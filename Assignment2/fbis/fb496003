  [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [31 March] the 
imposition of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu would be 
perceived as an invasion and would render free and fair 
elections impossible. 
  He said the declaration of an emergency proved the 
constitutional process was flawed, adding it marked another 
"chapter of oppression". 
  Troops pouring into kwaZulu would be seen as an "invasion". 
  "We'll see it as an invasion especially if... soldiers and 
army tanks will be rolling in here. It looks like an invasion... 
as if we're being forced by the barrel of a gun." 
  Interviewed at a Durban hotel after a telephone conversation 
with State President F.W. de Klerk, who announced the state of 
emergency on Tuesday [as received] morning, a solemn Mr 
Buthelezi said he was "not happy with it at all". 
  "I would understand his actions if he... considered 
postponing elections for a month or so," said Mr Buthelezi. 
  "I can't see how elections can be free and fair under a 
state 
of emergency." 
  "I told (Mr de Klerk) it was embarrassing," he said, 
explaining he was surprised at the declaration before next 
week's summit meeting between himself, Mr de Klerk, African 
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. 
  "It's sort of humiliating. People won't understand it on the 
ground," he said. 
  "I believe tanks will be rolling in, coming from all over," 
he added. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the emergency appeared to be a "form of 
duress for those of us who don't want to participate". 
  "I think this vindicates the point the IFP made: that the 
constitutional process was flawed... that's why we could not get 
our people to participate (in elections). 
  "Everything that has happened completely justifies our 
stance 
and it vindicates us."

  [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] said on Thursday [31 March] it was angered and outraged at 
the declaration of a state of emergency in Natal and kwaZulu 
which it said was aimed at eliminating all political opposition 
to the interim constitution. "The declaration is a 
party-political act taken in close co-operation with the African 
National Congress and the SA Communist Party [SACP], both of 
which have for years nurtured a desire to overthrow the kwaZulu 
government and destroy the IFP," said an Inkatha statement. 
  The IFP charged State President F W de Klerk had colluded 
with the ANC and SACP to eliminate all political opposition to 
the interim constitution. 
  "He (Mr de Klerk) has succumbed to pressure from the 
Transitional Executive Council to send troops into kwaZulu. 
(SACP leader) Joe Slovo of 'two down, one to go' fame must be 
especially pleased," said the statement. 
  The IFP said it was "especially cynical" to declare a state 
of emergency in the midst of a general election campaign. 
  The party repeated calls for the postponement of the April 
poll and for a resumption of "genuine" multiparty negotiations.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- President F W de 
Klerk's declaration of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal 
meant the start of civil war in South Africa, Inkatha Freedom 
Party Transvaal Deputy Chairman Humphrey Ndlovu said on Thursday 
[31 March]. 
  If Mr de Klerk could refuse to allow the African National 
Congress' [ANC] headquarters to be searched for weapons which 
were allegedly used to kill 53 Zulus in Johannesburg on Monday, 
and then in the same week make this declaration, "then he can 
forget it", said Mr Ndlovu. 
  South African democracy at present meant rule by the barrel 
of a gun, he told media at a conference at the IFP's 
Johannesburg offices. "This declaration is the start of the 
civil war in South Africa. We are not going to tolerate this 
state of emergency." 
  Mr Ndlovu said this meant that IFP supporters would continue 
to go about their daily lives and would ignore curfews or 
prohibitions on meetings. 
  If the security forces attempted to stop them, "they will 
get 
what they are looking for". Did this mean IFP supporters would 
fight? "Of course," said Mr Ndlovu. "If we have to, of course." 
  Asked if the forecast civil war would only take place in 
kwaZulu/Natal, the IFP leader said he was not going anywhere. 
"You will see it here with your own eyes." 
  In what he described as a continuation of Monday's massacre 
in Johannesburg, Mr Ndlovu said seven IFP members were executed 
in the kweSine area in Soweto, on Wednesday night. The 
attackers, some of who were dressed in traffic police uniforms, 
had waved down a taxi before opening fire on the occupants. 
Eight people had been seriously injured. 
  Several of the victims were local IFP leaders, including the 
Youth Brigade leader in Katlehong. Names had been withheld 
until families had been notified, said an IFP statement. 
  The incident was reported earlier by police, but with less 
detail and no political affiliations supplied. 
  The failure of the police -- apparently after political 
intervention -- to raid the ANC's Shell House headquarters after 
Monday's massacre supplied the go-ahead to the ANC to kill 
pzople with weapons they had stocked in the building, said Mr 
Ndlovu. 
  IFP members travelling down to kwaZulu/Natal this weekend 
had 
been warned about information that more attacks by people 
disguised as traffic police were planned.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress on Thursday [31 March] said it welcomed the 
announcement of a state of emergency in kwaZulu as long as it 
allowed free and fair political activity in the area, ANC 
spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA soon after the announcement by 
President F.W. de Klerk. 
  He said the ANC, as a member of the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC], called on Wednesday for a state of emergency 
"because of the very serious situation that prevails in Natal". 
  "The ANC therefore welcomes the announcement by Mr de Klerk 
that a state of emergency is introduced in Natal/kwaZulu. 
  "We fully support the state of emergency as long as it 
allows 
full freedom of political activity and full freedom to hold 
political meetings, voter education and that preparations for 
the elections can be fully guaranteed," Mr Niehaus said. 
  He added that a leadership summit to address the serious 
situation in Natal was now even more urgent than before and the 
ANC hoped it would be held as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan and C. Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Natal African National 
Congress leaders on Thursday [31 March] welcomed the 
announcement of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu provided 
it was aimed at establishing a climate for free and fair 
elections. The emergency was announced as political violence 
continued to rage in Natal with an unprecedented toll of close 
to 300 expected for March. 
  African National Congress Midlands leader Harry Gwala said 
while his organisation was opposed to an emergency "for obvious 
reasons", it appeared the current declaration was aimed at 
establishing a climate for free and fair elections. 
  "We're hoping the security forces will deal with those 
elements bent on destabilising the election and not turn it (the 
emergency) on victims of this violence," he said. 
  Mr Gwala said he further hoped the security forces would 
liaise and co-operate with "organisations and communities 
affected". 
  He rejected Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's contention that deploying troops in kwaZulu would be 
perceived as an invasion. "KwaZulu is not separate from South 
Africa, it's an integral part. There's no such thing as an 
invasion at all." 
  Northern Natal ANC Secretary Senzo Mchunu said his region 
hoped the emergency would mean deployment of the SA Defence 
Force and SA Police in areas of violence in the province. 
  He lashed out at the IFP's rejection of the emergency, 
charging the party was "not genuine or serious" about the loss 
of life in the territory. 
  "No person in Natal could say they don't want an added 
security presence here in the light of the violence. What is at 
stake is the lives of the people. The state of emergency will 
bring policing closer to the people," he said. 
  Southern Natal ANC secretary S'bu Ndebele said the kwaZulu 
Police had not fulfilled its duty of maintaining law and order. 
  "Chief Buthelezi's refusal to discharge his task as chief 
minister and minister of law and order leaves very little 
alternative. 
  "We do welcome the move. The ANC wants action on the state 
of 
anarchy that now prevails here, where people can go on the 
rampage and no-one is willing or able to?stop them." 
  A statement from the ANC's southern Natal Media Officer 
Dumisani Makhaye said all democratic forces should ensure the 
emergency was not used to "trample on the rights of people". 
  "The state of emergency must ensure free campaigning for or 
against the elections and peaceful demonstrations. It must be 
meant to protect free political activity for all organisations 
and parties and to stop the carnage. No rational person can be 
against this. 
  "The state of emergency must take all necessary measures to 
prevent those forces that are bent on causing violence against 
the people. 
  "The Transitional Executive Council, Independent Electoral 
Commission and the South African Government must jointly 
administer its implementation."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- Freedom Front leader 
Constand Viljoen said he doubted President F W de Klerk's 
assurance that kwaZulu would not suffer the same fate as 
Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Lebowa and Qwaqwa, SABC radio news 
reported. 
  Gen Viljoen questioned the manner in which Mr de Klerk had 
declared the state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu, saying he 
doubted denials that the African National Congress and National 
Party [NP] had not planned the emergency beforehand. He said he 
would consider inviting all parties, excluding the NP and ANC, 
to discuss whether the elections should be held in April. 
  CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg also criticised the 
announcement. 
He said the intention was to overthrow the kwaZulu government 
and to compromise Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's authority. He 
said there could be no talk of a free and fair election under a 
state of emergency.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front, AVF] on Thursday [31 March] asked 
that the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal be lifted and the 
matter discussed with King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha 
Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi. An AVF statement 
condemned what it called, "the one-sided imposition of the state 
of emergency on kwaZulu/Natal by (State President) F W de Klerk 
on the instructions of the African National Congress". It said 
the state of emergency was an act of aggression against the Zulu 
nation and, in particular, the king and Mr Buthelezi. The state 
of emergency was also a sign that negotiations had failed. The 
election now needed to be postponed, the statement said.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The decision to 
declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal was "politically 
wrong and tragic", the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] said in a 
statement on Thursday [31 March]. A PAC spokesman said: "The 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has no control over the 
armed forces which remain in the control of the regime. This is 
a contradiction. We would have expected that control of the 
armed forces be given to the TEC". The organisation called for 
a special sitting of multiparty negotiators to reverse the TEC's 
decision and mandate an international peacekeeping force to 
normalise the situation in violence-torn areas.

  [Text] Cape Town March 31 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP] 
on Thursday [31 March] conditionally supported the imposition by 
President F W de Klerk of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal, 
stressing that normal political activity should continue 
unhindered and human rights defended as far as possible. 
  In a statement, DP Natal leader Roger Burrows said the 
emergency regulations should make specific reference to the 
human rights situation of likely detainees and indemnity for 
acts committed by security forces during the state of emergency 
should be specific and limited in extent. 
  Mr Burrows said the DP awaited the specific gazetted 
regulations before reacting further. 
  The DP had always been opposed to the imposition of a state 
of emergency, but was giving its conditional support to the 
present one in view of the extremely grave situation in 
kwaZulu/Natal. 
  The support was dependent on the emergency being aimed only 
at the cessation and prevention of violence and the promotion of 
free political activity in kwaZulu/Natal. 
  Normal political activity had to continue unhindered, Mr 
Burrows said.

  [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Natal security forces, 
including the kwaZulu Police [KZP], are due to hold a meeting in 
Durban on Friday [1 April] to discuss policing in the province 
under the state of emergency announced by State President F.W. 
de Klerk on Thursday. 
  According to KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During, the 
emergency regulations would be known on Friday and they would be 
discussed in a meeting between himself and leaders of the SA 
Police and SA Defence Force. "We have to discuss the precise 
nature of the regulations. It's obviously of necessity and our 
policing methods will have to be adapted because it becomes law 
and you have to abide by that," Gen During said. 
  The KZP worked in "close conjunction" with other security 
forces and Friday's meeting would definitely arrive at joint 
policing strategies for certain areas, he said. 
  The emergency would probably allow greater movement to 
security forces and give them greater access to violence 
flash-points, he added. "It may have the effect of stabilising 
the situation, and we sincerely hope that it will have that 
effect." 
  Gen During said he did not expect Inkatha leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, as kwaZulu minister of police, to defy the emergency 
because it was the law and Mr Buthelezi was a "Christian and 
law-abiding citizen".

<F P=106> [Report by C Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 30 SAPA -- More than half of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Natal/kwaZulu supporters will vote 
in the April elections, according to the latest opinion survey 
by Durban's Institute for Multiparty Democracy. 
  This is in spite of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's 
warning 
that the elections will lead to the destruction of the Zulu 
nation and his repeated calls for them to be postponed. 
  Released on Wednesday, the survey by Data Research Africa 
Ltd 
and the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] in February, 
showed 52.1 per cent of IFP respondents said they disapproved of 
an elections boycott, and 54 per cent said they would 
"definitely vote". "Only one IFP voter in 14 was adamant they 
would not vote," said the survey conducted among 2,601 
respondents of whom 389 were white, 500 Indian, 100 coloured and 
1603 black. "We took particularly painstaking efforts to 
achieve a proper rural representation," said the researchers. 
  On party choice, the survey showed 44.1 per cent of black 
respondents supported the African National Congress, and 21.3 
per cent were behind the IFP. 
  Among all races the ANC scored 36.7 per cent support, the 
IFP 
18.1, the National Party 13.9, the Democratic Party 2.3 and the 
Freedom Front and Pan Africanist Congress 0.8. 
  "Don't know" responses scored 10.5 per cent, followed by 
"won't say" 8.4 and "won't vote" 8.2. 
  Perceptions of who was to blame for violence drew a 27 per 
cent response pointing to the IFP and 23.1 per cent blaming the 
ANC. 
  Expectations of the post-election future followed earlier 
survey patterns with "general gloom among the non-African 
minorities contradicted by the euphoric views of the African 
majority". But, the surveyors noted: "The election in Natal is 
fraught with contradictions, ironies and sheer tragedy." "The 
situation is dominated by the IFP's electoral boycott. As 
recently as July 1992, an HSRC survey showed the IFP leading the 
ANC in Natal by 37 per cent to 23 per cent, but in only two 
years the IFP has slipped from this leadership position to a 
clear second place."

  [Text] The police say a warrant to search the ANC 
headquarters in Johannesburg was one of the options to obtain 
information on Monday's [28 March] violence in the city center, 
but it was decided that negotiations would be a better 
alternative. Brigadier Zirk Gouws was reacting to renewed 
criticism by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] that the search had 
been canceled on the grounds that it could've been politically 
detrimental. Brig. Gouws said the regional commissioner of 
police on the Witwatersrand, Major General Koos Calitz, and Mr. 
Nelson Mandela held talks before the planned search, and the ANC 
leader had undertaken to cooperate fully with the police. 
However, the warrant remained effective.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by South African Police Commissioner </F>
General Johan van der Merwe in Pretoria on 30 March on the SAPA 
PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] As result of media enquiries I wish to issue the 
following statement: 
  I deny categorically that either the state president or the 
minister of law and order in any way involved themselves in the 
execution of a warrant which was issued for the purpose of 
searching Shell House. 
  I personally held a discussion with Lt. Gen. Calitz, 
regional 
commissioner, Witwatersrand concerning the matter with the 
understanding that he would inform Mr Mandela of the warrant and 
attempt to obtain his cooperation in confiscating the weapons. 
Lt. Gen. Calitz informed me that Mr Mandela had given him an 
undertaking that the weapons would be handed over and therefore 
it was not necessary to continue with this search. 
  The matter is being dealt with further by Lt. Gen. Calitz.

Monday. Eight people were shot dead in front of the ANC

  [Text] Pretoria March 31 SAPA -- African National Congress 
President Mandela's interference in the police operation 
investigating Monday's [28 March] killings in central 
Johannesburg was unacceptable, the National Party [NP] said in a 
statement on Thursday. NP media spokesman Danie du Plessis said 
the laws that applied to other political parties should also 
apply to the ANC. 
  Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe's statement that 
Mr Mandela had offered to hand over weapons found at the ANC's 
Shell House headquarters once more highlighted that the ANC had 
become "a law unto themselves", he said. 
  "This incident follows others such as the ANC's treasury 
department asking the Reserve Bank for finrand access so it 
could use funds held abroad to buy a Pretoria building. It also 
asked for import duties to be waived on election materials such 
as electronic equipment, land rovers and t-shirts," Mr du 
Plessis said. 
  "If the ANC has nothing to hide, why did Mr Mandela 
interfere 
to prevent the police from searching Shell House?" the NP 
statement said. 
  ANC officials are investigating Gen van der Merwe's claims 
that Mr Mandela offered to hand over weapons. 
  Enquiries since early Thursday on the statement had still 
not 
been answered by the ANC by Thursday afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 30 SAPA -- The South African Defence 
Force [SADF] expects a good response to the call-up of Citizen's 
Force and Commando members for the election period. SADF 
Communications Chief Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said on 
Wednesday [30 March] predictions of a turn-out of as low as five 
per cent were hopelessly exaggerated. 
  Last year 49 per cent of part-time SADF members reported for 
service when called up, and only 10.6 percent failed to report 
for duty. Others obtained exemption, served in crucial posts or 
could not be traced, said Gen Opperman. 
  The election call-up period is from April 15 to May 15. 
  Gen Opperman said he wanted to stop predictions of a low 
response rate because this could lead to its realisation. "I 
can't see how such predictions can be made. If people stop 
creating a negative perception, and concentrate on the positive, 
we can expect a good number of men." 
  The call-up had the approval of most parties, including the 
End Conscription Campaign and the African National Congress, he 
said. "They are all saying that the chaps should report. The 
call-up is truly in the national interest and for ensuring free 
and fair elections. I think people will react responsibly 
despite their personal fears because this will be in South 
Africa's macro-security interests." 
  Part-time force members would get salaries equalling those 
of 
their permanent force colleagues during the call-up period. 
Subject to approval, the SADF would also pay an allowance to 
them and permanent force members deployed to assist the police. 
  Asked about concerns about the party-political loyalties of 
part-time SADF members and units, Gen Opperman said: "We have 
total confidence in the members of our part-time forces and 
think they will react very responsibly without allowing party 
politics to influence their judgment."

  [Text] The Commonwealth says it is unlikely to send a 
peacekeeping force to South Africa if civil unrest escalates 
before and after next month's first all-race elections. 
Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku said the 
Commonwealth was not a peace-keeping organization. He said it 
was only acting as a mediator to help strengthen democracy in 
South Africa. The Commonwealth, a loose association of former 
British colonies, has sent a mission of observers to South 
Africa for the elections from the 26th to the 28th of next month.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela has issued a communique to all 
ANC regions and officials warning that any member found flouting 
the electoral code of conduct will be disciplined, the ANC said 
in a statment on Thursday [31 March]. 
  This follows the Independent Elections Commission's [IEC] 
finding on Wednesday against the ANC arising out of disruption 
of a National Party election meeting in Venda three weeks ago. 
  "Although the happenings in Venda did not result from 
decisions by either the leadership or the structures of the ANC, 
the movement takes collective responsibility and will ensure 
that a message of political tolerance is disseminated to all our 
regions and structures," the statement said. 
  It said the ANC had on a number of occasions publicly called 
on all members and supporters to desist from any activities that 
undermined the principles of free and fair electioneering. 
  "In this regard, ANC President Nelson Mandela has issued a 
communique to all our regions and officials, to ensure that any 
ANC member found to have flouted the electoral code of conduct 
will be disciplined in terms of the ANC constitution." 
  Thousands of posters and leaflets containing the electoral 
code of conduct have been distributed to all ANC regions and 
branches. 
  "The ANC regrets all incidents of intimidation and 
disruption 
irrespective of who the perpetrators are," the statement said.

issued 13 summonses to political parties. 
  Fifteen matters have been referred to mediation, while 50 
complaints files have been closed because they were frivolous or 
settled, investigations unit head Kgomotse Moroke said at an IEC 
briefing yesterday. 
  It was proving difficult to get statements from witnesses. 
  The directorate's head, Albert Mokwena, said voter education 
gaps has been identified among women in rural areas, the 
informal sector and public servants, particularly the army and 
police. 
  The IEC was penetrating kwaZulu by way of educating 
scholars, 
who in turn were educating families.

  [Text] Pretoria March 30 SAPA -- Ninety-six per cent of 
potential voters already have identification documents enabling 
them to vote in next month's election, the Department of Home 
Affairs said on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  In a statement the department said 21,850,116 of an 
estimated 
total of 22,709,152 voters as determined by the Central 
Statistical Services had their documents by last Friday. 
  During the preceeding week 153,520 ID documents and 152,301 
temporary voters' cards had been issued and the department would 
continue its efforts to sustain this trend. 
  The department reminded the public that its regional and 
district offices would be open on Family Day (April 4) and 
Founders Day (April 6) enabling them to apply for the necessary 
documents. 
  "Reports from various quarters indicate that the rush at the 
department's offices is diminishing." 
  The department warned that the loss or theft of ID documents 
constituted a "very real" security risk.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers List Party official Sallim Valli, </F>
Workers International Party official Leon Caesar, COSATU 
official Neil Coleman, and Nactu offical Cunningham Ngcukana by 
announcers Reggie Morobe and Xoli Mazibuko on the "Newsline" 
program --live] 
  [Excerpts] [Mazibuko] Gentlemen, welcome to the studio. We 
are joined now by gentlemen from the two organizations, new 
political organizations so to speak, as well as the old 
federations. Gentlemen, good evening to you and welcome. 
Perhaps if I may start with the gentleman from the Workers List 
Party, Sallim Valli. Tell me what was the need for the party to 
be formed, and to claim that it's looking after the interests of 
the workers so to speak. 
  [Valli] Well, for us in the Workers List Party, we are not a 
new party in the sense that 80 to 90 percent of our members have 
been involved for many years in trade unions, civic movements, 
youth movements, women's movements. And that we feel that the 
time for an independent political expression of the working 
class and mass workers party -- the idea for a mass workers 
party has come. It's not a new call, in 1982 the general 
secretary of FOSATU [Federation of South Africa Trade Unions], 
before the formation of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade 
Unions], made that call. We believe that the interest of 
workers against retrenchment for a living wage, a 35-hour week, 
self-defense of working people, the right to work enshrined in 
the constitution. The established political organizations are 
working within the capitalist framework, and we believe that 
those changes can only come about, that fundamental change can 
only come about through the formation of such a political 
expression, and the point is that we want real change, not a new 
flag, more black faces in Parliament, that is not real change. 
  [Mazibuko] Let me just hold you there and see how Leon 
Caesar 
differs from you in this aspect. Do you differ from him in any 
way? 
  [Caesar] Well, let me start off by saying why we in the 
Workers International feel it is necessary to stay in this 
election. You see the Nationalist [National] Party [NP] and the 
Democratic Party [DP], they are the parties of the capitalist 
class. Now the workers do not have a class that is, or, the 
working class does not have a party that is really fighting in 
the immediate and long-term interest, and we believe that the 
parties that used to fight for the oppressed, foremost the ANC 
[African National Congress] and the SACP [South African 
Communist Party], we feel that they have now forsaken the 
working class, and they are rather trying to prop up the 
capitalists system, and we feel that the PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] is also going in that direction. So we feel that 
workers in the [word indistinct] need their own party, but it 
must be a party that is committed to socialism, to the overthrow 
of, the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, to 
internationalism. So that is why we have decided to come out 
now and to stay in this election, to put across.... 
  [Mazibuko, interrupting] Let me see what divides you with 
them, because I'm seeing similarities? 
  [Valli] If I can answer that: I think that we in the Workers 
List Party acknowledge the sacrifices made by tens of thousands 
of people who support the ANC, PAC, Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization], etc. We don't think that we have the Holy Grail, 
we are not a vanguard party in that sense. We put forward the 
need for a mass workers party so that even people in those 
organizations, who have sacrificed much, can join hands with us, 
so that together, we will form a movement for a mass workers 
party. We don't believe we are the workers' party. 
  [Morobe] If I'm to come in here, what you're just speaking 
about, isn't it the duties of the unions. Neil, isn't it what 
you are supposed to be doing? What is different that they'll do 
that you fail to do now? 
  [Coleman] Well, the question is, Reggie, who has the 
capacity 
to implement a program which will improve the lives of ordinary 
people, the lives or workers in this country, and we believe, 
yes it is the trade unions, it is the civic movements and so on, 
we also believe that the organization like the African National 
Congress have a track record, they have a history, they have a 
program, a reconstruction and development program, which would 
enable them to improve the lives of ordinary people. So we're 
not against anyone forming a political party, even soccer clubs 
have formed a party, but the question is who is going to really 
change the lives of people. 
  [Valli] And that is the point because if you look at the 
reconstruction and development program. If you look at the 
apartmeid debt, the apartheid regime has got a debt of 186 
billion rand, and interest on that debt is about 3 billion 
rands. The future state, the ANC, regardless of their good 
intentions cannot use the money for social spending, because 
they are trapped in the debt... 
  [Morobe, interrupting] Cunningham, you could come in here. 
He 
is talking about the debts and from the manifesto they say they 
will not even repay the IMF monies and the World Bank monies. 
Isn't this a disaster for the workers? 
  [Ngcukana] Let me explain. As Nactu [National Council of 
Trade Unions], we recognize that we are living within a 
particular social, economic, and international order. There is 
no way that we can operate an economy in isolation. 
International trade has linked many countries. I do have 
sympathy for the views that they are expressing, but the reality 
on the ground is a different thing. Recently, we have had Daniel 
Ortega having to step down because of international economic 
pressure to be able to get a loan, to ensure that Nicaragua 
survives. Now, the reality of the international loans, we would 
live with it. However, the question will be: How would a 
future democratic government use those loans? That is the 
fundamental question. There is no way you can say that we will 
not be able to repay debts. It is simply -- South Africa will 
be cut off and will not function, and even that government that 
says so, that is about not repaying international loans, will 
not even survive a day because of the international reality. 
  [Morobe] But I am seeing here four organizations and all 
their base line is workers. Can't we have one formation, one 
federation? 
  [Ngcukana] No, they are a political party trying to raise 
pertinent issues on a political level. We are a trade union 
operating on a day-to-day basis defending the working people. 
The question of them coming up, I must say that yes, everybody 
has got a democratic right to form his or her own organization, 
but what we have to understand is in the class sense whatever is 
happening in this country it is the realization of what has been 
called a bourgeois revolution. It is coming to an end of its 
cycle. Given those realities and the realities of the economic 
situation in the country, we would need to hold each others' 
hands and work together and to make the country work, to ensure 
that our people have jobs, to ensure that people have got 
housing. Yes, it is important to have dreams and hopes. 
  [Morobe] Let me come in there. Workers International, are 
you not using this as another band wagon to come into power? 
  [Caesar] No, no, no. Not at all. We believe also that there 
is a place in society for the trade unions as well as a place 
for political parties and that they should exist separately. 
But what differs us, the Workers International, from the 
Workers List Party: In our manifestos there are two points which 
are really very different. We lay very strong emphasis on the 
reactionarm role of Stalinism and the need to expose and combat 
Stalinism. The Workers List Party does not even mention 
Stalinism within their manifesto. Secondly, we emphasize that we 
can only achieve socialism by means of a revolutionary overthrow 
of capitalism, and the Workers List Party also doesn't refer to 
the need of a revolutionary overthrow. I would like to just pose 
something... 
  [Morobe, interrupting] We do not have much time. Can I let 
you bring in, maybe sum it up. Is this doing the workers, the 
future workers, any good? 
  [Coleman] Well, democracy is good for workers, conflicting 
ideas, but workers don't eat ideology. We have to improve their 
living conditions, we have to improve their wages, we have to 
put in place a political system and an economic system which is 
in their interest. We believe that the Reconstruction and 
Development Program of the ANC and the tripartite alliance 
attempts to do that in a systematic way. That is why COSATU is 
calling not only on our own members, but on all working people 
in these elections to vote for the ANC. 
  [Mazibuko] Let me go back to the gentlemen representing 
trade 
unions. One would read in this set up a whole issue of 
deficiencies within the two federations to a point that people 
believe they now have to get on the band wagon, form up their 
own political parties and go to parliament and to represent 
themselves. And what do you tell me? 
  [Ngcukana] No, they are not deficiencies, Xoli. Our position 
as NACTU is simple. Given the present conditions, we are saying 
to the workers let them go and vote for the parties that have 
historically fought oppression and to vote against the 
oppressor. We are not saying which political party they should 
vote for because our members come from different backgrounds. 
It does not mean that in future we will not consider a position 
regarding the interests of the working people. We are saying 
let the working people go and vote and vote against the 
oppressors, and vote for those who have historically fought for 
freedom. 
  [Mazibuko] Come in, Neil. What do you think? Are you [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Coleman] Yeah. I think the reality is that the vast 
majority of our members support the ANC. In a survey which we 
did two years ago, we discovered that 96 percent of our shop 
stewards were going to vote for the ANC. This is a reality. 
The majority of ANC supporters are workers and workers's 
families. [passage omiteed] 
  [Mazibuko] Do you see in this gentleman wishful thinking? 
  [Coleman] To a certain extent, yes, there is an element of 
wishful thinking, but let them speak for themselves. 
  [Valli] Can I say that wishful thinking is the 
Reconstruction 
and Development Program, although the basic objectives are 
laudable -- housing, employment, etc. -- it cannot be achieved 
under capitalism. In the workers charter, which we spent over a 
year developing and a quarter of a million rands, where are 
those demands? Nationalization without compensation, which the 
biggest affiliate of COSATU made? The IMF-World Bank loans? I 
think the problem is that throughout the world, through the 
structural adjustments policies of the IMF-World Bank they have 
impoverished economies. THE FINANCIAL MAIL has projected in 
the year 2003 South Africa would owe, its debt would be 119 
billion rand. The state.... 
  [Mazibuko, interrupting] Okay, let's (?put aside) the 
economic jargon tonight. Let me bring you back to reality, the 
people are reading situations here like, we have seen people 
climbing on the band wagon of Christianity. We are now seeing 
people climbing on the band wagon of workers parties? 
  [Valli] Xoli, our members have fought to build the trade 
union movement. We have many of our members who spent years on 
Robben Island. We haven't just come into the struggle today. 
We have been around in the union movement, in the civic 
movement. I need to say that what we are talking about is 
eminently realistic. 
  [Mazibuko] Let me bring Leon in on this issue. How long will 
it take to address some of these issues, to build a socialistic 
economy to build an economy that will look after the interests 
of workers? 
  [Caesar] The time to do it isn't really a question. The 
question now is that we have to build a strong revolutionary 
workers party to overthrow the capitalist system, to begin that 
socialist reconstruction. But I would like to address something 
that you mentioned about parties jumping on the band wagon. Our 
party has been around for about two or three years. We have 
worked underground for a few years, and we have got a number of 
members that are working within the trade union, within 
unaffiliated organizations. Now, I would like to pose something 
to the COSATU person. The comrade said that they recognize the 
right of parties like ours to exist, but the reality is that 
many of our members within the unions, that are in COSATU, they 
are being harassed. Why? Because they said, look, it is my 
right to vote for any party, and they said they are members of 
the Workers International. So some of them are actually getting 
some pressure, and I would like COSATU to make a very 
unambiguous statement around this issue. 
  [Coleman] Sure. We would say that the comrades have the 
right to operate, but on the other hand he said they are 
operating underground. Now, organizations have been unbanned 
since 1990 and we think this sort of tactic of entering into 
organizations secretly and so on, the trade union is an open 
organization. There should be no need to operate underground. 
So I think that is an important point to note. 
  [Valli] Our views have always been open. Comrade Neil, 
Comrade Cunningham knows us. We have stood for our views in the 
trade unions. We have always fought alongside those workers in 
COSATU. Most of our members come from COSATU, Nactu, and 
affiliated unions. 
  [Mazibuko] Gentlemen? I am afraid we have run out of time. 
My producer is breathing down my neck, and I need to close 
shop. Thank you very much for coming through.

<F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 30 SAPA -- South Africa would seek 
an international credit rating as the first step in re-entering 
global capital markets, African National Congress economist 
Maria Ramos said Wednesday [30 March]. 
  She told an ANC meeting with business leaders in 
Johannesburg 
a new government was keen to tap international markets following 
the country's absence for most of the last ten years, bar a 
400-million German marks issue in September 1991. 
  Ms Ramos said a return to these markets would assist the 
country in improving the maturity structure and reducing the 
cost of the debt portfolio. 
  South Africa has been inhibited from approaching world 
capital markets for funds due to previous apartheid governments 
and, since 1991, the high perceived risks of the country's 
political transition and domestic violence. 
  The Transitional Executive Council's finance sub-council is 
preparing a strategy for the country's return, likely after the 
April polls which are expected to be won by the ANC. 
  Ms Ramos said domestic markets would continue to be 
important 
and the ANC wanted to improve the operation and capacity of the 
capital market. 
  A new government's responsibility would be to ensure 
economic 
policy certainty and credibility to achieve efficient borrowings. 
  Ms Ramos said an independent central bank and autonomous 
auditor- general's office would help to nurture a sound and 
stable financial system. 
  ANC money and finance analyst Neil Morrison assured the 500- 
strong gathering of business people the Reserve Bank would not 
be hindered in its key task of protecting the value of the 
currency. The independence of the bank was critical to the 
establishment of financial credibility as well as having a 
sobering influence on fiscal policy, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Desmond Blow] </F>
  [Text] The pensions for KwaZulu civil servants are assured 
in South Africa's new constitution, no matter who wins the 
elections -- but this does not apply to the homelands who took 
so-called independence: Transkei, Bophuthatswana [Bop]; Ciskei 
and Venda. 
  Civil servants, police and even politicians who held office 
in the six homelands that did not take "independence" will be 
treated in the same manner as those in the central government -- 
and are in fact part of the same pension scheme. 
  However, this does not apply to the four "independent" 
states, who ran their own pension funds. 
  This was confirmed to City Press by Deputy Director of 
Finance Dr Robbie Burton. 
  He quoted Section 212 of the Constitution, which guarantees 
the pensions of civil servants; section 236 which guarantees 
civil servants' employment; and section 246 which guarantees the 
rights and pensions of political office- bearers. 
  Efforts by City Press this week to find out whether the two 
collapsed bantustans -- Bop and Ciskei -- and Transkei and Venda 
could pay out their civil servants were unsuccessful. 
  None of the four states were economically viable, and they 
relied on heavy subsidies from the central government, so it is 
not known if their pension funds are in a healthy state or not. 
  It appears that the misgivings of striking civil servants 
that led to the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] stepping 
into Bop and Ciskei were justified -- but the take-over does not 
ensure that their civil servants will get their pensions. 
  It will depend on the financial state of these funds. 
  KwaZulu civil servants were assured in 80,000 personal 
letters this week that their pensions were safe, and Inkatha 
spokesperson Suzanne Vos blamed the ANC for sowing false 
insecurity among them. 
  This accusation was echoed by Tony Leon of the Democratic 
Party [DP], who said: "The ANC created a Frankenstein by 
unashamedly creating conditions on the ground calculated to 
topple homeland leaders who do not support it." 
  The ANC vehemently denied this -- and called Leon the DP's 
"brat who showed his immaturity".

<F P=106> [Report by Stephanie Bothma] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria -- The Transvaal Supreme Court has placed a 
gagging order on former Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South 
Africa] nuclear and rocket scientists, preventing them 
disclosing details about the supply, export, import, manufacture 
or research of any armaments. 
  Armscor brought an urgent application against 16 former 
employees -- who were among 60 people retrenched last February 
when Armscor subsidiary Denel rationalised its Advena division. 
  The arms manufacturer argued in court that publication of 
arms secrets could seriouly damage SA's newly acquired standing 
in the international defence industry. 
  The move followed a report that the scientists had 
threatened 
to disclosed nuclear secrets unless they were paid R4.5m 
[million rands] in compensation by their former employer. The 
scientists admitted that their demands amounted to blackmail. 
  Judge TT Spoelstra prohibited the scientists from disclosing 
information to the media or unauthorised people about the 
obtaining, supplying, marketing, importing, exporting, 
development, manufacture, maintenance or repair of armaments by 
Armscor or its subsidiaries. 
  In an affidavit supporting the application, Armscor guided 
missile systems chief Gideon Smith said all the scientists had 
signed on oath of secrecy. 
  Armscor's mission to secure SA's armament needs as 
effectively and economicallly as possible meant that technology, 
knowledge, material and equipment had to be obtained from 
abroad. All dealings with overseas countries or companies were 
extremely sensitive and secrecy received absolute priority, 
Smith said. 
  Last November SA had entered into an agreement with the U.S. 
on the restriction of missile-related export and import, 
including guarantees that secret information would not be 
disclosed. Adherence to this agreement would result in the U.S. 
recommending SA's admittance as a member of the Missile 
Technology Control Regime [MTCR]. 
  "To be accepted as a member of the MTCR would be beneficial 
to Armscor and SA. Armscor would have access to technology and 
foreign markets currently not available to it. Should sensitive 
information be made available, SA's chances of being admitted 
would be very poor." 
  Smith said that on November 11, four scientists, Christiaan 
du Plooy, Eldrid Fick, Klaus Muller and Jan Frederik Combrink, 
had informed Denel about a potential labour dispute. They had 
demanded re-employment or further compensation, a demand 
rejected by Denel a month later. 
  Since then, nothing had been heard from the scientists until 
last Sunday, when a newspaper article appeared headlined 
"Nuclear Scientists Threaten To Tell All." 
  Smith said the report had sparked immediate inquiries from 
Switzerland and several other countries, which had been upset 
and worried by the media reports. 
  It had been reported that the scientists were prepared to 
accept employment from anyone who could guarantee their 
salaries. If they received employment as a result of the 
publicity, sensitive information could be passed on their new 
employers and Armscor would lose control over such information, 
Smith said. 
  Armscor's attorney said only six of the 16 scientists cited 
in the court action had been aware of the newspaper report, 
while the others had indicated that they were prepared to honour 
their oath of secrecy. 
  The six who had been aware of the report were Du Plooy, 
Combrinck, Ester Maria Swart, Cornelius Appelgryn, Maarten 
Pretorius and Jurie Heydenrich. 
  The scientists had 14 days to oppose the application and 
have 
the order amended or set aside, the judge ordered.

if the security situation deteriorates before or after the 
elections. Reports from Lisbon indicate that the returnees would 
be housed in disused buildings and military bases in northern 
Portugal after being airlifted from South Africa. Portuguese 
Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said he was extremely 
concerned about the violence in South Africa but that he did not 
think he should advise the Portuguese community in South Africa 
to leave the country yet.

  [Text] The Council of State, the Liberian National 
Transitional Government, has expressed satisfaction over the 
clarifications provided it this week by the chairman of ECOWAS 
[Economic Community of West African States], President Nicephore 
Dieudonne Soglo of the Republic of Benin, relative to the issue 
of the allocation of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, 
Justice, and Defense. 
  In a letter to the chairman of the Council of State, 
Professor David Kpomakpor, dated 23 March, Chairman Soglo of 
ECOWAS says that he has learned that a letter bearing his 
signature has been circulated to the leaders of the former 
Liberian factions party to the Cotonou Peace Accord recommending 
that two of the four disputed ministries be given to the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. The ECOWAS chairman 
expressed surprise at what he described as an irresponsible act 
because the contents of the purported letter differ totally from 
his recommendations concerning the allocation of the four 
cabinet posts. The ECOWAS chairman reiterated his position that 
the decision for the allocation of the four ministries rests 
with the Liberian people. Chairman Soglo has, therefore, urged 
a prompt settlement of the issue in a spirit of dialogue, 
concerted efforts, good judgment, and secrecy.

<F P=106> [News conference by President F.W. de Klerk at the Union </F>
Buildings in Pretoria -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Good morning from my side, too, ladies and 
gentlemen. My sincere apologies for having kept you so long. 
Part of the delay was caused by the fact that meetings in which 
I was involved took somewhat longer than expected, and, 
secondly, I then felt it correct to communicate the announcement 
which I am going to make to Chief Minister Buthelezi as well as 
Mr. Mandela and we had some trouble in tracing one of them 
before I could have the telephone discussion which I have just 
had. I will read, firstly in English and then in Afrikaans, a 
very short statement, and thereafter I will, off the cuff, add a 
number of remarks. 
  After being briefed by the intelligence establishment and 
security advisers I am of the opinion that circumstances have 
arisen within the province of Natal, including the 
self-governing area of KwaZulu, situated in the province of 
Natal, which seriously threaten the safety of the public and the 
maintenance of public order, and that the ordinary law of the 
land is inadequate to enable the government to ensure the safety 
of the public and to maintain public order. I have, therefore, 
decided to declare, in terms of the Public Safety Act of 1953, a 
state of emergency in the area mentioned. There are, however, 
certain aspects regarding the emergency regulation that have to 
be negotiated with the Transitional Executive Council and the 
Sub-Council of Law and Order, Safety and Stability, in terms of 
the act governing those institutions. 
  As soon as the regulations are finalized the necessary 
proclamations will be published in the gazette. The state of 
emergency shall come into operation as soon as the said 
proclamations are published. I have reason to believe that that 
will still be today, unless some unforeseen hitches occur. 
[passage omitted on de Klerk repeating announcement in Afrikaans] 
  Now ladies and gentlemen, a lot of perceptions have already 
been created with regard to the decision which I have this 
morning only taken. Until 0930 this morning there was not a 
decision by me, and it is only me, as head of government and 
head of state who can declare a state of emergency. There was 
no decision to do so. We were looking at all options. Our 
looking at this possibility was not initiated by any outside 
source, any other party or any other institution. More than a 
week ago, some of you who were present at the press conference 
will recall that I was asked, specifically: Are we considering 
it. And I already then emphasized that, yes, we were looking at 
all options on a continuous basis and that one of the options 
would be a state of emergency, that we would like to avoid that 
if at all possible, but that we would be continuing to look at 
all options in the light of the serious situation in 
KwaZulu-Natal. 
  We were, therefore, involved in a process and the first 
perception that I would like to deal with is the perception that 
I am now doing this because I was asked or ordered or requested 
to do so by anybody or by any institution. The decision is not 
at the behest of any party. It is not at the behest of the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council]. It is my decision based on 
the advise and the analysis of the government intelligence 
services and advisers in the security field and it is taken 
within the framework of the law. The second perception that I 
would like to deal with, which I have seen strongly reflected 
this morning in the newspapers, it is to a certain extent 
reflected in some statements, inter alia, of the DP [Democratic 
Party], is that this is now a first step aimed at actions 
against the kwaZulu government or aimed at the destabilization 
of the kwaZulu government. This decision has nothing to do with 
any such goal. 
  I am on record, and I want to repeat it again, that the 
kwaZulu government has been lawfully elected and that in terms 
of other legislation I will only make inroads on their authority 
in terms of that legislation if, firstly, there is 
maladministration and I have no evidence of anything like that. 
Secondly, if that government does not cooperate in making free 
and fair elections possible, and they have given and they are 
giving their full cooperation, so this is not aimed at the 
kwaZulu government. It is not aimed at the position of the 
chief minister. It is not aimed to have any effect on the 
position of the king. In fact, it will help to protect the 
kwaZulu government against any threats, against any efforts from 
whatever source, to destabilize their position as a lawfully 
elected constitutional authority. Simultaneously, it is not 
aimed at any other party or particular institution. The state 
of emergency will be managed and implemented even-handed. It is 
aimed at stabilization of the whole area, which specifically 
includes the maintenance and the restoration of law and order, 
which specifically includes the protection of life and property 
of all the people. Actions in terms of the state of emergency 
will be taken against anybody, irrespective of which party it 
belongs to, irrespective of which party it supports, anybody 
involved in any actions which constitute a threat to the 
security of that area, of the people living in that area, which 
constitutes threats of violence or involvement in violence, or 
the instigation of violence -- those are the aims. We do not 
have a political aim with this in any way, whatsoever. 
  It will also be aimed at ensuring that the election will 
take 
place. Political action will, therefore, in terms of the 
regulations, be permitted but in such a manner that it will not 
lead to conflict. The question might arise: Is free... [pauses] 
a free and fair election compatible with the state of emergency, 
and the answer is yes, because free political activity will be 
allowed. Meetings as a right can be held. Notice will, 
however, be required in terms of the draft regulation which I 
have seen, notice so that the security forces can take the 
necessary precautions to effectively protect that meeting and 
ensure that it takes place. The state of emergency, I would 
like to add, is also being declared in interaction with the TEC, 
in terms of the legal prescriptions in that regard. It will 
also enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to be free to 
continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, to 
hold their meetings and to do their political thing to ensure 
that they have the opportunity to convince people in terms of 
their policy and their policy goals, not to come and vote. I 
would like, therefore, to underline, even-handed, not aimed at 
any party -- aimed at stabilization, aimed at safeguarding of 
all interests, aimed at ensuring that the election will take 
place -- the search for political solutions to the underlying 
problems must continue. 
  It is crucially important that my scheduled meeting with the 
king, the chief minister, and Mr. Mandela should continue, and I 
sincerely hope that none of the parties involved will use this 
decision which has no political basis, to stand away from that 
meeting. It is fundamentally necessary in the interests of all 
the people of this country, and specifically, of all the people 
in kwaZulu-Natal, that that meeting should take place. I want 
to reiterate, my commitment to the constitutional accommodation 
of the position of the king of the Zulus. That is what we must 
solve. It is one of the underlying problems, and I am positive 
that dignified and full recognition should be given to the 
traditional position of the king of the Zulus with regard to his 
nation. Included in the search for political solutions lies the 
necessity to address in the negotiations and at this forthcoming 
meeting, the problem of Zulu self-determination and of 
self-determination in general. I continue to remain committed 
to participation of all major parties in the constitutional 
process, and it must be promoted, and there is no connection 
between this decision and the necessity for continued 
discussions and negotiations aimed at reaching the accommodation 
of those who are deeply concerned in a meaningful manner, 
reaching agreements which can be implemented also after the 
election, so as to ensure long term peace and stability to all 
people. I believe that this decision actually creates the 
opportunity for solutions to be found for the underlying 
problems, and will hopefully bring about the type of atmosphere 
which will be conducive for free and fair elections as well as 
the type of atmosphere which is needed for political leaders to, 
through negotiation, solve outstanding problems. 
  [Unidentified moderator] We have a link-up with Cape Town. 
We'll take some questions from Pretoria, then we'll cross to 
Cape Town. Linda van Tilburg? 
  [SABC correspondent van Tilburg] Mr. de Klerk, could we ask 
you: What was Dr. Buthelezi's reaction when you informed him 
about this and did he in any way indicate that it could 
jeopardize (?the process)? 
  [De Klerk] I do not plan to in any way, whatsoever, to try 
and relate what they said to me. I felt it was necessary that I 
inform them and no doubt, having been informed they will react 
and I leave it to them to formulate their reactions. 
  [Moderator] Enoch Sithole? 
  [Sithole] Mr. President, what is the position with the 
kwaZulu Police, obviously they should be expected to apply the 
state of emergency regulations? Did you get from Chief 
Buthelezi an indication that he is going to get them to observe 
those regulations, and if they don't, what is your next move? 
  [De Klerk] The management on the ground of a state of 
emergency is a matter which will be in the hands of the security 
forces, the South African Police. The South African Defense 
Force will play a strong role, particularly in specific parts. 
There will be deployment on an incremental basis from day to 
day now of fairly large numbers of South African Defense Force 
members and the arrangements of interaction with the kwaZulu 
Police is best left in the hands of those who will be in charge 
of the South African Defense Force side, and, where applicable, 
the South African Police. I did not discuss this particular 
aspect in detail or in any way really with the chief minister. 
We had a short discussion, but can I say it really goes without 
saying that cooperation will be sought and I'm sure will be 
achieved, because surely the goal of the kwaZulu Police is also 
to maintain law and order and to ensure stability and to protect 
the life and property of people. 
  [Announcer] You have been listening to the state president, 
Mr. F. W. de Klerk, speaking at a special news conference at the 
Union Buildings in Pretoria.

  [Text] Pretoria, March 31 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on 
Thursday [31 March] announced a state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal. 
  He said he had communicated his decision to African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday morning. 
  The state of emergency would come into operation as soon as 
the necessary regulations were published. 
  Mr de Klerk was of the opinion that the state of emergency 
was necessary because circumstances in the region threatened 
public safety. Ordinary law was inadequate to ensure pulic 
order, he said. 
  Mr de Klerk told a news conference at the Union Buildings 
that negotiations with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr 
Buthelezi should continue despite the decision to declare a 
state of emergency over kwaZulu/Natal. 
  Mr de Klerk said it was important that the position of the 
Zulu monarch should be accommodated constitutionally. 
  He was of the opinion that the state of emergency would 
create the opportunity to find solutions, and that it would 
bring about an atmosphere that would facilitate free and fair 
elections. 
  He declined to say how Mr Buthelezi and Mr Mandela had 
reacted to his decision, saying they would respond themselves. 
  President de Klerk said the state of emergency, which would 
apply to Natal, including the self-governing area of kwaZulu, 
would see a substantial increase in security force manpower 
levels in the province. 
  However, Mr Buthelezi would remain chief minister and run 
his 
own administration. 
  Mr de Klerk also said the election would continue on the 
scheduled dates of April 26-28, and there was no need for the 
South African public to panic. Sufficient numbers of security 
forces would be deployed in South Africa to ensure law and 
order, and government would not allow anarchy to develop. 
  He said there was no need for people to store up food as 
though they were preparing for a siege. 
  Mr de Klerk said he envisaged that the state of of emergency 
regulations, which were still being drafted, would provide for 
stricter control of marches, public meetings, and would provide 
for the detention of people. 
  There would also be "some form of prohibition" on the 
carrying of weapons, but this was still subject to discussion. 
  It went without saying that there would be good co-operation 
between the South African security forces and the kwaZulu Police. 
  The actual management of the state of emergency would be 
left 
in the hands of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the 
police. 
  He said had the state of emergency not been declared, there 
would have been a serious deterioration in the security 
situation in kwaZulu/Natal. 
  There were strategies from more than one side towards 
destabilisation, he said. 
  He did not foresee a need for the call-up of additional 
part-time SADF members. 
  Mr de Klerk said no date had yet been set for the meeting 
between himself, Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, and the Zulu king. 
  Mr de Klerk was accompanied to the news conference by 
Justice 
and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee, a police General van der 
Merwe, and the chief of the army, Gen H Pretorius. 
  Mr de Klerk said the state of emergency may be promulgated 
later on Thursday. 
  He had only decided to declare the state of emergency on 
Thursday morning, and only he, as head of government and head of 
state, could declare a state of emergency. 
  The decision was not initiated by any outside party or 
institution. 
  The perception that the state of emergency had been ordered 
or requested by an outside source was wrong, he said. 
  It had not been taken at the behest of the Transitional 
Executive Council, but on the advise and analysis of the 
government's intelligence services and security advisers. 
  It was also wrong to see the development as a first step 
towards destabilising the kwaZulu government. The decision had 
nothing to do with any such goal, said Mr de Klerk. 
  "I will only make inroads on their authority if there is 
maladministration and i have no evidence of that." 
  He would also intervene if the kwaZulu government did not 
co-operate in making free and fair elections possible, but the 
kwaZulu government was giving its full co-operation in this 
regard. 
  The state of emergency would help to protect the kwaZulu 
government against any threats or efforts to destablise its 
position, Mr de Klerk said. 
  Action in terms of the state of emergency would be taken 
against anybody involved in any actions which constituted a 
threat to the security of kwaZulu/Natal, or a threat of 
violence, he said. 
  Free and fair elections in the region would be compatible 
with the state of emergency, because free political activity and 
meetings would be allowed. But advance notice would be required 
in terms of the regulations, Mr de Klerk said. 
  The declaration was made in terms of the legal prescriptions 
for interaction with the TEC, he added. 
  The declaration would also enable the IFP to be free to 
continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, Mr 
de Klerk said. 
  The state of emergency would see the deployment, on an 
incremental basis, of fairly large numbers of SADF [South 
African Defense Force] troops. 
  In terms of the law the state of emergency would apply for a 
year but it would be lifted as soon as circumstances permitted. 
  Mr de Klerk said the regulations might affect the freedom of 
the press. 
  "It might, I do not know of any specific regulations in the 
draft regulations at this time. In the past it has. I do not 
think that the press has anything to fear however in this 
regard." 
  Mr de Klerk had considered also placing the Witwatersrand, 
where unrest areas had been declared, under a state of emergency. 
  "I would not say that it is probable that at this stage 
parts 
of the Witwatersrand would also be changed to a state of 
emergency, but we will continue to keep a close watch."

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 31 March (PANA) -- The Organization of 
African Unity (OAU) has decided to withdraw its special 
representative in Burundi, Papa Louis Fall, after four months 
under an impossible observer mission, sources in Bujumbura said 
Thursday [31 March]. Fall, who is Senegal's ambassador to 
Ethiopia, met President Cyprien Ntaryamira in Bujumbura on 
Tuesday, the official sources said. The envoy arrived in the 
country on 17th November 1993 at the head of 20 civilians 
supposed to be in the proposed OAU Protection and Observer 
Mission (MIPROBU), which was to be sent into Burundi following 
the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye on 21st October 
1993. 
  In a televised statement in Bujumbura, the OAU special 
representative expressed regret at not being able to carry out 
his mission. "I learnt a lot in Burundi but I taught very 
little" he said, adding that "the problem in Burundi is very 
complex, and can only be effectively solved by the people of 
Burundi themselves." 
  The Senegalese diplomat was supposed to head a force of 200 
people, 180 of them army officers and men from several 
francophone African countries. However, on 24th December 1993, 
six opposition Burundi political parties staged demonstrations 
in the streets of Bujumbura to oppose the force's impending 
arrival. They claimed the presence of MIPROBU in Burundi would 
be in violation of national sovereignty. Some protesters also 
accused the OAU envoy of making biased statements. 
  After that incident, the OAU representative became very 
discreet and the idea of a foreign protection force was 
gradually shelved. In its place, a 1000-man local unit was 
created under the direct authority of the presidency. It is 
charged with the protection of institutions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sao Tome, 30 Mar (AFP) -- Reliable sources in Sao 
Tome disclosed today that the country runs the risk of having 
its structural adjustment loans suspended because the government 
is not prepared to bear the social consequences of the World 
Bank's "drastic measures." 
  In a faxed message sent to Finance Minister Arlindo Carvalho 
and Central Bank Governor Adelino Castelo David, the World Bank 
said the country runs the risk of having the payment of new 
loans suspended because it has not met the bank's conditions. A 
copy of this message was also sent to AFP. 
  The suspension of World Bank loans could have repercussions 
on the progress of the structural adjustment program agreed upon 
by Sao Tome and the IMF. 
  The World Bank is accusing the Sao Tome Government of not 
achieving any "tangible results" in the implementation of its 
recommendations. These recommendations basically include the 
privatization of state enterprises, the restructuring of the 
financial system, and a reduction in the civil service work 
force. The government has been asked to cut down its civil 
service work force by half by January 1995. This means laying 
off nearly 2,000 workers. An emergency cabinet meeting was 
convened following the World Bank warning.

  [Excerpts] The Coalition for the Defense of the Republic 
[CDR] has demanded its seat in the Transitional National 
Assembly. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana yesterday, the CDR did not beat around the bush. 
It reaffirmed that its participation in the Transitional 
National Assembly had already been decided in accordance with 
Articles 61 and 62 of the power-sharing protocol of 19 January 
1993 and the annex to the text of the code of political ethics 
to which the CDR was a signatory. 
  The CDR letter stressed that since negotiations are over, 
there is no more room for verification of respect for the 
conditions stated in Article 61 of the protocol (?to) which the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] refers [passage indistinct]. 
  Concerning the [name indistinct] criticism of the peace 
accord, the CDR party stressed that no text can be perfect. It 
is normal for the Arusha accord to be submitted to criticism but 
that is in no way a prerogative of the CDR party. Despite the 
criticism, the CDR has decided to adhere to the agreement and to 
respect it in order to contribute to the restoration of real 
peace and national reconciliation. 
  The CDR also stressed that the recent reaction of RPF Leader 
Titus Rutaremana reflects an ethnic [words indistinct] RPF 
officials. According to the CDR, the RPF is not interested in 
the problem of the war displaced and the need for a change in 
mentality in order to generate durable and real social peace 
between Hutus and Tutsis. However, the CDR ideology is pacifist 
and realistic because it recognizes the ethnic problem which has 
been eating away at our country for centuries. The CDR 
furthermore denounced the ideology of ethnic purification 
preached by many extremist RPF members. 
  In its letter to the prime minister, the CDR also pointed 
out 
that the RPF is not at all empowered to demand the exclusion of 
the CDR from the Transitional National Assembly and urged the 
RPF to renounce once and for all its ideology of power struggle 
based on vengeance and revenge. 
  The CDR said it could obviously not accept joining the 
Transitional National Assembly later simply based on a decision 
by the RPF which is exceeding its powers. The CDR reaffirmed 
that it has to enter the institution from the very first day and 
under the same conditions as those of the other political 
parties. CDR First Vice President Sylvestre Nahimana signed for 
his party. 
  The entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly 
is 
also recommended by 11 political parties which were registered 
at the time of the Arusha peace accord on 4 August 1993. The 11 
parties, which signed a motion of support for the entry of the 
CDR in the Transitional National Assembly, said they were 
motivated by a spirit of justice and fairness, and were 
concerned with strict respect for the Arusha accords and the 
speedy return of durable peace in Rwanda and national 
reconciliation. The entry of the CDR in the Transitional 
National Assembly has to be on an equal footing with the other 
political forces and under the same legal conditions in 
accordance with Articles 61, 80, 81, and 82 of the protocol on 
power-sharing signed in Arusha, the parties stressed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Only the Social Democratic Party, the Rwandan People's 
Democratic Union, the Rwandan Socialist Party, and the 
Democratic Party did not sign the motion of support for the 
entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly.

  [Text] Mogadishu, March 31 (AFP) - An American aid worker 
in Somalia was kidnapped by gunmen on Thursday [31 March], 
Somali sources said. 
  The American, working for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), 
was kidnapped in the Somali capital Mogadishu, the sources said, 
but without giving further details. 
  The kidnap of the American comes barely a week after the 
release of a New Zealander and a Kenyan who were held hostage 
for 16 days by gunmen demanding a one million dollar ransom. 
  But David Morris, the owner of Morris Catering which is 
contracted by the UN to supply its troops with food and water, 
said he secured the release of his employees after protracted 
negotiations by giving the gunmen a few bags of rice and sugar, 
and a tin of cooking oil. 
  Armed bandits are on the increase here after the withdrawal 
last week of American and other western forces. 
  Wayne Hargreaves, the New Zealander released last week, said 
his kidnappers "were a well equipped terrorist group". 
  Meanwhile, five bandits were killed by newly-trained Somali 
police in the northwestern town of Baidoa on Wednesday, UN 
military spokesman Chris Budge said on Thursday. 
  The killing occurred after the leader of the bandits tried 
to 
coerce aid workers into employing some of his men.

  [Text] The Daboa Youth Association has appealed to the 
government to take the necessary action to protect the lives and 
property of the Dagombas, Gonjas, and Nanumbas now that they 
have surrendered their arms to the military task force. The 
appeal was contained in a statement issued in Tamale and signed 
by the northern regional president of the association, Mr. 
Mohammed Mumuni. 
  The association pointed out that despite the recent 
directives of the task force commandant to the Konkomba warriors 
to gather at certain designated areas for the disarming process, 
they have flouted these orders and are still attacking and 
burning down villages. It cited the cases of Tabia and Sanye 
which were attacked and burned last week resulting in the loss 
of lives and damage to property. The association expressed 
concern about the alarming rate of displaced persons and 
appealed for more relief aid for them.

  [Text] The report of the committee of inquiry, appointed by 
the government to investigate the Gonja, Nawuri, and Nangjuri 
dispute and the circumstances that led to the communal violence 
at Kpandai in the Northern Region involving the Gonjas and 
Nawuris in April and June 1991, has been published. The 
committee noted that the Gonja hold on the Nawuris and the 
Nchumurus stems from the Gonja claim to conquest and the 
accepted overlordship by the two ethnic groups. It said despite 
the Nawuris' and the Nchumurus' resistance to this claim, the 
colonial government maintained it in pursuit of the policy of 
indirect rule. Successive governments continued this policy of 
domination by the Gonjas without realistically coming to terms 
with the situation. 
  The committee was of the view that this hegemony by the 
Gonjas has been the major cause of disharmony and unrest in that 
part of the country and the cause of the recent disturbances in 
the area. The committee said it found out that both Nawuris and 
Nchumurus own the land on which they live. They have their own 
chiefs and, according to evidence, the payment of tribute has 
ceased long ago. The Nawuris and the Nchumurus also have 
different languages, customs, practices, and religions from the 
Gonjas. 
  In addition, the practice whereby Gonjas have to protect the 
minor ethnic groups in return for services and tributes has 
ceased to have any meaning to the people. It pointed out that 
the system of overlordship can no longer be tolerated in this 
era of civilization, because it is inimical to the aspirations 
of the people and must be considered obsolete and unworkable at 
the present time. The committee, therefore, made the following 
recommendations: 
  The nangjuri wura, head chief of the Nchumurus, and the 
nawuri wura, head chief of the Nawuris, be accorded recognition 
as the paramount chiefs of their respective people; the 
subchiefs of the Nawuris and Nchumurus be also recognized as 
chiefs in their respective areas; the Nawuri and Nchumuru chiefs 
be registered in the national register of chiefs and gazetted 
accordingly. 
  In addition, separate traditional councils should be created 
for the Nawuris and the Nchumurus. The committee also 
recommended that separate traditional areas should be created 
for the Nawuris and Nchumurus. Membership of the Nawuri 
traditional council to be created should be extended to include 
representatives of all heads of or chiefs of other ethnic 
groups, including the kangokiku wura, chief of the Gonjas at 
Kpandai, if he so wished to attend. The nawuri wura should be 
the president of such a traditional council. 
  Similarly, the membership of the Nchumuru traditional 
council 
should include the representative of all heads or chiefs of 
other ethnic groups, the president of which should be the 
nangjuri wura. They should take their seats in the Northern 
Region House of Chiefs, and in accordance with the practice 
obtaining at the house, they should be given the opportunity to 
represent the house at the National House of Chiefs without any 
discrimination. 
  The Gonjas should however retain whatever land they have 
effectively reduced into their possession [as heard]. In view 
of the strained relations between the Gonjas and the Nawuris in 
particular, and the desire of all people in Nawuriland and 
Nchumuruland for administrative autonomy, the committee 
suggested that serious consideration should be given to the 
possibility of creating a separate district assembly for them. 
  The committee said it is aware that its recommendations may 
not be completely acceptable to the parties. They must, 
however, be made to accept a break with the past. The past has 
not provided a favorable climate for peaceful and progressive 
coexistence and has been a long period of cold war between the 
Gonjas and Nawuris and the Nchumurus. The pressure emanating 
from the cold war has been the major cause of recent 
disturbances. 
  It is clear that the Gonjas can no longer subdue the 
determined Nawuris and Nchumurus. These troubles will cease 
only after the lands, native sovereignty, and dignity are 
restored to the Nawuris and the Nchumurus.

  [Text] Monrovia, 31 Mar (AFP) -- Charles Taylor, leader of 
the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main 
Liberian armed faction, offered to mediate yesterday in an 
internal crisis that has been shaking up his rivals in the 
United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] 
since the beginning of this month. 
  Fighting between Mandingos, who are loyal to the ULIMO 
political leader, Alhaji Koromah, and Krahns, who support 
military commander General Roosevelt Johnson, has left some 300 
dead. 
  In a statement broadcast on NPFL radio and monitored in 
Monrovia, Mr. Taylor asked the representatives of each of the 
two fighting clans to meet in his presence and said that he was 
"optimistic" that the crisis could be resolved quickly. He 
denied accusations that the NPFL had taken sides with General 
Johnson against Mr. Koromah. "As far as we are concerned, the 
war is over. We will not do anything to hinder the peace 
process," he stated. 
  To back this declaration of good faith, yesterday the NPFL 
began distributing 25 tons of rice to displaced civilians who 
have settled around Monrovia. "This is only the beginning," he 
stated in a communique. 
  The NPFL, the ULIMO, and the former interim government, the 
three main factions in the Liberian civil war, which has left 
about 150,000 dead since December 1989, in July 1993 signed a 
peace agreement in which they pledged to disarm and demobilize 
their troops before the holding of general elections -- slated 
for September -- in the country. This normalization process, 
which started on 7 March, is still at a very early stage since 
the disarmament and installation of the transitional 
institutions are only just symbolic.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied an 
allegation in the 26 March 1994 edition of THE NEWS newspaper in 
which the (?newspaper alleged) without any proof whatsoever that 
Liberian diplomatic passports have become the hottest commodity 
in Europe and the Far East for (?tourists) posing as businessmen. 
  The paper reported that a Foreign Ministry official is said 
to be the passport merchant. A Foreign Ministry release pointed 
out that following the appearance of the allegations, the 
ministry formally invited the editor of THE NEWS newspaper to 
have some clarifications made in connection with this great 
issue of national interest so that (?tough) action would be 
taken to arrest the situation in the supreme interest of the 
government and people of Liberia. However, the release states 
the editor in chief of THE NEWS newspaper failed to name the 
passport merchant referred to in her column and could also not 
give any clues to help the authorities of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to arrest this frightening situation. 
  In the absence of any tangible proof to substantiate THE 
NEWS 
newspaper's disturbing allegations, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs wishes to make it clear that it is by no means aware of 
the operation of any diplomatic passport merchant within the 
ranks of its functionaries, whose integrity it has no reason to 
question. The ministry says it is constrained by the conduct of 
the NEWS newspaper to admonish its editors to be sufficiently 
circumspect in their professional undertakings so that the 
imaginations of individuals [words indistinct] unfounded malice 
and [words indistinct] will not continue to embarrass them 
unnecessarily.

  [Text] The Liberian People's Party [LPP] has elected Dr. 
Togbah-Nah Tipoteh as the national chairman of the party. At an 
emergency meeting of LPP's high decision-making organ, the 
organizing committee, Dr. Tipoteh was elected by acclamation. A 
release from the LPP's office says Dr. Tipoteh's [word 
indistinct] comes in the wake of the former chairman, Dr. 
Wolokollie's request to the organizing committee to find a 
full-time chairman to prepare the party adequately for the 
pending elections. The organizing committee, in the release, 
commended Mr. Wolokollie for the leadership provided the party 
in its most difficult period and hoped that in his new 
assignment as special liaison of the party with the LNTG 
[Liberian National Transitional Government], Mr. Wolokollie will 
exhibit equal commitment in the discharge of his duties. 
  Dr. Tipoteh, in his thanks to his solid partisans for his 
unanimous election, pledged continuity in the implementation of 
the general policies of the party. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. (Joseph Volloh) has been named chairman of 
the 
policy council of the party. He replaces Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh.

  [Text] The federal Government has reacted to a statement 
credited to the Cameroonian foreign minister, Mr. Ferdinand 
Oyono. Mr. Oyono is quoted to have said that his country is 
prepared to go to war over the Bakassi Peninsula, a piece of 
Nigerian territory which has been the subject of dispute. Mr. 
Oyono is also quoted as having said that there could be an 
outbreak of war anytime now. 
  In reacting to the Cameroonian minister's utterance, the 
minister of state for foreign affairs, Chief Anthony Ani, said 
the Nigerian Government considers the statement unnecessarily 
belligerent and unfortunate, especially in the face of ongoing 
efforts to resolve the matter amicably. Chief Ani also said it 
is instructive that Mr. Oyono's threat was issued in Addis 
Ababa, where a committee of OAU had risen from deliberations in 
the finding of a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Chief Ani 
has however warned that Nigeria's capability to protect its 
territory and citizens should not be underestimated.

  [Text] Many South African mercenaries are piloting Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] 
combat aircraft in Angola. Reports from the Armed Forces for 
the Liberation of Angola Military Command in Cuango area 
yesterday said the involvement of mercenaries in the MPLA-PT air 
force was confirmed in the last bombings. Our source said the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] will 
not take responsibility for what will happen to those 
mercenaries and others on the battle fronts. Recently the head 
of the South African Army said mercenaries operating in Angola 
did not do so with the government's consent. However, when 
UNITA killed 12 South African nationals, including a colonel, on 
22 March during clashes, Pretoria became agitated.

  [Text] The fourth session of the Central Committee of the 
Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] was held in Matola 
recently. The final communique reflects the issues discussed at 
the meeting: 
  The Mozambican Government continues to strictly adhere to 
the 
General Peace Accord. Although the international community is 
assisting in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and 
in the democratization of the Mozambican society, Frelimo's 
Central Committee noted with apprehension the patronizing 
attitude that some members of the international community have 
shown toward Renamo on a number of occasions, as well as the 
actions aimed at downplaying the seriousness of the violations 
of the General Peace Accord, and underestimating Renamo's 
maneuvers to avoid fulfilling the agreed timetables. 
  In complete disregard of its public statements on the 
upholding of democracy and human rights, Renamo continues to 
prevent the access and movement of citizens in areas under its 
control, thereby violating the General Peace Accord. Moreover, 
Renamo prohibits economic activities -- namely, hunting, 
fishing, and logging in areas under its control in violation of 
the spirit and letter of the General Peace Accord and the 
Constitution of the Republic.

  [Text] The movement of government and Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] forces to assembly areas has become 
increasingly slower over the past few days. Since the beginning 
of this week, only 68 government troops and four from Renamo 
arrived at assembly areas. A total of 33,369 soldiers from the 
government had been confined by yesterday. This represents 54 
percent of the total number of soldiers to be confined. On 
Renamo's side, a total of 14,809 soldiers have already been 
confined. This represents 77 percent of troops to be confined.

  [Excerpts] Continuing his tour of African countries, 
Foreign Minister Velayati arrived in Windhoek, the capital of 
Namibia, today. He met and held talks with President Sam Nujoma. 
At that meeting, Nujoma expressed his pleasure at the presence 
of the Iranian delegation in Namibia and described his country 
as the second home of Iranians. He expressed his interest in 
expanding cooperation in all fields with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. 
  Velayati, for his part, congratulated Nujoma on the return 
of 
Walvis Bay to that country and delivered a message from the 
president of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the fourth 
anniversary of Namibia's independence. 
  At that meeting, the two sides discussed international 
political issues and expressed their concern at the continuing 
violence by South African racists against the opposition. The 
two sides also underlined the need to expand economic and 
commercial relations based on the agreement reached between the 
presidents of Namibia and the Islamic Republic of Iran within 
the framework of South-South cooperation. Other topics 
discussed between Velayati and Nujoma were the formation of a 
joint commission between the two countries and cooperation in 
the fields of fishing, oil, and mines. [passage omitted] 
  Continuing his visit to Namibia, Velayati met and held 
negotiations with the foreign minister of that country. At that 
meeting, the Namibian foreign minister described stopping the 
sale of oil by the Islamic Republic of Iran to South Africa and 
occupied Palestine as a major factor in damaging the interests 
of those two countries and said: Iran has struck the biggest 
blow to racism in the world. 
  Velayati, for his part, underlined Iran's continuing support 
for the struggle of the people of Namibia against racism under 
the leadership of Nujoma.

  [Text] Harare March 30 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's Government on 
Wednesday [30 March] attempted to control damage caused by the 
scandal over land leases to top government and ruling ZANU 
[Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front]) 
officials in the face of first signs of a party split on the 
question. 
  President Robert Mugabe is currently abroad seeking foreign 
investment. 
  At a news conference Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai 
accused Zimbabwe's press of being "bent on frustrating the 
efforts of government promoting foreign investment" with reports 
of how at least a dozen senior officials had been issued with 
large commercial farms initially intended for resettlement of 
landless peasants. Mr Kangai denounced the independent DAILY 
GAZETTE for being "misguided and mischievous". 
  But the government was criticised for the first time from 
within the ruling ZANU (PF) party, with chairman of the populous 
and influential Mastingo Province, Dzikamai Mavhaire, denouncing 
the land policy as "government's worst corruption ever". His 
remark was a sign the scandal could create a split in the party. 
  On March 3 the DAILY GAZETTE reported former agriculture 
minister, and now minister of education, Witness Mangwende, was 
the first beneficiary of the land policy of confiscating 
white-owned farms to resettle landless black peasants. 
  Mr Mangwende pushed for the Land Acquisition Act two years 
ago. The act allows government to seize land and pay farmers a 
rate of compensation determined by government. It also excludes 
farmers' claims for unfair compensation. 
  The newspaper has since named eleven other officials -- 
including two cabinet ministers and the police and army chiefs 
-- who were granted leases for land of white tenants or land 
bought over the last decade to resettle [word indistinct] 
farmers. 
  At Wednesday's news conference, Mr Kangai repeated his 
assertion that "there is nothing wrong with giving farms to my 
colleagues", but refused to provide a list of beneficiaries. 
  The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe on 
Wednesday "condemned unreservedly the so-called tenant 
resettlement scheme" under which officials were granted land "at 
the expense of landless peasants whose need is desperate". 
  A commission statement said the allocation of farms to 
officials was "highly unethical (and did not) in any way redress 
the disparities in land distribution, but simply has the effect 
of replacing one elite group with another". The commission said 
its concerns about the legislation had been vindicated by the 
current trends.

<F P=106> [Interview with kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi in Ulundi, </F>
ANC's Jacob Zuma in the Durban studio, and TEC official Mac 
Maharaj in the Johannesburg studio by announcer Max du Preez -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] Chief Minister, can we kick off with you 
immediately. Your deputy leader in Transvaal, Mr. Humphrey 
Ndlovu, said today that this declaration is the start of the 
civil war in South Africa... 
  [Buthelezi] The what? 
  [Du Preez] ...is the start of the civil war in South Africa, 
we are not going to tolerate this state of emergency. Now that 
comes shortly after your statement that the struggle between 
your party and the ANC is now to the finish. Are these 
statements not highly dangerous and grossly irresponsible? 
  [Buthelezi] No, the statement is not aggressive, the 
statement is merely the facts of the matter, but right from 
Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] the ANC did 
not want the king of the Zulus and the kwaZulu government 
represented at Codesa. And there are many other things where we 
were sort of elbowed out of things, you know, in the multiparty 
talks, with the approval of the ANC. Because many times it was 
stated that it was immaterial whether we were there or not, and 
that the train would move whether we were present or not, and 
this was said not only by the president of the ANC but also by 
Mr. Ramaphosa the secretary general. So therefore, there has 
been this struggle, this attitude towards kwaZulu, this 
aggression, against the people of kwaZulu by the ANC. So I 
mean, then, the killing of our people I said means that, it 
means that they want this to be a fight to the finish. 
  [Du Preez] The statement I just read.... 
  [Buthelezi, interrupting] People are trying to distort that 
by saying that I mean that I'm now going to fight with the ANC 
to the finish. But the fight is on already. Thousands of Zulu 
people have been killed, even in the East Rand. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Buthelezi, what do you think of the statement 
that this declaration of a state of emergency is the start of 
civil war in South Africa? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I did not even hear Mr. Ndlovu say so, and 
I don't even understand that statement. 
  [Du Preez] Do you agree with it? 
  [Buthelezi] I don't even understand it. How can I agree with 
what I don't understand? I don't understand what Mr. Ndlovu 
meant when he said that. 
  [Du Preez] Can I read you some more of what he said, 
according to SAPA. He said this meant that IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] supporters would continue to go about their daily lives, 
and would ignore curfews. If the security forces attempted to 
stop them, they will get what they are looking for, unquote. 
And, asked whether this meant that IFP supporters would fight, 
he said: Of course, if we have to. And then they asked him 
would the civil war only rage in Natal, he said: I'm not going 
anywhere; you will see it with your own eyes. This is dangerous 
stuff, Mr. Buthelezi. 
  [Buthelezi] Well, but you must understand, a person who is 
traumatized by the slaughter of our people, the Shell House 
slaughter of our people, the Shell House massacre was really a 
traumatic thing. I don't necessarily approve of that statement 
personally, but you must understand that Mr. Ndlovu was there 
and he saw those people, and it's only a few days ago that this 
happened. 
  [Du Preez] Can I stay with you and ask you...the state 
president was not prepared to tell us what you said to him on 
the phone when he told you about the state of emergency. What 
did you tell him? 
  [Buthelezi] Who? 
  [Du Preez] What did you tell the state president on the 
phone 
when he told you about the state of emergency? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I told him that as far as we are 
concerned, 
you know, the TEC and ANC is one thing, because, from the 
management committee right up to every council of the TEC, the 
majority of the people are either ANC or members of the 
Patriotic Front, which is aligned to the ANC. Some of them are 
candidates in the elections or in the lists of the ANC, both 
national and regional. So therefore, he said that he did this 
on his own initiative. But I said that the perception wouldn't 
be that he does it on his own initiative, in so far as many 
spokespersons of the ANC have threatened us by saying that 
they're going clamp on kwaZulu. Mr. Ramaphosa has said so. Mr. 
Joe Slovo said: Two down, one to go. Mr. Maharaj himself and 
many others have threatened us in this way. I have documented 
evidence to the fact that the state president has been under 
pressure from them to do exactly what he did today. 
  [Du Preez] Can I quickly go to Mr. Zuma in Durban. Mr. Zuma, 
what is your reaction to the statements from Chief Buthelezi and 
Mr. Ndlovu and others? 
  [Zuma] Well, it is clear that the tension is very high, 
politically, in our country. I think we are welcoming the state 
of emergency because the situation, particularly here in Natal, 
has been very volatile. I think the chief minister is correct 
that the fight between the IFP members and the ANC has been on. 
As we are talking now, there are people who are not in their 
houses at kwaMashu, who are refugees. There are people who have 
died. Just last night, people were killed who were called into 
a peaceful meeting and yet that was a trap. 
  You are, therefore, dealing with a situation that people are 
dying everyday. The question that has been always there has 
been: At what point shall we have people stop from killing one 
another? Even if we had political differences, it didn't seem 
clear that this was possible. Therefore, the state president, 
who had the responsibility for the security of the citizens of 
this country at the end of the day, I think has a responsibility 
to ensure that we are all protected. 
  As I'm talking to you, my own homestead has been burned down 
just last week. Now you dealing with a situation therefore, 
wherein you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. You do 
need extraordinary measures to ensure that the security 
situation is stabilized, so that political campaigning goes on. 
We have an important agreement between ourselves, that is the 
IFP and the ANC, that much as we differ, in terms of whether 
there should be an election or not, but our members should be 
free to express themselves, either for elections, or for not 
participating in the elections, but the problem is, there is 
violence going on. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Zuma, can I cut you short there and just ask 
Mr. Maharaj: Mr. Mandela this afternoon in his press conference 
said the regulations would mean confining the kwaZulu Police to 
barracks and the fact that Chief Buthelezi would not be the 
minister of police any more, are those.... 
  [Maharaj, interrupting] Max, from the point of view of the 
Transitional Executive Council, let me say this, it's subcouncil 
on law and order has been involved in drafting the regulations. 
Those regulations still center on allowing political activity 
to take place. Secondly, there is a lot of evidence of many 
aspects of the problem of violence in Natal and political 
activity. One of the matters that is of concern has been the 
role of certain individuals in the kwaZulu Police. The chief 
minister is well aware of them. He has seen them documented. 
They have been referred to in commission reports, in court 
records. Nothing has been done about it, and they have actually 
prevented free political activity. There are allegations of 
their participation in hit squad activity, and alternatively of 
their failure to take due and proper steps regarding the 
investigation of criminal activity. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Maharaj, these fears about the state of 
emergency, especially on the side of kwaZulu people and IFP 
people. Are they real fears? 
  [Maharaj] Yes, I think they are real fears -- concerns -- 
because the state of emergency has a particular history in our 
country, and therefore this state of emergency must be 
understood in the context that the state president has 
explained. Relating to your earlier question, I must say that 
the South African Defense Force is being deployed and will be 
effectively in control of law and order. The consequences of 
that depends on the level of cooperation they receive from the 
kwaZulu minister and his police force. I believe the responses 
so far have not been heartening, and therefore one must realize 
that what is being done in securing free political activity and 
the electoral process depends to a considerable degree on the 
type of cooperation that we receive. One would imagine that he 
would cooperate. 
  [Du Preez] Can we quickly ask Chief Buthelezi on this point, 
are you going to....[pauses] You are the minister of law and 
order in kwaZulu. Are you prepared to cooperate, or is this 
going to escalate? 
  [Buthelezi] In fact, the remarks that are made by Mr. 
Maharaj 
are typical Marxist propaganda because Mr. Maharaj should know 
that the commissioner of police of kwaZulu is appointed by the 
minister of law and order of South Africa, and we operate with 
the South African Police. Most of the kwaZulu Police stations 
in kwaZulu are actually run by the South African Police because 
the kwaZulu Police is a small force. We don't have enough 
personnel, and therefore we cooperate with the South African 
Police. And now to come and ask me now will I cooperate with 
the police is nonsense because, in fact, we do cooperate. My 
police is run by an officer of the South African Police. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Maharaj, it sounds like a positive answer. He 
will cooperate under the state of emergency. 
  [Buthelezi] I am cooperating now. To say that I am making a 
pledge to Mr. Maharaj now -- I don't need to make any pledge to 
Mr. Maharaj because we do work hand in glove with the South 
African Police. 
  [Maharaj] I don't expect the chief minister to make a 
commitment to me, but there is a clear record that even the 
Wallace Commission said with regards to one of his top police 
officers that his conduct was entirely unacceptable in a police 
officer. He described his conduct in another paragraph as 
bizarre and entirely inappropriate. That police officer 
remained in his position. 
  [Buthelezi] I mean, you Mr. Maharaj, you're not as white as 
driven snow. I mean, for instance, you refused to allow after 
the slaughter of our people at Shell House -- you refused to 
allow police to search Shell House. Now you should be talking 
as if you are as white as driven snow. It's that individual who 
was blamed. I mean, it's actually the transgressions of that 
individual. 
  [Maharaj] With due respect to the chief minister, he's not 
answering the problem that I'm posing. He is the chief minister 
of the police. There are allegations and findings made by a 
commission about senior offices of his police force, not General 
During. They remain in the police, and in order to cooperate, 
something has to be done about this police officer. 
  [Buthelezi] The remaining in the police force...in fact it 
was myself, as minister of police, who said to Gen. During that 
the allegations about hit squads should actually be 
investigated. It was actually done by myself. And of course, 
the general, when he came to give evidence there...I mean, he 
did give evidence, and you are talking this as if the person 
concerned was actually convicted. Those people that were 
mentioned in that hit squad were actually charged, and they were 
actually suspended from the police. 
  [Maharaj] Clearly the chief minister is not addressing the 
question that I posed. The Wallace Commission did not refer to 
Gen. During. It referred to a high officer still serving in the 
kwaZulu Police. 
  [Buthelezi] Who is he? 
  [Maharaj] If you want me to name him in public I will. 
  [Buthelezi] Yes, because I don't know what you are talking 
about. But I'm not prepared to be stickling actually about 
transgressions of one officer. I don't even approve of any 
transgressions in the police force. 
  [Maharaj] It's a matter of public record that the Wallace 
Commission said this about Brigadier (?Mather). 
  [Buthelezi] Well, you say that he is not fit to be in the 
police? 
  [Maharaj] I don't say. The Wallace Commission said that his 
conduct was bizarre and was entirely inappropriate and entirely 
unacceptable in a police officer. 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I find that, you know, it's a question of 
the pot calling the kettle black, because, as you know, the 
Douglas Commission and other commissions have said that very 
high ranking members of the executive of the ANC were involved 
in torturing people, murdering people in their own camps, their 
own members. But I don't now indulge in guilt by association, 
by saying that all members of the National Executive of the ANC 
are the same. 
  [Du Preez] Can I quickly bring us back to the topic. And I'm 
asking Mr. Maharaj quickly to tell us, can we, as Lester asked 
the state president--let's define this a little bit-- can we 
really have an election with a state of emergency. What about 
abuses of human rights? 
  [Maharaj] Yes, I believe that we can because we have drafted 
the legislation in such a way that it ensures the right of free 
political activity. I believe that those who see an 
inconsistency are failing to address the central problem of 
violence and the lack of safety to people's lives and their 
right to exercise the vote. Now I believe that this can be 
affected, with cooperation it should be affected within days, 
without cooperation it can be effected with a little longer 
time. With that scenario, I do not underestimate the problems 
that we face. And I think that those problems will have to be 
overcome, they need the empowerment of the security forces to be 
able to carry out their task. In the normal legislation the 
South African Defense Force have no powers of search, entry, and 
even arrest or seizure. 
  [Du Preez] Can I go to Mr. Zuma quickly and ask him, Mr. 
Zuma, do you think the state of emergency is going to bring us 
more peace in Natal now, and what do you think the likelihood is 
of peaceful elections in three weeks' time? 
  [Zuma] I certainly believe that the state of emergency will 
contain the level of violence which was clearly beginning to 
escalate. I think we'll be in a position to continue with 
political campaigning of any view, and that we will have 
elections, and people will feel protected, that they could go 
and vote without their lives being in danger. And I believe 
that therefore, with all of us, understanding the intentions of 
that we should be in a position to say as believers in 
democracy, we should allow people to make their free choice in 
the process leading up to the elections. And I also believe 
that the processes that are going on in terms of trying to 
negotiate the peaceful resolutions of the problems, the 
political problems and constitutional problems, should go on and 
be supported, because if we can, in the process, in the face of 
the state of emergency as well, manage to reach agreement, that 
will go a long way to solve our problems. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Zuma, can I switch to Chief Buthelezi, and 
ask 
the chief, the meeting that was planned between yourself, the 
king, Mr. Mandela, and Mr. de Klerk. Will that happen next 
week, or are the rumors true that you're trying to get out of 
that completely? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I told the state president that, in fact, 
it's embarrassing for both His Majesty, the king, with whom I 
had a conversation on the telephone from Durban today, for the 
state president to actually declare a state of emergency prior 
to a meeting like that. I said that, therefore, he must 
understand that is a lot of misconceptions about that. 
  But to go back, I mean to the state of emergency, as far as 
I'm concerned, you know, I think an analogy can be drawn to what 
is being done. Because our people were killed just on Monday, 
brutally, while they were just, you know, peacefully marching, 
and therefore what's being done is really comparable to someone 
holding a woman for someone to rape that woman, it amounts to 
that to us. And it's not justified because violence is taking 
place in many parts, even in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] area itself, in the East Rand. Why is a state of 
emergency not declared there. 
  I mean after all, in 1990, the ANC, SACP, and COSATU 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions] actually brought this 
country to a standstill because they were urging or pressurizing 
Mr. de Klerk to actually dismantle kwaZulu and to disband and 
disarm police. This is just a continuation of that vendetta, 
because as I said earlier, for TEC one reads ANC in this case. 
It is true that I do want peace, too. I do agree with most of 
what Mr. Zuma says, and, incidentally, I would like Mr. Zuma to 
say that I was saddened by the fact that your homestead was 
burned because I don't approve of such methods, because in as 
much I wouldn't like anybody to burn my own home. I'm very 
sorry about that. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for ending on 
a 
positive note slightly. Unfortunately, the time has caught up 
with us. Thank you, gentlemen for your time. Good night from 
us.

  [Text] Ulundi April 1 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Friday [1 April] he held 
out hope for next week's planned summit with State President F W 
de Klerk, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. In an interview outside a small 
rural church near the kwaZulu capital Ulundi, where he attended 
a Good Friday service, the IFP president said if the summit went 
ahead it would take place in a "sour atmosphere", following 
Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu. 
  There was uncertainty after the declaration whether the 
meeting would go ahead but Mr Buthelezi indicated it appeared to 
be on and said he held out hope "otherwise I wouldn't be going". 
However, threats by Mr Mandela to confine the kwaZulu Police to 
barracks and Mr de Klerk's "appalling and shameful" decision to 
declare an emergency were not conducive to good negotiations, he 
said. 
  The summit was to have taken place last week, but King 
Zwelithini pulled out because of the killing of his subjects in 
Johannesburg on Monday. 
  Mr Buthelezi said on Friday he had begun to doubt the state 
president's integrity. While commending Mr de Klerk for his 
reforms, he said "the extent to which he has capitulated to the 
ANC worries me". "I've begun to question his integrity. He's 
disappointed me." Mr de Klerk was supposed to make a decision 
on an emergency from security information but instead he had 
been compelled to do so by the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC], charged the IFP leader. "For TEC, you must read ANC." 
  Mr Buthelezi alleged Mr de Klerk was handling the situation 
unfairly, because he had said nothing about the ANC's hidden 
arms caches but was worried about Zulu traditional weapons. Mr 
Buthelezi repeated that it was "not normal" for elections to be 
held under a state of emergency. The IFP leader, who is also 
kwaZulu's chief minister, expressed despair at the turmoil 
engulfing South Africa, saying the country was experiencing the 
"worst of the worst". "I can't prophesise what will happen, but 
what's worse than what's already happening?" 
  Mr Buthelezi said it was difficult to say what might happen 
if a settlement was not reached to accommodate him and his 
supporters. But, he would continue to act as before: "For 
decades I've been practising resistance politics, by that I 
don't mean taking up arms...but people on the ground are very 
angry. I don't want to speculate or predict how their anger 
will be expressed on the ground."

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in the Transvaal has 
threatened that civil war will follow the declaration of a state 
emergency in kwaZulu-Natal and the murder of eight hostel 
residents on the East Rand. The minibus taxi, in which the 
hostel dwellers were travelling, was ambushed near the kweSini 
Hostel in Katlehong and the occupants shot. According to one of 
the wounded, the attackers were apparently in police uniform.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- Minister of Justice 
and Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee on Friday [1 April] appointed South 
African Police Regional Commissioner of Natal Lt-Gen W H Steyn 
and Brig D Ferreira, commanding officer of Natal command, as 
joint control officers of Natal, including kwaZulu. The 
appointments were temporary, he said in a statement. 
  Mr Coetsee announced that the decision to appoint the two 
men 
was taken in consultation with the management committee of the 
Transitional Executive Council. 
  The appointments follow the imposition of a state of 
emergency in kwaZulu/Natal by State President F W de Klerk. 
  At a press briefing in Pretoria on Thursday, Mr de Klerk 
said 
large numbers of SADF [South African Defense Force] troops would 
be sent into the province to stabilise the region. 
  The emergency measures would not affect Mr Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's position as chief minister of kwaZulu or his 
administration. 
  Similarly, dignified and full recognition should be given to 
the position of the Zulu monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Mr de Klerk said emergency regulations would provide for the 
detention of people, a form of prohibition on the carrying of 
weapons and stricter controls on public events.

<F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 1 SAPA -- The security forces have 
been given wide-ranging powers in terms of the emergency 
regulations which came into effect in kwaZulu/Natal on Thursday. 
Regulations published on Friday in the Government Gazette 
provide for the arrest and detention of those deemed to be a 
threat to public safety and the maintenance of law and order. 
  Fines and a maximum of ten years imprisonment can be imposed 
on any person convicted of an offence which include contravening 
regulations prohibiting: 

  -  organising unauthorised military or para-military training 
or the use and construction of weapons and ammunition; 
  -  interference with lawful gatherings (in terms of this 
regulation no person may by words or conduct threaten others or 
intimidate them; 
  -  contravening the prohibition on the carrying and displaying 
of 
weapons including firearms, assegais, spears, axes, pangas and 
knobkierries; 
  -  publication, posession or dissemination of material 
containing 
threats to life or property; and 
  -  hindering any other person in the carrying out of his duties. 

    Organisers of any march should obtain prior written 
magisterial permission for the procession, stipulating the exact 
route and details such as time and venue. 
  The regulations also limit security forces' liability. 
  Security force members may arrest, without a warrant, any 
person who in their opinion constitutes a threat to public 
safety or the maintenance of law and order, subject to an order 
obtained "not later than 24 hours after arrest". 
  A person may be detained under a written order from any 
security force commissioned officer of the rank of captain or 
above, "without hearing that person" if he or she is deemed to 
constitute a threat. 
  "A person arrested ... may be released ... at any time but 
shall be released or charged in a court of law after the 
expiration of 30 days from the date of his arrest." 
  Those arrested may be questioned by security force members. 
  The minister is authorised to appoint "special advisers" to 
visit detainees. If they deem an offence has been committed in 
respect of the detainee they can submit a report to Defence 
Minister Kobie Coetsee or the attorney-general. 
  Security forces may also, without warrant, enter and search 
premises and seize objects if deemed necessary. 
  The emergency regulations also provide for the minister, in 
consultation with the Transitional Executive Council, to appoint 
"control officers" for any area defined by him. 
  The Independent Electoral Commission may second a suitably 
experienced international observer to control officers who have 
powers to close-off areas and control entry, traffic flow, 
temporary closing of any public or private place and control of 
any essential services. 
  The regulations also empower security force members to 
order any person or persons out of any area if they are 
reasonably deemed to be endangering public safety or public 
order. If they refuse, security forces may arrest them or 
remove them.

  [Text] Additional members of the South African Army will be 
deployed throughout kwaZulu/Natal over the Easter weekend. 
Deployment strategies have already been planned by the Natal 
Command headquarters. 
  [Begin recording] [Franz Verfuss of the Natal Command] It 
will be three companies, a company being approximately 100 to 
150 men strong. A company will be deployed in each of the group 
areas: one going to the Group-9 area -- Pietermaritzburg, one 
going to the Group-10 area near Durban, and one going to the 
Group-27 area round about Eshowe. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] Colonel Verfuss said because 
kwaZulu/Natal is such a vast area, the troops would be mobile 
and would assist the police and the other troops already in the 
area to stabilize the most volatile areas starting off with 
kwaMashu and Bhambayi near Durban. He said they would not work 
directly with the kwaZulu Police. 
  [Verfuss] If the kwaZulu Police cannot handle a situation, 
they approach the police, the South African Police. If the 
South African Police feel that they need extra forces, they 
approach the South African Defense Force. Our support is to the 
South African Police and not directly to the kwaZulu Police. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] Despite Bhambayi and kwaMashu being 
very 
quiet during the daytime, it's at night that violence usually 
erupts, and it's then that the security forces will be most 
needed. [end recording]

  [Text] Durban April 1 SAPA -- Senior police and army 
officers met in Durban on Friday [1 April] morning to begin 
planning security operations in Natal/kwaZulu under the 
emergency regulations. South African Defence Force [SADF] 
spokesman Col Frans Verfuss said the South African Police, 
kwaZulu Police and SADF were represented at the 10am meeting. 
  "They're meeting to discuss the emergency regulations and to 
do joint planning," he said. 
  The role of the kwaZulu Police [KZP] was on the agenda, he 
said. This follows a statement by African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela on Thursday that the KZP would be 
confined to barracks and certain laws in kwaZulu would be 
suspended under the emergency regulations. "The KZP is going to 
be confined to barracks and it will perform such duties as 
permitted by the defence force," said Mr Mandela. 
  "The effect is to suspend all legislation in the area in 
which the emergency applies. The effect is that there will be no 
kwaZulu minister of police," he added. 
  Col Verfuss said three companies of soldiers -- about 500 in 
total -- would be deployed in natal at the weekend, in addition 
to existing troops. He declined to indicate current troop 
strengths in Natal. 
  Col Verfuss said reports of troops "streaming" into the 
region were unfounded. There had also not been a mass call-up in 
Natal. 
  "Natal command has called up people for the period April 15 
to May 15 for elections," he said, adding that the chief of the 
South African Army had also called up reserves, but it was not 
clear yet where they would be deployed. 
  "The situation will decide where troops are deployed. At 
this 
stage tensions are high and there are pockets of violence; it's 
not widespread." 
  Townships around Durban appeared quiet on Friday morning, 
with no immediate reports of overnight violence.

  [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Hundreds of kwaZulu civil 
servants in Umlazi near Durban have vowed not to return to work 
before the kwaZulu government addresses their demands for their 
pensions to be paid out, SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] radio news reported on Thursday [31 March]. The 
civil servants, some of them from places outside Umlazi, have 
been meeting at a stadium outside the township since the 
beginning of the week. 
  Meanwhile, the launch of an African National Congress 
election campaign for Umlazi pupils has been cancelled by the 
Congress of South African Students after school principals 
refused to allow the pupils to attend a meeting on Thursday. 
School principals are reported to have said that pupils were 
busy with their quarterly examinations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike in </F>
Pietersburg and TEC Task Group Member Philip Dexter and Regional 
and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie in the Johannesburg 
studio with announcer Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program 
-- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mashokwe] The TEC's 
[Transitional Executive Council] task group comprising Mr. 
Philip Dexter and Minister Sam de Beer were assigned to look 
into the alleged corruption in Lebowa. I was supposed to be 
joined by Mr. Sam de Beer, who I'm told is locked in meetings, 
but I have with me here Philip Dexter. Good evening and welcome 
to you, Sir. 
  [Dexter] Good evening, Leslie. 
  [Mashokwe] The task group of the TEC, what did it find in 
Lebowa? 
  [Dexter] Well I think the most striking feature of what we 
saw in Lebowa was that there was a complete and total collapse 
of all services. And I think that the extent to which that has 
happened has now become a crisis. 
  [Mashokwe] Is that despite the fact that Fourie's men are in 
the area, trained to sort out the mess? 
  [Dexter] Well I think one of the things that we certainly 
uncovered was that despite the intervention of the minister's 
department, none of the problems have actually been able to be 
solved. Now I'm not trying to imply that that's the minister's 
fault, all I'm saying is that the intervention doesn't seem to 
have achieved any of the objectives that we would have thought 
it was supposed to. 
  [Mashokwe] I want an objective view here: What did you find 
out about the views of the people there with regard to 
Ramodike's governance? 
  [Dexter] Well we consulted, firstly, with the striking 
workers, who were the only people there when we arrived, myself 
and Minister de Beer. After that, we went back to Johannesburg 
and arranged a meeting with the heads of departments and came 
back to Lebowa to meet them. Thereafter, we spoke to the 
cabinet and to the chief minister himself, and I think what we 
discovered in talking to all these various groups was that it 
was clear that none of them were going to be able to solve the 
problem. I don't think the workers who are on strike have the 
ability to solve the problem. The heads of departments clearly 
can't, and it seems to me that the cabinet has also been 
rendered ineffective by the situation that is currently 
prevailing. 
  [Mashokwe] I want you to tell me what exactly the problem is 
in the area? 
  [Dexter] Well, if I were to be honest I would have to say 
that it's difficult to actually find out what is the problem, 
because there are so many claims by different parties, people 
accusing one another of various things. And I think, in all 
fairness, what has happened is that you have a situation that is 
now simply a huge political dispute, and it's quite clear that, 
as I said before, none of the parties involved in the dispute 
would be able to solve it. 
  [Mashokwe] Having listened to the debate that preceded this 
discussion that we're having now, Mr. Ramodike conceded that he 
gets paid for not working, or he gets paid for working in exile 
-- if you didn't find him in his offices? 
  [Dexter] Well, we did actually find the minister, the chief 
minister, in his offices, but I think the point is that nobody 
is able to do any work because everybody is on strike. But I 
think that's not really the issue. The issue is that we can all 
dance around technicalities, but what we need is a solution to 
the problem because there are patients in the hospitals who are 
not being cared for, there are government vehicles which have 
been liberated by people, and in one case... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Liberated? 
  [Dexter] Well we saw -- in one case, we witnessed children 
driving a government vehicle. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, let me come back to you. You said 
to me you're still the chief minister of that area -- children 
driving cars, government has collapsed, you called to the TEC to 
come and take over financial control. Why did you not resign if 
you thought that the government was not worth being there? 
  [Ramodike] Well, if I had to comment Leslie -- you are aware 
of the fact the political authority, power and functions, were 
removed from my administration since September last year. 
  [Mashokwe] You're shaking your head. 
  [Fourie] Well its simply not true. I mean, the chief 
minister admitted that he is the chief minister. He's got a 
government. He's being paid for the job. He is the government. 
All I did was -- we took over the control of the finances. We 
took the checkbook and the order book in simple terms, and we 
are checking that whatever decisions are being taken, that it is 
properly tended for -- if there is services required that there 
is money budgeted for in terms of any decisions being taken, and 
then we ensure that the right payments are made. Just a last 
remark ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you are saying he 
is not -- he was spending money without proper budgeting. 
  [Fourie] Just a last remark. To resolve this problem of the 
police -- he took this absolutely incredible decision to take 2 
million rand from Legislative Assembly pension fund to transfer 
it to the Police Benefit Fund and to give every policeman a 
check. Now that is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Who is going to 
repay the pension money? 
  [Ramodike] To come in Leslie, that is irreconcilable of the 
minister. You will recall that, a few months ago, he said that 
funds accruing from own resources of the self-governing 
territory, like the 3 million rand that was used to purchase a 
jet in kwaZulu, these he said he doesn't have control -- a say 
over this, but when it comes to Lebowa, because we are his 
political opponents and they came down here for a political ploy 
and political posturing, then he would like to control 
everything. The decisions he is referring to -- there is no 
decision that we can take and it doesn't interfere with our 
decisions. For an example, the items of expenditure -- very 
important, essential services that are to be rendered to our 
people, he stopped everything and that is not only a question of 
financial control. If he goes out there to stop the project 
like the erection of (Mankueng) Nursing College, like the 
tarring of roads, like stopping the old age pensions because all 
our old age pensioners, as I'm speaking now, have not as yet 
received their pensions. Now is that my fault? How can you 
give a man administrative accountability and remove political 
accountability, political authority, political power, and 
political functions. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, I am running out of time. Why did 
you remove 2 million rands from the Legislative Assembly's 
pension fund to the police. 
  [Ramodike] Those monies and three other accounts are 
directly 
under our control in spite of the fact that the minister took 
over the financial control. He doesn't have a right to tamper 
with money accruing from our resources. 
  [Fourie] Just two remarks. He just now accused us of a 
blatant lie. I want to say that it is a blatant lie if anybody 
says we stopped the pension monies. I want to say 
categorically, especially to the pensioners in Lebowa, the money 
is lying in the bank. The reason why the pensioners are not 
getting their money is because the civil servants do not pay it 
out to them. The last remark I want to make is, just for an 
example, if President de Klerk would take 2 million rand from 
the parliamentary pension fund and hand it out to the police in 
South Africa, do you not think that would be a banana republic 
decision. 
  [Mashokwe] Ramodike? 
  [Ramodike] Well, I think that could be said by an 
inexperienced minister. It does happen that if you have got a 
crisis in one department, then you could always shift funds from 
one department to the other department and when the next year's 
financial year comes, then that other department would make 
provision on its budget to refund the amount taken from other 
departments. It happens. On several occasions, since the days 
of the late Dr. (Pathudi), and the minister then accepted that 
bona fides and we resolved such problems amicably. What is the 
point of keeping money in the bank when people are dying out 
there in the hospitals when there is a lot of looting, when our 
poor old mothers are suffering, and you just say I cannot 
rearrange my plans, and I don't see any wisdom in such type of 
leadership. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, I want Mr. Dexter to come in to this 
discussion. 
  [Dexter] You want me to comment? Well, obviously I think 
that this is precisely the problem that we have. It seems that 
there's no way the parties involved will be able to resolve the 
problems. That's why the TEC council met today and has actually 
taken a resolution on this matter and we believe that that will 
actually assist in solving the problem. 
  [Mashokwe] We will talk to you about that, but I want Mr. 
Ramodike to explain one thing to me very quickly: Why don't you 
resign if you think that the TEC must take over the governance 
of your area? 
  [Ramodike] Yes, that's very simple. In fact I think first 
and foremost you should know that the Legislative Assembly is 
placed...[pauses] the cabinet, I mean, is placed in power by the 
Legislative Assembly, and in order for the cabinet to be 
dissolved then the state president should be requested by either 
my cabinet or the whole Legislative Assembly to dissolve it. We 
have long requested, after we got fed up -- with all humility -- 
with the takeover by Minister Fourie. We made a submission 
requesting the state president that he should dissolve the 
Lebowa Legislative Assembly.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why don't you resign? Why don't you 
resign? Oupa Gqozo did it without a Legislative Assembly. 
  [Ramodike] I'm not going to resign, Leslie, because I'm 
aware 
that once I resign now together with my cabinet and the other 
members of Legislative Assembly remain in place, then Minister 
Fourie may convene a special session of the Legislative Assembly 
and place his own puppets or surrogates in our position. 
  [Fourie] May I reply to that please? 
  [Mashokwe] Minister, why don't you let Ramodike... 
  [Fourie, interrupting] I want to be given... 
  [Mashokwe, continuing] Wait a minute. Let me ask a question. 
Why don't you let Ramodike run his cabinet? Why do you meddle 
in his affairs? Is it political mileage that you are trying to 
make for the National Party? 
  [Fourie] I've got to meddle in his affairs because they 
made a total mess of the financial administration. They haven't 
got money left. I want to give a guarantee tonight to Mr. 
Ramodike. I will not use the act to appoint anybody else into 
the position if he resigns. I will support him if he resigns, 
and we ask the TEC to appoint co-administrators to administer 
that territory from now until the election. I give him that 
guarantee then he must just resign so then we can get order back 
into that place. 
  [Ramodike] Well my response to that, Mr. Minister, is that 
you have been a stumbling block towards my way of resignation 
all the time. Set an example because you are the first 
stumbling block in terms of this monster called apartheid, then 
once you resign, let me give also a guarantee -- resign tomorrow 
and I will follow suit. 
  [Fourie] I must resign for what? I challenge Mr. Ramodike to 
appoint any commission, to appoint the TEC -- I am prepared to 
appear before the TEC on every single decision and 
administration that we have taken, and if anybody can fault me I 
will resign. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Fourie, I made mention earlier on of the fact 
that you are making political mileage out of this -- it's almost 
like saying the Nats [National Party members] are the good boys. 
They are coming to sort out the mess. Would you care to comment 
on that? 
  [Fourie] You see Leslie we happen to be the government in 
South Africa, and there is an act in terms of which the 
self-governing territories are operated, and the act says quite 
deliberately: If in the opinion of the state president, any 
decisions are taken in a self-governing territory that places an 
unfair burden on the taxpayer of South Africa, or there is not 
proper administration, we've got the right to go in there and to 
rectify things. So if I wanted to act why didn't I act against 
Samuel Khumalo of Gazankulu, or Mr. Zitha in Kangwane, or Mr. 
James Mahlangu from Kwandebele. They...[pauses] at least I've 
got a good relationship with them, but when we tried to help Mr. 
Ramodike ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] So you don't have a good 
relationship with Mr. Ramodike? 
  [Fourie] No, no. When we tried to help him he didn't want to 
give his cooperation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, you are laughing there. 
  [Ramodike] Yes, well if the reason for taking over the 
administration really is because he doesn't have good 
relationships with him [as heard], I wanted to remind Mr. 
Minister, with all humility, that it is common cause that 
politicians should at times cross political swords, and for that 
matter we should not make enemies. 
  [Mashokwe] Tell me, are you being singled out because of 
your 
connections with the ANC, do you think? 
  [Ramodike] Repeat that. 
  [Mashokwe] Do you think the government is singling you out 
because of your connections with the ANC? 
  [Ramodike] Yes, well I've got evidence. For an example, 
Minister Fourie held secret meetings in (Leisdorp), Harmony 
Plot, (Mokhetse), (Leisitele), where he attacked on me and the 
African National Congress. 
  [Mashokwe] What's wrong with that. He's a politician. You 
are a politician. 
  [Ramodike] I'm a politician, and I could not begrudge him 
for 
that. I mean, the people -- confidentially, from (Sikororo) 
area, (Mujaje) -- into the bushes, because they were afraid to 
face us as ANC -- in the (Sikororo) area, (Mujaje), and up to 
now I mean, we are still making a call ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK, let him respond to that 
quickly. 
I want to bring in Philip Dexter here. Let him come in. 
Respond quickly to that. 
  [Fourie] Can I just make a remark in lighter vain. Mr. 
Ramodike at one stage challenged me to oppose him as the 
governor of the north. I am now the number one on the National 
Party list, and he is somewhere number 78 on the ANC list. I am 
not worried about him. I am campaigning in the northern 
Transvaal yes, and I am holding meetings all over, right through 
Lebowa, and not Mr. Ramodike or anybody will stop me from that. 
  [Mashokwe] The political section of this debate is over. 
Let's go over to the TEC. The people out there are in need of 
services. Are you going to step in? 
  [Dexter] Well, absolutely. The decision of the TEC today was 
that it's become -- well, due to the crisis -- it's become clear 
that something would have to be done and the TEC has decided 
that the management committee should take immediate steps to 
ensure that there is an effective administration in Lebowa. 
  [Mashokwe] What does that mean? 
  [Dexter] Well, I think that that gives the management 
committee the right to look into the matter and make a decision 
as to what part they would follow. That could include the 
appointment of administrators. 
  [Mashokwe] What are you saying to us? Are you going to 
appoint administrators? 
  [Dexter] Well, as I said, it's the management committee of 
the TEC that will take that decision, but clearly they have been 
empowered to do so by the council itself. But could I just add 
another point? I think that part of the problem that we've 
identified is that there are all these deep-seated grievances in 
the region, you know. And I would submit that one of the things 
that I've certainly learnt myself from watching this dispute is 
that it's very difficult to understand how people could allow a 
crisis like this to continue and not actually do something 
constructive about it. And I think that in that respect, you 
know, that I think we'll have to all accept some kind of 
accountability for that situation. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, your reaction to the TEC's position. 
  [Fourie] I would gladly support the TEC, but 100 percent. I 
must tell you Leslie.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Will you move out? 
  [Fourie] No, what do I move out? I say that if they appoint 
administrators, somebody must do the financial administration. 
I don't think the TEC has got the capabilities to do that. 
They haven't got the staff to do that. But if they appoint two 
administrators and the civil servants go back to work and I'm 
satisfied that the money will be in good hands, I will most 
definitely move out. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, your reaction. 
  [Ramodike] Well, first and foremost, it would be (?wrong) 
for 
the minister to prescribe to the TEC. I've got full confidence 
in the TEC and it has got experts in the Subcouncil on Finance 
and as a matter of fact I have already made a request, that the 
TEC Subcouncil on Finance should take over the financial 
administration in Lebowa, and hamba kahle [goodbye] Mr. Fourie. 
And I will further welcome that the administrators be appointed. 
  [Mashokwe] And you resign? 
  [Ramodike] They should be appointed by the management 
committee.... 
  [Fourie, interrupting] No, he must resign then. 
  [Ramodike] If I've got to resign, I am saying again, Mr. 
Fourie you are equally...you have equally failed in 
administering Lebowa. In fact, you have made things worse. I 
think you should be bold, you should have audacity to quit your 
cabinet, and then I will follow. 
  [Mashokwe] Thank you, Mr. Ramodike, Mr. Fourie, Mr. Dexter. 
Thanks for talking to us.

<F P=106> [By Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] A mere month before the election, the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] has yet to finalise plans to secure 
at least 9,000 polling stations across the country. 
  Security at the polling stations will be looked after by a 
National Security Management Centre (NSMC) falling under the 
IEC. This will co-ordinate a network of Joint Operating Centres 
(JOCs), responsible for securing the stations and keeping an eye 
on the security situation. These in turn will be largely 
staffed by South African Police [SAP] and South African Defence 
Force [SADF] personnel, but will be chaired by civilians 
appointed by the IEC. 
  The only problem with the complicated structure is that 
there 
is no plan to implement it, as details of the massive security 
operation have yet to be worked out. A month before the 
election there is still confusion over a host of technical 
points -- including who will carry the ballot boxes to counting 
points and whether security forces will be positioned within the 
perimeter of polling stations. 
  The final plan is the subject of wrangling between the South 
African Police and the IEC. The SAP has been pushing a plan it 
developed for policing the election late last year, but which 
has come under fire from policing experts as "inadequate". 
  The IEC is trying to work out the necessary improvements 
with 
the SAP. "The commissioners are meeting frequently with the 
police to ensure the safety of the elections and the monitors," 
said Peter Wilson, head of accreditation and logistics for the 
IEC's monitoring directorate. 
  There is also a wrangle about who will command the state 
security forces. The IEC does not have jurisdiction over the 
SAP or the SADF, although they will form the backbone of 
security operations and will have to operate under the banner of 
the commission at the polling stations. The SADF dodged polling 
station duty rather than place its soldiers under the command of 
either the police or the IEC. 
  As with all security issues, the IEC can only make 
recommendations to the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] 
which must take the final political decision on how to order the 
deployment of security forces. This means any plan the IEC 
comes up with is likely to be the subject of time-consuming 
political haggling in the TEC. Sources say the IEC has become 
the TEC's chief source of information about what is happening on 
the ground because the TEC cannot rely on its own intelligence 
sub-council -- which is supposed to be keeping the TEC informed 
about security problems. 
  "The members of the subcouncil are so busy keeping 
information from each other, they cannot get a decent briefing 
together on anything. The TEC has had to rely on the IEC for 
objective information," said a security adviser. Without the 
IEC to tell it where the problems are, the TEC would not be able 
fulfill its main task of ensuring all parties are allowed to 
freely campaign throughout the country. 
  The IEC has been able to feed the TEC with details of 
problems on the ground because it is flooding the country with 
monitors who will watch every step of the election process -- 
from the issue of identity documents to monitoring voting at 
every polling station.

<F P=106> [By political editor Shaun Johnson] </F>
  [Text] The ANC should be the clear winner in the election, 
but it is still wide open as to whether Nelson Mandela's 
organisation can achieve the two-thirds majority it is gunning 
for. This finding emerges from the latest STAR/MMR [Marketing 
and Media Research] survey, reflecting opinions expressed as 
recently as three weeks ago. The survey comes as a follow-up to 
the first phase poll, conducted three months ago, and published 
in THE STAR. 
  There are still 17 percent of people who are undecided 
compared to about 19 percent three months ago. This adds up to 
almost four million voters who could hold the key to a 
two-thirds ANC majority. 
  The "absolute majority" cut-off has emerged clearly as the 
main focus of the campaign -- all research indicates the ANC 
will win the election comfortably, but the question is by how 
much. 
  Against this background the survey suggests that while 
interesting, subtle and important shifts have occurred in the 
intervening period, broad support-levels have not altered 
sufficiently to make dramatic changes -- as in a different 
overall outcome -- likely in the remaining weeks of the 
campaign. But percentages can still shift meaningfully, with 
important political spin-offs for power balances in the 
five-year transition period. 
  The accompanying graph sets out MMR's estimates, within five 
percent ranges--ANC 59-64 percent, NP 16-21 percent, PAC 3-8 
percent, FF 2-7 percent, DP 1-6 percent--of the likely 
performances by the five main political parties contesting next 
month's election. MMR's estimates -- which take into account 
other credible pre-election polls -- suggest the ANC is 
tantalisingly close to the two-thirds breakthrough at this 
stage, but that this remains a possibility rather than a 
probability. For this reason the closing stages of the election 
campaign take on a particular significance. 
  A regrouping National Party [NP] could draw as much as 21 
percent of the vote, indicating that it has no serious 
competitors for second place as the major partner in the new 
government. 
  It is thought unlikely that any other parties will break the 
10 percent barrier, but the estimates show that the Pan 
Africanist Congress [PAC], the Freedom Front [FF] and the 
Democratic Party [DP], all have the chance of achieving and 
surpassing five percent -- which, in terms of the Interim 
Constitution and arrangements for the transitional period would 
catapult them into a coalition Cabinet. 
  The survey's extrapolations show, therefore, that the PAC's 
potential is higher than has been generally thought and the new 
factor, the Freedom Front, is also to be taken seriously. 
  As is explained at the top of this page [see "How the poll 
works" passage below], many factors have been brought to bear by 
MMR in reaching what are "best informed guess" predictions. What 
will happen to the Inkatha Freedom Party's support, for example, 
is unpredictable. 
  MMR calculates the "midpoint of range" election outcome 
predictions are as follows: 

  -  ANC, 62 percent. 
  -  NP, 19 percent. 
  -  PAC, 6 percent. 
  -  FF, 5 percent. 
  -  DP, 4 percent. 

    The new poll points to a five percent loss of support by the 
ANC, with the NP being the main beneficiary. Indian voters in 
particular seem to be shifting, with the trend less marked among 
coloureds and black South Africans. Upper income voters are 
more likely to switch their allegiance to the NP than other 
voters. The ANC's supporters have stood firm, but the 
organisation has some male support. The ANC's appeal to women 
can probably be linked to its strong pro-female campaign, 
including speeches from Mandela. 
  The NP is in a growth phase, attracting an increase of up to 
six percent in its support level. Many whites who said they 
were uncertain three months ago have thrown their lot with 
President de Klerk's party. 
  The DP has remained largely static; it has make moderate 
gains among coloureds; but has lost white and Indian support. 
  The PAC's messages is having some effect in black and 
coloured communities, in the 25 to 34 year-old age group. 
  Before its formal decision to boycott the election, the IFP 
showed a one percent increase in voter support. 
  Separate articles on this page spell out the other detailed 
findings of the survey. 
  In the first survey 19 percent of people said they were 
undecided and 6 percent refused to name their choice. 
<H5>  How the poll works </H5>
  The second phase of The Star-Marketing and Media Research 
(MMR) poll is comparable to the first in terms of the size and 
the methods used. A total of 2,590 people over 18 years old 
were interviewed face-to-face in their homes, in their chosen 
language, by trained Market Research Africa (MRA) interviewers. 
  Areas representative of the whole of South Africa were 
chosen 
and random samples were then taken in these areas. This sample 
is representative of just under 90 percent of voters living in 
cities, towns and larger villages in South Africa. 
  The survey excludes communities of fewer than 500 and, 
therefore, is not representative of the "deep" rural vote. 
  The fieldwork for the second phase was carried out between 
February 9 and March 7, about three months after the first phase. 
  The survey was designed and analysed by MMR, which will be 
happy to answer any queries about the reliability or 
significance of the findings. 
<H5>  But remember this... </H5>
  Although the survey used scientific methods, and interviews 
were carried out by trained people and analysed by unbiased 
experts, factors outside their control could influence the final 
result of the election. 
  Among these are: 

  -  When the first poll was carried out the Freedom Alliance, 
which included the IFP, had not decided definitely on whether or 
not to take part in the election. Since then IFP has refused, 
but the Freedom Front has decided to come in. 
  -  No one can accurately predict the voter turnout -- polls on 
this vary from 60 percent to 90 percent -- or spoilt papers. 
  -  Violence and intimidation. 
  -  Uncertainty in Natal. 
  -  The position of a party on the ballot paper. 
  -  The ability of rural voters to get to polling stations. 
  -  Voter education and party propaganda. 
  -  Coloured and Indian "swing" vote. 
  -  Processing of valid identity documents. 
  -  Survey sample error and the lie factor in answering 
questions. 
  -  Undecided voters. 
  -  Lack of accurate census figures. 
  -  Difficulty in predicting who, or if, those who support the 
IFP, 
CP [Conservative Party], Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], 
etc, will vote for. 
  -  Apathy or uninterest.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Estimate of Election Outcome (Based </F>
on past and present polls from HSRC [Human Sciences Research 
Council], Markinor, MRA [Market Research Africa] and MMR 
[Marketing and Media Research])"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  LOYALTY </H5>
  The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] may not have a huge number 
of supporters, but those who say they will vote for it are 
certainly the most loyal. Of those who were asked if they would 
stand by their choice "no matter what" 97 percent of PAC 
supporters said they would. 
  Worrying for the DP [Democratic Party] must be the result 
which shows that only 59 percent of its supporters are certain 
nothing can change their minds. 
<H5>  CHANGE </H5>
  What would make people who have made up their minds switch 
their vote? 
  Nothing, said 88 percent. 
  If the party did something I strongly disagreed with, say 4 
percent. 
  If another party made promises or policies I strongly agreed 
with, say 4 percent. 
  If someone threatened or intimidated me, say 2 percent. 
  If parents, partner or friends sway me, say 1 percent. 
  A few gave reasons such as if their party withdrew, if 
minority groups were disregarded, and if their party changed its 
policies or broke its promises. 
<H5>  UNCERTAINTY </H5>
  Why are people uncertain about their choice? 
  The two main reasons are uninterest and ignorance. 
  These were the answers by people who are still undecided 
about their choice: I'm not interested in politics or the 
election (25 percent, who were more likely to be coloureds or 
Indians). 
  I don't know what is going on politically (19 percent, 
coloureds, Indians, lower income, over-50s). 
  I like more than one party and can't decide which to vote 
for 
(15 percent, upper income whites). 
  I don't know what each of the parties stands for (12 
percent), and I don't like or trust any of the parties or 
leaders (9 percent). 
  Minor reasons were: I don't know how to vote; I don't know 
where to vote; my vote won't make a difference; promises are not 
being kept; have not decided yet; parties are changing their 
policies and, lots can still happen. 
<H5>  FREEDOM FRONT, 7 PERCENT? </H5>
  General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front (FF), the electoral 
vehicle of conservative whites, is the wild card in next month's 
election. 
  A late entrant to the race, the front's showing is 
unpredictable as fieldwork was conducted before it decided to 
take part in the election. 
  However, if we assume a large proportion of CP [Conservative 
Party] and some white IFP and most Volksfront [National Front] 
supporters will vote for it, the FF could get as much as 7 
percent of the vote. 
  This is not a scientific research prediction but only an 
estimation. 
<H5>  NATAL </H5>
  Natal is the area where those who want a free and fair 
election just do not know what is going to happen. Will most 
people be able to vote? How much violence and intimidation will 
there be? Will voting in all areas be declared valid after the 
election? There are all these doubts, but of those who were 
prepared to name a party 85 percent had no doubt they would 
stick to this party "no matter what happens". 
  Only 54 percent of people polled were prepared to name their 
choice. The remainder were either not sure who to vote for (19 
percent), not prepared to say (15 percent) or said they could 
not or would not vote (12 percent). 
  Of all those polled in Natal, 22 percent said they would 
vote 
for the ANC, 16 percent for the NP [National Party], 12 percent 
for the IFP and 4 percent for "others". The overall result 
could be greatly effected by those who go to the polls and those 
who stay away either because of intimidation and violence or 
because they want to vote for the IFP and no other party. 
<H5>  The main findings: No dramatic shift in the past three months </H5>
<H5>  THE ANC </H5>
  Has shown a 5 percent loss, mainly from Indians who have 
switched to the NP. Another big loss is in the upper-income 
category. 
<H5>  THE NP </H5>
  Is recovering some of the support it lost over the past year 
or so and has grown (about 6 percent) mainly at the expense of 
the ANC. 
<H5>  THE PAC </H5>
  Has shown a 1 percent gain in black and coloured 
communities, 
the 25-35 age group and in the Cape and Free State. 
<H5>  THE FREEDOM FRONT </H5>
  Is difficult to assess as fieldwork was carried out before 
it 
decided to take part in the election and, therefore, there is no 
shift pattern. 
<H5>  THE DP </H5>
  Has remained static with moderate gains among coloureds. Of 
all the main parties it showed the least loyal supporters.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- As much as 38 per cent 
of the country's electorate could stay away from this month's 
poll, the Human Sciences Research Council said. SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported on Friday [1 
April] that contributing factors could include the high level of 
violence, uncertainty of confidentiality in voting booths, and a 
low literacy rate.

  [Text] According to an opinion poll by the Institute for a 
Multiparty Democracy, the estimated support for the ANC in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region has shrunk by 
almost 8 percent in the past three months, while the National 
Party [NP] has gained almost 3 percent. The poll shows that the 
ANC can now bargain on 38 percent support and the NP on 18. 
Sixteen percent of respondents have refused to say for whom 
they plan to vote, and 8 percent have not yet made up their 
minds. The poll has revealed that the situation in at least 
half of the black residential areas is such that voters are 
unable to make political choices without interference. A survey 
released in Natal yesterday showed that the ANC enjoyed 37 
percent support, Inkatha 18 percent, and the NP 14.

  [Text] A new snap poll commissioned by the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] reveals little support among 
whites for the right-wing and a volkstaat [homeland]. The poll 
shows that 60 percent of whites are opposed to the idea of a 
volkstaat, and that 68 percent of right-wing supporters are 
opposed to withdrawing from the election. The poll shows that 
the Freedom Front leader, General Constand Viljoen, is far more 
popular among right-wingers than the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and 
AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche. 
However, State President F.W. de Klerk, remains the most 
popular leader among whites with 72 percent support.

<F P=106> [Report by Johannes Ngcobo] </F>
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday declared 
East Rand townships "no-go" areas for the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC) and said commission head Judge Johann Kriegler 
and commissioner Oscar Dhlomo were not welcomed anywhere near 
hostels in the area. 
  The IEC yesterday called off a planned Operation Access 
initiative in the East Rand, saying recent Inkatha activity was 
cause for concern and that hostels there could prove too 
volatile for political canvassing. 
  Police said the bodies of two unidentified men who had been 
beaten and stabbed to death were found at the Denver hostel, 
eastern Johannesburg, yesterday. 
  IEC spokesman Ghadija Vallie said the Operation Access 
process, in which formal public debates were conducted between 
party representatives under the auspices of the commission, had 
been started by the IEC to enable parties to put their cases in 
areas where canvassing would not be possible. 
  Inkatha Thokoza leader Abraham Mzizi and local indunas 
[assistants to a chief] said the IEC had not consulted them 
about a planned Operation Access visit. 
  Mzizi said the insinuation that hostels could prove volatile 
was an insult to Inkatha's leadership in the East Rand. "The 
IEC thinks indunas are inferior," said Mzizi. 
  Inkatha West Rand chairman Humphrey Ndlovu said Dhlomo -- a 
former Inkatha general secretary -- and Kriegler were not 
welcome near hostels on the East Rand. 
  "We would repeat what happened to Kriegler when he was at 
Ulundi in Natal. Inkatha members are angry, and Zulus in 
particular. If Kriegler wants to be hurt he should defy my 
warning," said Ndlovu. 
  Inkatha members would grant the IEC access when Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini was granted sovereignty and called upon his 
subjects to listen to the commission. 
  IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the IEC's visit to Ulundi 
had managed to set up a working group between the commission and 
the KwaZulu government. 
  He said the IEC message had always been that people were 
free 
to vote for parties of their choice and free not to vote in the 
elections. "This freedom requires tolerance and acceptance that 
one person's democratic freedom can be exercised only if he or 
she allows everyone to the same," said Cronje. 
  The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region deputy 
secretary-general Obed Bapela said his organisation was 
disappointed that the IEC had cancelled yesterday's Operation 
Access initiative. 
  He said Inkatha was in the minority in East Rand townships 
and the party's leadership knew that some hostel residents 
wanted to vote on April 27. It was unfortunate that hostel 
residents would be prevented from voting. 
  "I call upon the IEC and Kriegler to start using the powers 
given to them to ensure people on the East Rand go to the voting 
stations on April 27," said Bapela. 
  Wits [Witwatersrand]-Vaal peace secretariat director Rupert 
Lorimer said Ndlovu had been through a difficult period because 
of the shootings in central Johannesburg on Monday. He hoped 
cool heads would prevail.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Black Empowerment in Mining Sector -- "For decades, not to 
say centuries, blacks have been barred by economic and 
historical forces from ownership of South Africa's top layers of 
business: the mining and industrial sectors," begins the 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 March in a page-14 
editorial. "Today, both justice and economic realism demand 
that this imbalance should be urgently redressed." 
Consequently, Anglo-American's "plan to unbundle its 40 
percent-controlled JCI [Johannesburg Consolidated Investments], 
enabling black investors to acquire significant blocks of 
shares, is a highly promising move," while "a black-run mining 
house would be the cherry on the top." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Financing the ANC's RDP -- The Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 31 March in a page-14 editorial warns that "it is 
becoming increasingly clear that South Africa's post-election 
government will be fiscally challenged. The TEC's [Transitional 
Executive Council] promise to the IMF that budget deficits will 
be contained by curtailing expenditure rather than by increasing 
taxes will be a major constraint, if it is kept," because the 
BUSINESS DAY questions whether major reductions in current 
spending are "really feasible at a time of affirmative action 
and creation of new government structures? In time, 
rationalisation opportunities will present themselves, but it is 
wishful thinking to count on too high an 'apartheid dividend'." 
"It is difficult to see where the savings can be made in the 
short run to finance the massive investment promised in the RDP 
[Reconstruction and Development Program]." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  `Battle of Johannesburg' -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN in English in its 31 March to 7 April edition in a 
page-16 editorial states that the Zulus who died in front of the 
ANC's Shell House in Johannesburg were not "lambs." "They had 
come looking for trouble. Nevertheless, it was impossible to 
escape the impression that they had been led to the slaughter, 
victims in an increasingly cynical political game of 
oneupmanship. They were men who had become more valuable to 
their leaders in death than they could ever have been in life." 
Concluding, the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN blames the police for 
the "complete failure of public order." "This was first and 
foremost their disaster," states the editorial. 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Johannesburg Violence -- "In a country of endemic 
violence...we suppose we should not be shocked by what happened 
in central Johannesburg yesterday, but we are," begins the 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 29 March in a page-6 
editorial. THE CITIZEN is "deeply shocked" because of "snipers 
who killed marchers like they were shooting at a flock of 
birds." Inspite of this "horror" now is "not a time for 
overreaction, not a time for retaliation, not a time for 
reprisals. It is a time for calm. A time for an awareness of 
what violence is doing to this country." In conclusion the 
paper states that it has "over and over again" said "let there 
be peace." 
  Meeting of National Leaders -- "We are pleased that Zulu 
King 
Goodwill Zwelithini will attend a meeting with State President 
de Klerk, KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC 
president, Mr Nelson Mandela, next week to discuss steps to 
contain violence and to seek solutions to Zulu aspirations" 
because "the ugly events in downtown Johannesburg have sinister 
implications not just for the election but for peace itself," 
begins an editorial on page 6 of the 30 March edition of THE 
CITIZEN. Regarding the declaration of a state of emergency in 
Natal/kwaZulu, THE CITIZEN states that "since the ANC, which 
dominates the TEC, has condemned previous states of emergency, 
it is hypocritical to support one now." "The solution does not 
lie in introducing Draconian measures, but in reaching an 
understanding on the holding of the election without 
interference, intimidation or violence." Later the paper states 
"we expect the government to act firmly but evenhandedly," and 
to stop "treating the Zulu issues as an aberration on the part 
of the king and Chief Buthelezi. The Zulu demands are 
deep-rooted and cannot simply be ignored." In a final demand 
THE CITIZEN states that "the ANC must stop protesting its 
innocence about the events in downtown Johannesburg."

  [Text] There is still no progress at the peace talks in 
Lusaka, Zambia, because the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] has not yet presented its stand 
with regard to the document on the Conclusion of the Electoral 
Process. Pedro Manuel reports: 
  [Manuel] Good evening! The UNITA negotiating team has not 
yet presented its final stand to the mediators and observers. 
This has further reduced the chances of progress at the peace 
talks. According to a source, UNITA promised to present its 
stand today but failed to do so, alleging that it has not yet 
concluded the examination of the government document. 
  In turn, the government negotiating team has already 
presented to the mediators its final stand on the Conclusion of 
the Electoral Process. 
  This afternoon the parties did not work for all intents and 
purposes. The mediators and observers reportedly used the 
afternoon to meet alone in search of a solution that will force 
both the government and UNITA to resolve the issue of the 
country's governance. A source assured us that although they 
are working on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process, the 
mediators and observers are also carrying out work on another 
two points still to be concluded: the UN Angola Verification 
Mission mandate and national reconciliation. 
  According to the source, what is most important for the 
mediators at the present moment is to resolve the problem of 
national reconciliation. Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye only 
decided to move forward in order to give time to the leaderships 
of the negotiating teams to reexamine the issue of national 
reconciliation. 
  The source also revealed that the date for the second round 
of presidential elections will be set later. The date will be 
chosen in a situation of complete peace. Now, what is important 
for the mediators is to obtain from the negotiating teams 
assurances that the second round of presidential elections will 
take place. 
  Although there are four consecutive holidays because of 
Easter, the mediators said the parties will work tomorrow, most 
probably in a hotel, because the Mulungushi Conference Center 
will only be reopened on 5 April. 
  According to another source, during this long weekend there 
will only be work if UNITA presents its final stand on the 
Conclusion of the Electoral Process.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] yesterday complained to the UN Security Council 
that Luanda is hindering talks on national reconciliation in 
Lusaka. In a letter delivered by Ambassador Jardo Muecalia, 
UNITA's Representative in Washington, who left for New York 
yesterday, UNITA says that the Luanda government was adopting a 
line aimed at prolonging the talks so that they will fail. The 
same document states that Luanda is interested in the UN 
Security Council imposing further sanctions on UNITA, this being 
the main cause of its intransigence and arrogance in Lusaka.

<F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk by announcer Lester </F>
Venter in Cape Town on the "Agenda" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Venter] Mr. President, I think the first thing that 
everyone wants to know is what impact will your holding of an 
election in Natal with the declaration of the state of emergency 
in that area have? 
  [De Klerk] It should definitely increase the chances of 
having a free and fair election. Maybe that is putting it too 
negatively. It will ensure that a free and fair election can be 
held because there will be a high level of manpower in the 
security forces. It will, with the additional powers that they 
have, make it easier for them to maintain law and order and to 
safeguard the interest also of the voters. 
  The regulations have been drawn, specifically so as to 
ensure 
that this state of emergency will be compatible with an 
election, and therefore the right of parties to hold meetings is 
an inherent right. They will be asked, however, to give notice 
so that proper protection can be arranged. Marches will still 
be allowed, although permission will have to be obtained. But 
free political activity has been written into the regulations 
(?just) subject to reasonable procedures. Those regulations 
have also been cleared with the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] so that the parties participating are basically happy 
with the arrangements made to ensure free political activity. 
  On election day itself, it should definitely be to the 
advantage of an incident-free, or as incident free as possible. 
  [Venter] What that means, Mr. President, is that you 
envisaged the state of emergency lasting up until and including 
the days of the elections.? 
  [De Klerk] I really do -- if a wonder happens and everything 
calms down to such an extent that we can lift it sooner, we will 
look at that. In terms of the law, a state of emergency is 
imposed automatically for a year, but there is authority to lift 
it sooner. We would want to lift it as soon as circumstances 
permit. 
  [Venter] Well, then many people say that an election under 
state of emergency are mutually exclusive, that you can't really 
have a free and fair election under a state of emergency? 
  [De Klerk] Well, we've had quite a few in the past in South 
Africa. Although circumstances are now different... 
  [Venter, interrupting] ... people the negative impression in 
fact? 
  [De Klerk] Yes, but as I say, to the satisfaction also of 
the 
parties represented in the subcouncil, and of the 
representatives of the management committee of the TEC, special 
provision has been made to ensure compatibility between a free 
and fair election with free political activity on the one hand, 
and on the other hand simultaneously, the additional powers to 
the security forces to ensure that the public order is properly 
maintained, and that the public is effectively protected, 
because those are the main grounds for the decision. 
  [Venter] Have you acquired to your satisfaction the 
agreement, if not in fact the full agreement, of all the parties 
in the TEC to the implementation of the state of emergency? 
  [De Klerk] I don't think that all the parties will agree, 
but 
sufficient agreement in terms of the rules and procedures of the 
TEC has been obtained. They have said yes to the regulations. 
I didn't need their approval for the declaration. That was my 
decision, and my decision alone. 
  And I would like to emphasize because I see some people are 
making political propaganda and say that we have declared this 
because of collusion between the government and the ANC, because 
the ANC actually wanted it, it is simply not true. I started 
mentioning the fact that we will, as a government, look into 
this option more than a week ago during a visit to Natal. In 
reply to your question, we've constantly monitored the 
situation. I've been briefed yesterday by our intelligence and 
security forces. I've been briefed this morning, and the 
decision to do so was taken at 09:30 by me. And I thereafter 
phoned Mr. Mandela, and thereafter phoned Chief Minister 
Buthelezi because I wanted them to be fully advised. 
  [Venter] Now, mentioning Chief Minister Buthelezi, of course 
you have substantive agreement, (?which) is sufficient to allow 
you to carry on with the state of emergency and its 
implementation from within the TEC. But now, of course, Mr. 
Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] are not part of 
the TEC. Now can you tell us something about his reaction when 
you told him about it, and what do you expect? 
  [De Klerk] I don't want to say what he said to me. He has 
made a statement since then, and from that also it is clear that 
he is critical of the decision, that he feels that his people on 
the ground will react negatively toward it. I hope that he will 
give a positive lead because this is not directed at the kwaZulu 
government. It is not directed at the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party]. This decision does not have a political motive. This 
decision is based on the necessity to stabilize kwaZulu-Natal, 
to bring the deaths to an end, to ensure that the climate is 
created where free and fair elections can take place, and to 
prevent further deaths and to protect people and their property. 
  [Venter] Of the troops that will be deployed, are you 
intending that troops of the National Peace-Keeping Force should 
be deployed? 
  [De Klerk] That is not being considered at the moment. All 
the planning is that it will be SADF [South African Defense 
Force] troops, and the deployment will take place in an 
incremental basis during the next week. It is also as a result 
of a general call-up which was made some time ago with the view 
to have a sufficiently high level of manpower for the whole of 
South Africa in the weeks running up to the elections, the 
election days itself, and the few days after the election. So 
it will be SADF. 
  [Venter] So if you deploy troops, Mr. President, are you 
prepared to see them used in order to reach the objective that's 
set, mainly the holding of a free election? 
  [De Klerk] Yes, obviously. That is not the main objective. 
It will flow from that. The main objective is to ensure that 
there will be public order, and to protect the public. But yes, 
it will flow from that, and yes we will use them, but they will 
act within the law and subject to the regulations. A state of 
emergency means that you give some additional powers that are 
not ordinarily available in terms of the ordinary laws of the 
day with regard to detention, with regards to the control of 
movement of people, with regard to searching, etc., etc. That 
will be clear from the regulations when they are shortly 
published. 
  [Venter] But now talking about the ordinary law, the 
ordinary 
law for example contains provisions against the carrying of 
dangerous weapons in public, and many people will say that you 
have not adequately seen to the implementation of those laws up 
until now. 
  [De Klerk] The regulations once again will contain 
provisions 
with regard to the public display of all dangerous weapons. It 
will also be sensitive inasmuch as one can under these 
circumstances toward recognizing traditions and cultures. What 
has been seen in the past in that regard is often a situation 
with too little policemen or security force people available, 
and with a large crowd of 10 or 20 thousand people, it is simply 
impossible to implement the law under such circumstances. I 
have seen public rallies, even also of the ANC, with traditional 
weapons visible, but mostly one saw that at IFP gatherings. And 
there were circumstances where it was actually practically 
impossible to implement the law because of too low a number of 
security force people. Once again implementation will become 
easier with a higher level of manpower. 
  [Venter] Is that in fact the intention to implement the 
prohibition of the carrying of dangerous weapons? 
  [De Klerk] It will be part of the regulation subject to 
certain exceptions. 
  [Venter] Let's talk a little more about the reaction by Mr. 
Buthelezi. Now, it has been said that in the implementation of 
the state of emergency, the troops and the added security forces 
that will be sent in will work in conjunction with the kwaZulu 
Police. Now Mr. Buthelezi is the minister of police in kwaZulu, 
and he has spoken against the implementation. Doesn't that 
immediately create a difficulty in having two security forces? 
  [De Klerk] Hopefully not. I don't regard that as a political 
issue. The security forces, the commanders on the ground will 
interact with the kwaZulu Police in kwaZulu Police areas. Chief 
Minister Buthelezi is also basically against the election. But 
as head of government, he committed himself to full cooperation, 
to ensure -- and also making available facilities and everything 
-- to ensure that an election can take place, and to ensure that 
those who want to vote will be able to vote. I therefore don't 
think that it is necessarily a problem. If, of course, there is 
a lack of cooperation, then that will create a situation which 
will have to be managed, and you can be assured it will then be 
managed. 
  [Venter] Could you give us some idea of what could be 
involved if that cooperation isn't forthcoming, and I ask that 
question because it is a distinct likelihood at this stage, 
given what Mr. Buthelezi... 
  [De Klerk, interrupting] I think it is speculative. He did 
not say that we would not have the cooperation of the kwaZulu. 
I think it is speculative at this stage. The legal position of 
the armed forces operating under the state of emergency is that 
they will have the powers that they have throughout 
kwaZulu-Natal, and that is their task. They will use those 
powers with discretion to ensure that the goals of the 
declaration -- namely, to maintain public order and to ensure 
the safety of the public -- will be served. 
  [Venter] Do you expect, when you have your meeting next week 
with Mr. Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr. Mandela and 
yourself -- when you walk into that meeting, it's going to be a 
very much tenser and more difficult meeting than it would 
otherwise have been without the state of emergency. 
  [De Klerk] It might be, but I think the meeting becomes 
even more important. But may I just emphasize: I didn't declare 
the state of emergency out of the blue. The declaration of the 
state of emergency is actually a judicial finding--that there is 
a state of emergency on the ground and that is then recognized 
and certified. You don't create a state of emergency by 
declaring it. You certify that there is a state of emergency, 
and that is the case. 
  And the focus of the debate shouldn't be on the declaration 
of a state of emergency. The focus of the debate should be why 
was it necessary for me to sign such a declaration. But why? 
Because of the breakdown of law and order, because of the 
failure to really effectively contain it, because of the many 
deaths, because of the threats and the war cries. And what my 
intelligence is telling me, what is from more than one side in 
the pipeline. That is what must be addressed in the debate; not 
the formality of having declared it. I'm sending troops into 
kwaZulu-Natal because it is my duty, because that is the primary 
duty of a government, and kwaZulu is part of the Republic of 
South Africa. It is not an invasion, as Chief Minister 
Buthelezi has said. It is part of the Republic of South Africa, 
and my duty in that regard as head of the government extends 
over the whole of South Africa. 
  [Venter] Just briefly, Mr. President, as we close off. The 
last state of emergency in South Africa drew a very negative 
international reaction. Now have you had an opportunity to 
canvas what the likely international response to this is going 
to be? 
  [De Klerk] No, but I have reason to believe -- I didn't 
canvas it, I didn't ask anybody's permission. I didn't first 
clear it before I took the decision. But I have reason to 
believe from discussions with an ambassador here and a 
delegation form overseas there that it will be welcomed, that 
the distinction between this state of emergency and previous 
ones will be understood. In the past under a state of 
emergency, we acted against parties because they were parties. 
We acted against the ANC because it was the ANC, and because it 
was a banned organization. This time we are acting to defend 
the right of all parties to operate freely. This time we are 
acting to ensure that people who want to interfere with the 
rights of all South Africans through violence and through 
creation of unrest, interfere against their basic human rights, 
to act against them. It is a totally different situation, and I 
have no hesitation to say that I will have the moral support of 
the international community. 
  [Venter] Mr. President, thank you very much. 
  [De Klerk] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by ANC President Nelson Mandela on 31 </F>
March; place not given] 
  [Text] The declaration of a blanket state of emergency in 
Natal and kwaZulu was done in consultation with the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] as a last resort measure to prevent the 
further loss of life in that troubled part of our country. 
  I have personally been deeply saddened by the countless 
numbers of ordinary people who have lost their lives in the 
violence that has racked South Africa. Innocent blood has been 
shed, and all South Africans, regardless of their political 
affiliation, race, ethnic or language group, have been 
diminished by it. These are losses to South Africa as a nation 
which all of us should mourn. 
  Today's action, has one purpose and should have one purpose 
only: that is to stem the tide of violence, which if left 
unaddressed will engulf us all. It is criminal that the 
citizens of this country - who ever they are - should be reduced 
to pawns in the political games of ambitious leaders. People 
deserve the right to be able to lead their lives without fear of 
violence. They deserve the right to express themselves without 
threats of death being visited upon them. They deserve the 
right to choose for themselves whether or not they will vote in 
the coming elections. 
  These are the issues at stake in Natal and kwaZulu and no 
political rhetoric must be allowed to obscure that. The state 
of emergency enjoys my wholehearted support and I appeal to all 
South Africans to abstain from any actions that will impair its 
purpose. 
  I shall expect all ANC organised structures in Natal and 
kwaZulu to so conduct themselves as to assist the attainment of 
the objectives I have underscored. ANC members and supporters 
must take the lead in ensuring that the climate of violence and 
bloodletting in that province abates so that our people in Natal 
and kwaZulu can freely exercise their rights to participate in 
the elections, if they so choose, or to stay away from the polls 
if that is their decision. 
  I am making an appeal to all of us to remain calm. There are 
those who fear democracy and are bent on creating the maximum 
amount of chaos through acts of violence and mayhem. We have 
already seen them in action in a number of cities. 
  We must all affirm our commitment to peaceful, free and fair 
elections by protecting every citizens right to participate 
without let or hindrance from any quarter. As leaders of 
political opinion we must all affirm our commitment to peaceful, 
free and fair elections by asserting and protecting the right of 
every political party, however objectionable we might consider 
its views, to express itself and canvass support without fear of 
intimidation from any quarter. 
  That it has been necessary to have recourse to such measures 
in Natal is highly regrettable. As a movement we have used 
every ounce of the talent we have to try to find another way. 
We remain committed to seeking a dialogue with King Zwelithini 
Kabhekuzulu. We shall continue bilateral discussions with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party. I am ready to proceed with the propose 
summit among President de Klerk, Chief Minister Buthelezi, the 
Zulu monarch and myself. 
  A number of measures become necessary if this limited state 
of emergency is to achieve its stated purpose. I expect that 
the security forces will with all deliberate speed take steps to 
contain the perpetrators of violence and death. All those 
persons whom investigations have implicated in hit squad 
activities should be apprehended, charged and brought before the 
law courts as swiftly as possible. All members of the security 
forces who have similarly been implicated should be disarmed and 
suspended from duty forthwith. This necessarily must include 
the Caprivi Strip trainees who have since been absorbed in 
various structures of the kwaZulu administration. I expect, too 
that the training camps established with the express aim of 
destabilising that province will be shut down immediately. 
  While these drastic measures have become necessary to save 
life, we must not allow the draconian powers which the state has 
assumed to become yet one more obstacle on our road to 
democracy. The mini-state of emergency has been proclaimed so 
that the elections may proceed in an atmosphere of calm. Its 
provisions must not be subversive of free political activity nor 
must they be employed to harass and intimidate the political 
opponents of the kwaZulu administration. Police units, such as 
the Internal Stability Division, that have demonstrably lost the 
confidence of a wide section of the African community should not 
be deployed in Natal. 
  The postponement of the April 27th elections is not an 
option 
that our country can afford. I reaffirm the ANC's stand that we 
shall not contemplate such a postponement. The steps taken 
today should enable us to proceed to the agreed election date in 
a context of relative peace. 
  All of us must assume responsibility for seeing this 
transition through to the end. The ANC will play its part. We 
invite other political parties to do likewise. We cannot and 
shall not allow the spoilers and the wreckers to succeed. To 
succumb to their threats and bullying tactics now would be a 
fatal error. 
  The ANC remains extremely confident about our country's 
future. This is a truly historic moment of opportunity and 
challenge. In years to come we will look back on these days as 
but an interlude in a period of great optimism. The future we 
can build as a nation beckons us. Let us all work together and 
we shall surely build a better life for all South Africans.

  [Text] Ndjamena, 4 Apr (AFP) -- The Presidency of the 
Republic of Chad today announced that a "final communique 
spelling out the modalities" for Libya's withdrawal from the 
Aozou Strip "is expected to be signed today in Tripoli." The 
withdrawal, which begins on 15 April, will be carried out under 
the supervision of a commission made up of 25 Libyan officers, 
25 Chadian officers, and five officers selected by the United 
Nations, the Presidency explained in the communique carried on 
national radio. The official turnover of the Aozou Strip to 
Chad would take place on 1 May, the Presidency further stated, 
making sure it used the conditional tense throughout its 
release. A Chadian delegation led by Interior Minister 
Abderamane Izzo and Defense Minister Mahamat Mamadou have been 
holding discussions in Tripoli since 1 April with a Libyan 
delegation led by Arab Unity Minister Jum'ah al-Mahdi al-Fazzani 
and General Security Minister Muhammad Hijazi.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The majority party in the 
Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] on 1 April 
officially endorsed the new Transitional Constitutional Act, 
which was adopted on 30 March by the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. The act is being 
contested by the USOR's hardliners. 
  In a press communique, the Union for the Republic and 
Democracy [URD], which contains most of the USOR's major 
political parties, with the exception of Etienne Tshisekedi's 
party, said it has noted that "from a legal standpoint, both 
Article 76 and the Transitional Constitutional Act were 
correctly adopted by the HCR-PT plenary session, which wsa 
officially held in line with the normal procedure." 
  The Article 76 being referred to here deals with the 
provisions for appointing a prime minister. It does not make 
any allusion or reference to former Premier Etienne Tshisekedi 
or to the Sovereign National Conference, which had appointed him 
to that post. 
  The drafting of the article led to the departure of most of 
the USOR hardliners from the HCR-PT. The USOR hardliners 
maintain that Tshisekedi is Zaire's "legal prime minister." 
  The URD communique was initialed by key figures from the 
main 
opposition parties, notably Gerard Kamanda of the Nationalist 
Common Front, Edouard Mambu of the Union of Independent 
Democrats, and Raphael Mwanba of the Social Christian Democratic 
Party, which, with the exclusion of Tshisekedi's Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress, form the backbone of the Sacred 
Union. 
  It was also signed by Pierre Lumbi, a representative from 
the 
civil society (peasant solidarity) and foreign minister in 
Tshisekedi's government.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 3 April (SUNA) -- Ethiopian President 
Meles Zenawi has confirmed the strength of Sudanese-Ethiopian 
relations and reiterated his country's interest in making every 
effort to successfully bring about peace in Sudan. He stated 
this yesterday when meeting with 'Uthman al-Sa'id, Sudan's 
ambassador to Ethiopia, who gave him a message from the 
president of the Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, 
on relations between the two countries. He said the security 
and stability of Sudan concerned all neighboring states, above 
all Ethiopia, with which Sudan shares its longest border. 
  In a statement to SUNA in Addis Ababa, the ambassador said 
that the message came within the framework of continuous 
consultations and exchange of ideas between the two countries. 
The message also covered the recent Intergovernmental Authority 
on Drought and Development [IGADD] meeting in Nairobi relating 
to the establishment of peace in Sudan as well as the 
preparations under way for the second round of talks, set for 16 
May. The message also dealt with the situation in the region 
and progress in the implementation of joint agreements which 
were recently concluded in Khartoum. 
  The Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia said Ethiopian President 
Meles Zenawi described the Nairobi peace talks as positive and 
commended the Sudanese Government's stand and its interest in 
attaining a peaceful solution. 
  His excellency the ambassador also denied a BBC report that 
relations between Sudan and Ethiopia had cooled down to some 
extent. He said this was not the first time its correspondent 
had worked to undermine the two countries' close relations. The 
correspondent had always attacked the Ethiopian Government too, 
and had covered Ethiopian news in a negative and non-objective 
manner. The ambassador stressed that relations between the two 
countries were too strong to be affected by such media campaigns.

  [Text] Mogadishu, April 4 (AFP) -- An American Doctor 
working for the International Committee of the Red Cross 
abducted by Somali gunmen last last week has been released, 
relief agency sources said Monday [4 April]. 
  Alfred Petters, 39, a cholera expert, was kidnapped on 
Thursday as he drove from Benaadir Hospital, south of Mogadishu, 
to the Red Cross headquarters a short distance away. No further 
details were immediately available about circumstances of the 
release. 
  Fifteen gunmen in three cars described by an eyewitness "as 
very aggressive" ambushed the Red Cross cars, ordered everyone 
out, shot dead a Somali guard and drove away with Petters. 
  Petters, who was on his second tour of duty in this 
war-ravaged east African country was the first Red Cross worker 
to be kidnapped in Somalia.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The war of words in Lusaka has revealed the identity 
of those involved in the negotiations. So far, one thought the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] were the negotiators. It now seems that the 
United States is against the government. 
  The mediator is shuttling between the sides, but to no 
avail. 
The Portuguese observer does not shuttle, preferring to 
indignantly witness the fight between the giants. The Russians 
brought in a breath of fresh air by proposing that the 
negotiations be restricted. The Americans, however, turned down 
the idea. Since then, nobody has questioned the time being 
taken. 
  While UNITA (?takes) its time to form an opinion about the 
outcome of the negotiations, the U.S. delegation to the talks 
this morning met with the government team headed by Carlos 
Feijo, secretary of the Ministers Council. This is the third 
time a meeting of this nature has taken place since the start of 
the talks on 5 January 1994. Some observers believe such 
meetings have been like a tug of war, but others say this 
morning's meeting was an indication of flexibility on the part 
of the government delegation. 
  No further details are available, except that Blondin Beye 
is 
scheduled to embark on a tour in search of international 
political backing and that his news blackout continues. In 
addition to seriously jeopardizing the role of the reporters, 
the blackout has led to differences of opinion between the 
negotiators. Opponents of Beye's news blackout say it is 
senseless to keep the ongoing of round of talks under wraps, so 
much so that Angola no longer features in the list of the 
world's main hotbeds of tension. In fact, the world public is 
today better informed about recent African disputes, such as in 
South Africa and Burundi, though those have not yet reached 
one-third the catastrophic proportions that Angola has been 
experiencing for over 20 years now. But that is Lusaka--where a 
news blackout is in force, although nobody knows why.

  [Excerpt] Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], has promised that 
there can be no impasse at the Lusaka talks. The UNITA chairman 
and supreme commander of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola reiterated UNITA's commitment to searching for peace. 
  Addressing about 2,000 Angolans and foreigners at the 
wedding 
reception for Engineer Adalberto da Costa Jr., UNITA 
representative in Portugal, on 30 March, Dr. Savimbi said [words 
indistinct] he promised that UNITA will do its best to bring 
about peace. He added: We will all have peace and will organize 
our economy in a stable atmosphere. He said he was willing to 
make every concession, provided that it is not humiliating, 
because men (?want to live) in freedom and dignity. He noted 
that there can be no freedom without dignity. 
  The UNITA leader thanked humanitarian organizations for 
their 
aid in food, medicine, and clothing [words indistinct], and he 
invited officials of several relief organizations to feel at 
home. [passage omitted]

negotiations can be avoided. President of the Republic Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos has sent an envoy to the Zambian capital, 
possibly with new proposals for National Union for the Total

  [Text] The mediators at the peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, 
are expected to present a new document to bring the government 
and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] closer together. Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos 
Feijo is in the Zambian capital, as President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos' envoy, carrying new proposals from the Angolan 
Government. In Lusaka, the president's envoy has already met 
with mediator Alioune Blondin Beye and the government team. 
Observers say the new proposals could signify government's 
flexibility in the face of UNITA's demands. Nothing is known yet 
however about the contents of this new government proposal. UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali will meet with his special 
representative in Geneva on 7 April, and the meeting is expected 
to center on the new document with which the mediators hope to 
bring the government and UNITA closer together.

  [Text] The possible delay of regional voting in the 
violence-riddled kwaZulu region could be on the agenda when 
President de Klerk meets with Mr. Nelson Mandela, Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, and King Goodwill Zwelithini on Friday. SAPA reports 
that a government spokesman said all possibilities would be 
considered in view of the importance of the millions of Zulus in 
the region being involved in the post-electoral decision-making 
process. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus rejected the possibility, 
saying there would be no distinction between regional and 
national elections.

majesty the king, and myself, do not come up with something that 
can make it possible for us to participate in the elections even 
at this late hour, then of course we'll continue to play the 
role of being opposed to the status quo. [end recording] 
  Dr. Buthelezi said though the declaration of a state of 
emergency in kwaZulu-Natal was not conducive to good 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler by </F>
correspondent Steven Lange on the "Radio Today" program; place 
and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer Jeremy Dawes] The countdown to the 
elections has begun in earnest, but still a major cause of 
concern is kwaZulu-Natal. With violence still unacceptably high 
and the fact that a state of emergency is in operation, what are 
the chances of a free and fair election there? On the line to 
Steven Lange, we have the chairman of the IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission], Judge Johann Kriegler: 
  [Begin recording] [Kriegler] A very short while that it's 
been in operation, but the prospects are that it would improve 
the outlook for a substantially free and fair election in 
kwaZulu-Natal. To the extent that it enhances stability, law and 
order, free movement of people without fear of harm, it can only 
be beneficial. 
  [Lange] Is the state of emergency having the desired effect, 
from what you've heard so far? 
  [Kriegler] So far, certainly yes. But it's early days yet, I 
repeat. 
  [Lange] Have you had cooperation from the kwaZulu 
administration? 
  [Kriegler] No, not the requisite degree. We've had a very 
close look at the extent to which we could mount an election 
with the cooperation that has been offered. The subcommittee is 
due to report to us tomorrow. But the last report that I had 
from our side was that it didn't look as if we were really 
getting a great deal of cooperation. 
  [Lange] In what respect is it failing? 
  [Kriegler] Well, it's failing in the will. The word is 
there, but the will is not there. You know, our officials can 
work for you provided they're available, provided they're not 
engaged in essential services, provided they realize that in the 
political climate they're taking an enormous risk -- that kind 
of ostensible support, but really not. 
  [Lange] Do you sense a sort of passive resistance? 
  [Kriegler] Yes. There used to be a term in the old British 
army called dumb insolence -- you know, you go along, but you do 
so with such obvious ill-will and unwillingness that in fact 
it's tantamount to disobeying. 
  [Lange] Over the weekend Chief Minister Buthelezi suggested 
that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] might still participate in 
the elections. Is this logistically possible? 
  [Kriegler] On the ballot paper as it is, on the planning of 
the election, the legislation as it stands, it's not possible. 
The only feasible means that I can imagine -- but then, I don't 
have all of the options necessarily in mind -- the only feasible 
option is for them to join in, in collaboration with a party 
already in the ballot paper, otherwise there's no way that I can 
see them joining in this particular election on the 26th, 27th, 
28th. 
  [Lange] So the IFP will not appear on the ballot paper? 
  [Kriegler] No, it simply can't. We've been printing those 
ballot papers for weeks and weeks now, and we cut it very short 
as it is, to allow late participants an opportunity to come in, 
and there's no way that we can start reprinting and have ballot 
papers available for the predetermined election days with other 
runners on. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] </F>
  [Excerpts] Chilling intelligence reports predicting a sharp 
increase in KwaZulu/Natal violence fatalities as the election 
approached finally persuaded President de Klerk to declare a 
state of emergency in the region, according to Government 
sources. The reports -- some of which are understood to have 
referred to a tenfold increase in deaths prior to the election 
-- came shortly after the Independent Electoral Commission's 
blunt and decisive call for political intervention in the 
crisis-torn province. 
  One source described the intelligence reports presented to 
De 
Klerk as "hair-raising" and said they had indicated a massive 
potential for increased violence as the election approached. 
The sources declined to comment on whether specific campaigns 
of violence were planned. They believed gravest threat to 
stability lay in already volatile areas on the ground where 
violence was expected to break out and spread to other, more 
stables areas. 
  Troops began to arrive in KwaZulu/Natal yesterday as 
security 
chiefs gathered to plot how the tough state of emergency 
regulations proclaimed by De Klerk would be applied on the 
ground. 
  There was no immediate indication from the KwaZulu 
government 
or the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] on whether there would be 
active resistance to the imposition of the emergency 
regulations, but it was clear that there was considerable 
unhappiness in Ulundi. 
  It is evident from the proclamation in the Government 
Gazette 
that steps have been taken to directly inhibit the continued 
training of Inkatha "self-defence units" and the carrying of 
"cultural" weapons in public. Both steps were met with anger by 
senior Inkatha members yesterday. The organisation's national 
chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose said: "No doubt, training people 
out of the country in Uganda is exonerated. But the small, 
little training at Umfolozi must be punished." It is estimated 
that some 5,000 self-defence unit members have undergone limited 
training at a camp in Umfolozi. 
  It has been widely speculated that the imposition of the 
regulations might scupper the summit that would have bought King 
Goodwill Zwelithini, IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela and De Klerk together in the next few 
days. 
  However, SAPA reports that Buthelezi said yesterday the 
meeting appeared to be on, and he held out some hope for it -- 
otherwise I wouldn't be going". But he added that if it went 
ahead it would be in a "sour atmosphere" because of De Klerk's 
"appalling and shameful" declaration of the state of emergency 
and Mandela's remarks that the KwaZulu Police (KZP) would be 
confined to barracks. 
  The emergency regulations contain no reference to the KZP 
being confined to barracks. 
  Senior KZP officers were present at day-long discussions 
with 
the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] in Durban yesterday to plans security operations 
under the state of emergency. 
  One of three additional companies of SADF troops that are to 
be deployed in KwaZulu/Natal arrived in the region yesterday. 
The remaining two companies of between 100 and 150 members each 
are expected today or tomorrow. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Shaun Johnson and Esther Waugh] </F>
  [Text] A memorandum bluntly stating that free elections in 
KwaZulu/Natal were impossible without direct political 
intervention was the primary catalyst for the eventual 
declaration of this week's state of emergency there. The 
confidential three-page memorandum, with 15 pages of supporting 
documentation, was presented by Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler to President F W de Klerk 
and ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on March 24. An 
edited version was released to the media the same day. The 
state of emergency was declared on March 31. 
  Appended to the original document -- a copy of which has 
been 
seen by WEEKEND STAR -- was a nine-point memorandum from the IEC 
to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, setting out the guarantees the 
IEC wanted from Ulundi regarding co-operation in allowing the 
election to take place in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  It was the reaction to this memorandum by Buthelezi, King 
Goodwill Zwelithini, several KwaZulu Ministers and members of 
the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly that led the IEC to give its 
own ultimatum to De Klerk the following day. 
<H5>  List of Demands </H5>
  In the memorandum to Buthelezi dated March 23, the IEC 
proposed that in order to "execute its mandate of conducting an 
election within the territory of KwaZulu", it requested that 
Buthelezi "cause instructions to be given forthwith that": 

  -  The KwaZulu Department of Education make schools available 
for use as polling stations. 
  -  Principals give telephone technicians access to their 
schools. 
  -  KwaZulu government buildings, including tribal authority and 
magistrates' offices, be made available for election purposes. 
  -  The KwaZulu Department of the Interior cooperate with the IEC 
on matters including the issuing of identity documents and 
seconding staff. 
  -  The KwaZulu Department of Justice make facilities available 
for 
the IEC Adjudication Secretariat. 
  -  Amakhosi [chiefs] and other KwaZulu officials and authorities 
assist the IEC and observer groups. 
  -  The KwaZulu departments of Health and of Pensions and Welfare 
co-operate with the IEC in facilitating special votes. 
  -  The KwaZulu Police provide security for IEC staff and secure 
the election process, as well as participate fully with other 
groups in security planning. 

<H5>    `Operation Access' </H5>
  The IEC memorandum to Buthelezi also proposed the 
establishment of a working committee, and informed the KwaZulu 
authorities that the IEC intended to launch "Operation Access" 
in the region soon. 
  The response of the KwaZulu authorities to the IEC 
delegation 
was subsequently described in the IEC's document to De Klerk and 
Mandela as "stage-managed to humiliate the IEC". Describing the 
atmosphere as "confrontational and aggressive," the IEC 
concluded that the requisite assurances sought from the KwaZulu 
authorities had not been given. 
  In the final paragraph of the confidential memorandum 
presented to De Klerk and Mandela, the IEC stated: "In order 
for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in KwaZulu/Natal, 
the requisite degree of stability and co-operation has to be 
established in the province as a matter of urgency. 
  "How that is to be achieved is not for the IEC to determine. 
Nor will it be in a position to advise whether substantially 
free and fair elections can be conducted in KwaZulu/Natal unless 
and until such stability and co-operation have been attained."

Thursday [31 March]. Nine of the latest victims were killed in 
Port Shepstone and another four died at Eshowe. The others were 
killed in kwaMashu, Umlazi, Verulam, and the lower Umfolozi 
area. About 1,200 SADF [South African Defense Force] troops 
have been deployed in kwaZulu-Natal over the past few days.

  [Text] Durban April 3 SAPA -- Nine African National 
Congress supporters were massacred in their kraal outside Port 
Shepstone, Natal South Coast, on Saturday [2 April] and an 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporter was allegedly shot dead by 
ANC supporters while praying in Durban's Bhambayi shack 
settlement on Sunday, police said. And police on Sunday said at 
least another eight people were murdered in Natal since the 
declaration of a state of emergency in the province three days 
ago, bringing to almost 40 the number killed since then. 
  SA Police spokesman Lt-Col Marzedt de Beer said Ethel 
Danisa, 
25, was shot dead in war-torn Bhambayi while she and others were 
praying. Another woman was injured. Col de Beer said gunmen 
armed with AK-47 rifles fired at the group from an ANC 
stronghold in Bhambayi. The women were praying beside a cross, 
recently erected there by clerics after a peace march. 
  In Port Shepstone at about 8.30pm on Saturday the kraal of 
the Mzelemu family in the Nkulu ward was approached by men who 
identified themselves as policemen and forced their way into the 
homestead. One family member fled the area immediately. Nine 
others, including a five-month-old baby and two other children 
were chopped and stabbed to death. 
  The dead were identified as: Gugu Mzelemu, 5 months; Ciyisa 
Mzelemu, 70; Philisile Mzelemu, 3; Hlengiwe Mzelemu, 13; 
Phindile Mzelemu, 8; Phumele Mzelemu, 18; Prudence Mzelemu, 13; 
Lindiwe Mzelemu, 16; and Doris Mzelemu, 46. Milfred Mzelemu was 
wounded in the attack. 
  "The above are all ANC supporters," Col de Beer said. 
  Meanwhile in Inanda, near Bhambayi, three people were 
murdered on Saturday night. Police also reported a rape and 
armed robbery in the Amatikwe area where two of the killings 
occurred. 
  Aaron Sibisi, 49, an unidentified 15-year-old girl and an 
unidentified 26-year-old man were shot dead in separate 
incidents. 
  In Eshowe, Natal North Coast, five people were killed since 
Thursday. 
  On Friday in the Gezinsila township three people were shot 
dead. The body of Bonginkosi Biyela, 42, was found on a footpath 
in the area. Lindi Nxumalo, 18; and Nkosinathi Mkhize, 18, were 
shot dead while sleeping. 
  In the nearby Umhlalazi area, Bongokwakhe Mthimkulu, 23, was 
fatally shot on Friday. 
  In Gezinsila on Thursday night Solomuzi Mthambu, 38, was 
shot 
dead by unknown killers when he went to close the gate to his 
yard.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- The kwaZulu Police [KZP] will 
continue its normal policing duties and its members are not 
confined to barracks under the emergency regulations, but there 
are "uncertainties" about the KZP which have to be clarified by 
the minister of justice and of defence. This emerged at an SA 
Defence Force [SADF] media briefing in Durban on Saturday [2 
April] addressed by Natal Command spokesman Col Frans Verfuss. 
  "At this stage, they're (KZP) not restricted by the 
proclamation. 
  "No where does (the proclamation) say they're confined to 
barracks," he said. 
  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela said last 
week that the KZP would be confined to barracks and would carry 
out only those duties permitted by the SADF. 
  Col Verfuss said there were "uncertainties" regarding the 
emergency regulations which had been referred to Justice and 
Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee for "clarification". There was a 
"bit of a grey area" in terms of the KZP's role, he said, 
without elaborating, adding that the KZP would in the interim 
continue its normal policing operations. 
  Col Verfuss explained that KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy 
During 
had been at Friday's planning session with the SA Police [SAP] 
and SADF where the emergency proclamation had been studied. 
  Col Verfuss refused to elaborate on the "uncertainties" in 
the regulations saying these would be made clear by senior 
police and army officers next week. 
  The KZP is not specifically referred to in the regulations 
which define "security force" as the SAP or the SADF, or "any 
part" of these forces. 
  On kwaZulu self defence training camps, Col verfuss said the 
regulations made it clear that any illegal military or 
para-military training was prohibited. He, however, was unable 
to say whether action would be taken against the kwaZulu 
training camps in Northern Natal and said this would be made 
clear next week. 
  Meanwhile, he revealed that three SADF companies, comprising 
up to 500 soldiers, had been deployed on the South Coast, 
Midlands and Northern Natal regions over the weekend. These 
included two parabat [paratrooper batalion] companies and one 
infantry company. 
  In total, about 1,200 soldiers were now deployed in 
Natal/kwaZulu and their daily operations would depend on the 
"situation on the ground". "These are troops deployed in an 
internal stability/unrest type role and this doesn't include 
forces we can call up." 
  He said citizen forces had, however, been called up for the 
election period from April 15 to May 15. 
  Col Verfuss said current flashpoints around Durban were 
Bhambayi, kwaMashu and Ndwedwe. He said troops had been deployed 
in these areas and around Margate on the South Coast. 
  Questioned why he thought violence had recently subsided in 
the Natal/kwaZulu region, Col Verfuss said there were "many 
reasons". "Probably, the major reason is there's a bit of a 
'wait and see' attitude." 
  He said next week's planned summit between State President F 
W de Klerk, Mr Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have quelled 
fighting. People were also probably waiting to see how the 
emergency regulations would affect them. 
  On illegal weapons in Natal, Col Verfuss said AK-47 assault 
rifles were "flowing in on a regular basis", while there were 
unconfirmed reports of RPG-7 rocket launchers being smuggled 
into the region. 
  He said licensed weapons would not be confiscated under the 
regulations, but there was a ban on carrying other weapons, 
including "traditional" ones.

  [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] 
Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] his 
force was not affected by the emergency regulations and would 
continue its normal policing duties in cooperation with the SA 
Police [SAP] and Defence Force [SADF]. He described African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela's remark that the KZP 
would be confined to barracks under the regulations as 
"reckless". 
  "I don't know where on earth he gets that idea. We're an 
independent statutory force with our own police act." 
  Earlier, SADF Natal spokesman Col Frans Verfuss said 
clarification was being sought on the precise role of the KZP 
under the emergency regulations. He added, however, that the KZP 
would continue its duties in the interim. 
  In a telephonic interview later, Gen During said: "What 
clarification is necessary? There is nothing to clarify. They've 
left the kwaZulu Police completely out. 
  "In other words, the regulations don't affect them. 
  "As far as I'm concerned, we continue as in the past and 
according to the laws of the country." 
  He said the KZP would continue cooperating with the SAP and 
SADF "as in the past". "There will be operations we'll also plan 
together." 
  He said there were a few issues within the emergency 
regulations that required clarity, but as far as he was 
concerned, "the role of the KZP is not affected at all". 
  He said confining the KZP to barracks would be doing the 
community a disservice.

<F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- Eskom [Electricity 
Supply Commission] has cancelled a sales transaction involving 
1,000 semi-automatic weapons with an arms dealer who claimed 
they were for export but, the company believes, were actually 
intended for the kwaZulu Police. An Eskom statement said chief 
executive Mr Allen Morgan on Friday [1 April] informed the 
Goldstone Commission and the South African Police [SAP] about 
the matter. "The deal was cancelled before delivery took place, 
when it was discovered that the dealer intended to sell the 
weapons within South Africa," said the statement. 
  The transaction, it said, was to have taken place in terms 
of 
an export permit issued by the SAP according to the arms and 
ammunition act. "The transaction was cancelled by senior 
management when it became clear that the weapons were destined 
for a customer within South Africa, in this case the kwaZulu 
Police." 
  The statement said the weapons were originally acquired by 
Eskom in terms of its obligations under the national key points 
act. "The act has subsequently been relaxed and surplus weapons 
were being disposed of," he said. Eskom added that an internal 
investigation would be conducted into the circumstances 
surrounding the transaction, in collaboration with the Goldstone 
Commission and the SAP. Assisting them will be forensic 
auditors from the firm, KPMG-Aitken and Peat. 
  "Members of the Eskom protection services involved in the 
transaction have requested to be relieved of their duties 
pending further investigations." 
  Eskom added that an audit at its main armoury at Megawatt 
Park showed all automatic rifles had been accounted for, and 
that country-wide audits were continuing.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- A permit issued to an 
arms dealer to export 1,000 LM4 weapons to kwaZulu lapsed after 
Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] cancelled the sales 
transaction with the dealer, police said on Friday night. 
Spokesman Maj Burger van Rooyen said Eskom informed the South 
African Police on Friday [1 April] that the weapons were its 
property, and that it had cancelled the transaction. 
  The arms dealer, he said, had applied for an export permit, 
required for a sale to kwaZulu on Thursday last week, and made 
it known the arms were destined for the homeland. With his 
application was an official letter from the kwaZulu commissioner 
of police, giving authority for the receipt of the weapons. 
  Maj van Rooyen said there was no legal stipulation for such 
a 
permit to be refused. 
  Meanwhile kwaZulu Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said 
the issue had "a couple of loose ends". He told sapa a press 
statement would be released shortly. He had no further comment.

Friday pending the Goldstone Commission investigation into the 
cancelled arms sale that could have seen 1,000 automatic weapons 
sold to kwaZulu, have been relieved of their duties for their 
"serious error of judgement". 
  Eskom spokesman Kevin Morgan said on Friday night the 
service's departmental manager and the employee who negotiated 
the arms deal had, however, acted "above board". 
  He would not identify the arms dealer other than saying he 
was from Johannesburg.

<F P=106> [Report by Greg Arda] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] 
Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] there 
was nothing "clandestine" or "sinister" about his force's 
attempt to buy guns from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission]. 
He described the deal as an "ordinary, above-board business 
transaction" and rejected any insinuation it was clandestine. 
  In a statement, Gen During accused Eskom of backing out of 
the deal because it was afraid of dealing with "political 
adversaries of the African National Congress". "We find it 
ludicrous that any publicity should be given to this matter, and 
particular, that any sinister connotations should be ascribed 
to, what is considered by us, as an ordinary above-board 
business transaction." 
  Gen During said at no stage did the KZP conceal its identity 
as the buyer. The KZP and the "negotiators for both parties were 
at all times fully aware of all the circumstances surrounding 
the transaction". 
  Eskom on Friday said it had suspended two employees pending 
a 
Goldstone Commission investigation into the deal which could 
have seen 1,000 weapons sold to the KZP before the transaction 
was cancelled by the company. 
  Gen During said Eskom should have been fully aware that the 
arms were destined for the KZP because a signed letter from 
himself accompanied a required export permit for the weapons to 
a self-governing territory. The deal was done through an 
"authorised weapons dealer", he said. 
  Eskom had been paid for the arms, and although the KZP 
considered the company's cancellation of the deal as a 
contractual breach, the force had accepted this, Gen During said. 
  "Representations made by senior Eskom officials to the 
effect 
that they regarded the matter as a politically sensitive one," 
Gen During said, had led the KZP agreeing to calling off the 
deal. 
  "I'm compelled to conclude that Eskom management fear some 
form of reprisal arising from these events and in a pathetic 
attempt at exonerating themselves from any blame daring to deal 
with the political adversaries of the ANC, they have now 
requested the Goldstone Commission to investigate the matter. 
  "I believe that the Goldstone Commission has far more 
important issues at hand with which they should be presently 
occupied, other than to sensationalise a matter like this," Gen 
During said.

<F P=106> [By Newton Kanhema and Janine Lazarus] </F>
  [Text] Snipers "planted in strategic points to shoot at the 
Zulu crowds" triggered Monday's [28 March] bloodshed in central 
Johannesburg, police said this week. "Our information indicates 
that the first shots were fired at the Zulus. There is no 
evidence that the marchers started shooting," said Witwatersrand 
police liaison officer Colonel David Bruce. 
  Initial investigations showed that there were people placed 
in buildings who were assigned to shoot at the crowd, he said. 
"It appears that certain elements were planted to cause 
trouble. They didn't care who they hit. They fired 
indiscriminately." 
  More information which pointed to planned acts of terrorism 
was passed on to WEEKEND STAR this week. 
  Defence analyst Helmoed Romer-Heitman said witnesses had 
seen 
a number of men entering buildings around the Library Gardens 
with bags that could have concealed weapons. "Several people 
who work in the area and who get to their offices early in the 
morning apparently saw men they had not seen before going into 
buildings along the route and around the Library Gardens, 
carrying bags," he said. 
  The second piece of information concerned at least 10 bullet 
holes blasted through thick steel girders in the Library 
Gardens. They seemed to indicate that weaponry of a much heavier 
calibre than would normally be available to ordinary citizens 
was used. 
  Most of the shots, which left holes a centimetre in 
diameter, 
went right through the 14 mm-thick steel structures supporting a 
mezzanine floor above shops overlooking Library Gardens. 
  Forensics expert Dr David Klatzow, "who was commissioned by 
WEEKEND STAR to examine the holes, concluded that the bullets 
were almost exclusively full metal jacket. This means they 
would have been fully encased in metal, enabling them to pierce 
most armour plating. According to Klatzow, they could have been 
fired from either R-1 or AK-47 rifles. Klatzow said the shots 
were probably fired from the direction of the public toilets 
overlooking Library Gardens. 
  Commenting on the SAP's [South African Police] use of R-1s, 
Bruce said it was useless to equip policemen with handguns in an 
attack like that on Monday. "You've got people shooting up 
there and you've got a .32 -- what use is that?" 
  Asked what the police had done to prepare for the Zulu 
march, 
he said they had been prepared for a meeting, not a march. "We 
have no doubt that the investigation will reveal that the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC will have to shoulder some 
blame for Monday's crisis," said Bruce. 
  "What we find most pertubing is that there are people who 
have said they saw what happened, but they don't want to come to 
the police. 
  "We must have eyewitness accounts so that we can ensure this 
doesn't happen again -- and we can't do it alone."

  [Text] The Goldstone Commission says it has substantial 
further information on some of the matters contained in its 
interim report, which implicated top police generals in 
so-called third force violence. Lieutenant General Basie Smit, 
Major General Krappies Engelbrecht, and Lieutenant General Johan 
le Roux were suspended last week after the Goldstone Commission 
report implicated them in gun smuggling and violence. 
  Mr. Justice Goldstone said in a statement that this 
information and any other information received would be handed 
to the international team investigating the allegations. 
  The Johannesburg newspaper, THE STAR, reported earlier that 
the commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, said 
that unless he received additional information on the so-called 
third force from the Goldstone Commission, he would order the 
suspended generals to resume duty tomorrow. Gen. van der Merwe 
said the attorney general was assessing the prima facie value of 
the evidence, and he expected to hear from him soon.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has taken 
its first decisive step to rein in rogue elements in the South 
African Police [SAP] during the election period with the 
establishment this week of a National Police Inspectorate [NPI]. 
At a meeting in Pretoria the NPI was quietly brought into being 
with the specific task of keeping a check on the various 
policing agencies -- including the SAP -- during the election 
period. 
  Its first task will be to concentrate on the "flashpoints" 
of 
Natal and the Wits/Vaal [Witwatersrand/Transvaal] area. The 
first of the 13 members of the NPI -- five civilians, four SAP 
officers and four officers from homeland police forces -- 
started moving into their new offices on the 10th floor of the 
Saambou Building on Tuesday [29 March]. The existence of the NPI 
will only be announced next week, but the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN has 
been leaked details of the secret launch meeting this week in 
the Saambou Building in Pretoria. Chairing the meeting was 
Peter Gastrow, who heads the TEC's law and order subcouncil. 
  It was revealed at the meeting that a national complaints 
mechanism is to be established in 10 days' time for civilians to 
protest about unacceptable police conduct. 
  The NPI will take over many of the functions of police 
officers who are presently operating under the National Peace 
Accord. 
  Described by our source as the eyes and ears of the TEC, the 
NPI will identify rogue elements in the SAP and the homeland 
police forces, and report to the TEC on possible crises in the 
police, logistical plans, problems of low morale and tension 
between different policing agencies. It will also see to it 
that decisions by the TEC's law and order subcouncil are 
implemented. All police plans regarding control of the election 
process will be reported to the subcouncil by the NPI's nine 
regional inspectorates. 
  All steps taken by police will be measured against a 
national 
police plan, which was recently accepted by the law and order 
subcouncil. With less than four weeks to go before the 
elections, short cuts were taken in appointing a director for 
the NPI. It was decided at Tuesday's meeting that Fanie Bosch, 
project leader of co-operative education and programme 
development at the Technikon RSA in Florida, Transvaal, will be 
the executive director. Bosch, who attended the meeting as an 
observer, was instructed by the law and order subcouncil to 
convene the first meeting of the NPI before the existence of the 
new body was made public. Because of the time limit, those 
attending the meeting were told to squeeze the TEC for as good a 
financial package as possible. 
  Gastrow is believed to have promised that the subcouncil 
would support its demands, because at this late stage it hoped 
not to readvertise for the position. 
  Members of the NPI were told that although they should not 
impose themselves, they should be part of decision-making 
meetings of the various police forces all over the country. 
Decision-making meetings outside the security forces -- such as 
city council meetings -- should also be attended. 
  The NPI will be expected to evaluate unrest regulations and 
report to the subcouncil on what steps to take. Members of the 
NPI were warned to be specifically on the lookout for tensions 
between homeland police and the SAP, and to report any problems 
to the subcouncil. 
  Joint operational centres (JOCs) will shortly be established 
in many parts of the country for the various policing agencies, 
and the NPI members will have an important role in seeing that 
everything is in place for the elections. 
  Gastrow warned during the meeting that the politicians and 
experts had done very little forward thinking on the key issue 
of the integration of South Africa's various police forces, and 
that serious problems could be expected. 
  A police general at the meeting also warned that there were 
morale problems within the police, and that there was a need to 
motivate the police to play a constructive role before the 
election and under a new government. 
  During the meeting Bosch made it clear that he was not 
prepared only to criticise the police, as the inspectorate was 
designed to help the police as much as the TEC. 
  Gastrow said his subcouncil also wanted to help the police 
to 
do their job properly, in part by identifying weaknesses in the 
police force.

  [Text] An officer in the Defense Force says it is nonsense 
for officials in the Defense Force and the Police to say they 
have no knowledge of the maneuvers of Operation Sunrise and the 
SACP [South African Communist Party] document in which the 
procedure for a takeover has been detailed. 
  He said the document was distributed among various Defense 
Force elements, police and government officials at the end of 
last year. According to his evidence, the document had also been 
discussed in Parliament, and it is therefore unimaginable that 
the authenticity or existence of the document should in the 
least be doubted. He said if the document was false, then it is 
coincidental that the communist onslaught spelled out in the 
document should coincide with recent events throughout the 
country, and with those that have already taken place.

  [Text] Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper has accused the 
National Party [NP] and the African National Congress [ANC] of 
perpetrating an enormous fraud in claiming that the elections 
will be free and fair, and that there will be peace once a new 
government is in place. 
  The newspaper dismissed claims by State President F. W. de 
Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela that the constitution 
they had drafted was a federal one, saying scores of foreign 
experts had pointed out that it was not. The newspaper made an 
urgent call for the election to be postponed. 
  The SUNDAY TIMES also accused the ANC of being responsible 
for the massacre of Zulu demonstrators during their march in 
Johannesburg last week. The paper said its reporters had proved 
that most of the shooting had come from identifiable ANC 
supporters. 
  The newspaper also said it had been arrogant of ANC 
President 
Nelson Mandela to deny detectives access to Shell House to 
gather evidence.

<F P=106> [By Mike Robertson] </F>
  [Text] Dramatic shifts in voter support in South Africa's 
three most important provinces have been highlighted by an 
update of the SUNDAY TIMES Pulse of the People poll. With just 
over three weeks to election day, the result of the poll among 
850 respondents in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging], Western Cape and Natal provinces show a leaching 
of support away from the ANC, a growth in National Party [NP] 
support and a surprising surge in DP [Democratic Party] fortunes. 
  Although the ANC's dominance in the PWV and Natal is 
unchallenged, the new poll indicates that the NP is poised to 
take the Western Cape. The province is poised to be one of two 
-- the Northern Cape is the other -- that will not fall to the 
ANC. 
  But the poll, a revisit of the national survey commissioned 
by the SUNDAY TIMES in November, also shows a considerable 
number of white voters are undecided. This means voting 
patterns could change even further in the next three crucial 
weeks. The main points of the poll are: 
  The ANC has shed support in the PWV, Western Cape and Natal, 
but is still comfortably ahead in voter-rich PWV. Because of 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] election boycott, it is likely 
to win majority support in KwaZulu/Natal. In the Western Cape 
it has been overtaken by the NP. 
  The NP has made gains in all three provinces, and in 
particular the Western Cape where coloured voters are flocking 
to its side. At the time the poll was taken it had lured much 
support away from right-wing parties. 
  The Democratic Party is winning back the support of white 
voters who had ditched it in favour of Inkatha and the NP. In 
the provincial elections in the PWV and Western Province, the DP 
is benefiting from the introduction of the two-ballot system and 
could qualify for provincial cabinet seats in both provinces. 
  Support among blacks in Natal for Inkatha has grown since 
the 
Zulu king entered the political arena. But is has lost 
virtually all its support among non-blacks. 
  Had the IFP contested the election, sufficient numbers of 
voters who intend voting DP and NP in national elections would 
have switched support to the IFP in the provincial poll. By now 
the IFP would have been running a neck-and-neck race with the 
ANC for control of the province. 
  Support for the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and CP 
[Conservative Party] was negligible in the three provinces at 
the time of the poll. This support had gone to the NP, but 
Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front could win it back in the 
remaining weeks. The poll was conducted before the Freedom Front 
registered and therefore does not reflect support for it. 
  Large numbers of white people (35 percent in the Western 
Cape 
and 15 percent in the PWV) who were willing and able to vote did 
not know how they would cast their ballots or refused to say. A 
high proportion of these would-be voters are likely to be 
right-wing supporters. 
  In an election dominated by personalities, the influence of 
the two major players -- President F W de Klerk and ANC leader 
Nelson Mandela -- is clearly visible in the poll. 
  The NP's lead in the Western Cape can be attributed to Mr de 
Klerk's enormous popularity among coloureds -- a third said they 
were "totally in favour" of him. Only 4.2 percent of coloured 
voters said this of Mr Mandela. 
  That the ANC is still in with a chance in the Western Cape 
can be attributed to the fact that a massive 78 percent of black 
voters said they were totally in favour of him. Only two 
percent of blacks said this of Mr de Klerk. 
  Voters are equally polarised over election issues. Whites 
regard violence, jobs, education, securing a free enterprise 
economy and attracting foreign investment as the most important 
issues. More than half of them believe the NP has the best 
policies to tackle these issues. 
  In the PWV the number of whites who think the DP has the 
best 
policies to tackle these issues has doubled to about 25 percent 
since November, explaining the steep rise in its support in the 
province. 
  Almost 50 percent of black voters said creating jobs was the 
most important election issue. This was followed, in order, by 
houses, ending discrimination, education and violence. About 
half of black voters in Natal, more than 80 percent in the PWV 
and more than 90 percent in the Western Cape think the ANC has 
the best policies to address these issues. 
  Coloured voters in the Western Cape list their chief 
concerns 
as violence, jobs, education, housing and inflation. More than 
half think the NP has the best policies to tackle these issues. 
  In KwaZulu/Natal the Pulse of the People poll showed that 
overall support for the ANC dropped from 40.9 percent in 
November to 32.3 percent in March. 
  But because of the IFP boycott and the likelihood of a low 
poll in the province, Markinor estimated the ANC would get the 
backing of 50.4 percent of the province's willing and able 
voters in the national elections on April 27-28. 
  About 20 percent of IFP supporters said they would ignore 
boycott calls and cast their ballots. Some 70 percent of these 
voters said they would support the NP in the national elections, 
pushing its support up to 29.9 percent (21 percent) in the 
province. 
  The DP has clawed back the support of whites and Indians 
from 
the IFP to increase its support among voters to 6.4 percent (3.5 
percent). In the provincial elections it will also get the 
backing of some Inkatha supporters, pushing its support even 
higher to eight percent. 
  In the PWV, support for the ANC is down from 65.9 percent in 
November to 56.5 percent in March. However, the main reason for 
this is that the boundaries of the PWV province have been 
altered since the first Pulse of the People poll in November. 
As a result there are almost two million fewer black voters in 
the province than there were in November. 
  Among black voters in the province, support for the ANC has 
remained constant at about 80 percent. About 10 percent of 
black voters have not decided how they will vote and five 
percent will not vote. 
  It is among white voters in the PWV that there has been the 
greatest swing. About 7.3 percent of whites said in November 
that they would back Inkatha and 20 percent the CP/AVF. Now 
support among whites for these parties is down to four percent 
and 3.2 percent respectively. 
  The biggest beneficiary has been the NP which has seen its 
support among whites grow from 40.7 percent to 55.7 percent for 
the national elections. As a result its support is up to 23.2 
percent. 
  The DP also gained, with its support among whites 
increasing from 9.3 percent to 19.7 percent. Its support among 
willing and able voters in the province for the national 
election is up to 9.4 percent (3.2 percent). Neither party has 
made inroads among blacks. 
  Nor can either party be entirely confident it will retain 
this support. The DP is under threat from the Federal Party 
while General Viljoen's Freedom Front is likely to draw support 
of conservative whites away from the NP. 
  A high proportion of white voters -- some 16 percent -- said 
they did not know how they would vote. 
  In the Western Cape the ANC's support had dropped from 42.9 
percent in November to 31.3 percent in March. It has lost half 
its white supporters and about a quarter of its coloured 
supporters. However, it retains the backing of about 90 percent 
of black voters. 
  The NP has lost some of its white supporters to the DP but 
has made major inroads among coloureds. More than 55 percent of 
coloureds now say they will vote NP, giving the party the 
support of 37.8 percent of willing and able voters. 
  Given this voting trend, it can be confident of getting the 
backing of significant numbers of the 35.6 percent of white 
voters and 20.9 percent of coloured voters who said they had not 
made up their minds or refused to tell pollsters how they would 
vote. 
  The marginal improvement in support for the DP in the 
national elections in the Western Cape (from 5.7 percent to 6.7 
percent) is the result of the party making a modest inroad into 
the coloured community. 
  However, in the Western Cape provincial elections, Markinor 
estimates that the DP will win 10.5 percent support -- enough to 
qualify it for membership of the provincial cabinet. 
  The reason for this increase is that people who said they 
would vote for the NP in the national elections indicated they 
would support the DP at a provincial level. 
  Although support for right-wing parties was down from 2.6 
percent to 1.7 percent, General Viljoen stands to gain the votes 
of some undecided white voters.

    [Editorial Report] The following two-page advertisement 
appears on 3 April in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English 
on pages 16 and 17 and in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in 
English on pages 22 and 23. A one-page version of the ad also 
appears in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April, on page 
11. The text of the Afrikaans ad is the same as that used in 
the English. 
<H5>  "`Now is the time to make the change' </H5>
  "Imagine that you live in a country which has a strong 
government, with a plan that works -- a plan which attracts 
money to the country, so that factories and businesses are built 
-- so that everyone can get a job. 
  "Imagine proper housing for all the families; hospitals for 
the sick; and decent schools for the children -- so that 
everyone might make the most of the gifts God gave them. 
  "Imagine all this in a truly free society. A society where 
all people are equal in their right to vote, in their freedom to 
state their views, and to worship how they wish. 
  "Imagine all the inequalities, which have damaged the life 
of 
the nation, disappearing as it becomes a truly colour-blind 
country. 
  "A country which truly values the brightest and best of its 
people, whatever their colour. A country which recognises that 
ALL of its people have a contribution to make. 
  "A country in which law and order are respected. Where the 
people feel safe in their homes, in their cars, on the streets, 
in the fields -- and on their way to work. 
  "Imagine South Africa as that country. 
  "South Africa the peaceful! 
  "South Africa the prosperous! 
  "Africa's -- if not the world's -- first genuinely 
successful 
multi-racial society. How we would be envied. 
  "That is THE PRIZE. It is not a dream. It is perfectly 
possible. It is there for us to grasp. All of us. 
  "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE. 
  "For too long we have, as a nation, been obsessed with the 
things that divide us. Now it is time to think instead of all 
the things we have in common. 
  "We all desire the strong economy, the jobs which come from 
it, the houses, hospitals and schools. And above all, peace. 
  "In other words, we all want The Prize. 
  "In the last five years we have begun our long journey 
towards it. 
  "Of course there have been bumps; but however rough the 
ride, 
it is to the credit of ALL our people that we have come so far, 
so fast, with so much willingness to understand each other and 
so much desire to build our new nation together. 
  "The vast majority of the people of South Africa want the 
change that is coming. They have fears about it, yes. They are 
anxious that their futures should be safe, yes. But they want 
the change to come. 
  "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. 
  "For this election is not about looking backwards. It is not 
about liberation -- we are already liberated. It is not about 
Black Power -- why replace domination by one race with 
domination by another? 
  "Nor is it about revenge. Apartheid was wrong, and it hurt 
the lives of millions of people. But President F.W. de Klerk, 
has both apologised for it, and abolished it completely. 
  "This election is about one thing only. The future. It is 
about us. All of us -- Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, and Indians. 
It matters not the colour of our skin or where we came from. 
What matters is where we are going to. 
  "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE. 
  "But who can we most trust to bring us The Prize? 
  "Consider two simple points: First: After the elections, the 
next Government will be a partnership; and the two largest 
parties in it will be the National Party [NP] and the African 
National Congress. 
  "They will have to work together. 
  "But no partnership works if one of the partners is too 
large, the other too small. Each needs to be strong enough to 
have an influence on the other. But to be sure of it 
working, the NP with its plan for the future needs to be the 
leading one. 
  "Second: Both parties promise very much the same thing -- a 
better life for all the people. 
  "But which one is most likely to be able to deliver its 
promises, to deliver The Prize, in other words? "Ponder the 
following questions. 

  -  "Which party has lost jobs through strikes, stopped the 
building of houses, disrupted the children's education, and 
intimidated and threatened people? 

    "The answer to all this is the ANC and its supporters and 
partners. 

  -  "But which party has already given its people -- ALL its 
people despite the inequalities -- the best life, in the whole 
of Africa? The answer is the new National Party. 
  -  "Which party has taken the lead in transforming South Africa 
and brought us to our first full and free election? The answer 
is the new National Party. 
  -  "Which party will be the most truly multi-racial party 
contesting those elections? The answer is the new National 
Party. 
  -  "Which party has the best plan, and knows how to make it work 
-- so that the jobs will come -- and the houses, the hospitals 
and the schools? The answer is the new National Party. 
  -  "And which party is dedicated to peace and the rule of law -- 
because only if we have peace can all this be achieved? 
The answer is the new National Party. 

    "SO NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE THE NEW NP. 
  "On April 27, we all get a chance to vote. Your vote is the 
heartbeat of democracy. It is yours and yours alone. It is 
secret. And no-one can tell you how to use it. 
  "If you vote for the new National Party, you will be voting 
for a party which can grasp The Prize. 
  "A party which is pledged to bring the jobs and make 
possible 
all the houses and schools that we need. A party with the 
strength, the experience and the determination to live up to its 
promises. And a party dedicated to peace and a secure future. 
  "If you vote for the ANC, you are taking a gamble on the 
future. You will be voting for an organisation which promises 
dreams; but simply does not have the experience to deliver. 
  "You will, in other words, be voting on hope. Which is 
better -- to vote for the party you hope might deliver The Prize? 
  "Or the one you KNOW can do it. 
  "Don't just hope for a better life. Vote for one. 
  "Half the world is rich. The other half is poor. Ours are 
the policies which have made nations rich. The ANC's are those 
which make them poor. 
  "Vote for us, and look ahead, five or ten years, and imagine 
this beloved country of ours with the economy booming, the jobs 
coming, the houses and schools and hospitals being built. 
  "Imagine what we could be! 
  "NOW IS INDEED THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE TO THE NEW 
NATIONAL PARTY. 
  "BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE 
  "VOTE FOR F.W. DE KLERK AND THE NEW NATIONAL PARTY 
  "We've made the change" 
  Between the previous two lines is a graphic depicting the 
National Party's line on the election ballot with a "X" marked 
in the space next to F.W. de Klerk's picture.

    [Editorial Report] The following full-page advertisement 
appears on 3 April in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English 
on page 9 and in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 
page 10. 
  The upper portion of the page is divided into two columns -- 
the left one headed "WHAT THE NP [National Party] IS DOING." and 
the right headed "WHAT THE ANC WILL DO." 
  The NP column contains three pictures and associated 
captions. The first picture shows three apparently unemployed 
black men. The caption reads: "The NP talks jobs. But its 
economic policies have left 5 million people without jobs." 
Below that is a picture of young children doing school lessons 
crouched on the floor in a room where no desks, tables, or 
chairs are visible. The caption reads: "The NP talks about 
equal education. But this year they are spending 3 times more 
on each White pupil than on each Coloured, Indian, and African 
pupil." Below that is a third picture, a close-up of a grieving 
black woman. The caption reads: "The NP talks about peace. But 
there is strong evidence that officials appointed by the NP are 
running a Third Force within the South African Police." 
  The ANC column is similarly divided into three sections, but 
without pictures. The text reads: 
  "On Jobs 
  "We have a plan to create 2.5 million jobs over the next 10 
years through a National Public Works Programme alone. 
  "We will also create jobs through small business development 
by changing licensing laws and providing training and access to 
loans. 
  "We will create a stable environment for investment and 
growth. 
  "On Education 
  "We have a plan to give 10 years free and quality education 
to all our children. 
  "We will ensure that a national bursary and loan scheme is 
established. 
  "And we will establish a major programme for adult education 
and skills training. 
  "On Peace 
  "We have a plan to reform the security forces to ensure that 
they are professional and non-partisan. This will allow the 
police to work closely with the communities to stamp out crime 
at its root. 
  "We will introduce a strict gun control programme." 
  Below the two columns is the following text, extending 
across 
the full width of the page. 
  "You don't need to wait for the election to see what the 
National Party's plan will do for South Africa. Just look 
around you. The damage caused by the NP's policies is 
everywhere to see. You cannot trust them with your future. 
  "The National Party have had their chance. It's time for 
change. On April 27, vote for the ANC. We have a plan for 
better life for all. 
  "A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and 
freedom." 
  A small ANC logo appears as a graphic in the bottom right 
corner of the page.

    [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 
3 April on page 8 carries a full-page advertisement for the 
Democratic Party. The top two-thirds of the page contains a 
picture of a white hand sticking out of a trench and waving a 
white flag. The caption of the picture reads: "WHEN IT COMES TO 
EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION, THE NATS HAVE SHOWN THEIR TRUE COLOURS." 
  Below the picture and caption is the following text: 
  "We all know the ANC are going to win the election. If 
you're 
worried what they'll do when they get in, you'll be looking for 
an effective opposition party. And you really have only two 
choices -- the DP [Democratic Party] or the NP [National Party]. 
  "As you know, the NP are real flag-waving South Africans. 
  "Unfortunately, those flags are white ones. 
  "They surrendered to the ANC on the issue of Federalism, so 
we're faced with an election boycott and possible civil war. 
They surrendered on the issue of the Constitutional Court, so 
the ANC nearly put their own judges into the highest courts (the 
DP only stopped this happening at the last minute). And when 
the Nats aren't giving in to the ANC, they're making deals with 
them: they've released over 10,000 convicted criminals onto the 
streets in secret amnesty deals, and they could release still 
more. 
  "The implications for you are serious. 
  "If you don't have an effective opposition in Parliament, 
you 
won't have anybody to protect you if the new government goes 
wrong. So vote for a party which won 5 times more issues at 
negotiations than the Nats. 
  "Vote for the Democratic Party. 
  "We might be smaller, but we'll never surrender. 
  "DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER.

<F P=106> [Interview with Freedom Front leader General Constand </F>
Viljoen by Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program--live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Good evening. The recently established 
Freedom Front unveiled its election manifesto on Monday [28 
March]. Tonight we have with us in the studio the leader of the 
party, General Constand Viljoen, to discuss the issue. Welcome, 
General. We have discussed the election manifestos of several 
parties, but I see yours is rather brief, so it indicates that 
you have worked quickly to get all this together. The essence 
of this, as I see it, is that you desire a confederal system, an 
independent homeland -- fully independent. Is that correct? 
  [Viljoen] What do you mean by fully independent? I do not 
think you are interpreting the matter correctly. You are 
correct when you say.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Constitutionally speaking, 
confederation means that the states are separate, but 
independent. 
  [Viljoen] Look, if you say a confederal or a strong federal 
system, if you talk about political independence, then we agree. 
Economically, we cannot be fully independent. That we know. We 
are economically interwoven. So we are actually concerned about 
freedom. It concerns the freedom of the nations in South 
Africa. It concerns a political system that prevents domination 
over groups in South Africa from occurring again. 
  [Robinson] But do you want to establish a strong local 
government -- a homeland, a strong federal state within 
specified borders? Is that so? 
  [Viljoen] No, let us talk about the homeland issue. We have 
stated this very clearly for a long time now. We know that this 
homeland of ours will be economically dependent on the new South 
Africa. Our farmers still want to sell their things there. We 
will have to make use of the same electrical power distribution 
system, and so on. Economically, we will have to work very 
closely with the new South Africa, but politically we want to be 
free. This means that the central authority should not be able 
to dominate us, concerning political decisions. 
  [Robinson] But what about foreign affairs? What about 
defense? 
  [Viljoen] I will come to that soon. By saying that we don't 
want to be dominated I mean, first, we want the right to write 
our own constitution, and second, we want the right to amend 
that constitution. We don't want to be prescribed to on what to 
include in that constitution and how to amend it. If we decide 
to give the function of foreign affairs to the central 
authority, that is our right. This is one of the issues we have 
considered in the Volksfront [National Front], and we say that 
this homeland of ours will most probably delegate its foreign 
affairs function to the central authority. Certain aspects of 
this -- for example, agriculture -- we think that if 
agricultural attaches have to be appointed overseas then we 
think that the homeland will be the one to appoint these 
agricultural attaches at South African embassies overseas. That 
is one of the issues. Policing is a function we believe rests 
with the homeland -- territorial defense, almost like the system 
in Switzerland, where the territory will have specified powers. 
  [Robinson] For a defense force or for a police force? 
  [Viljoen] No, for a territorial defense force. The central 
authority, however, will have the responsibility of national 
defense. This means that if southern Africa is attacked, the 
central authority will establish a defense mechanism or a 
defense headquarters to control the more sophisticated, the more 
professional parts of the defense force, and who will then ask 
for the various states to supply manpower to carry out the real 
task at national level. In other words, what I want to tell 
you.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But why do you want the local 
force? 
  [Viljoen] This is extremely important in South Africa in the 
future, so that we do not give communities the perception that 
they will be defenseless in the new South Africa. For this 
reason it is important for the Afrikaner to preserve its 
commando system for a considerable period after the 27 April, so 
that the Afrikaner does not feel he is completely defenseless. 
You know, the commando system is an absolutely integral part of 
our culture. In this respect it is important that we not give 
the Afrikaner a culture shock, and that we ensure the continued 
existence of the commando system, since it will form the nucleus 
of the future territorial defense force for the homeland. 
  [Robinson] But then, General, one could argue that one would 
have different states, each with its own territorial force, as 
you say, a sort of defense force. 
  [Viljoen] Yes, why not? 
  [Robinson] But then it could happen that they will be 
constant conflict with each other, that they will fight against 
each other. 
  [Viljoen] No, such a force serves as a deterrent and if it 
is 
responsibly applied then it is actually a force that ensures 
peace. There is an old saying: If you want peace, prepare for 
war. Now in South Africa's future, it would lead to chaos if 
you create a situation where either the central authority or 
other provinces are able to act against, the homeland for 
example, without the homeland having the ability to defend 
itself. We must accept that in the future there will be a need 
for such a force. I call it a balancing of forces -- through 
the creation of forces to serve as a deterrent and as a 
guarantee --to provide a feeling of security for the Afrikaners 
in that area. 
  [Robinson] General, but it is stated in newspapers that 
your involvement in the Bophuthatswana debacle was not 
necessarily a success, that you did not exercise the necessary 
authority, and that the army was not impressive. 
  [Viljoen] let me tell you a little about the Bophuthatswana 
issue. I challenge another organization to mobilize 2,000 
troops virtually overnight and to move into a given area, under 
the leadership of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, in support 
of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, at their request. They 
were to have supplied the weapons. We had an agreement. What 
was the purpose? The purpose was to assist President Mangope to 
survive over the weekend, until that Monday, so that a 
parliamentary session could take place on Tuesday in which they 
could make decisions without any form of intimidation -- 
decisions forced upon them following a coup. 
  [Robinson] General, I don't really want to discuss 
Bophuthatswana. All that I want to discuss is the issue of the 
army, that that entire episode was an indication that a private 
army, or the territorial army you envisage for the future, could 
create problems and that there will not necessarily be the 
required discipline. 
  [Viljoen] Look, if you are talking about discipline, we know 
that there are certain levels of discipline. That is well 
known. It's a pity that that incident took place because the 
lack of discipline was responsible for the failure of that 
exercise. If we had acted correctly, that operation would have 
been successful. President Mangope's party would still be in 
power today, and most probably Mr. Khoza's party would also not 
have been powerless. This process has led to the elimination of 
at least two other political parties, and the third political 
party, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], is now on the way to 
being eliminated, now three or four weeks before the election. 
  [Robinson] Let me link this discussion to another issue. If 
in your homeland you delegate certain functions to the central 
government, such as foreign affairs and defense, there must be 
another law -- the constitution as such must be applicable to 
you, for example, the Human Rights Charter -- in which there is 
a fundamental principle of no discrimination. Would this, for 
example, apply to your state? 
  [Viljoen] Freek, without doubt, we will have to do this. Can 
I add that I believe that the Afrikaner -- although we are 
chiefly interested in the homeland's constitution -- that the 
Afrikaner will not be able to divorce himself from politics, and 
especially from the constitution to be adopted by the rest of 
South Africa, for the simple reason that economically, we will 
have to work with those people. 
  [Robinson] What people? 
  [Viljoen] The new South Africa. Secondly, we are faced with 
the problem of 50 percent, at least, of our own people, our own 
Afrikaners, who will be situated outside the homeland. We 
cannot desert those people and say: We have a homeland. We are 
going to build that homeland and not pay attention to the others. 
  [Robinson] How will you pay attention to them? 
  [Viljoen] There is a very interesting development in 
negotiations at the moment. Initially we concentrated on the 
idea of a homeland. It was difficult to sell the homeland 
philosophy to people. We have succeeded. It was also difficult 
to convince the people about the practicality of the homeland. 
I think we have succeeded in that also. There are still a few 
questions concerning that, but the new development is that we 
want to link the homeland to certain concentrations of 
Afrikaners in the rest of the country. We could call them 
community councils. The idea, for example, is to investigate 
this and we are busy with final negotiations in this regard -- 
to investigate the possibility of linking community councils 
outside the homeland, through representatives, to the people's 
council of the homeland, so that the homeland's council also 
ensures certain functions for the Afrikaner in the rest of South 
Africa, so that we can ensure the cultural survival of the 
Afrikaner. The homeland and the people's council, settled in 
that area dominated by Afrikaners, will have an influence inside 
and outside the area, through which we can determine the future 
of the Afrikaner. This is what we want. Self-determination 
means the right to determine your own future. 
  [Robinson] I also asked you about the whole issue of the 
Human Rights Charter, discrimination. What about those people 
inside such a homeland who do not want to be there? 
  [Viljoen] About the people who do want to be part of the 
homeland -- I have often explained that we want to create a 
situation where there is Afrikaner dominance. In South Africa 
there is an area where Zulus dominate. There is an area where 
Xhosas dominate, but there is no area where Afrikaners dominate, 
for specific reasons. Research indicates the fault dates back 
to 1910, and the effect of the separate development policy 
actually denied Afrikaners the right to certain areas. You have 
already heard the argument on the peace of Versailles -- when a 
delegation of blacks and a delegation of Boers came together, 
and both asked to have a say in the new South Africa. The Boers 
wanted to reclaim the old Boer Republic, and the blacks asked to 
be accommodated in one way or another in the constitution. Both 
were rejected. We are asking now, after this election, for 
certain issues concerning the Afrikaner as a nation to be 
rectified. We have a right to ask for this, and defining the 
area is our problem. Together with the Zulus we can ask for 
self-determination, but the Afrikaner does not have an area, and 
in an attempt to define these borders we will have to use the 
polls to prove sufficient support and to ensure that we can 
implement a people's council and also that we can determine the 
distribution of Afrikaner support to put the borders of the 
Afrikaner homeland down on paper. 
  [Robinson] I want to come back to the issue of the homeland 
borders, but I want to repeat my question -- very directly. If I 
am a colored and I live near Lydenburg, where you yourself live, 
and I find myself as part of this homeland, will I have voting 
rights? Will I have equal educational opportunities? Will 
there be equal employment opportunities? Will I, as a person, 
have equal legal access and the same human rights? 
  [Viljoen] Yes, Freek, it is no longer possible in South 
Africa or the world to have a homeland or state where you do not 
give people certain rights. We are busy negotiating the details 
of the homeland. These issues you have referred to are actually 
issues that will be referred to the homeland council, to be 
negotiated on a bilateral or trilateral basis, or with the 
future constitutional bodies of the new South Africa. These are 
important issues. We gladly want to give those people what we 
ourselves are asking for, but we do not want to create a system 
where people will again oust the Afrikaner -- through squatting, 
for example. 
  [Robinson] So you actually want them away from those areas? 
  [Viljoen] No, we don't want them away from those areas. We 
say that we will not have any forced removal of people. If 
people want to leave themselves, then they can leave. What we 
actually envisage is to resettle Afrikaners in those areas, to 
offer those Afrikaners who have lost their jobs through this 
so-called affirmative action, an opportunity to come back to 
Afrikanerdom and to build a homeland through hard labor. That 
is what we have in mind. 
  [Robinson] I have a lot of follow-up questions, but let us 
leave that for the moment. I just want to ask you the following 
question. Do you approve of the map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg 
over the weekend? 
  [Viljoen] This map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg is a 
so-called 
discussion map. In other words, it takes into account the 
historical demands of the Afrikaner. In this regard it is 
correct. Dr. Hartzenberg himself said that this is not the final 
map but that it is subject to negotiation. 
  [Robinson] Do you accept this? 
  [Viljoen] On the issue of further negotiation, yes, I 
definitely agree with that. 
  [Robinson] That this be used as a basis for negotiation? 
  [Viljoen] Yes, I think it can serve as basis for 
negotiation. 
Let me tell you this: If we look at what the Afrikaner wants -- 
self-determination in an independent area, in a homeland, as 
well as the right to negotiate self-determination for its 
people, as far as possible, in the rest of South Africa -- then 
there is one more thing the Afrikaner must remember, and that is 
that our demand is a reasonable one, but it must also be a 
practical one. The dear Lord placed us in this country together 
with other people. Those other people have certain rights, and 
we also have rights. 
  [Robinson] The same rights or not? 
  [Viljoen] We say that the rights of nations, the rights we 
grant to ourselves, should also be granted to others. All that 
we must do now is to sort out the constitutional mess South 
Africa finds itself in, to rearrange this, taking into account 
all the different population groups, including the Afrikaner 
nation and the other nations, as well as other people living in 
the Afrikaner nation's area, people who have lived there for a 
long time -- to give them these rights so that we can coexist 
peacefully alongside each other in the future. 
  [Robinson] Do you want to say then that you will also fight 
for the rights of others in this election? Will you, for 
example, try to get the Inkatha vote? 
  [Viljoen] No, that is not want I want to do. What I want to 
tell you is that the Freedom Front undertook to fight for 
freedom. 
  [Robinson] Just for the Afrikaner? 
  [Viljoen] No, no. Freedom is a concept that should not only 
be seen in the political context. Freedom in the true sense of 
the word, and freedom which especially excludes domination. 
  [Robinson] But would you want blacks to vote for you? 
  [Viljoen] If we want.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] No, answer the question. Would you 
want blacks to vote for you? 
  [Viljoen] At the moment I can't.... [pauses] I will explain 
in a minute. Constitutional clause 34, says specifically that a 
community should prove that they want self-determination. If I 
campaign, for example, for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to 
vote for me, then the constitutional court could turn around 
after the election and say this proven support is not accurate 
enough. 
  [Robinson] What is proven support? What number would qualify 
as proven support for you? 
  [Viljoen] Look, if one includes a constitutional clause in a 
constitution, then that clause should not only apply to the 
Afrikaner but also to all other nations who want it. In other 
words, we cannot say that if 500,000 people vote for a homeland 
then that is proven support, because if the Indians come and say 
they want self-determination then we are speaking about 
different numbers. 
  [Robinson] But one has to arrive at some figure. 
  [Viljoen] If we talk about support, majority support, then 
the constitutional clause would have said majority support -- 
that is, more than 50 percent. 
  [Robinson] Of Afrikaners? 
  [Viljoen] Of Afrikaners, yes. Of the community asking for 
self-determination. If there is sufficient support then I would 
say .... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] More than 50 percent of Afrikaners? 
  [Viljoen] No, more than 50 percent would be a majority of 
Afrikaners. If we say sufficient support, then we would say 
there should be close to 50 percent, or more than 50 percent, 
but it should not be so small that it becomes laughable. Let us 
say that a court might rule -- and here I don't want to predict 
want a court will say -- that 30 percent or less would be 
unsuitable. So one doesn't want to put forward a precise 
definition of this, but I think the court will be guided by 
circumstances that will surely include the size of the community 
asking for self-determination, and, of those communities, how 
many voted for or against the idea. 
  [Robinson] General, in conclusion, you were in a partnership 
with several other people in right-wing politics. There were 
harsh words between you and some of those people, especially 
from their side. Is there division in Afrikaner ranks? 
  [Viljoen] Look, the Afrikaner is undivided in his struggle 
for his goal. We are undivided in our struggle. We are 
targeting the same eventual goal. We only differ about the 
method. It is a question of, for example, of driving to 
Bloemfontein via either the Kimberley route or the Kroonstad 
route. It does not matter. If we differ, we have agreed to 
differ, and we said we will accept the two-stream policy. We 
said that we would not oppose each other because we believe that 
both groups are equally honest and equally serious about the 
manner in which they want to achieve self- determination. 
Eventually, before reaching our goal, we will take hands again 
and we will stand together again. I, for example, am still a 
member of the Volksfront. I am still strongly linked to the 
defense mechanisms of the Volksfront and as such, I still 
associate myself with the Volksfront, but I had to establish the 
Freedom Front to bring about this specific alternative and 
strategy, so that there would not be any setback to the 
development of a homeland, but to ensure that we can secure a 
homeland as soon as possible after the 27 April. 
  [Robinson] General, thank you very much for your 
contribution 
tonight.

  [Text] Reports indicate that preparations are in full swing 
for the inauguration of the new state president on 9 May and 
that invitations are to be sent to heads of state all over the 
world. Among the guests of honor are leaders of terrorist 
countries and sworn enemies of South Africa and the West, such 
as Fidel Castro, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and Saddam Husayn. 
Western leaders mentioned include President Bill Clinton, Mr. 
John Major, and Dr. Helmut Kohl. Political observers believe 
this could be a protocol and diplomatic hot potato that might 
leave organizers of the event with red faces, as Western leaders 
distance themselves from the leaders of the terrorist countries.

  [Text] It is reported from London that emergency plans are 
being drafted to airlift up to 350,000 Britons out of South 
Africa if chaos should erupt after the election. The report 
said that British Airways was preparing to divert flights to 
Johannesburg and Cape Town if violence in the townships spread 
to the white community. One million three hundred thousand 
whites hold dual South African-British citizenship, but it is 
reported that priority in such an evacuation will be given to 
those whose sole nationality is British. Last week reports from 
Lisbon said that the Portuguese government had plans for the 
evacuation of about 600,000 Portuguese nationals from South 
Africa if necessary.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Natal State of Emergency -- As troops are "settling into 
their new postings in Natal and kwaZulu," one man stands "at the 
center of the drama:" kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi, an 
editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 2-3 
April on page 8 notes. Believing his "continued brinksmanship" 
would eventaully gain what he wanted, Buthelezi ignord a 
"lifeline from President de Klerk," allowing late registration 
for the election. With the "crumbling of the Freedom Alliance 
Buthelezi became increasingly isolated and desperate" and "with 
the apparent complicity of his king" he opened an "ethnic 
Pandora's box," attempting to "terrify Zulus in his kraal with 
talk of `ethnic cleansing' and `obliteration.'" As a result, the 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters on the ground "reacted 
with predictable militancy" and "just as predictably blood 
flowed." "It is an indication of the severity of the crisis" 
that de Klerk declared a state of emergency as "he must have 
been aware such a step would mean loss of conservative votes." 
Buthelezi is "left with a stark chioce -- to order a futile last 
stand, or finally face reality and order his administration to 
co-operate with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission.]" 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Natal State of Emergency -- An editorial in Johannesburg 
SUNDAY TIMES in English on 3 April on page 20 states the 
"declaration of a full state of emergency in kwaZula-Natal 
smacks of expedience, perhaps panic. It is in any case an 
unseemly way for the new South Africa to be born." While the 
"slaughter between Inkatha supporters and the ANC is of course a 
matter of desperate concern," "South Africa's problems are not 
caused in the first instance by the lack of law: this country 
has been bowed through decades by a surfeit of laws." The state 
of emergency is "open-ended, not subject to review," "it invites 
perpetuation." "The one truly remarkable thing about the 
adoption of this state of emergency is the alacrity with which 
the ANC has joined the National Party in defending these 
undemocratic measures on the basis that they protect democracy." 
There is "one small gesture which would go some way to 
ameliorating suspicion. Amend the emergency regulations to build 
in an immediate review facility which would allow an 
authoritative body -- why not the Independent Electoral 
Commission -- to scrap the emergency when a visible and 
pre-determined level of peace is established." 
<H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>
  Natal State of Emergency -- "At long last, the Transitional 
Executive Council (TEC) has heard the cries of the people of 
Natal, and has responded," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY 
NATION in English on 3 April on page 6 notes. "We are convinced" 
that this state of emergency is "directed at those who have been 
causing deaths and sufferings -- and are keen to continue doing 
so -- in the Natal/KwaZulu province." "It will give the security 
forces the powers they needed all along to act against 
para-military training which has been boastingly shown in our 
television screens. We mean the training of Inkatha's 
Self-Protection Units, the Boer Command's and also the ANC's 
Self-Defence Units. We also hope that Inkatha and rightwing 
leaders' war talk amd threats of civil war will come under 
serious scrunity from this state of emergency." "Surely, if it 
is a state of emergency that is needed to end all these things, 
then the principle that a state of emergency is necessarily a 
wrong thing does not apply in this case. We, however, need to 
caution the security forces against over-stepping their mark and 
make this state of emergency yet another licence to curtail 
civil liberties. We hope that the TEC, in particular, will place 
its sharp eye on the men and women that will enforce the state 
of emergency so as to prevent abuses from taking place."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Full Security Force Deployment Needed for Elections -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 29 March points out in a 
page-8 editorial that "the chaos and bloodshed in the center of 
Johannesburg is the last straw." "Regardless of who is 
responsible for the tragedy, such lawlessness cannot be 
tolerated. The decision by obscure so-called traditional Zulu 
leaders to call a protest meeting in the city center at short 
notice and without proper liaison with the police and other 
interested parties was stupid and irresponsible...but that does 
not give ANC members or whoever it was who fired on the marchers 
from surrounding buildings the right to act in this manner." 
"In the future, the government, together with the Transitional 
Executive Council, must take firm action to prevent a repetition 
of such events. A great responsibility also lies with political 
leaders to discipline their supporters and stop unnecessary 
shows of strength." "Peace-loving and law-abiding South 
Africans -- and they are by far in the majority -- demand that 
in the remaining weeks before the election the security forces 
be deployed in their entirety in order to protect the democratic 
process." 
  Threats by Nuclear Experts `Unforgivable Blackmail' -- 
"Certain experts who were involved in South Africa's nuclear 
weapons program are now threatening to expose secret information 
if they are not given good retrenchment packages. That is 
unforgivable blackmail, and destroys any sympathy which they 
could have received for losing their jobs," states a second 
editorial on page 8 of BEELD. "South Africa's nuclear weapons 
program was conducted mainly during the time when the country 
was an outcast from the international community." "In normal 
circumstances and with the wisdom of hindsight a different 
course could have been followed, but that is now of purely 
academic interest because the country wisely chose not to 
proceed with the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Those who now 
seek to strike gold through blackmail ought to be prosecuted." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Singling Out KwaZulu-Natal Questioned -- The Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April comments in a page-20 editorial 
on the state of emergency that was declared in kwaZulu-Natal, 
saying that "serious questions remain unanswered. For example, 
whether a `free and fair election' will be at all possible." 
"But one of the most important questions remaining is why only 
kwaZulu-Natal was singled out for such drastic action. This 
week, the Johannesburg city center was the scene of events the 
likes of which one sees regularly in the media reportage on 
Sarajevo...but no state of emergency was declared." "Why have 
other dangerous target areas been excluded?" "Is kwaZulu-Natal 
more dangerous than Transkei, where it has long been suspected 
that hit squads launch their attacks from? And where the 
Transkei leader recently informed the National Party that they 
can conduct their election campaign but only from inside armored 
vehicles? This selectivity makes people wonder." 
  Election Approaching Amid Crises -- In her column on page 21 
of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "`It is not easy to rule 
a country in a transitional period like this.' True words, 
spoken by the man who ought to know, President F. W. de Klerk, 
in reply to a question about whether he is still in control." 
"But that is putting it mildly. Since the start of the year 
the government has had to deal with one crisis after another. 
Just look at the Zulu march through central Johannesburg 
earlier this week in the wake of the previous week; the crisis 
involving the police generals and the Goldstone report; events 
in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei; the prison uprising over the right 
of prisoners to vote...." Aggravating the situation is the 
question of where power lies -- with the Transitional Executive 
Council or the government. The ANC "is so convinced of a 
massive election victory that it behaves with limitless 
self-confidence," which has created the "feeling among many that 
a kind of vacuum has developed, with the old almost past but the 
new not quite in place yet. It is as though everyone wants to 
find a gap, challenge authority, strike, demand, march. Perhaps 
that is why even the police generals last week used the 
opportunity to growl back at the state president." "Should the 
transition have been handled differently? No one can really 
speak out on the matter one way or the other." Now "it is a 
matter of pinching one's eyes shut and hoping it passes quickly. 
There is no turning back."

  [Text] In response to the deteriorating situation in the 
ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
territory, the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], 
yesterday began the deployment of its troops into Bomi County. 
Although a part of the Liberian peace plan, ECOMOG's deployment 
into the ULIMO territory is seen as an attempt to calm the 
internal rift within the organization and also separate the 
fighting forces of the Mandingo and Krahn ethnic groups. At a 
brief ceremony held at the Po River Bridge minutes before their 
checkoff yesterday, soldiers of Nimba 17 hurriedly boarded a 
convoy of several trucks and tanks awaiting instruction from 
their commander. 
  As the commanding officer of Nimba 17 Lieutenant Colonel 
(Jonathan Albaah) gave the order, two armored tanks slowly led 
the convoy of four trucks of troops that drove across the Po 
River Bridge into Bomi County amid cheers and jubilation by 
war-weary civilians standing by. Our reporter, Harry Rogers, 
who was on the scene, said that the troops would be deployed at 
(Camp Fashima) last night and disarmament would have begun 
immediately thereafter. According to Rogers, the scene at the Po 
River Bridge was characterized by a lot of emotion when the 
[words indistinct]. 
  Fighters of the defunct ULIMO were (?behind) the bridge 
chatting with their ECOMOG brothers as civilians looked on. One 
of the fighters, according to our reporter, said and I quote, 
let this thing be over. We are now tired of fighting. With 
yesterday's exercise, ECOMOG can now be said to be in Margibi 
and Bomi Counties.

  [Text] It seems as if all is, for now at least, pretty much 
quiet between the factions within the ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] rebel movement in Liberia. 
This calm follows weeks of a split and fighting between the 
Mandingos loyal to the leader, Alhaji Koromah, and the Krahns 
who support the ULIMO military head, Roosevelt Johnson. The two 
men went to neighboring Sierra Leone last week to talk peace and 
at the end of it they issued a communique saying they have 
patched up their differences, and now the West African force, 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group], have begun deploying troops in the ULIMO town of 
Tubmanburg. Jonathan Pay Laile, who normally reports for us 
from Gbarnga, was taken to Tubmanburg today. He sent this 
report: 
  Tension is easing in Tubmanburg following the deployment of 
ECOMOG troops last Thursday [31 March]. Some 200 ECOMOG troops 
have arrived in the town. However, armed soldiers loyal to 
Alhaji Koromah, are patrolling the streets 24 hours a day. Some 
civilians are slowly beginning to return to the town. Most had 
fled following fighting between competing factions within the 
ULIMO. 
  This afternoon, a senior ECOMOG soldier told me in 
Tubmanburg 
that the deployment of ECOMOG troops will be completed by 
tomorrow. He said since the arrival of the troops there has been 
no fighting. A chief operations officer with the UN force, 
UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia], also confirmed that the 
town has been calm for some days now. He also said that troops 
loyal to Roosevelt Johnson attacked Bomi last week but were 
pushed back by fighters loyal to Alhaji Koromah. The town of 
Congo on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border, he said changed hands 
three times last week before ECOMOG troops were deployed there. 
As I returned to Monrovia this afternoon, I passed several 
trucks carrying ECOMOG soldiers into Cape Mount County.

  [Text] Bamako, 1 Apr (AFP) -- The residence of the French 
consul general here was attacked and looted by a group of youths 
yesterday, a reliable source disclosed. The assailants, after 
overpowering the watchman, raided the residence, which they 
ransacked and looted, taking away valuable objects and money. 
  The attack, which did not result in casualties, has not been 
claimed but various sources attribute it to a new organization 
called the "Armed Resistance Group," which recently released a 
leaflet carrying threats to attack foreign interests -- 
particularly, French, American, and German -- in Mali. 
According to official sources, there is no information about 
the perpetrators of the attack, which coincided with the 
political opposition's ghost city operation organized in Bamako 
to demand the reopening of schools closed since mid-February by 
the government.

  [Text] The school crisis was at the center of a meeting 
held this morning at the prime minister's office between 
Kadiatou Sy Sow, the minister of foreign affairs, Malians 
abroad, and African integration, ambassadors accredited to our 
country, and representatives from international organizations. 
The main item on the agenda was the continuation of contacts, 
exchange of views, and the providing of information on the 
school crisis, acts of violence and vandalism, and security 
measures planned for the protection of lives and property. 
Rokia Cisse attended this meeting: 
  [Cisse] The meeting was aimed mainly at providing specific 
information on the school crisis. In this regard, the 
government [word indistinct] the following objectives: It will 
not give in to opposition pressure. Schools will partially 
reopen from 11 April (?following) negotiations between education 
partners and the government. The government's wish is to save 
the Malian school system. Let us listen to Foreign Minister Sow: 
  [Begin Sow recording] Yes, before February, we made appeals 
for calm. We asked everybody to show a sense of responsibility 
and understand that above all it was necessary to actually save 
the Malian school system. In order to save the academic year 
[words indistinct] and be able to save the democratic process in 
our country. We have made all these appeals, we hope that they 
will be heard again this time and that all Malians will mobilize 
themselves to ensure that the reopening of schools is a success. 
[end recording] 
  [Cisse] The government, through Sow, apologized for the 
violent acts perpetrated against some diplomats. According to 
the minister, these acts occurred after the campaign mounted by 
some newspapers. The government is determined to curb this 
violence and is taking all the necessary measures to ensure the 
security of diplomats and their families. She therefore 
appealed to the diplomats to be more understanding and to assist 
in facilitating the work of the security forces.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, returned to 
Abuja last night after a foreign tour that took him to India and 
Saudi Arabia. In India, he attended the G-15 summit, and in 
Saudi Arabia he visited Medina and performed a one-day 
pilgrimage to Mecca. He was accompanied to Mecca by the 
minister of external affairs, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, the 
Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Professor (Shehu 
Karaganchi) and the counselor (Jalloh Njeba Alhaji Kafakagbon). 
  In Jedda, the Saudi authorities pledged to improve on the 
facilities and welfare services for Nigerians on pilgrimage. 
The pledge was made by the Saudi minister for pilgrim and hajj 
operations, Dr. Mahmud al-Safar, during an exchange of views 
with Alhaji Babagana Kingibe. He said that a recommendation 
from the Nigerian Government on ways of improving hajj 
facilities would be most welcome. Responding, the minister of 
external affairs said a master plan from his ministry on the 
conduct of pilgrim/hajj operations would soon be forwarded to 
the Saudi Government. Making a statement to the press at Jedda, 
Gen. Abacha described the G-15 summit as important to Nigeria's 
search for indigenous technology and trade relations under the 
South-South cooperation. 
  The head of state reaffirmed the Federal Government's 
commitment to the objectives of the Group and said Nigeria would 
continue to use the experiences gained from such organizations 
for her political, economic, and social development. Gen. 
Abacha was welcomed back at Abuja airport by the chief of 
general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, the minister of 
the capital territory, Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni and other top 
government officials.

  [Text] Freetown, April 2 (AFP) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone 
killed six government soldiers in three attacks which saw them 
make their furthest advance yet from their southeast 
strongholds, military officials said here Saturday [2 April]. 
  The troops were killed Friday in an ambush in Jembeh, 200 
(130 miles) east of the capital, the officials said. 
  Two days earlier an United Revolutionary Front (RUF) rebel 
group occupied nearby Massingbi before being forced to retreat 
by government troops. 
  That incursion marked the furthest known advance by the 
rebels since the insurgency was launched in May 1991 from their 
presumed bases in the Kailahun and Pujehun regions 300 
kilometres (180 miles) east and 210 kilometres (125 miles) 
southeast of Freetown, the officials said. 
  Also Wednesday a separate RUF group tried to sabotage a 
hydroelectric dam at Bo, 170 kilometres (1O5 miles) southeast of 
the capital. The dam held, but the attackers torched several 
houses and farms in the region. 
  The military junta in power since April 1992 declared "total 
war" against the insurgents in January.

  [Text] The rebels in Sierra Leone must have given the 
government of that country an even bigger fright this Easter 
weekend with an attack on the north of the country. This is the 
first time that fighting has been reported between government 
and rebels in the Northern Region since they launched their 
incursion into Sierra Leone three years ago. In that time, the 
war has been concentrated in the south and southeast of the 
country. From Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report: 
  Details are now beginning to emerge of the first rebel 
attack 
on any target in the north of the country. According to sources 
close to the Defense Department, the RUF [Revolutionary United 
Front] rebels attacked the mining town of Masingbe at about 4:30 
on Friday [1 April] afternoon, killing at least 15 civilians and 
briefly occupying the town. They were forced out by government 
troops yesterday. Reports from the area say that the rebel 
force numbered some 60 soldiers. They also speak of a mass 
exodus of civilians from Masingbe and outlying areas and towns 
like Matotaka, Mabourka and Makeni. On the line to Makeni in 
the north of the country this afternoon, the defense 
undersecretary, Captain Komba Kambo told me that Masingbe was 
now under full government control and that government troops 
were now engaged in exercises aimed at ensuring that no such 
attack would ever occur in the area again. I was told that for 
now civilians who had fled the fighting would not be allowed 
back until the area was declared safe. 
  When I asked Capt. Kambo about reports I had been receiving 
from those coming from Makeni that government soldiers had been 
selling looted property from Masingbe, I was told this was not 
the case. Capt. Kambo said such statements could only come from 
detractors who are bent on causing mischief. One military 
officer who comes from the north thought that the marauding band 
of rebels who attacked Masingbe must have been escaping from 
Kenema District, where the government has launched offensives 
against the RUF rebels. Be that as it may, many here feel it is 
now that the government war machine was put into top gear so 
that the war can come to a close.

  [Text] The Supreme Court of Togo yesterday annulled the 
election of two Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] deputies 
following an annulment suit filed by the Rally of the Togolese 
People [RPT] after the second round of the legislative 
elections. Serious incidents in the second constituency of Haho 
and the first constituency of Wawa led to these annulments. A 
few days ago, the Supreme Court invalidated the election during 
the first round, of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] 
deputy in the first constituency of Oti because Bemba Bahissa's 
alternate had not satisfied the conditions concerning residence 
on the territory during the elections. Following these 
annulments, the opposition still retains the majority with 40 
seats -- 34 for the CAR and 6 for the UTD as against 37 for the 
RPT-Union for Justice and Democracy and one for the 
Confederation of New Forces.

  [Text] Lome, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The two opposition parties 
forming a parliamentary majority after the February legislative 
elections in Togo today decided to suspend "the participation of 
their parliamentarians in the deliberations of the National 
Assembly," in protest against the Supreme Court's invalidation 
of the election of three of their deputies. 
  In a communique to AFP, the two parties stated that their 
parliamentary boycott would last until "the situation is 
clarified." 
  The opposition coalition, comprising the Action Committee 
for 
Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], had 
won 43 (36 for the CAR and 7 for the UTD) out of 81 
parliamentary seats. Currently the coalition has only 40 (34 
for the CAR and 6 for the UTD) out of the 78 declared seats, but 
it still retains a parliamentary majority. 
  The Constitution makes it binding on President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema to appoint the future prime minister from within the 
parliamentary majority. Consultations have been continuing in 
this direction between President Eyadema and the opposition 
leaders since 15 March, but so far have not progressed. 
  The CAR's Yaovi Agboyibor and the UTD's Edem Kodjo stated in 
their communique that one of the election annulments by the 
Supreme Court was "in flagrant violation" of the Electoral Law, 
while the reasons put forward to justify the two other 
annulments are, according to them, "poorly founded and devoid of 
any weight." 
  In the first case, the court observed that the substitute 
for 
the elected parliamentarian was not eligible. In the other two 
cases it was of the view that "disturbances" had "undermined the 
sincerity of the polls." 
  According to the opposition, these incidents were "fomented" 
by the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally [RPT] and that "it is 
inadmissible for the court to use this as a pretext for 
questioning the validity of the polls." 
  Agboyigbor and Kodjo also deplored the fact that the 
"consultative mechanism put in place before the elections to 
ensure the "amicable" settlement of disputes had not been 
"operational." 
  Finally, the UTD and the CAR "questioned" the "motives 
behind 
these maneuvers and the RPT's preparedness to play the 
democratic game." 
  The appointment of a prime minister from the ranks of the 
opposition would compel General Eyadema, who has been in power 
since 1967, and who was reelected last August during an election 
boycotted by the opposition, to accept a new arrangement for 
cohabitation with the opposition in the governance of the 
country.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by Justice Minister Aregba Polo in </F>
Lome on 3 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Fourth Republic's Constitution has assigned two 
essential electoral tasks to the Supreme Court. The first one 
is the proclamation of results. The Constitution has assigned 
to the Court the official proclamation of results. Before this 
proclamation it should check the material and formal aspects of 
the poll. It does not deal with the details of the electoral 
exercise, but simply judges whether the organized poll appeared 
to be legal. The National Electoral Commission [NEC] was of the 
view that the poll appeared to be legal in 76 constituencies, 
but in the remaining five, incidents occurred to such an extent 
that it was advisable to transfer the results to the Supreme 
Court for examination. After examination, the Court concluded 
that it had to announce all the results because candidates 
affected by the incidents had the chance to lodge their 
electoral complaints for settlement. 
  The second mission assigned to the Court concerns election 
disputes. It receives complaints from dissatisfied candidates, 
checks the regularity of electoral exercise, and hands down 
verdicts. It can confirm the validity of polls or annul the 
election of a candidate in case it believes the electoral 
process has been violated. The Supreme Court received 29 
appeals for annulment. During the examination of the appeals, 
it analyzed all the legal aspects to check the validity of the 
challenged polls. The examination resulted in the annulment of 
the elections of three candidates out of 81. In one case, the 
annulment resulted from the ineligibility of an alternate, while 
in the remaining two cases the annulment was due to the serious 
irregularities that affected the fairness of the voting. 
  Concerning the conciliation procedure at the level of the 
NEC, I point out that it was followed as proved by the letters 
exchanged by the NEC chairman and the president of the Supreme 
Court. Togo is a law-abiding state. Each citizen has to 
respect the decisions made by the judiciary, and it is in this 
spirit that each citizen should consider the decisions made by 
the Supreme Court.

  [Text] Lome, April 3 (AFP) -- Togolese President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema on Saturday [2 April] appealed to the country's two 
opposition parties, currently enjoying a parliamentatary 
majority, to show their good will by helping him designate a 
prime minister. 
  Eyadema, in a statement sent to AFP, said opposition leaders 
had told him they could not "draft a list of candidates," 
although they had "committed themselves to do so." He said the 
officials, whom he met Saturday, were unable to assemble a list 
"because the rank and file members are at odds with their 
leaders." 
  The two parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and 
the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), agreed on March 26 to 
put forward CAR leader Yao Agboyibor as their choice for prime 
minister. But General Eyadema called for a list of several 
candidates, a request the two parties have so far been unable to 
meet. 
  The opposition coalition won 43 seats in February's 
legislative elections to the 81-member parliament, with CAR 
capturing 36 and the UTD seven. But the supreme court 
subsequently invalidated the election of three of its members. 
As a result, CAR currently controls 34 seats and the UTD six. 
  Eyadema said in his statement he could "only express 
surprise 
at the sluggish pace at which the leaders of the majority 
parties are trying to draft a list of candidates for prime 
minister." 
  He reiterated his readiness to continue discussions with 
Agboyibor and UTD head Edem Kodjo. But the parties on Saturday 
vowed to boycott parliament to protest the court decision 
invalidating the election of three oppostion deputies. 
  The coalition said the action would last "until the 
situation 
is clarified." 
  The supreme court nullified the election of the three 
deputies for technical reasons in one case and because of 
"trouble" during election day in the two others. 
  The opposition rejected all three decisions, charging that 
election day "trouble" had been the work of the pro-Eyadema 
faction.

  [Text] An ANC [African National Congress] spokesman, Mr. 
Ronnie Mamoepa, has denied a statement in a report by police 
commissioner, General Johan van der Merwe, that ANC President, 
Mr. Nelson Mandela, has undertaken to hand over weapons used in 
this week's slaughter of Zulus in Johannesburg. 
  Mr. Mamoepa told Radio Pretoria's news desk that he was not 
aware of this agreement and that the ANC would not issue a 
statement. Mr. Mamoepa confirmed that no weapons or ammunition 
were handed to the police by the ANC. This development follows 
a denial by the NP [National Party] leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, 
that he and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel ordered 
Witwatersrand regional police commissioner, General Koos Calitz, 
not to carry out a search warrant at ANC headquarters, Shell 
House. This warrant was issued shortly after snipers shot at 
marchers from Shell House during a peaceful Zulu protest march 
in which several Zulus were killed. A police liaison officer, 
Colonel Dave Bruce, declared that he is not surprised at Mr. 
Mamoepa's reaction. 
  In reply to a question on whether Gen. Calitz did not act 
too 
lightly by just accepting Mr. Mandela's word, Colonel Bruce 
replied, and we quote: You must remember that the undertaking 
was given in a discussion between the regional police 
commissioner and the future state president of the country. I 
do not know what Mr. Mandela's agreement is with his personnel. 
  Radio Pretoria put to Colonel Bruce that everything points 
to 
a situation where the ANC will simply deny the existence of 
possible murder weapons. The following question was put to Mr. 
Bruce: Why do the police not act in terms of the search warrant, 
since Mr. Mandela probably tricked the police. 
  Colonel Bruce replied that the police were meeting to decide 
on a course of action.

  [Text] Our guest today is the Cameroonian communications 
minister and government spokesman, Augustin Kontchou. For some 
10 days now, Cameroon has been attempting to get the support of 
the international community on its border dispute with Nigeria. 
Seven delegations are currently touring the world in an effort 
to persuade their partners that the Bakassi Peninsula claimed by 
Nigeria belongs to Cameroon. 
  Augustin Kontchou has just ended his tour of Europe, and 
Ghislaine Dupont asked him first if he felt like he had been 
heard and understood: 
  [Begin recording] [Kontchou] We are convinced that we were 
understood and we are returning home pleased with the result. 
In France, Germany, and Belgium, we heard the same thing: 
First, European governments supports the stand of the European 
Union which called on both parties to settle their dispute in 
accordance with international law -- that is, in the framework 
of a respect for borders lawfully established -- to pull out 
their troops in accordance with the principles previously 
outlined. Everywhere we were told: Since Cameroon is within its 
rights we will support it. 
  [Dupont] Cameroon has just turned to the International Court 
of Justice in The Hague. What are the main arguments supporting 
your case? 
  [Kontchou] Our arguments are unassailable, they are based on 
historical and legal factors. Historically, Cameroon borders 
were acknowledged by colonial powers; Cameroon was later placed 
under UN mandate with the same borders. The UN organized a 
referendum in the English-speaking part of Cameroon in 1961, to 
let the local people decide for themselves either to join the 
French-speaking Cameroon independent at the time, or Nigeria, 
which was independent too. The people of this Bakassi region 
decided to join Cameroon as other English-speaking people did 
too. Later, even before that [as heard] the 1954 Nigerian law 
defining the Nigerian borders placed Bakassi within Cameroon. 
  Until 1992, that is until very recently, Nigerian maps 
placed 
Bakassi within Cameroon. There has been a series of statements, 
of agreements between Nigerian and Cameroonian authorities since 
1960. They related to various bilateral border issues but none 
ever questioned the border in the Bakassi region. We have legal 
and historical arguments which Nigeria does not possess. 
Nigeria bases its position on some texts dating back to 1906 
and before, therefore we cannot see on which legal base Nigeria 
could pretend to obtain sovereignty. 
  [Dupont] What is the current military situation in Bakassi? 
  [Kontchou] The front is quiet, but I must tell you that this 
quietness is extremely fragile. Everyday detailed reports tell 
us that the Nigerian side is strengthening, is bringing in more 
troops and more equipment. Therefore, things might quickly get 
out of hand. 
  [Dupont] Nigeria considered the arrival of 15 French 
paratroopers in Cameroon a provocation. Was it Cameroon which 
called on France? 
  [Kontchou] Nigeria must know that Cameroon is a sovereign 
country and that it is entitled to choose its allies. It is not 
for Nigeria to choose Cameroon's allies. It is not for Nigeria 
to attack us and then decide who should be our ally after 
attacking us in the first place. We know that the Nigerians, 
who are our neighbors, have a defense policy and know who our 
allies are. If they attack us they know perfectly well in what 
predicament they get involved. 
  [Dupont] So it was Cameroon which called on its ally, 
France? 
  [Kontchou] Yes, it was the Cameroonian Government which 
called on France. The defense agreement between Cameroon and 
France states that if France is attacked, Cameroon should come 
to France's rescue, if Cameroon is attacked the opposite 
applies, namely France should come to Cameroon's rescue. In 
this particular case Cameroon is facing aggression and Cameroon 
decided to call for the implementation of its defense agreement 
with France. 
  [Dupont] France wishes to see a peaceful, a diplomatic 
settlement to this dispute. Do you believe that France will 
continue its support as firmly if war were to break out between 
Nigeria and Cameroon? 
  [Kontchou] We fully understand France. No one likes to wage 
war, France has major interests in both Cameroon and Nigeria, we 
believe that France would not like to see its interests 
sacrificed in one country or another, therefore France is in a 
good position to find a negotiated settlement between both 
parties. However, we in Cameroon have chosen the same solution 
as France. Since we are not ready to abandon a single square 
inch of our territory to anyone, if Nigeria wants to impose war 
on us, what can we do? 
  [Dupont] In this case would it not be a case of David 
fighting Goliath? 
  [Kontchou] In any case not a single square inch of 
Cameroonian soil will be relinquished to a foreign power as long 
as there is a single Cameroonian alive. This is a fact. So, if 
Nigeria forces war on us we will wage a war we do not want. We 
will then rely on our Armed Forces, we will rely on our people 
which is closely united to these armed forces, but we will also 
rely on our allies and mainly on France. We are convinced that 
in this case, if war is forced upon us, France will lend us its 
support till the very end. [end recording]

  [Text] Ndjamena, April 1 (AFP) -- Human rights groups here 
Friday [1 April] deplored a massacre in the eastern town of 
Abeche which left over 200 dead and missing in January. 
  A report issued by a commission of enquiry set up by five 
human rights groups said 201 people had been killed and 23 were 
missing in the wake of clashes between government forces and 
Chad National Front rebels in the town located 500 kilometers 
northeast of here. 
  The government at the time said that 30 rebels and two 
soldiers were killed when the armed opposition group attacked 
the garrison in Abeche on January 23. 
  Most of the rebels, who had earlier agreed to a ceasefire 
and 
then reportedly turned on the government forces, reportedly 
escaped with a number of weapons. 
  But the commission of enquiry said that 201 people had died, 
either in the original clashes or in army mop-up operations in 
the town afterwards, and that there had been numerous cases of 
torture, rape and pillage by government forces against the 
civilian population. 
  "All cases of summary execution were the work of the 
gendarmes and of the soldiers, mostly the Republican Guard whose 
main leaders are known and have been identified," the report 
said. 
  The Republican Guard is an elite army unit which takes its 
orders directly from the head of state. 
  The government forces combed the city looking for rebels who 
might have gone into hiding after the original clashes "and this 
operation very quickly turned into a man-hunt", according to the 
report which spoke of 136 people killed in the city and the 
others nearby. 
  The investigators also met with 23 captured rebels who were 
being held in very poor conditions and of whom those wounded 
were not receiving medical attention.

  [Excerpts] Mogadishu, 5 Apr (AFP) -- Heavy guns pounded 
several parts of south Mogadishu late Monday [4 April] as rival 
Somali clans clashed in the most fierce battle in several 
months, witnesses said. A Somali journalist said at least one 
person was killed in the fighting which lasted almost three 
hours. 
  The fighting occurred between the K4 roundabout on Afgooye 
Road and the seaport. Militiamen exchanged machinegun and 
rocket fire. It was unclear which clans were involved in the 
fighting, but Somali journalists said it pitted "bandits from 
rival clans". 
  South Mogadishu is the fiefdom of warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid 
of the Somali National Alliance (SNA). United Nations deputy 
military spokesman Major Asif Iqbal said no United Nations 
peacekeeping forces were involved in the fighting. "We don't 
know which clans were involved in this", Major Iqbal said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Factional fighting has been escalating during the week, but 
previous clashes involved the use of small arms. Three SNA 
officials were reportedly killed near the October 21 Road on 
Sunday by a lone gunman who fired into a crowd, a Somali 
journalist said. SNA militiamen vowed to retaliate and 
surrounded a building near the stadium.

  [Excerpts] The head of state met with the press at the 
Presidential Palace in Cotonou this morning. For two hours 
President Soglo discussed serious national problems, such as the 
social and political crisis, insecurity, and the effects of the 
CFA franc devaluation. Indeed, one of the causes of the 
political crisis is the devaluation, a development which is 
being capitalized on by some politicians for their own ends. 
This in fact is what the president stated in his introductory 
remarks. President Nicephore Soglo stated that his government 
was open to criticism, and was even prepared to mend its ways 
and change direction, if need be. However, he noted his 
opposition to abuse with the sole purpose of doing harm. Let us 
listen to the head of state: 
  [Begin Soglo recording] The political scene here has been 
characterized by unprecedented tension since the setting up of 
new institutions in April 1991. These tensions stem from 
various sources. The most important of these sources is, 
obviously, the sudden devaluation of the CFA franc, a 
devaluation which we neither wished for nor really planned or 
prepared for. No head of state within the CFA franc zone wished 
for or was prepared for it. 
  The difficulties arising from this situation -- i.e., the 
drastic fall in our population's purchasing power -- 
unfortunately were capitalized on by some of our countrymen, in 
an atmosphere typical of a pre-electioneering campaign period. 
From verbal violence, they progressed to violence in general, 
and even assaults. People simply forgot that impatience can be 
a bad adviser, and that a nation divided against itself is bound 
to perish. They forgot the principle of self-respect, and sold 
our collective dignity dirt cheap. They then sought to trigger 
an institutional war which, had it been prevailed, would not 
have benefited either our budding democracy or even those who 
sought to set it off. On the contrary, it would rather have 
resulted in -- sooner or later -- a questioning of the hard won 
freedom and social peace which was restored thanks to the 
national conference. [passage omitted] 
  We cannot afford to forget so soon the disastrous effects of 
the disorder of dirty politics, which gave our country the 
unenviable tag of Africa's sick child in the early years of her 
independence, and which served as a pretext for military 
takeovers. We cannot forget the long tragedy from which we were 
narrowly rescued by the February 1990 national conference. We 
had to create a collective reawakening of the entire Beninese 
people and a new sense of patriotism, solidarity, tolerance, and 
collective dignity. We had to achieve, on some basic questions, 
the broadest consensus possible, a prerequisite for a fresh 
start. Since then we have been trying to establish a 
law-abiding state together. The 11 December 1990 Constitution 
clearly laid down the rules of the democratic game. It makes 
political succession possible. Each one must agree to play the 
game in a serene and loyal manner. No one has the right to 
resort to violence. Power will henceforth be determined only 
through the ballot box. Power is no longer attainable through 
the gun. The real battle has a new stake -- public opinion. 
Like any other kind of battle, it can be tough. But if we love 
our country, we must ensure that such political clashes -- which 
are necessary and unavoidable -- preserve our collective dignity 
and honor and that they do not, at any time, call to question 
the indispensable consensus on the nation's philosophy and major 
objectives. [end recording] 
  On the problem of security, the head of state said he was 
disturbed about the kidnapping of the Boukoumbe subprefect, and 
stated that the government is doing everything possible to 
secure his release. The president noted in passing that the 
growing insecurity in our country is not the result of laxity or 
a lack of firmness on the part of the government, but rather of 
the refusal of some political groups and leaders to respect the 
code of ethics laid down by the national conference. 
Henceforth, all legal measures necessary for the security of 
the state and the protection of life and property will be 
implemented rigorously and firmly, the head of state stressed. 
  He took this opportunity to seriously warn students 
responsible for acts of violence. While remaining open to 
dialogue, he said, the government will not allow the university 
to become a breeding ground for criminality, indiscipline, or 
intolerance. The head of state also touched on the devaluation 
of the CFA franc and on its consequences on citizens' living 
conditions. Let us listen to him: 
  [Begin Soglo recording] Ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January, 
before the nation, I reviewed the government's determination to 
limit, as best as we can, the negative effects of the 
devaluation on the various socioprofessional categories. In 
this regard, I announced certain backup measures. Wage-earning 
workers, including the public sector's civil servants, have 
suffered greatly from the effects of the devaluation, as have 
all the other components of the national community. Yet, they 
are legitimately anxious to preserve their purchasing power. I 
make it a point to commend them once again for their significant 
contribution to the building up of New Benin and the 
reconstruction of its economy. Furthermore, the government is 
happy concerning the sense of responsibility exhibited by all 
those among them who understood that their particular demands 
can be met only within the framework of a general solution to 
the nation's problems. The government remains open to dialogue 
with all workers. However, I would like them all to understand 
that Benin is a tiny country with limited resources, and that it 
is impossible to consider only civil servants' demands and close 
our eyes to the existence of industrialists, traders, and 
farmers, who comprise 80 percent of the population. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, in my 19 September 1991 radio and 
television address to the nation I stated that I will never lie 
to the Beninese nation, because I consider my people a 
population of mature and responsible adults. I firmly stick to 
this pledge. The government is responsible for the interests of 
the entire nation and each of its components. It neglects no 
one, and similarly it will not favor any categories to the 
detriment of others, or in contempt of our dignity. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Lansana Conte in Conakry </F>
on 2 April--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Guineans, 10 years ago our valiant soldiers 
came to power by making a certain number of promises to you. 
The most important of these promises was the commitment made to 
endow our country with democratic institutions so our people can 
choose their representatives. This year, on the eve of 3 April 
1994, I address you with particular delight. The 19 December 
1993 multiparty presidential elections constitute one of the 
most important accomplishments of the democratization process in 
our country. 
  Of course, one cannot talk about these elections without 
paying tribute to the whole country and without mentioning 3 
April 1984. This date was an historical turning point when all 
the sons of the country came together to form a united, strong, 
and prosperous Guinea. This turning point also enabled us to 
open up to the outside world, establish individual and 
collective freedoms, prepare for economic liberalism, adopt a 
constitution, and create all the constitutional institutions, 
all the things that are indispensable for the establishment of a 
country where the rule of law prevails. Like 28 September 1958, 
3 April 1984 is a milestone in the glorious history of our 
country. That is why I pay glowing tribute to all those who, 
either known or unknown, contributed to the accomplishment of 
this permament task, particularly the members of the Military 
Committee of National Redress and our valiant Army who were able 
to bring Guineans together to fight against the challenges of 
the moment. 
  Dear countrymen, I have already said the real winner of the 
presidential election of December 1993 remains the people. My 
wish is that Guineans would use this victory to improve 
democracy building in the country. This means each and everyone 
should contribute his part to regular legislative elections in 
the future and for all to respect the laws and republican 
institutions. Furthermore, I am pleased with the detente which 
characterizes the current political and social scene. Credit 
must go to all the nation's politicians for this important 
achievement. This victory should also serve as an impetus to 
the socioeconomic development of the country, which is 
undoubtedly one of the conditions for the survival of democracy. 
I call on all sons and daughters of the country to view the 
first five-year term of office of the Third Republic as an 
example of the profound change possible within the appropriate 
institutional framework. We must create the basis for the 
genuine revival of the national economy, work toward integrated 
development, and modernize through a change of attitude and 
behavior. It is clear the subregional, regional, and 
international economic atmosphere is difficult, but I have 
confidence in the creative and fighting spirit of Guineans. 
  In regard to economic growth, I consider energy and 
communication infrastructure essential for a real economic take 
off. That is why sustained efforts have been directed and will 
continue to be directed toward these priorities. I am pleased 
to inform you, dear countrymen, that negotiations with financial 
backers have been successful and the construction of the 
Garafiri Dam will begin by the end of this year. The 
reorganization of the energy and post and telecommunications 
sectors should soon help improve the operations of these 
services. Road construction projects under way on some of our 
highways should be multiplied to take the country out of its 
isolated situation. I remain convinced that the cornerstone of 
our development rests with the farmer. It is therefore 
appropriate to intensify the policy of agricultural development 
and support the village water supply program which is beneficial 
to our people in the rural areas. 
  One of our major social problems now is unemployment. I 
therefore call on the creative ability of Guineans for the 
exploitation of the private sector. When this sector is 
harmoniously coordinates with government's efforts it can 
generate employment within the framework of national solidarity. 
It is at this cost that we can achieve a more balanced society. 
  Fellow Guineans, achieving this large-scale program requires 
huge resources. Unfortunately, we are poor. Therefore, the 
thing to do is to judiciously use existing resources while 
seeing to the sound management of government property. 
  Furthermore, by maintaining and improving our country's 
relations with international financial institutions and friendly 
countries, on the basis of already secured confidence, we can 
count on the support required for our economic recovery. It is 
understood that all external contributions should essentially be 
acquired to supplement our own efforts. 
  Meanwhile, the policies pursued so far in developing the 
education and health infrastructure has helped to achieve 
results considered exemplary on the continent. These policies 
should be resolutely continued and reinforced. To enable our 
women and youth to fully fulfill their roles in building up the 
country, it is important to reactivate their organizations at 
all levels. The same goes for labor unions, whose function 
should be adapted to the new situation. 
  Fellow Guineans, in being confronted with all sorts of 
challenges, African states have no other options than to join 
their resources within the framework of subregional groupings, 
or even larger ones. It is this profound conviction which makes 
me say that backing subregional integration will be one of the 
guidelines of our African policy. 
  Concerning the Liberian conflict, the Guinean people's 
efforts remain fruitful. In fact, the recent installation of 
institutions which are expected to lead to the democratic 
elections called for by all Liberians has proved that our 
people's views are correct. 
  South Africa is preparing for its first multiracial 
elections, and their success will sanction an end to the 
apartheid system. In the Middle East, our desire to always 
strive for the defense of justice and the people's legitimate 
rights has always dictated our position of principle. This 
stand has always inspired our unflinching support for the 
Palestinian people's just cause. The progress made in seeking 
solutions to the Israel-PLO conflict comforts us. To contribute 
to the peace process which has been initiated, we will bring the 
necessary changes to our policy to back and favor the 
establishment of a constructive dialogue between the 
protagonists. But we will do this without any shady deals, and 
by making sure that justice has prevailed. In the same vein, it 
is noted that the former Yugoslavian crisis continues. But 
recent efforts by the United Nations and Europe give us hope. 
  Dear countrymen, our road is long and inevitably strewn with 
obstacles. However, the future is bright. While wishing you a 
happy anniversary, I call on you to set to work to make the 
first five-year plan the plan for all and sundry. But this 
should be done in a spirit of sound emulation, equity, 
tolerance, and peace. 
  Long live the Republic!

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It's beginning to look like the biggest stumbling 
block towards peace in Liberia. It's the continuing fighting 
between Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] and the Liberia Peace Council [LPC] in the east of the 
country. Much of the fighting had been around the River Cess in 
the Grand Bassa County, but now it seems like the battle is 
concentrated further north towards the Cote d'Ivoire border, 
around the town of Zwedru, with thousands of refugees fleeing 
the clashes towards the town of Tapeta. From Monrovia, our 
correspondent, Nii Nartey Allison, sent this telex: 
  More than 2,000 refugees have so far arrived in Tapeta. And, 
according to United Nations officials, they are fleeing fighting 
between the NPFL and the Peace Council in Zwedru. Zwedru has 
twice changed hands and it is not yet clear which group is in 
control of the town. Fierce fighting is said to be continuing 
around the border village of To and the United Nations Observer 
Mission today declared the region a no-go zone. According to 
United Nations officials, atrocities in southeastern Liberia by 
both the LPC and the NPFL have extended into Zwedru, and 
hundreds of residents have fled into the surrounding forests. 
  The UN said that local officials in Tapeta were physically 
preventing some of the escapees from entering the town. Some 
300 people are on the move, trying to escape fighting, said a 
senior UN official, but they are being prevented by local 
authorities from entering Tapeta because of congestion. 
Journalists, who attempted at the weekend to go into the area, 
were stopped in Gbarnga by the NPFL. The United Nations said 
that there is a dire need to move in with food, medicines, 
temporary accommodation. They said that 500 malnourished 
children aged between one to 12 are in desperate need of food, 
medicines, and clothing. The United Nations said that 
panic-stricken Zwedru residents arrived in Tapeta and the 
village of Diala, 10 miles southeast of Tapeta, with bullet 
wounds. The French charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres, the only 
aid agency operating in the area, moved in last week with 
measles vaccine from mobile clinics. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations today said that a fresh influx 
of 700 displaced people arrived in the port city of Buchanan on 
Saturday [2 April], fleeing continued skirmishes between the 
NPFL and the LPC in River Cess County.

  [Text] Venancio de Moura, foreign affairs minister of the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, is currently visiting Lunda Sul Province. His call on 
the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, 
for become engaged in more fighting, has enraged the people. 
Reports say that the MPLA-PT foreign minister does not believe 
in the Lusaka peace talks. He showed similar spirit during the 
negotiations in Estoril, which led to the signing of the fragile 
Bicesse Accord. 
  A source in Lunda Sul Province said yesterday that Venancio 
de Moura's remarks in Saurimo are in line with the Luanda 
regime's warmongering plans for this year as announced by Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos in his New Year message.

It is the CDA, Angolan Democratic Confederation. The party, 
which is still making arrangements for registration with the 
Supreme Tribunal, has said the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] cannot be the only political 
parties in the country. Gaspar Neto, chairman of the CDA's 
constituent commission, felt indignant when he said: 
  [Begin Neto recording] The Angolan problem will not be 
resolved by only those two political forces. [end recording] 
  Gaspar Neto is a man of few words but feels distressed with 
the crisis that has brought the country to its knees. He did 
not announce an immediate solution to the country's problems, 
but said nobody should be in power for ever. 
  [Begin Neto recording] Parties cannot aspire to power the 
moment they come into being. We will learn from Angolan and 
international experiences. At the right moment we will disclose 
to Angola and the world the CDA's plans to gain power. [end

  [Excerpts] Alvaro Machate, a member of the Collegiate 
Commission of the National Convention Party (PCN) and head of 
the party's administration department has told NOTICIAS that the 
PCN will not contest the presidential elections. He said the 
PCN will only contest the legislative elections. 
  He said opposition parties should unite to find a single 
presidential candidate because "we are about 16 officially 
registered parties, and if each one of us submits its candidate 
we will risk splitting the votes and encouraging war." [passage 
omitted] 
  Turning to the system of government that would eventually be 
in place in the country, he is for the "establishment of a 
government of national unity." He noted that "this country has 
gone through many years of war and people do not know each other 
well. Hence, it would be advisable for whoever wins the 
presidential election, not to consider only his party, but other 
people with potential, if he wants to guarantee peace."

<F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>
  [Text] As the tragic Angolan situation has taught us, the 
formation of a truly national army before the elections is a 
basic condition for the peace process to anchor at the port of 
democracy with no problems. 
  In Luanda, this aspect was taken lightly by the United 
Nations, which, a few days before elections were held, hurriedly 
"decreed" the existence of a single armed forces and the 
disbanding of troops of the warring factions. This was 
something that only existed on paper because in practice, as 
everybody knew, both the MPLA [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] kept the "crack units" of their 
respective military forces in place, as a precaution for what 
could come afterward. 
  What did "come" afterward was an armed conflict of 
consequences even more serious than the previous ones, with 
FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] and 
FALA [Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] emerging on the 
ground better equipped than ever before. 
  It was a new and bloody civil war that shattered, as if it 
were a soap bubble, the fragile and theoretical "intention" of a 
single national army that Unavem [UN Angola Verification 
Mission] decided to bring about at full steam. 
  Thus, before one debates the reasons that one or the other 
of 
the contenders on the Atlantic coast gave to resume the mutual 
slaughter, we will have to attribute to the UN's criminal 
precipitation and hasty "washing of hands" the main 
responsibility for the bloodbath that continues in a country 
once again deprived of a future of progress and peace. 
  Meanwhile, in Mozambique, the United States, the Unomoz [UN 
Operations in Mozambique], and the government are together 
traveling down a "path of disaster," similar in all aspects to 
the one traveled in Angola. Taking advantage of its status as 
the only superpower, Washington insists that elections ought to 
be held in October, alleging lack of "patience" and resources to 
finance the process, while shrugging its shoulders about the 
possibility of pushing Mozambicans to a pre-electoral abyss. 
The United Nations is servilely attuned to that rationale, 
closing its eyes both to the facts and the government's sabotage 
of the process, while keeping itself busy arranging and 
rearranging timetables -- in fact manipulating the lives of 
millions of Mozambicans as if they were mere pawns in a chess 
game. 
  The government is sticking to the "scheduled delay" in 
confining its forces, hindering the emergence of the FADM 
[Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], and giving strong indications 
that it is forming a "stand-by army" that would be on hand in 
case of an electoral defeat. This very serious violation of the 
AGP [General Peace Accord] and this true blow to the prospects 
of future peace and democracy is still being taken lightly by 
Unomoz, which, right now, might have visualized an FADM suitable 
for passing out parades on public holidays as sufficiently good 
for backward Mozambicans for the sake of the sacrosanct 
adherence to timetables. 
  The rest can be neglected -- the prospects of the loss of a 
few more thousands of lives and the continued existence of 
various armies in tandem with a national army that is still on 
the drawing board. What matters is to adhere to the dogma 
originating from the "U.S. boss," as inspired on its "promising" 
Somalia adventure. which was like a bull in a china shop. 
  Aware of Frelimo's [Mozambique Liberation Front] methods and 
"tricks," we know too well the government's hidden intentions in 
delaying the confinement of its troops: to secure the practical 
neutralization of Renamo Defense Force's soldiers while keeping 
in place its army's "elite" units. Afterward, it would be just 
a matter of using any violation of the AGP as a pretext to 
annihilate what is left of Renamo, and then return to the good 
old days of a single party to which half a dozen of smaller 
tamed political groupings would lend a "democratic" and 
"pluralist" facade. 
  This frightening return to the past is, however, something 
which we will oppose with all the means at our disposal, 
regardless of where the pressure may come from.

  [Excerpts] The training of the first group of 82 sappers of 
the future Mozambique Defense Armed Forces (FADM) begins in 
Boquisso, Maputo Province, on 24 April. A team of 10 French 
instructors arrived in Maputo yesterday to give the training 
course, which will last about four months. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Philippe Garcin, military attache at the 
French Embassy, said before the actual training, a minicourse on 
minesweeping techniques will be given to two FADM officers and 
two noncommissioned officers. He added: "Afterward, the 
officers and noncommissioned officers will work closely with the 
French instructors during the training of the platoon." [passage 
omitted] 
  He added that a group of 30 people, including soldiers, 
technicians, and administration personnel is already in Boquisso 
to provide the required security and logistics. 
  The 10-man French training team that arrived in Maputo 
yesterday consists of people assigned to a regiment with great 
minesweeping experience in various countries, including Kuwait, 
Lebanon, Chad, and Cambodia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The ANC says that recommendations made by 
international mediators in talks on possible amendments to the 
constitution will not be binding. An ANC official who did not 
want to be identified said the mediators would be here to 
mediate, not to arbitrate. The mediators, including two former 
foreign affairs ministers, Dr. Henry Kissinger of the United 
States and Britain's Lord Carrington, are due to arrive in South 
Africa this week. The ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] joint 
working committee, which is meeting in Kempton Park today to 
make final arrangements for international mediation, is expected 
to meet the mediators later this week to suggest amendments to 
the constitution.

  [Text] Empangeni, Northern Natal April 5 SAPA--Several 
hundred Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters, many bearing 
traditional sticks and shields, began massing at a field in 
Empangeni in Northern Natal on Tuesday [5 April] in preparation 
for a march to protest against violence. Police tried to 
prevent the protesters from alighting from buses with their 
traditional weapons, although many had assembled on the field 
brandishing sticks and knobkerries in defiance of emergency 
regulations. 
  Police spokesman Maj Margaret Kruger said organisers had 
attempted to obtain permission for marchers to carry the 
weapons, but this had been refused by police headquarters in 
Pretoria. "They don't have permission to carry weapons. We are 
trying to get the IFP leadership to get them together," she 
said, adding that police would request marchers to leave their 
weapons on the buses. 
  She said police did not want to provoke the crowd. "We will 
see how the situation develops." 
  There was a strong police and defence force presence along 
the march route and organisers said they expected thousands more 
supporters to arrive later. 
  The atmosphere was cordial at 10.30AM in spite of a few 
protestations by marchers when police searched them as they 
alighted from buses.

  [Text] [Announcer] Thousands of IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
supporters have started through the streets of Empangeni in 
Zululand, armed with traditional weapons. This is in 
contravention of the emergency regulations. Peter Scott is on 
the line from Empangeni with further details. Peter, can you 
just start by giving us the present situation? Peter, are you 
there? Can you please tell us what is the situation at present? 
  [Scott] At the moment thousands of IFP supporters are 
marching down John Ross Highway on their way to the magisterial 
building in the center of town. Marchers are mostly armed with 
sticks, some with sharpened points, knobkieries, a few spears, 
bullwhips, and axes. Now, earlier a senior police officer on 
the scene, Major Margaret Kruger of the police legal department, 
confirmed that permission was not granted for the marchers to 
carry any weapons during the procession. Later a local IFP 
leader, Mr. Robert Mkhize, spoke to the IFP supporters where 
they were gathering to start marching, and told them that they 
had to hand in some of the traditional weapons. However, most 
of the marchers flouted this order, and they started marching a 
short while ago. 
  [Announcer] And, Peter, can you tell us what is the mood of 
the people? 
  [Scott] I wouldn't say the mood is very tense at the moment. 
People are very noisy, and they're sort of clashing their 
sticks, but I wouldn't say they're in a very bellicose mood. 
It's not as if they're out to make trouble as such. 
  [Announcer] And how strong is the army and police presence? 
  [Scott] Well, the army and police presence is quite 
substantial. There are quite a few members of the Internal 
Stability Division. They've got Nyala riot vehicles. There are 
some SADF [South African Defense Force] people as well. Air 
force helicopters and police helicopters are circling overhead 
and monitoring the situation. 
  [Announcer] And is it clear from watching the crowd that the 
marshals monitoring the crowd are in control of what's going on? 
Is their presence very obvious? 
  [Scott] They're actually very well marked. They've got 
overcoats on with clearly marked IFP colors on them. Now, 
earlier we were told not to speak to any of the supporters. 
We've been told to only speak to Robert Mkhize and also to the 
chairperson of the Inkatha Women's Brigade, Mrs. Faith Gasa, and 
she had some very strong words about the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council]. She said that they have basically been 
forced by the TEC to act in this way, bt she stressed that the 
marchers are not out to make trouble, that they are actually 
there to protest about the massacre in Johannesburg earlier this 
month, and also in support of the king's demands for a sovereign 
kingdom. 
  [Announcer] Right. Finally, what is the mood in the town, 
Peter? 
  [Scott] So far most of the shops along John Ross Highway 
have 
actually closed their doors to business, in anticipation that 
there might be trouble. It's understandable that people are 
probably scared and would rather be safe than sorry. But 
further on in town businesses are still open, but we're on our 
way there to investigate what the situation is. 
  [Announcer] Peter Scott, thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 4 SAPA -- Federal Party leader 
Frances Kendall on Monday [4 April] expressed support for an 
editorial in the latest issue of the London SUNDAY TIMES, 
calling for the postponement of regional elections. The 
editorial accused the National Party and the African National 
Congress leaders' propaganda machines of "perpetrating an 
enormous fraud on 40 million South Africans" by claiming the 
interim constitution was a federal one even when many foreign 
experts had pointed out it was not. 
  Ms Kendall said the only way to bring the Inkatha Freedom 
Party (IFP) into the democratic process was to devolve real 
powers to the regions, then elect regional structures -- not the 
other way around. "All of the regional elections should be 
postponed to allow Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington the 
opportunity to recommend constitutional changes and have them 
implemented. In the meanwhile, a nationally elected body can 
run the country rather than the authoritarian Transitional 
Executive Council (TEC)," she said. 
  Ms Kendall added that the state of emergency and clampdown 
on 
the IFP would not solve the fundamental issue that the 
constitution was not federal, and the real issue of federal 
power was the underlying cause of violence in the country. 
  Meanwhile the National Party (NP) called the tone of the 
SUNDAY TIMES editorial "hysterical", adding that its criticism 
confirmed "we South Africans know more about how to solve our 
problems than a British editor 6,000 miles away." The NP said 
it was acutely aware of risks facing South Africa at present. 
"That is exactly why President (F W) de Klerk took the 
initiative in proposing a meeting between himself, (ANC leader) 
Mr (Nelson) Mandela, (IFP leader) Chief (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi 
and the Zulu king which will take place on Friday." 
  It said that to allege that the NP was guilty of an enormous 
fraud exposed the newspaper's lack of understanding and 
knowledge of the situation in South Africa. "The newspaper's 
implicit claim, that the NP sees the state of emergency in Natal 
as a solution, is without foundation and an indication that its 
editor did not read President de Klerk's statement when he 
announced the state of emergency." The state of emergency, the 
NP stressed, was never intended as a solution.

  [Text] A snap poll by Markinor for the SABC indicates that 
right-wing groups boycotting elections in South Africa enjoy 
little support. At the same time the majority of whites are 
scared for their future under an ANC government. This survey 
was carried out among 500 white South Africans countrywide. 
According to the Electoral Act this opinion poll is one of the 
last of its kind that can be released. After tomorrow the act 
bans the publication of opinion polls indicating support for 
parties, their leaders, or their policies. Ronel van Zyl 
analyzes this opinion poll. 
  [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] The developments in 
Bophuthatswana last month that led to the deposing of former 
President Lucas Mangope contributed to the discrediting of 
right-wing groups. The deployment of Afrikaner National Front 
and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] armed forces in 
Bophuthatswana was rejected by 82 percent of whites. 
  [AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche] A magnificent victory for 
the AWB. 
  [Van Zyl] This remark by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche was 
condemned by 83 percent of whites. Concerning participation in 
the election, 80 percent of whites believe that all right-wing 
organizations should participate. This includes 68 percent of 
right-wing supporters. Eight-four percent of all whites say 
that General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front has made the 
right decision by participating in the election. The idea of a 
homeland is opposed by 60 percent of all whites and 54 percent 
of Afrikaans-speaking whites. The idea enjoys the support of 30 
percent of whites, while only 13 percent are prepared to live in 
such a homeland. 
  Sixty-three percent of whites feel they will be worse off 
under an ANC government, but 90 percent say they will accept an 
ANC government if they are allowed to continue their lives 
unhindered. The opinion poll indicates that the state president 
and National Party leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, is the most 
popular leader among whites. [video indicates 72-percent 
support] He is followed by DP [Democratic Party] leader Dr. Zach 
de Beer [42 percent], whose support has risen sharply over the 
past few months, followed by Gen. Viljoen, CP [Conservative 
Party] leader [37 percent], Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg [17 percent], 
and then Mr. Terreblanche [12 percent]. According to the poll, 
64 percent of Afrikaans speakers say that the AWB is an 
embarrassment to other Afrikaans speakers. There is a 5 percent 
margin of error. [end recording]

  [Text] The ANC has expressed concern about that it calls 
wild rumors about expected anarchy and violence after the 
election. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said that the rumors were 
triggering off a psychosis of fear. 
  Reports at the weekend said that many whites have been 
stockpiling non-perishable supplies in anticipation of trouble. 
The fears were reportedly spurred by the carnage in 
Johannesburg last week, and an anonymous panic list distributed 
to businesses warning about water supplies being cut off and 
power pylons blown up. 
  Mr. Niehaus said that the ANC did not believe that there 
would be more violence after the election and that there was no 
need for concern.

  [Text] Two of the police generals who took voluntary leave 
after being implicated by a Goldstone Commission report on 
alleged third force violence will probably be back at their 
desks today. The commissioner of police, General Johan van der 
Merwe, said yesterday that Lieutenant General Basie Smit and 
Lieutenant General Johan le Roux would resume their duties today 
unless specific evidence was submitted implicating them in 
criminal activites. He added that no such evidence had been 
forthcoming. 
  A spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order said that 
Minister Hernus Kriel would review the positions of the two 
generals today. He said that their future would depend on what 
new information had been uncovered by investigators.

  [Text] Cape Town April 4 SAPA -- The South African Police 
Union [SAPU] has threatened to strike unless member salaries are 
increased to the levels of the National Peace Keeping Force 
[NPKF]. Lt-Col Andy Miller, SAPU national and Western Cape 
president, said on Monday [4 April] that members were prepared 
to "sacrifice the election" if their demands for wage parity 
were not implemented by April 13. 
  The union, which represents 20,000 members, made the threat 
despite a Transitional Executive Council (TEC) proposal to 
treble police salaries from R22.50 [rands] to R61.50. The TEC 
Law and Order Sub-committee is expected to hear the proposal on 
Thursday. Col Miller said, however, that a crippling strike on 
the eve of the election could only be averted if police were 
paid the same as their NPKF counterparts, many of whom earned 
double. "I wouldn't call that blackmail. I'd call it justice. 
We've been treated like animals," he said. He said the TEC's 
proposed increases would fail to match those of the NPKF, whose 
members would earn an additional R35 per day once they were 
deployed. 
  "We will not allow policemen to strike," Law and Order 
Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said on Thursday. He said there 
was "no reason" for a stoppage and "all channels were in place" 
for policemen to air their grievances.

<F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>
  [Text] East London April 4 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
should tell kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to stop 
his nonsense because the African National Congress was not 
prepared to postpone the election, Major-General Bantu Holomisa 
said on Monday. Gen Holomisa, who heads Transkei's Military 
Council and is also a senior ANC candidate for the National 
Assembly, was speaking to about 4,000 people at an ANC rally in 
a sports stadium at Duncan Village, East London. The rally was 
shifted at the last minute from a venue in a community hall when 
it became clear that the hall could not accommodate the number 
of people who wanted to hear him. 
  Gen Holomisa said kwaZulu was under President de Klerk's 
jurisdiction. "He must not create an impression that kwaZulu is 
an independent state. It is him personally who must see there 
is stability in that area." 
  The ANC was not impressed by Mr de Klerk's attempts to draw 
its president Mr Nelson Mandela and other people into the 
conflict. "All he must do is to tell Buthelezi that the nonsense 
must stop now, and it must stop as soon as possible, because we 
are not prepared to postpone the elections in South Africa 
because of one man." 
  Gen Holomisa also said under a new government, all weapons, 
which had been handed over by the state to whites "under the 
pretext of self defence", would be confiscated and returned to 
armouries. This included weaponry issued to SADF [South African 
Defense Force] Citizen Force Commandos. It was these weapons 
which had been used to kill people in Bophuthatswana. There 
were also people in the community who owned illegal weapons. 
"We must come up with a campaign to make sure we demilitarise 
our population," he said. Ordinary citizens who had licensed 
private firearms would be allowed to keep them.

  [Text] Transkei leader Major General Bantu Holomisa says 
homeland chief ministers will not be receiving salaries after 
June. He was speaking on his campaign trail in the [Orange] Free 
State. Gen. Holomisa also said that drastic steps would be taken 
after the election to restore law and order in South Africa. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Richard Newton] The general 
addressed ANC supporters at (Mothente) at Theunissen and 
(Mangaoen) in Bloemfontein today. During the rally he said that 
ANC president Mr. Nelson Mandela would become the new paymaster 
on the 10th of May. Apart from the axing of salaries for 
homeland ministers, he said, the ANC government would also cut 
the defense budget. The money saved here would be used to 
improve the living standard of blacks. Gen. Holomisa said that 
ANC policy after the election would be to restore law and order. 
This swould be done by taking drastic steps agaisnt the right 
wing and Inkatha. 
  [Holomisa] You will no longer see the right-wingers having 
training camps, or going to the shooting range, or marching 
through the streets carrying weapons, or wearing uniforms. 
There will be no private armies under the rule of the ANC. 
  [Newton] The general also said that all weapons being used 
for self-defense must be handed over to the new government after 
the 27th of this month. He said it was a blessing that the 
Goldstone Commission had exposed the generals who were providing 
guns to the Inkatha Freedom Party. He added that the pressure 
was now on the state president to quell the violence. He also 
told prospective farmers that farmers with more than one farm 
would have to share with those who want farms. Ninety-three 
billion rands had been budgeted by the ANC for housing, he said, 
and 23 billion for education. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 4 SAPA -- Transkei military 
leader Gen Bantu Holomisa should "come clean" on allegations 
that some of his cabinet ministers and MP's are seeking to gain 
control of 100,000 ha [hectare] of state-owned land before the 
elections, says the National Party [NP]. An NP statement on 
Sunday quoted news reports as saying some sales in this 
connection had already been approved by the Transkei cabinet. 
"This is exactly the kind of corruption which thrives under 
military dictatorships." General Holomisa should immediately and 
publicly state if these allegations were true and what his role 
was in the affair, the NP said. 
  "If these allegations are true it will confirm our suspicion 
of massive abuse of power by the Holomisa government."

  [Text] Get chlorine pills, ensure you have enough firewood, 
give each member of the family a well-stocked backpack and a 
healthy supply of non-perishable food. 
  This is not the checklist for a family hike. It's a sample 
of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] list of precautions 
to ensure that members will be able to deal with the pandemonium 
it predicts will erupt around the time of the election. The 
full list, which includes ensuring that there are sufficient 
weapons and ammunition for all family members and enough food 
for all pets, was distributed at schools in the Pretoria area 
this week. 
  Its more extreme entries are enough to inspire 
bunker-building activities among rightwingers, frantic shopping 
for canned food among DP [Democratic Party] supporters and a lot 
of gun-cleaning in the northern suburbs. 
  "In the time which is approaching it will be wise to be 
prepared at all times. Herewith the guidelines which will 
ensure you will not be caught off-guard," begins the four-page 
document. 
  First up is to ensure you have enough water. That means 
protecting all water sources and getting plenty of chlorine 
pills. 
  Food supplies should be canned or preserved and not require 
water for preparation, it says. 
  Pick 'n Pay group marketing director Martin Rosen says sales 
of non-perishable foods soared countrywide this week. "People 
are certainly stocking up, especially on things like tinned 
foods, long-life milk and milk powder. 
  "Each of our stores is several million rands up on budget -- 
up to 50 percent -- for March as a result," he says. 
  The frantic buying is fairly evenly spread around the 
country. Rosen says supply problems have been compounded by 
strikes which have affected some of the grocery chain's 
suppliers. 
  If the pamphlet's medical hints are anything to go by, do 
not 
expect to be able to get on to any first-aid courses in the next 
three weeks. Antibiotics, pain killers and stomach medication 
could also be in short supply. 
  Its communications suggestions will likely result in a lot 
of 
neighbourly visits and improved cellular phone sales. 
  Despite intimations that the list is not "the alpha and 
omega", its author says only those who are prepared will survive. 
  An AWB head office spokesman said the phamphlet was probably 
compiled by one of the organisation's local committees, which 
were responsible for ensuring the safety of their supporters.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  National Party Picks Up Support at ANC Expense -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 5 April in a page-8 
editorial refers to an opinion poll commissioned by THE STAR and 
carried out by Marketing and Media Research, shows that the "NP 
[National Party] has picked up support, largely at the expense 
of the ANC." THE STAR concludes that "the assumption that the 
ANC will win a two-thirds majority -- and thus be able to impose 
a constitution of its own choice, subject only to constitutional 
principles hammered out at the multiparty negotiations -- is not 
justified. Whether the ANC can win two-thirds of the vote 
depends on the final phase of the election campaign." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Natal Emergency `Harsh Signal' to Buthelezi -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 5 April in a page-6 editorial 
comments on the state of emergency imposed in Natal saying, 
"April 27 will dawn with hundreds of people being held in 
detention without trial, subject to interrogation and with only 
limited protection from security force excesses." "No official 
of the government, the South African Defence Force or the 
Transitional Executive Council has answered the point made by 
both the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and the Human Rights 
Commission: that remedies other than the emergency declaration 
exist to bring stability to Natal. Though not all of their 
suggestions seem appropriate, it is worth asking why, for 
example, tighter controls on meetings and bans on the training 
of private armies and the carrying of weapons require emergency 
rule. This leaves the impression that one important motive for 
the emergency is psychological: that government and the ANC 
decided it was necessary to send a harsh signal to Inkatha 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi." 
<H8>  CAPE TIMES </H8>
  Skepticism Over ANC, NP Economic Growth Promises -- Cape 
Town 
CAPE TIMES in English on 29 March in a page-8 editorial says the 
economic growth stimulation plans by the NP and the ANC for the 
Western Cape should be evaluated "with more than a pinch of 
electioneering scepticism." Both parties are "offering jobs and 
houses by the thousands" in the Western Cape. "Promises which 
will, by and large, prove as good as the national economy 
allows. The converse of that fact, of course, is that the 
national economy in the new dispensation is a reflection of 
relative regional performance. So while there can be little 
doubt over which party will run the country, it will have to 
co-ordinate efficiently with the provincial administrations to 
ensure maximum overall development." 
  ANC Quiet on `Undemocratic' Actions of Candidate Holomisa -- 
A second editorial on the same page notes that Transkei leader 
Bantu Holomisa maintains that the NP cannot open an office in 
the homeland "until the NP and his thoroughly unrepresentative 
government have discussed `security'." Holomisa is using 
"illegitimately gained powers" to deny the NP access to a 
significant element of the voting population. "These are not 
merely the antics of a whacky dictator. They are the actions of 
one of the ANC's leading candidates." "Yet the ANC, which 
justly waxes so lyrical in condemning the undemocratic actions 
of a Lucas Mangope or an Oupa Gqozo, keeps quiet. The message 
is clear: An authoritarian dictator is easily tolerated as long 
as he or she is on the ANC side."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Reginaldo Silva in Luanda on the </F>
"London Last Minute" program; italicized passages recorded] 
  [Text] Luanda, the Angolan capital, has been in darkness 
since 2 April, following an attack on Cambambe Dam. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, 
rebels have been blamed for that attack. This latest operation 
by the UNITA forces occurs at a time when military clashes are 
intensifying in Cuanza Norte Province. The government forces 
appear to be determined to wrest the city of N'dalatando, the 
capital of Cuanza Norte Province, back from UNITA's hands. 
Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, provides the 
details: 
  [Silva] The Angolan capital has again been deprived of 
the power supplied by Cambambe Dam, which lies slightly more 
than 180 km southeast of Luanda. The UNITA rebels have been 
accused of carrying out a major sabotage operation involving the 
Luanda-Cambambe powerlines on 2 April. The exact extent of the 
damage is not known yet. 
  Official sources have said that at least four pylons 
near the actual dam were blown up. However, damage appears to 
have been far more extensive and pervasive than that and the 
results of the attack have already become visible: Luanda is 
partially in the dark and its residents are facing added and 
serious problems that will likely not be resolved in the short 
term. 
  Alternative power supply sources include two gas 
turbines and a number of generators around Luanda, but they will 
probably be good for little more than 50 percent of the city's 
needs in a rotating system. The power supply company has 
already made its usual calls for consumers to use available 
power as sparingly as possible. 
  That sabotage operation occurs at a time when various 
sources have reported fierce clashes to be under way in Cuanza 
Norte Province. Cambambe Dam is in that province and 
N'dalatando, the UNITA-held provincial capital, is seen as the 
major target for the government forces. 
  The UNITA radio station has quoted UNITA sources as 
saying that the government forces have embarked on an offensive 
to recapture N'dalatando. The first such offensive failed 
recently, but new operations are under way aimed at that target. 
Though Cuanza Norte Province has always been beset by 
considerable tension, it is curious to note that the powerlines 
linking Luanda and Cambambe Dam had so far not been one of 
UNITA's military targets. The Angolan capital had in fact 
enjoyed a stable power supply for many months now. Observers 
feel that such power supply stability can be explained by a 
tacit accord between the two warring factions, because Cambambe 
Dam also provides power to the city of N'dalatando. Thus, 
Luanda's power supply would have been assured as long as the 
capital for Cuanza Norte Province also received it. Indications 
are that the tacit accord has been terminated and the next few 
days do not seem likely to bring any positive developments 
concerning peace for Angola. 
  The intensification of military clashes in Angola precedes a 
UN Security Council meeting on that country scheduled to be held 
within the next two days. It is expected that the UN Security 
Council will issue a new resolution at a time when the Lusaka 
peace talks have ground down to a complete deadlock. This 
afternoon, we interviewed Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, the Angolan 
ambassador to the United Nations. We asked him what the Angolan 
Government would have liked to see the UN Security Council 
resolution include. 
  [Mbinda] Our government would like to see that 
resolution include the following passage: That the UN Security 
Council has already decreed sanctions against UNITA. The second 
package of sanctions has not come into force yet because the UN 
Security Council has deemed that this is not the right time yet 
for imposing additional sanctions. I believe that was an 
opinion voiced by the UN Security Council some months ago. 
However, in view of UNITA's inflexibility and its failure to 
abide by the resolutions and recommendations of the UN Security 
Council, it is our belief that conditions are in place for new 
measures to be taken against UNITA. 
  The additional measures alluded to by Angolan Ambassador to 
UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda include, notably, the freezing of 
UNITA funds abroad and the imposition of restrictions on the 
movement of its representatives outside Angola. Seeing that the 
imposition of such sanctions has been put off on several 
occasions, we asked the Angolan ambassador to the United Nations 
why he thought such measures might be approved now. 
  [Mbinda] This is a problem we have had with the UN 
Security Council. In all its meetings so far, the UN Security 
Council has been lenient about the introduction of additional 
sanctions against UNITA. Thus, everything hinges on the UN 
Security Council itself. We believe, however, that the UN 
Security Council has become so disappointed that it will take 
the necessary measures this time.

  [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni has called upon the 
seventh Pan-African congress to analyze the internal weaknesses 
in Africa which make the continent vulnerable to foreign 
domination so that solutions can be designed. The president, 
who was opening the seventh Pan-African congress at the 
conference center in Kampala today, told the congress 
participants that in order to emancipate ourselves from foreign 
domination we as Africans must know what to do. He described 
the Kampala congress as a good moment to make a correct 
diagnosis so that Africa gets an answer. 
  Mr. Museveni attributed Africa's problem to internal African 
weaknesses both now and in the past and to external greed by 
outside powers. He identified the main internal weaknesses of 
Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed 
the question of poor organization as having played the most 
crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia, 
and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend 
their sovereignty due to a high level of organization. 
  Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's 
self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most 
important factors to be independent is production, and yet 
African governments have continuously interfered with production 
by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and 
marketing monopolies. He said African governments have 
themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore 
called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their 
self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions. 
  On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and 
America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral 
responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by 
their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate 
herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors. 
However he was of the view that compensation for the past 
injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a 
position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore 
commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize 
But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our 
means to end domination. 
  Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting 
to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not 
ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating 
on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni 
categorized these as the black Africans on the African 
Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the 
Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a 
new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to 
draw ideology into the movement but to accept all 
Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of 
the movement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kampala, April 5 (AFP) -- Tempers flared here on 
Tuesday [5 April] between northern and southern Sudanese 
delegations during a debate on the situation in Sudan at the 
six-day seventh Pan-African Congress. 
  Tempers soared after Sudanese delegate Abu Zaidi, who 
introduced himself as representative of the Sudanese 
non-governmental Friendship Council for Sudan, accused the rebel 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of betraying the cause of 
pan-Africanism by accepting sponsorship from "imperialists". 
  Some 30 SPLA delegates shot to their feet and complained to 
the congress chairman Colonel Kahinda Otafire that Zaidi, whom 
they accused of being "a planted agent of the Sudanese 
government", was insulting their organisation. 
  But Otafire, director of Uganda's External Security 
Organisation, instead called in the police to remove the 
protesting SPLA men from the congress floor, a decision that 
enraged them and their supporters from other countries, 
particularly the Caribbean. The SPLA group immediately embarked 
on a protest within the hall, pulling out placards, one of which 
read: "We demand an independent state of Southern Sudan". 
  The protest, which lasted 30 minutes, brought the congress 
to 
a standstill, until some delegates persuaded the SPLA group to 
sit down to allow business to resume. 
  In his address to the congress the previous night, SPLA 
leader John Garang blamed the Sudanese problem on the domination 
of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Islamic, 
Arabised north. 
  Garang stressed that the proposal by the Sudanese government 
that southerners would be exempted from the Sharia law "was 
unacceptable, as it reduced non-Moslems to second class 
citizens". 
  "We propose a confederal Sudan as a temporary measure to end 
the war, but the talk that they will crush the SPLA cannot work. 
I assure you fellow pan-Africanists that we will not be 
crushed, we are there to stay", Garang declared.

  [Text] The five-day old state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal 
faced its first major test today. A protest march by thousands 
of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters in Empangeni went 
ahead under the watchful eye of a strong security force 
contingent without any incidents of violence; but large sections 
of the crowd, which assembled at an open field before the march, 
refused to lay down their traditional weapons in defiance of the 
emergency regulations. This report from Veronica van der 
Westhuizen and cameraman Koen Marnewijk: 
  [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] Bus loads of people 
arrived from all over Zululand to mourn the death of more than 
50 Zulus who died in Johannesburg on Monday last week. They 
also turned out in force to show their support for King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. Security force members were present in large 
numbers at an open field where the group gathered before the 
march, but they proved to be no deterrent to the IFP supporters 
who alighted from busses openly displaying traditional weapons. 
  [Police Legal Services spokesperson Major Margaret Kruger] 
As 
you can see they are trying to take them off as they come of the 
busses, and what I think they envisage doing is asking the 
organizers to please speak to the people and explain to them 
what has happened. We will then ask the organizers who have 
been cooperating with us all along to not allow ... [changes 
thought] to ask the people not to display and carry the weapons 
during the march. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] An attempt by a couple of policemen to 
confiscate the weapons failed. The police then held a meeting 
with the local leadership in an effort to persuade their 
followers to leave their weapons behind while marching. IFP 
organizer Mr. Reginald Mkhize then asked the people to do so. 
  [Mkhize] Due to the fact that the state of emergency came to 
us... [changes thought] Whilst in our hand we have the permit 
to hold this march, we could not get enough time to tell our 
people not to bring those so-called dangerous weapons. For that 
reason we are trying our best to take whatever is dangerous and 
keep it into our bakkie [pickup truck] so that our people are 
not seen carrying them. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] The crowd expressed its dissatisfaction 
and only a few sharp objects were handed in. The march then 
proceeded through the heavily guarded streets of Empangeni. 
Police and the army were stationed outside properties along the 
route and barbed wire was put up in front of premises housing 
the local ANC branch. A memorandum was then handed over to 
representatives of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. 
In it the IFP strongly attacked the IEC, saying that it was a 
product of what it called the ANC-dominated Transitional 
Executive Council. 
  [IFP spokesman Muzi Gwala] If the IEC makes it possible to 
force the installation of the polling booths in our areas before 
our demands are met, I am afraid the people will use even their 
own teeth to tear them down. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] The IFP's demands included the 
postponement of the election and a federal state. The IFP says 
if their demands are not met the IEC would find it difficult to 
maintain peace and stability that could lead to free and fair 
elections. The IFP also warned that they would ensure that the 
April election would not take place even if it meant losing 
their lives. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Clive Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela will meet Natal ANC leaders in Durban 
on Wednesday to review the Independent Electoral Commission's 
[IEC] contention that elections cannot be held in kwaZulu in the 
current political climate. A working committee, comprising 
representatives from the IEC and the South African and kwaZulu 
governments, concluded on Tuesday that several factors, linked 
to the politically charged climate in kwaZulu, would render free 
and fair elections improbable. 
  These included high levels of political intolerance and 
intimidation and the fact the kwaZulu civil service and tribal 
structures were unable to assist the process for a free and fair 
election. 
  ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Wednesday's meeting with 
Mr 
Mandela would centre on the IEC announcement, and "give full 
consideration to the implication of that announcement and 
provide a preliminary response". 
  "The present climate of violence makes it impossible for 
free 
and fair elections (in Natal and kwaZulu) but it is too early to 
make a decision." 
  Mr Mamoepa said a full statement will be issued after the 
internal meeting. 
  Meanwhile, IEC Chairman Justice Johan Kriegler said a 
decision on whether elections could be postponed in Natal or 
not, was a political one, which lay outside of the IEC's ambit 
of jurisdiction. 
  The matter is expected to be high on the agenda of Friday's 
summit between F W de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Mr Mandela travelled to Durban on Wednesday to address a 
youth conference at the University of Durban-Westville, and will 
then meet with the leadership of Natal's three ANC regions. 
  ANC Midlands spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande said the meeting 
would focus on elections in Natal and "yesterday's (Tuesday) 
development gives it an added significance". 
  The SA Congress of Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party 
will also attend the meeting, which comes amid spiralling 
violence in the province. 
  Since the declaration of the state of emergency last 
Thursday, about 100 people have died in political bloodletting 
in Natal, and last month's toll reached nearly 300 -- the 
highest recorded in several years.

<F P=106> [Report by G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 5 SAPA -- Elections cannot be 
held in kwaZulu in the current political climate, according to a 
unanimous conclusion reached by a joint working committee of the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and the South African and 
kwaZulu governments. 
  Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler said in a statement on Tuesday [5 April] he had 
reported the working committee's conclusion to State President F 
W de Klerk, the Transitional Executive Council, African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. "The IEC has indicated that in the light 
of the report, political measures were required. As such 
measures fell outside its brief, the IEC, as in the past, did 
not make any proposals," the judge said. The IEC is 
nevertheless continuing with its planning of elections in the 
province as a whole, and envisages providing the optimal level 
of voting facilities possible in those areas unaffected by the 
political climate in kwaZulu." 
  He said the effect of the recently-proclaimed state of 
emergency in kwaZulu/Natal could not be gauged as yet, but the 
IEC anticipated it would "significantly contribute to the 
performance of its mandate". An in-depth study was under way 
and would be followed by an inspection in loco by two IEC 
commissioners later this week. They would report to the full 
commission on April 9. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said the working group, set up on March 
28, consisted of heads of relevant kwaZulu government 
departments, representatives of the South African Department of 
Home Affairs, the South African Police and the IEC. 
  He said the working committee gave the following reasons for 
its assessment that an election was not feasible in kwaZulu: 

  -  "the high level of political intolerance and fear, as well 
as large-scale intimidation, which factors have led to the 
current state of emergency; 
  -  "the kwaZulu civil service and tribal structures/authorities 
are, at present, unable to fully assist the process for a free 
and fair election; 
  -  "due to time constraints, the IEC will not be able to follow 
the prescribed protocol required to confirm, evaluate, and 
secure the voting stations; (and), 
  -  "the South African Police and the kwaZulu Police do not 
foresee 
that they will be in a position in the present political climate 
to adequately ensure that the elections are free and fair. This 
is due to the additional demands on its manpower resources 
relating to the level of violence (present as well as future), 
normal policing duties and normal election-related duties."

  [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- The elections should be 
postponed -- not only in kwaZulu but in the whole of South 
Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] said on Wednesday. IFP 
Transvaal political Director Themba Khoza said parties like the 
Pan Africanist supported the postponement of the elections. "It 
is impressive that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
has finally realised the going is too tough to hold elections," 
Mr Khoza said. 
  He was responding to the conclusion reached on Tuesday by a 
joint working committee of the IEC and the South African and 
kwaZulu governments that elections could not be held in the 
current political climate in kwaZulu. 
  "But the Transvaal IFP can never support an election 
postponed only in Natal and not the rest of the country," Mr 
Khoza said. 
  There were two major obstacles hindering the conduct of 
elections -- violence and the constitutional impasse over 
regional powers. 
  "The IEC has finally realised that there is violence. But it 
is not only in Natal, it is gripping the whole country. There 
are no-go areas everywhere and therefore there can be no free 
and fair election throughout South Africa. 
  "We will need to go flat out to finally defuse the tension 
and this cannot be achieved in a short time," Mr Khoza said. 
  He said unless the dispute over regional powers was 
addressed 
and the IFP demands for provincial powers were met, there would 
always be conflict between political organisations. 
  "It is important that these two obstacles be addressed 
before 
we all go to the polls." 
  IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said in reaction to 
the joint report that the political climate in kwaZulu should be 
changed and not the election date. He said two inspectors would 
determine the effects of the state of emergency in kwaZulu and 
would report back to the IEC by Friday. 
  He said that a decision on further action would be taken on 
Saturday.

  [Text] At a news conference today the PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] said that since the inception of a state of emergency 
violence had increased in the Natal Province, and called on the 
government to lift the state of emergency. PAC President 
Clarence Makwetu said the state of emergency involved the 
suspension of basic human rights and would not lead to a free 
and fair election. He said the aim was not to solve the problem 
of violence but to pressurize kwaZulu into talking. 
  [Begin Makwetu recording] The decision of the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council], the ANC, and the regime, to 
declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal is politically 
wrong and tragic. This can only exacerbate a social tragedy, 
that is, military, security power remains with the ruling 
regime. [end recording] 
  Mr. Makwetu also said that the PAC wouldn't oppose a 
postponement of the April elections provided it applied to the 
whole country. He objected to the elections being postponed 
only in kwaZulu-Natal.

<F P=106> [Report by David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] A meeting between ANC Freedom Front and government 
negotiators to sign an accord on an Afrikaner volkstaat 
[homeland] scheduled for last Thursday [31 March], was cancelled 
at the last moment because ANC chief negotiator Thabo Mbeki was 
ill. 
  One of the three facilitators involved in drawing up the 
accord said yesterday that the meeting would take place this 
week, possibly on Thursday. CP [Conservative Party] MP Tom 
Langley was expected to represent the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front] at the meeting. 
  ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said Mbeki has recovered from a 
bout of influenza and was "up and about." After the negotiators 
had signed the accord it would be studied by their leaders. A 
public signing ceremony would be held later, the facilitator 
said. The signing would necessitate revision of the Electoral 
Act. 
  This breakthrough, after months of on-off talks between the 
Volksfront, the ANC and government, would lead to Gen Constand 
Viljoen's breakaway Freedom Front's taking part in the 
elections. Viljoen said after he had registered his party for 
the elections that it would take part only if there was an 
accord on a volkstaat, because constitutional provisions were 
too general. 
  The accord sets out the conditions and the process under 
which a volkstaat could be established. It made provision for 
voters' second ballots to be used to determine how much support 
the volkstaat commanded and where it lay. 
  It is proposed that the Electoral Act be changed to allow 
volkstaat votes to be recorded separately at certain polling 
stations. In terms of the ANC's position, insisted upon by the 
organisation's president Nelson Manadela and Mbeki, the accord 
specified that there would be no racialism or discrimination 
against non-supporters of a volkstaat living in such an area.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan and Clive Govender] </F>
  [Excerpts] Durban April 5 SAPA -- At least 88 people have 
been confirmed killed in six days as violence continues to sweep 
the politically charged Natal/kwaZulu region despite last 
Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency. The toll could 
climb as reports from far-flung rural settlements only reach 
police liaison officials days later. 
  Natal unrest monitor and academic Mary de Haas on Tuesday 
reported 16 additional weekend deaths in northern Natal 
townships and rural areas which police have not yet confirmed. 
  Police reports put the toll at 88 since last Thursday -- a 
staggering average of 14 killings a day under emergency rule. 
  Violence in Natal has reached unprecedented levels with 300 
deaths reported in March -- the highest in the province in 
several years. [passage omitted] 
  The confirmed death toll following violence in kwaMashu near 
Durban on Sunday night has risen to 12, the KZP [kwaZulu Police] 
reported on Tuesday, adding seven to the earlier report of five 
hostel dwellers killed. Capt Zakwe said the latest killings 
were linked to the ongoing political feud which erupted in the 
township after "Zulu royalists" occupied the venue of an African 
National Congress rally three weeks ago. 
  In other recent reports, kwaMashu police said another person 
was shot dead in the township on Monday night. 
  Four youths were gunned down at Folweni south of Durban, 
also 
on Monday night. 
  The badly decomposed body of a man was found in Esikhawini 
on 
the north coast on Sunday night. [passage omitted] 
  Pietermaritzburg police spokesman Maj Henry Budhram said two 
people were killed after a "kangaroo court" hearing on Saturday. 
He said both men were tied to a chair and set alight at

  [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- Police have reported 13 
further killings in Natal this week, pushing the death toll 
since last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in the 
region to at least 101. It emerged on Wednesday that there were 
some overlaps in violence reports from the kwaZulu Police, SA 
Police [SAP] and the SA Defence Force [SADF]. 
  The latest confirmed deaths, however, put the toll at 101 
since last Thursday. 
  Among the overlapping reports was one of six deaths in 
Ndwedwe at the weekend, reported by the SAP on Wednesday. 
  The kwaZulu Police on Tuesday reported 10 weekend killings 
in 
Ndwedwe and it emerged that this included the SAP's report of 
six murders there. 
  The Natal Security Committee -- comprising the SAP and SADF 
-- said 11 more people had been killed in the region since 
Tuesday morning. After investigation, however, it emerged that 
four of these deaths had already been reported. 
  The latest deaths included the fatal shooting of a man at 
Batania mission, near Port Shepstone. 
  In war-torn Bhambayi, north of Durban, a woman was shot dead 
and another injured. 
  In kwaMbonambi, on the North Coast, a man was shot dead. In 
the nearby Masekane area, a school child was fatally shot. 
  In the Northern Natal area of Newcastle, two people were 
killed and seven were injured in an attack at the Mfolozi 
reserve. 
  At the Mashenga reserve, also near Newcastle, a man was shot 
dead. 
  The committee said three houses were burnt down in the 
Drycott area of Estcourt, in the Midlands, and two houses were 
petrol bombed in the Northern Natal area of Dundee. 
  At kwaKhoza, near the North Coast area of Eshowe, security 
forces confiscated sticks, spears, and a firearm from a group of 
20 men. 
  In Wembezi, outside Estcourt, participants of an Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] march were searched and a revolver and 
homemade gun were confiscated along with a quantity of 
ammunition. 
  IFP supporters en route to Tuesday's march in Empangeni were 
stopped in two buses and a shotgun, ammunition, and three 
homemade guns were confiscated. 
  Meanwhile, Wednesday's toll includes six deaths reported 
earlier in Nongoma, Zululand, where three people were shot dead 
in a car, and another three were murdered in a minibus in a 
suspected taxi feud.

  [Text] East London April 5 SAPA -- South African Defence 
Force [SADF] troops deployed in Ciskei are unlikely to be 
withdrawn before the general election, according to the 
commanding officer for the region Brig Toon Slabbert. SADF 
troops poured into the homeland on March 24 in a massive show of 
force and seized key installations following Ciskei military 
leader Brig Oupa Gqozo's decision to relinquish power. 
  At the time fears were expressed that elements within the 
Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] did not fully support the 
Transitional Execitive Council's decision to install an interim 
administration and wanted to return Brig Gqozo to office. 
  Brig Slabbert said on Tuesday that while the situation in 
Ciskei had calmed down, it was not yet "sufficiently stabilised" 
for him to consider withdrawing troops. "Most probably we are 
still going to be here until the election." 
  He said his first responsibility was to ensure all CDF 
weapons were accounted for and that the troops were brought 
under control. An "audit" to establish what, if any, weapons 
were missing from CDF company armouries was almost complete, he 
said. 
  Brig Slabbert said joint patrols had been instituted last 
Thursday, with SADF troops and members of 1 Ciskei Battalion 
each taking an area of responsibility. However, South African 
troops were still in control of government installations. 
  The mechanised units from Bloemfontein and the Army Battle 
School at Lohatla in the Northern Cape, which spearheaded the 
SADF advance into Ciskei, were withdrawn on Sunday and replaced 
by an armoured force from Eastern Province Command, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by E van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 5 SAPA -- The three police generals 
implicated in a Goldstone commission report on third force 
activities would maintain their voluntary withdrawal from 
service pending further investigations, Police Commissioner Gen 
Johan van der Merwe said on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Generals Basie Smit, Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht 
had decided to accede to this request from Attorney-General Jan 
D'Oliviera, who is heading an international investigation into 
the allegations. 
  Dr D'Oliviera had made the request in the interests of an 
impartial and unhindered investigation, Gen van der Merwe said. 
  Generals Smit and Le Roux were back at work on Tuesday but 
their positions were reviewed at a meeting between Gen van der 
Merwe and Dr D'Oliviera on Tuesday. 
  They had been on "voluntary leave" until Tuesday following 
an 
agreement between Gen van der Merwe and the generals that they 
could resume their duties unless specific evidence to justify 
action against them was submitted. 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on Monday announced that he had 
obtained "substantial further evidence" concerning the 
commission's March 18 preliminary report on alleged senior 
police involvement in third force activities. 
  Gen van der Merwe said Dr D'Oliviera had indicated that due 
to the volume of the information he had received from the 
Goldstone Commission, he could not properly evaluate or make a 
statement on the issue at this stage. Dr D'Oliviera had 
undertaken to expedite the evaluation and further investigation. 
  In a separate statement Generals Smit and Le Roux said they 
had previously undertaken to resume duties on Tuesday unless new 
information came to light justifying action against them. They 
said Gen van der Merwe had on Monday informed them that no such 
information had come to his attention and he therefore ordered 
them to resume their duties. 
  Gen van der Merwe re-affirmed on Tuesday after his 
discussions with Dr D'Oliviera that the attorney-general had 
also not mentioned such information, Generals Smit and Le Roux 
said. 
  In a copy of a letter by the investigating task force it was 
said that "...the status quo of withdrawal from service should 
be maintained until we are in a position to decide on 
involvement or not of any person... Re-employment at this stage 
will be against the wishes and advice of the team". 
  The two generals said "to accommodate the 
attorney-general...we are prepared to voluntarily withdraw from 
service for a further period from April 6". 
  They called on Dr D'Oliviera and the task force to evaluate 
the information available as soon as possible to determine 
whether there were any reasonable grounds why their withdrawal 
from service should be maintained. It was essential that the 
matter be brought to a head as soon as possible. "In light of 
the abovementioned we will soon reconsider our position," the 
generals said. 
  Earlier on Tuesday, before the generals again withdrew from 
service, the Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission 
should release specific evidence against the police generals 
implicated in the commission report "as a matter of urgency". 
"The fact that Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have 
decided to return to work, in spite of President (F W) de 
Klerk's order that they stay on leave, raises serious problems," 
said DP Executive Director James Selfe. 
  The discipline of the South African Police [SAP] was 
essential for holding elections later in the month and for a 
successful transition to a new democratic order. Equally 
important was the principle of civilian control over security 
forces. Nothing sapped the effectiveness of the SAP more than 
unresolved allegations of third force activities. "Both to 
clear up these allegations, as well as to avoid a potential 
clash between the SAP senior management and the political 
leadership of the country, it is essential the Goldstone 
Commission makes available the specific evidence as a matter of 
urgency," said Mr Selfe. 
  The African National Congress, in reaction to the generals 
returning to work on Tuesday, said the step was typical of the 
contempt with which senior SAP personnel had sought to cover up 
charges of police complicity in the third force. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
quoted the ANC as saying it was totally unacceptable that any 
officer, who had been implicated in alleged criminal activities, 
be allowed to return to active duty until the allegations had 
been properly investigated, and they had been cleared by due 
process of law.

  [Text] Police are closely monitoring the entry of 
foreigners into South Africa following a shooting incident near 
Pretoria two weeks ago, in which a German right-winger was shot 
dead. 
  This comes amid reports that neo-Nazi sympathisers from 
Europe -- and possibly including battle-hardened Bosnian snipers 
fresh from the Yugoslavian war -- are entering the country to 
assist the local right-wing. Two weeks ago, German right-winger 
Mr. Thomas Kunst, 32, was shot dead in a firefight with police 
near Welbekend. Mr. Stephan Rays, 26, Mr. Horst Klenz, 57, and 
German Mr. Alex Nedelnein were later arrested. The men were 
apparently invited to South Africa by the right-wing. 
  In the March 14 edition of an international news magazine, a 
Bosnian sniper is quoted as saying they feared revenge attacks 
after the war. "They are hiring men like us in South Africa," 
said the man, identified only as Pipo. Other local reports, 
quoting anonymous right-wing sources, claim that foreign 
mercenaries are already in the country.

<F P=106> [Question put to "main political parties" on "whether they </F>
support a wealth tax and/or a capital gains tax"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  African National Congress </H5>
  The main object of any tax system is to raise revenue as 
effectively (at minimum cost) and as efficiently (with minimum 
distortion of the economy) as possible. This can be achieved 
only through a balanced tax system perceived as fair and 
transparent by most taxpayers. 
  The ANC therefore wants to move away from the ad hoc 
approach 
of the past towards a coherent, consistent and predictable tax 
policy. We are therefore not going to rush in and change the 
system or introduce new taxes just for their own sake. The 
constitution provides for a financial and fiscal commission to 
be created. It will be asked to provide government with advice 
on tax reform to bring about such a desired tax system. 
  The ANC will retain estate duties, donations taxes and 
transfer duties -- each being taxes on the transfer of wealth. 
These may well have to be rationalised, perhaps in the form of 
one capital transfer tax. Wealth taxes should not be confused 
with a capital gains tax which is a tax on income or profit -- 
albeit from the sale of a capital asset. 
  It is unfair to differentiate between that and "normal" 
income, because people who can obtain their income in the form 
of a capital gain would then not pay any tax on it. 
  An analysis of the tax system as a whole will have to 
explore 
the desirability and feasibility of introducing a capital gains 
tax. The commission will also have to advise government on the 
details of such a tax. 
<H5>  Democratic Party </H5>
  In general, the answer is "no". However, in SA [South 
Africa] there is often a misdirected focus on a specific tax or 
taxes. What is far more important is the total amount collected 
in taxes and the level of government spending as proportion of 
GDP. The share of our economy being appropriated by government 
is already uncomfortably high, but it is unlikely that it can be 
reduced rapidly. The danger is that it is allowed to increase 
further. 
  Economic growth is fundamental, and taxation should not 
hinder growth. A market orientated, enterprise-driven economy 
in which private property is respected, in which enterprise is 
recognised and encouraged, in which people are entitled to be 
rewarded for initiative, risk and hard work, and in which it is 
recognised that the private sector, not government, best creates 
wealth in an economy which will prosper. 
  Wealth and capital gains taxes are likely to be 
counterproductive. 
<H5>  Freedom Front </H5>
  SA needs entrepreneurs who produce wealth. Wealth will be 
produced if the producer can enjoy the fruits of his efforts. 
High taxes are no incentive to take risks or work harder. 
Lower taxes will stimulate growth. ANC plans for 
reconstruction and development do not provide hope for lower 
taxes in future and strengthen the perception that they will 
exploit all other possible type of taxes. 
  There is no doubt an ANC-dominated government will levy a 
wealth tax. If, however, they want to encourage growth, this 
should be introduced at a low rate. Redistribution should take 
place in a manner that does not discourage investment. The 
solution does not lie in the introduction of new taxes but the 
better utilisation of present tax income. 
  Although SA has no formal capital gains tax, estate duty 
acts 
as such a tax. We do not favour any further capital gains tax. 
It would not contribute much to revenue and would be difficult 
to administer. And inflation would make it difficult to 
determine the real value of a capital gain. 
<H5>  Inkatha Freedom Party </H5>
  The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] is not in favour of either a 
wealth or capital gains tax. Generally speaking, the IFP is 
against increasing the already high tax burden. High taxes 
serve not only to destroy entrepreneurship and initiative, they 
also encourage the hoarding of resources and thus stunt 
potential for growth. 
  While the IFP is keenly aware of the need to narrow income 
and wealth disparities between population groups, we are not 
convinced that either a wealth or a capital gains tax will prove 
effective in achieving this objective. 
  Importantly, the implementation of either tax, while having 
negligible effect on total revenue collected, will have a 
negative impact on the ability of this country to attract 
foreign investment. One of the few benefits of such taxes would 
be their symbolic value. However, the frightening away of 
investment is a high price to pay to create the illusion that 
there is a redistribution of income and wealth. 
  Further, a capital gains tax is neither equitable nor 
"fair". 
For it to be equitable and fair, all capital gains would need to 
be taxable. Such an approach is needed especially since the 
rich -- having access to better credit facilities -- can always 
avoid asset sales which attract taxes. The middle and lower 
classes, on the other hand, are most likely in times of need to 
be forced for sell their assets and thus incur the tax. 
  Secondly, SA does not have the administrative capacity to 
successfully implement a capital gains tax system which would, 
in turn, demand greater tax administration without actually 
substantially increasing government revenue. 
<H5>  National Party </H5>
  The NP [National Party] does not support a wealth tax 
because 
that would amount to double taxation -- the wealth in the hands 
of a person or company has been taxed before by way of income 
tax, estate duty and indirect taxes. 
  Capital gains tax is something that could be considered, but 
it should be done very carefully because it could discourage 
investment. 
<H5>  Pan-Africanist Congress </H5>
  The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of Azania will use wealth 
and capital gains taxation to address extremes of wealth and 
poverty. 
  Wealth taxation and capital gains tax will be part of a 
broader economic strategy. Capital gains and wealth taxes, far 
from being punitive, are distributive and reconstructive in the 
short and medium term. In the long term, the capital and wealth 
base will be sufficiently broadened to ensure taxation is borne 
by the Azanian society as a whole.

  [Text] The leader of the rebel UNITA [National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola] movement in Angola, Jonas 
Savimbi, has said he remains optimistic that peace talks with 
the government will succeed despite the gloomy assessment by the 
United Nations secretary general. Speaking in central Angola, 
he said UNITA could sign a peace agreement within days. The UN 
secretary general, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, has reported to the 
Security Council that the Angolan peace talks are deadlocked, 
but Mr. Savimbi told a group of especially invited journalists 
that progress at the talks had been so great that the United 
Nations was unlikely to proceed with the imposition of new 
sanctions against UNITA. Mr. Savimbi said he would return to 
the capital, Maputo [as heard], only if his security could be 
guaranteed.

  [Text] On 4 April the Luanda government ordered two of its 
infantry regiments, backed by heavy artillery pieces, to storm 
N'Dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. A military 
source says MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party] troops equipped with M-46, 85-mm, 46-mm, and 
30-mm guns, and various BM-21 multiple rocket launchers, have 
left Dange- ia-Menha. Today, the troops shelled villages along 
the Dange-ia- Menha-N'Dlatando road. The source added that the 
Luanda government intends to disembark special forces behind 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
lines in Cuanza Norte Province. Measures have been taken to 
defend civilians. 
  The Luanda regime is also involved in offensive operations 
in 
Huila and Cuando Cubango Provinces. MPLA-PT troops are fleeing 
in disarray after failing to storm the capital of Quibala 
District from positions in Ebo. Yesterday, UNITA repelled 
MPLA-PT troops led by Lieutenant General Antas after seven hours 
of fierce clashes in Conde region. Our correspondent reports 
that the enemy abandoned two BMP-1 amphibious vehicles, two 
76-mm guns, one 14.5-mm antiaircraft gun, one RPG-7, several 
tonnes of assorted war materiel, and large quantities of 
commodities carrying World Food Program labels. The MPLA-PT 
offensive in Cuanza Sul Province has claimed the lives of more 
than 200 innocent civilians in Conde. The area was shelled by 
Lt. Gen. Antas' long-ranging artillery pieces. These are 
preliminary figures.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] SHOULD be more realistic and prove with facts and 
not maneuvers that it is really interested in national 
reconciliation that guarantees the continuation of the 
democratic process. That is the view of Ambassador Afonso van 
Dunem Mbinda. Speaking during a news conference at the UN 
headquarters in New York yesterday, the Angolan envoy to the 
United Nations accused UNITA of having stepped up its military 
offensive throughout the country while negotiating in Lusaka. 
In doing so, UNITA has sowed death and destruction. As an 
example, Ambassador Mbinda mentioned the destruction of the 
Luanda power lines and the killing of civilians in every corner 
of Angola. 
  Ambassador Mbinda said that UNITA, although it has not won 
the elections arrogantly demands ministerial posts and the 
administration of provinces in central Angola, alleging its 
concern about the safety of residents who have coincidently been 
the most affected by the armed attacks. Mbinda says UNITA's 
demands are designed to facilitate the political control that 
the organization and its leader have always longed for and to 
fulfill UNITA's goal of dividing the country. The Angolan envoy 
said the government has rejected UNITA's proposals because they 
are illegitimate and contrary to the rules of democratic 
coexistence. Ambassador Mbinda said the government will 
continue to strive for the fulfillment of what has so far been 
agreed at the peace talks. 
  Afonso van Dunem Mbinda says it is imperative that UNITA 
should continue to be pressured by all possible means so that it 
abides by democratic rules and abandons the warmongering stance 
that the organization has tried to conceal by claiming to be 
willing to negotiate politically. He said the unilateral 
cease-fire declaration was in fact designed to deceive world 
opinion and prevent the application of the second package of 
sanctions by the Security Council in line with Resolution 
874/93. The Angolan diplomat said the government favors the 
adoption of a declaration by the UN Security Council. 
  [Begin Mbinda recording] The government would like the 
declaration to state that in view of UNITA's unwavering 
attitude, and because it has not abided by the UN Security 
Council recommendations, conditions have been created to adopt 
new measures against UNITA. [end recording]

  [Text] Angola's UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] movement says that up to 50 South 
African mercenaries fighting on the side of the Angolan 
Government have been killed in that country's civil war. 
UNITA's director of information in New York, Mr. (Malik Chaka), 
said a former member of the South African Defense Force Fourth 
Reconnaissance Regiment had been shot dead yesterday morning. 
Mr. (Chaka) said UNITA had not yet captured any South Africa 
mercenaries. He said the mercenaries were the responsibility of 
the South Africa Government and that their presence was 
threatening the peace process in Angola.

  [Excerpt] New Army units are expected to be armed soon, as 
a result of an agreement reached between the government and the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] today, regarding the 
selection of weapons for the future army. A meeting held 
between the government, Renamo, and the United Nations at the 
Military Club in Maputo this afternoon decided to send a 
tripartite team to Chimoio on 8 April to select the weapons to 
be used by the new army [words indistinct] to the Joint 
Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed 
Forces for the subsequent distribution to the new army units. 
Another issue discussed today was the issue of the 16,000 
troops demobilized by the government in 1992 before the signing 
of the General Peace Accord. A source from the United Nations 
presiding over the meeting told Radio Mozambique that the 
parties came to the conclusion that there is no technical reason 
preventing these soldiers from receiving a demobilization 
subsidy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] United Nations Undersecretary General Ismat Kittani 
has stressed UN concern about Mozambique's troubled peace 
process during a week-long visit. During his visit, which ended 
today, Mr. Kittani urged more speed in the process leading to 
elections scheduled for October. Military demobilization is 
running well behind schedule. The UN Security Council deadline 
for the elections is October and the deadline for the 
peace-keeping mission November. Mr. Kittani met President 
Joaquim Chissano and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
leader Afonso Dhlakama and will report back to the Security 
Council on the country's progress toward peace. Renamo peace 
negotiator Raul Domingos said Mr. Kittani's visit had shown the 
UN secretary general's concern to see the peace process end well.

<F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Text] In a communique issued to the media this afternoon, 
the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] accused the 
Mozambican Government of maintaining and sustaining what it 
described as small groups of armed men in Milange District, 
Zambezia Province. Reacting to the accusations, Teodato 
Hunguana, assistant government chief negotiator at the 
Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] of the General Peace 
Accord, said what is currently being noticed in Zambezia 
Province, and which concerns the government, is the existence 
and activities of an armed movement entitled Rombezia, which 
wants to divide the country in two. 
  Hunguana said both the Zambezia Provincial Government and 
the 
central government are investigating the existence of this 
group. He said the case must not concern just the government but 
also Renamo and everyone else, since national unity is at stake. 
  In a communique this afternoon read by Rahil Khan, spokesman 
of the Renamo Information Department, Afonso Dhlakama's movement 
points out that the alleged armed groups in Zambezia Province 
must be disarmed by the government. The communique said the 
armed groups are led directly by Gimo Phiri, the first leader of 
the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], which belongs to the 
Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and not Mr. Carlos Reis' 
Unamo. 
  In an interview with Radio Mozambique this afternoon, 
Minister Teodato Hunguana was asked to comment on the communique. 
  [Begin recording] [Hunguana] Well, the only comment I can 
make is that in Zambezia Province we are very concerned with the 
existence of an armed group called Rombezia which wants to 
divide the country. This is one of our main concerns in 
Zambezia Province. The other concern is the infiltration into 
Zambezia Province of armed Young Pioneers from Malawi. This is 
our second major concern. 
  [Matos] Mr. Minister, how many men does Rombezia have, more 
or less? 
  [Hunguana] Well, we still do not have exact, confirmed 
figures, but we have information that there are hundreds of men. 
  [Matos] And who is their leader, Mr. Minister? 
  [Hunguana] We do not yet have all the information, but we do 
know that the group's objective is to divide the country, thus 
endangering national unity. [end recording] 
  Elsewhere in its communique, Renamo also points out that the 
government has transferred about 8,000 troops and members of the 
People's National Security Service to the police force. 
Consequently, it calls on the government to present their list 
officially. The communique also alleges that all these men were 
transferred to the police force, along with their weapons, such 
as bazookas, AK47's, and tanks. The communique says in order to 
calm the people, the government must act in good faith. 
  Rahil Khan did not present proof for his allegations 
regarding the police, pointing out that the time was not ripe. 
Minister Teodato Hunguana said Renamo is engaged in yet another 
political maneuever by creating phantoms. He said this issue 
has already been discussed in depth and resolved in meetings 
between the president of the Republic and the Renamo leader who 
agreed, among other things, on the presence of an international 
police contingent to work with the national police.

  [Text] The Mozambican Government and the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] have rejected accusations by Africa 
Watch, a human rights organization, that they are hindering the 
mine removal program by failing to ensure the functioning of 
mechanisms created in terms of the General Peace Accord. 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana has said Africa Watch's 
accusations are an attempt to avoid pointing fingers at those 
responsible for the failure to implement the mine removal 
program. 
  In a communique issued in Washington last weekend, Africa 
Watch blamed the Mozambican Government, Renamo, and the United 
Nations for the failure to remove mines that have already 
claimed some 10,000 lives.

  [Text] Praia, 5 Apr (AFP) -- The Governments of Cape Verde 
and South Africa today decided to establish diplomatic 
relations, the Cape Verdian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
disclosed today in a communique issued in Praia. The Cape 
Verdian Government's decision comes only a few days before the 
first multiracial elections in South Africa. Two Cape Verdian 
observers -- who will form part of the international observer 
team that will supervise the polls -- are already in South 
Africa at the request of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Apartheid. 
Trade links have already been in existence for the past several 
years between the two countries. Such links notably take the 
form of landing rights for technical stopovers at the Sal 
Airport by aircraft of the South African Airways.

  [Text] Nigeria has appealed to the United States to lift 
the ban preventing Nigerian officials from traveling to that 
country. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., Alhaji Zubeiru Mahmud 
Kazaure, made the appeal in Los Angeles in a television program 
on Africa. Ambassador Zubeiru Kazaure said the ban by President 
Clinton had made the collection of visas very difficult for 
Nigerians traveling to that country. He said the United States 
should have allowed Nigerian leaders to intimate her with their 
programs instead of taking a hasty action. Ambassador Kazaure 
also expressed concern on the way and manner Nigerians were 
being maltreated in that country. He said the U.S. should rather 
commend Nigerians, who provide employment for others and those 
employed in American organizations, instead of harassing them 
unduly.

  [Text] The first ordinary session of the Togolese National 
Assembly could not begin this morning as scheduled due to lack 
of quorum. Not all opposition deputies showed up at the 
assembly session. Another conspicuous absence was that of 
outgoing Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. From Lome, 
Olabire da Cruz reports: 
  [Begin Da Cruz recording] Only 37 out of the remaining 78 
deputies responded to the invitation to attend the National 
Assembly session this morning, which was convened by the 
chairman and most senior assembly man, Ayitoh Kossi of the 
Action Committee for Renewal, who was himself absent in line 
with the joint decision of his party, the Togolese Union for 
Democracy, to suspend opposition deputies' participation in the 
National Assembly deliberations until the Supreme Court 
clarifies its decision to invalidate the election of three 
deputies of the parliamentary majority. 
  Following the lack of quorum, the 37 deputies of the Rally 
of 
the Togolese People [RPT] and the Union for Justice and 
Development, the RPT's ally, left the National Assembly, noting 
with regret the absence of their 40 opposition colleagues. 
  The outgoing prime minister, the only elected candidate and 
leader of the Coordination of New Forces, was also absent from 
the session. Sources close to the prime minister's office said 
however that the reason for his absence is quite different from 
that of the opposition deputies. 
  We note that this morning's session was notably to allow 
deputies to discuss the assembly's standing orders. The 
referent documents on the standing orders were distributed to 
the parliamentarians on 30 March for prior study. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Mogadishu, 5 Apr (AFP) -- Heavy guns pounded 
several parts of south Mogadishu late Monday [4 April] as rival 
Somali clans clashed in the most fierce battle in several 
months, witnesses said. A Somali journalist said at least one 
person was killed in the fighting which lasted almost three 
hours. 
  The fighting occurred between the K4 roundabout on Afgooye 
Road and the seaport. Militiamen exchanged machinegun and 
rocket fire. It was unclear which clans were involved in the 
fighting, but Somali journalists said it pitted "bandits from 
rival clans". 
  South Mogadishu is the fiefdom of warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid 
of the Somali National Alliance (SNA). United Nations deputy 
military spokesman Major Asif Iqbal said no United Nations 
peacekeeping forces were involved in the fighting. "We don't 
know which clans were involved in this", Major Iqbal said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Factional fighting has been escalating during the week, but 
previous clashes involved the use of small arms. Three SNA 
officials were reportedly killed near the October 21 Road on 
Sunday by a lone gunman who fired into a crowd, a Somali 
journalist said. SNA militiamen vowed to retaliate and 
surrounded a building near the stadium.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, who is on a visit to the 
African continent, met the President of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta 
Museveni last night and discussed bilateral ties, as well as 
regional and international issues. 
  During the meeting, Museveni expressed his pleasure at the

official invitation to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to visit 
Uganda. The Ugandan president also welcomed the expansion of 
cooperation and, in particular, joint investment in the private 
sectors of the two countries. He described the Iranian 
collaboration with his country in various fields as fruitful. 
  Referring to the favorable conditions for the broadening of 
bilateral relations and greater commercial exchanges between the 
two countries, Dr. Velayati declared our country's willingness 
for the transfer of its expertise in the fields of development 
and dam construction. 
  On the sidelines of the Pan-African Congress session, Dr. 
Velayati met the Libyan minister of state for foreign affairs 
and discussed the Arab-Israeli issue, the Gaza-Jericho accord in 
particular.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati left Uganda for 
Kenya today on the last leg of his African tour. On his 
arrival, our foreign minister described Iran's relations with 
Kenya in the past decade as good. He hoped that the two 
countries' relations would be further expanded. 
  Before leaving Uganda, Velayati had a meeting with Sudanese 
Vice President George Kongor Arop who was there to take part in 
the Pan-African Congress in Kampala. We draw your attention to 
our correspondent's report of the meeting. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Before leaving 
Uganda, Velayati had a meeting in Kampala with the Sudanese Vice 
President George Kongor Arop who was there to attend the 
Pan-African Congress. They discussed bilateral ties and 
regional and international issues. In view of the two 
countries' good relations and common viewpoints, the two 
ascribed the adverse propaganda in relation to Iranian-Sudanese 
relations to some Western countries' and the Zionist regime's 
antagonism toward the prevalence of Islamic values. 
  The Sudanese vice president, for his part, said: We have 
been 
subject to constant attacks by the hegemonistic powers for the 
sake of upholding Islamic and humanitarian principles. 
  Velayati, in turn, pointed to the values shared between Iran 
and Sudan, stressed the need for Islamic countries to resist 
Western propaganda attacks. [end recording]

  [Text] Shooting flared up between security forces and armed 
opposition activists in a Brazzaville district, near the home of 
former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who has become an 
opposition leader. One person died, but it is not known if the 
victim -- a noncommissioned officer assigned to guard a union 
leader, Bocamba Yangouma, who is close to the presidential group 
-- was involved in the shoot-out or if he was simply hit by a 
stray bullet. Sergeant Vourou Samba died from a bullet wound in 
the stomach. Calm returned soon after the incident, which 
occurred in an eastern suburb of the Congolese capital. Since 
the cease-fire agreement reached at the end of January, after 
two months of political and interethnic violence, there have 
only been isolated incidents in Brazzaville.

  [Text] Empangeni April 5 SAPA -- More than 20,000 Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] supporters marched through Empangeni on 
Tuesday, many carrying traditional weapons in defiance of 
emergency regulations, and were told by leaders elections would 
not be held in the province until the IFP's consitutional 
demands had been met. "We'll make sure the state of emergency 
does not work in Natal/kwaZulu as long as we live," IFP Youth 
Brigade publicity secretary Zenzele Phakathi told the crowd 
before delivering a memorandum to an Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] official. 
  IFP regional secretary and kwaZulu legislative assembly 
member Blessed Gwala warned the IEC the people of the region 
would not allow polling booths to be set up before their demands 
were met. "If the IEC makes it possible to force the 
installation of polling booths in our areas before our demands 
are met, I am afraid people will use even their teeth to tear 
them down. 
  "We are prepared to pay even the highest price with our 
lives 
if need be, for the sake of our children and the next 
generations." 
  Mr Gwala warned that if the IFP's demands for federalism 
were 
not ad?ressed "then there is no election on April 27, 1994". 
  In apparent reference to the state of emergency in Natal, he 
said: "We will do everything in our power to destroy any attempt 
by any state organ used by the African National Congress which 
is bent on dividing the zulu nation by encouraging certain 
elements in kwazulu to rebel against the king". 
  Earlier, Mr Phakathi, reading from the IFP memo, warned the 
IEC it would find it very difficult to maintain peace and 
stability which would allow free and fair elections in the 
country "unless this constitution is corrected in accordance 
with the minimum demands of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance". 
  He said the IEC was a product of the ANC-dominated 
Transitional Executive Council, an enemy of the IFP and kwaZulu, 
and said IEC decisions were proscribed by the ANC. "The IEC like 
the Goldstone Commission is a political weapon of the 
ANC/communist party/government alliance which is to be used as 
an instrument which will lead kwaZulu into final destruction." 
  Earlier, large groups of the crowd who assembled at an open 
field at the start of the march refused to lay down their 
traditional weapons in defiance of the emergency regulations 
proclaimed in Natal/kwaZulu last Thursday. 
  Police legal adviser Maj Margaret Kruger told reporters 
police did not want to provoke the marchers and would negotiate 
with leaders on the issue of weapons. She said, however, that 
those carrying sticks and spears were contravening the emergency 
regulations. 
  IFP leaders, including Women's Brigade National Chairman 
Faith Gaza, angrily told reporters the emergency regulations 
discriminated against the IFP. "The state of emergency is biased 
against us. It allows the ANC to train its people, but it strips 
us of our traditional weapons," Mrs Gaza said. 
  While many IFP supporters heeded calls to hand in weapons, 
others refused to do so. And while many marchers carried sticks, 
spears were also visible. 
  Police and soldiers lined most of the route and no incidents 
had been reported by the end of the procession.

  [Text] No concrete results were achieved in Lusaka, Zambia, 
today. Things are moving slowly and the delegations to the 
peace talks continue to examine the document presented by the 
mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral 
process. UN Alioune Blondin Beye met with negotiating teams 
from the government and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] before leaving for Geneva for a 
meeting on Angola with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Our 
correspondent Pedro Manuel reports: 
  [Manuel] Alioune Blondin Beye has not yet left Lusaka for 
Geneva. He is still expected to do so this evening. During the 
day Alioune Blondin Beye held some working meetings with the 
heads of negotiating teams from the government and UNITA. The 
parties are presently debating the document presented by the 
mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral 
process -- that is, general and specific principles. 
  The negotiators are also discussing, although not in depth, 
issues connected with local and legislative elections. The 
fundamental issue, however, is the holding of the second round 
of presidential elections. The date of these elections will 
only be announced after the creation of what a source described 
as material and psychological conditions -- that is, the 
establishment of complete peace. It will be the United Nations 
to announce the existence the preconditions for a second round 
of presidential elections. 
  According to one source, the UNITA team proposes changes in 
some aspects of the electoral law. UNITA says the voting 
bulletins must be more informative and more acceptable. It also 
proposes changes in the organization and operation of the 
National Electoral Council [CNE] and calls for an active UN 
participation in the conclusion of the electoral process. The 
following question remains, however: Who is going to hold the 
second round of presidential elections? Will it be the CNE or 
the United Nations? The reply will be obtained after the 
conclusion of debates on the issue. 
  All the same it seems as if the discussions on the 
conclusion 
of the electoral process are on the right track. There are few 
differences. According to our source, after a possible 
cease-fire a lot of time may be needed to hold the second round 
of presidential elections [words indistinct] government organs 
must operate normally, with the inclusion of some UNITA elements. 
  On the country's administration, despite all the secrecy, it 
is being said that it is no longer a very difficult issue. 
According to a negotiator, every effort is being made to ensure 
that the peace talks conclude in April. It is true, however, 
that differences still remain.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has 
today instructed that there will be no movement of people from 
1900 to 0500 [as heard] in the Burnt Forest area which has 
recently been the scene of clashes. President Moi said the 
instruction takes effect from today and will continue until such 
time as peace will have been completely restored in the area. 
[one-minute break in reception] instructed the provincial 
administration to facilitate the formation of village committees 
in the various settlement farm to enhance and maintain order. 
He warned that any village that will be found to have 
instigated violence of any order will be fined heavily, apart 
from other legal measures being taken against them. The 
president told the two communities, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, 
living in Burnt Forest to also form youth groups who will be the 
watchdog of the villagers. 
  The president explained that the recent clashes in the area 
erupted when two Kikuyu youths hurled a grenade at two Kalenjin 
youngsters who fortunately were not killed. He said following 
the attack, the police arrested the attackers but some people 
took the law into their hands and sparked off tribal animosity 
which led to the clashes. The president told the wananchi 
[citizens] in the area to abide by the law and report to the 
security agents whenever they are aggrieved, so that 
investigations could be carried out. President Moi instructed 
the police to hunt down some few people who are known to have 
incited the people by spreading falsehood. 
  The president cautioned the Wananchi against being incited 
to 
fight one another, saying that in the long run, they and their 
children will be the sufferers. President Moi particularly took 
a swipe at the DAILY NATION newspaper for fanning tribal 
animosity in the area by publishing false reports. President 
Moi said the media in the country should play a more responsible 
role of promoting a harmonious coexistence among the different 
communities in the country. 
  The president also called on the churches to preach to the 
people the importance of maintaining peace, instead of using the 
pulpit to criticize the government and making inflammatory 
statements. [passage omitted] 
  The head of state told the villagers in Burnt Forest to stop 
being alarmists by demolishing their homes and leaving behind 
their property while running away to urban centers. He 
explained that there are some people who have run away with 
their household goods to seek sympathy, claiming that their 
houses had been burnt when that was not the case. He said no 
one should be allowed to create the impression that some 
communities were being chased away from Burnt Forest and urged 
all the people in the area to return to their farm. 
  By a show of hands, the people in Burnt Forest assured the 
president that they were for peace and will cooperate with all 
those concerned to ensure that normalcy resumed. President Moi, 
at the same time, called on all leaders from the Burnt Forest 
and the surrounding areas to hold barazas [meetings] and 
emphasize to the people the need to live harmoniously. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] A report released by the Presidency of the Republic 
of Somaliland today has disclosed that Awil Haji Omar has been 
appointed treasurer for national reserves and Mohamed Haji Ahmed 
Il Dab has been appointed as national finance officer. 
Answering a question on these appointments at a news conference 
held at the Presidency today, Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, the 
president of the Republic of Somaliland, said this system was 
similar to the U.S. type of government. For this reason it had 
become necessary to divide the Finance Ministry into two 
sections: the Treasury and the National Budget section. 
Likewise, the president clarified at the news conference that 
the ministry had not been abolished, but that it had been 
divided into two. In the same vein, he said the finance 
minister had not been sacked but that his resignation had been 
accepted. 
  Speaking about the disarmament campaign, the president said 
the program was proceeding in all regions of the country and the 
capital was the one place in which the government had put 
pressure for the program to be carried out. It was proceeding 
well despite snags in some areas. 
  On the event which took place at the general command 
headquarters, Egal said no order was given by the government to 
fight the group stationed there, but that the national Army was 
defending itself after it came under fire and its food was 
looted. The president also said the people were expressing their 
feelings about disarmament and that they should choose in the 
interests of the country and the people. Lastly, the president 
spoke about the situation in the country. 
  On the conference to be held in Mogadishu on 15 April, the 
president said there was no framework whatsoever for Somaliland 
participation. He also said he had met the leaders of most of 
the organizations attending the meeting. He made it clear that 
the position of the Republic of Somaliland was based on the 
wishes of the Somaliland people and the decision had been made 
at the conferences of Burco and Boorama.

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke and Commissioner 
Glenn McDougall arrived in Port Shepstone on Thursday [7 April] 
morning on a two-day mission to assess the climate for free and 
fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal. They immediately met IEC 
officials at the Port Shepstone sub-regional office, before a 
planned meeting with local church, community, police and army 
representatives. 
  IEC Spokesman Glenn McDougall said the two-day tour was a 
"fact-finding mission to report back to the IEC on the 
possibility of free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal." 
  This comes after a working committee comprising 
representatives of the IEC, South African and kwaZulu 
governments concluded that free and fair elections in kwaZulu 
were impossible. 
  Mr McDougall said the current mission would take IEC 
officials to the south, north and central regions of Natal to 
assess where problems were being experienced. "The idea is to 
see where IEC procedures are working and if not, to find other 
ways of doing our work," he said. 
  The IEC officials would fly to Empangeni on the north coast 
on Thursday afternoon, before a trip to Newcastle and Howick in 
the Midlands. "Operation access" in kwaZulu/Natal would be 
launched in Howick, to take voter education to all in the 
region, Mr McDougall said. "We will have fleets of minibuses 
with loudhailers taking local leaders of different parties to 
neutral venues where they will be given a chance to speak to 
residents and where voter education can take place."

  [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that 
the April elections may be postponed either in war ravaged Natal 
or nationally. "Let me tell you there will be no postponement of 
elections...either in the province of Natal or in any of the 
provinces," Mr Mandela told a youth conference at the University 
of Durban-Westville. 
  "We will not postpone our freedom...we will not postpone our 
plans to build a better life for all South Africans," the ANC 
president said, scotching speculation the election may be 
delayed. 
  This follows Tuesday's Independent Electoral Committee [IEC] 
report on the improbability of holding free and fair elections 
in politically charged Natal. 
  Mr Mandela's remarks were met with wild applause and a 
standing ovation from hundreds of youths at the conference. Mr 
Mandela also called on people to give the recently declared 
state of emergency in natal a chance, saying: "people have 
questioned -- what is the use of this state of emergency if 
people continue to be killed? 
  "One appreciates this concern, but it comes from people who 
have not analysed the situation very well," he said. Explaining 
his defence of the emergency, Mr Mandela said SA Defence Force 
[SADF] deployment was a "complicated process". 
  "Stem your judgement until the SADF has brought all the 
forces required to this province," he added. 
  South Africa had reached a "very critical stage" in its 
history, Mr Mandela said, referring to recent third force 
disclosures by the Goldstone Commission. "We've been saying all 
along the third force exists...we are reaching almost a 
breakthrough in this regard...we are finding out the people 
responsible for these massacres." 
  Mr Mandela said present violence in the country was 
"frightening". 
  He accused the national party government of being "corrupt 
... where public funds have been given to black organisations to 
promote violence". 
  Mr Mandela said the ANC had enjoyed a measure of success 
through the Transitional Executive Council because it had 
stopped the government from giving funds to Bophuthatswana. 
  "There are others not very far from you here (kwaZulu) that 
are not going to get those funds for abuse ... and use to kill 
innocent people." 
  Mr Mandela charged that the same "corrupt government is 
steeped in the use of dirty tricks to solve its problems", 
adding that the NP in some areas of the country was involved in 
the "dirtiest campaigns". 
  But the NP, he said, was not to be feared in elections 
because it was a "mouse" and the ANc was an "elephant". 
Referring to recent opinion polls which said the NP and 
Democratic Party had made gains at the expense of the ANC, he 
said: "Even if a mouse eats very well it still remains a mouse 
and an elephant remains an elephant". 
  Mr Mandela said complacency among ANC supporters was to be 
feared in the elections. 
  Urging youths at Wednesday's conference, he said, "your task 
is to work very hard ... spreading the message of liberation". 
  The ANC president criticised conference delegates for not 
ensuring an attendance that reflected the wider population, 
which was necessary to allay the fears of minorities during a 
transformation. 
  "I hope at the end of this meeting you will be able to 
discuss ways and means of overcoming this challenge you don't 
appear to have stood up to," Mr Mandela said. 
  "You must extend your hands at mass, temple, synagogue, and 
schools right across the land," he said to the crowd of youths, 
one of whom held aloft a poster declaring: "Mandela, we Zulus 
have faith in your leadership".

  [Excerpts] The report by a working committee, saying that 
an election cannot take place under the present circumstances in 
KwaZulu, is receiving strong opposition. A joint working 
committee comprising members of the Independent Electoral 
Commission, officials of the kwaZulu government, the South 
African Department of Home Affairs, and the South African 
Police, jointly recommended that the present climate in kwaZulu 
would not make a free and fair election possible in kwaZulu. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Office of the State President says the government has 
taken note of the working committee's view that political 
measures are necessary in kwaZulu and adds that talks between 
State President de Klerk, Mr. Nelson Mandela, King Goodwill 
Zwelithini, and Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, will offer the 
opportunity of finding a solution to these problems. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by E Oelofse] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 6 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] has demanded that the April 27 elections 
be postponed and that all parties concerned return to the 
negotiating table. The demand comes in the wake of the 
announcement by the Independent Electoral Commission chairman, 
Mr Justice Johann Kriegler that elections cannot be held in the 
current political climate in kwaZulu. 
  The AVF, in a statement released on Wednesday [6 April], 
said 
the situation in Natal/kwaZulu was clear proof that negotiations 
had failed. "There can never be peace before the freedom of the 
Zulus and the Afrikaner is properly addressed," said the 
statement. 
  The attempts by the National Party [NP] and the African 
National Congress to intimidate the Zulu nation had also failed. 
Military steps were being directed at Inkatha Freedom Party 
members and certainly not at ANC members who were the 
aggressors, said the AVF. Which was why violence in the region 
had not been curbed. 
  The AVF said an end had to be brought to the "soft" way in 
which the NP dealt with the hunger for power exhibited by the 
ANC-South African Communist Party.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- African National 
Congress National Executive Committee member and former Youth 
League chief Peter Mokaba says the ANC will march into the 
kwaZulu capital of Ulundi to show that it is not afraid of 
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news on 
Wednesday [6 April] reported Mr Mokaba as saying his 
organisation was becoming tired of listening to demands made by 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The king would end up with 
nothing if he continued to be used, as Mr Mokaba put it, by Mr 
Buthelezi. 
  Mr Buthelezi should learn from the events in Bophuthatswana, 
he said. 
  Referring to the recent killing of Zulu people at the ANC's 
national headquarters in Johannesburg, Mr Mokaba blamed Mr 
Buthelezi for allegedly sending his people to the building. 
  Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League's [ANCYL] Executive is 
apparently discussing plans to isolate the IFP, kwaZulu leaders 
and to bring about the withdrawal of the kwaZulu Police force. 
  This according to ANCYL Executive Committee member Lassy 
Chiwayo. Mr Chiwayo said ANCYL would never accept the 
postponement of elections. He went on to urge ANC youth to be 
disciplined and to respect the democratic right of others to 
conduct election campaigns.

National Chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose on Thursday called on 
African National Congress President Nelson Mandela to distance 
himself from what he called inflammatory remarks by former

statement said Mr Mokaba had called IFP president Mr Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi a "coward" and a "criminal" in remarks on radio on 
Thursday morning. 
  Dr Mdlalose said: "These statements are an outrage. They 
are inflammatory and defamatory and are clearly designed to 
scupper tomorrow's (Friday's) summit meeting between ourselves, 
the ANC and the government. We call on Mr Mandela to distance 
himself and his movement from these highly offensive remarks 
uttered by Mr Mokaba. He can demonstrate a commitment to peace 
and success in tomorrow's talks by formally withdrawing the 
remarks".

<F P=106> [Report by K Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 5 SAPA -- A team of 80 senior 
European police officers assigned to monitor security force 
conduct during the election process is due in South Africa this 
week. Headed by British Deputy Inspector Keith Biddle, the 
officers will be deployed at joint operation centres throughout 
the country and will report directly to the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC]. "Our reports will be compiled from 
hard evidence and we will report fairly without fear or favour," 
Insp Biddle told a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday 
[5 April]. 
  The head of the European Union election unit, Jacob de 
Ruiter, said he had received a request for police observers from 
IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler on March 22. "I am 
pleased to say the European Union has been able, at very short 
notice, to respond positively. Mr Biddle, who has the rank of a 
deputy police commissioner, has been joined by Chief 
Superintendent Herman ven de Berge, a senior colleague from The 
Netherlands. Most of the European officers will arrive in South 
Africa later this week. We sincerely hope this initiative will, 
in the words of Mr Justice Kriegler, materially contribute to 
the IEC's ability to work for a free and fair election," Mr de 
Ruiter said. 
  Mr Biddle said the role of the European Union police 
contingent would be to advise the IEC on the formulation and 
implementation of plans to police the elections, to observe and 
monitor policing activity relevant to the election process and 
to report on this to the commission. "Our officers, after 
briefing, will be dispatched to all corners of South Africa. 
Our task is to monitor the way all police forces in South 
Africa carry out their duties. We want to see how they 
facilitate a free and fair election, prevent intimidation and 
how they conduct themselves," he said. "It should be stressed 
the officers will have no responsibility for operational matters 
nor any power to intervene in any policing activity." 
  Mr Biddle will be assisted by 10 regional co-ordinators who 
will operate mostly from national and regional joint operation 
centres. 
  The officers would be deployed in consultation with the 
South 
African Police, the South African Defence Force, the European 
Union election unit and the IEC. 
  Mr Biddle said he was honoured to have been selected by the 
European Union and his own government to head the observer team. 
  IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen said the security forces had 
an "awesome responsibility" to secure the elections. "The way 
they conduct themselves in the field and the confidence they 
build in the electorate is of critical importance to the success 
of the elections. Consequently the monitoring is very 
important. The observers should be deployed in areas where they 
are most needed to observe the conduct of police forces," Mr 
Nupen said.

  [Text] The South African army has strengthened its force in 
the volatile kwaZulu-Natal area. Eighty-eight people have died 
in the area since the state of emergency was declared last 
month. Seven hundred members of the Citizen Force Unit have 
arrived in Ladysmith and 150 more are expected tomorrow. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica van der 
Westhuizen] 
Citizen Force members arrived at the Ladysmith base early this 
morning. They were called up and mobilized within two weeks. 
The men will be joining other troops in northern Natal and 
Zululand. Welcoming the troops later in the day Brigadier Deon 
Ferreira of Natal Command emphasized that their main task was to 
help restore peace and stability. Brigadier Ferreira said there 
was a perception that the army was against the Zulu nation. 
This he said was not the case. He added that a lack of 
tolerance had resulted in the callous murders of people. The 
army was deployed to help stop this ongoing tide of violence in 
the area. Ninety percent of the Citizen Force come from Natal. 
  [A-Company Commander Maj. John Rutherford] We are all family 
people. We are here basically so that there is stability -- to 
ensure stability in the country so that there can be free and 
fair elections at the end of the day and then go home and then 
be happy again, really. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] The force members wasted no time in 
making sure their vehicles were in tip-top condition. The 
troops will leave for Eshowe tomorrow from where they will be 
deployed in volatile areas. With the arrival of the 850 members 
today and tomorrow there will be over 2,000 additional troops in 
kwaZulu- Natal. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>
  [Text] Welkom April 6 SAPA -- There could be no free and 
fair elections in the Orange Free State [OFS], the National 
Party [NP] said on Wednesday [6 April], citing alleged 
intimidation by supporters of the African National Congress as 
the reason. 
  The NP further accused the Independent Electoral Commission 
(IEC) of siding with the ANC and not being interested in 
levelling the political playing field. "They are absolutely 
useless and their operation access means nothing," said Mr Flip 
Nel, former NP MP for Welkom and number three on the party's 
Free State election list. "The ANC is making sure the voice of 
the NP is not being heard," he said at the end of the first day 
of an election sweep through the northern Free State goldfields. 
  A complaint would be laid with the IEC on Thursday charging 
that the ANC was preventing the NP from entering townships to 
canvass for votes and support, Mr Nel said. 
  An NP campaign truck toured several townships on Wednesday, 
handing out pamphlets and badges but choosing to skirt the edges 
of each rather than risk going in too deep. Organisers said 
this was a security measure as many townships were considered 
too dangerous, and that too much time spent in them gave the 
NP's opponents a chance to organise resistance to the party's 
presence. 
  In Henneman's Phomolong township on Wednesday, groups of 
children and a few adults ran alongside the NP truck, gathering 
and destroying party pamphlets as they were distributed. By the 
time the NP left the area after a 20-minute visit, about 20 
adults had gathererd at the township entrance chanting "Viva 
ANC, down with NP". Similar scenes were witnessed in other 
black townships, though a more favourable response was seen in 
Welkom's coloured Bronville township. 
  Mr Nel described international observers travelling with the 
NP roadshow as "a nuisance" because the NP had to take their 
safety into account when deciding whether or not to enter a 
township. Recent weeks have seen a number of incidents of 
harassment of National Party roadshows in the Free State, 
particularly on or near the goldfields. 
  The NP last week was granted an interdict stopping ANC 
supporters from threatening or assaulting NP members in Parys.

  [Text] The ANC has strongly criticized the return to work 
by two police generals. 
  The Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission should 
release specific evidence about their involvement in third force 
activities. Lieutenants General Basie Smit and Johan le Roux 
withdrew from their duties 10 days ago but resumed their duties 
today. The commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, 
said their positions would be reviewed if new information was 
received. 
  The ANC said it was unacceptable that police officers who 
had 
been implicated in alleged criminal activities should be allowed 
to return to active duty until the allegations had been properly 
investigated. 
  Earlier, Justice Richard Goldstone said that more 
information 
about the alleged involvement by policemen in third force 
activities had been received by him and that the information 
would be handed over to an international team of investigators.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- Mr Justice Richard 
Goldstone should be suspended or dismissed and a commission of 
inquiry appointed to investigate his activities, the Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] demanded on 
Wednesday. 
  In a statement issued by its Executive Council, the AWB said 
it had been the first organisation to "publicly state its 
disgust" at the Goldstone Commission. "The alarm bells are now 
ringing, even among the legal fraternity, over the nefarious 
activities of Goldstone's Commission. We demand that Goldstone, 
who is the only legal official in the Western world to be 
prosecutor, judge and executioner all in one, be suspended or 
dismissed as a matter of urgency." 
  The AWB further demanded a commission of inquiry be 
appointed 
to investigate Judge Goldstone, which should include an 
investigation into his present and past political affiliations. 
"For too long this man, who was appointed by (State President) 
FW de Klerk and is responsible to De Klerk only, has vilified 
our esteemed army and police generals without them being charged 
in a court of law or given an opportunity to defend themselves," 
the AWB said. 
  This was an apparent reference to the commission's "third 
force" investigation implicating top Police Generals Basie Smit, 
Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht. 
  The AWB called on the National Party caucus to place "volk 
[Afrikaner people] and country" before personal financial gain 
by dismissing Mr de Klerk, "Goldstone's boss". "For God's sake, 
do this now, before this man is responsible for more chaos and 
bloodshed in our beloved fatherland," the AWB said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Phineas Theboko on the "PM </F>
Newswrap" program] 
  [Text] Bophuthatswana's Rooigrond Central Prison was set on 
fire this afternoon as thousands of prisoners protested, 
demanding to be allowed to participate in the forthcoming 
democratic elections. According to the acting deputy 
commissioner of the homeland's prisons services, Colonel Hennie 
du Toit, no details of the damages were available as they were 
still awaiting a full report. He also refused to confirm the 
number of prisoners involved in the protest. 
  Rooigrond Central Prison is the biggest prison in 
Bophuthatswana, which accommodated former political prisoners 
involved in the 1988 abortive coup as well as death row awaiting 
prisoners. Today's violence in the former homeland was the 
second incident within a period of two weeks following the 
gutting down of Mafikeng prison in Mmabatho recently. Damages 
estimated at 100,000 [rand] were caused when prisoners went on 
rampage setting the prison on fire, demanding to be allowed to 
vote. The co-administrator for Bophuthatswana, Mr. Job Mokgoro, 
addressed protesting prisoners last week in an attempt to calm 
down the situation.

  [Text] Members of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force [BDF] 
took up positions for a few hours this afternoon at the Odi 
Prison in Mabopane north of Pretoria after it was set alight 
this morning. This comes after incidents of violence at the 
Rooigrond Central Prison in Mmabatho yesterday. Bophuthatswana 
prison authorities have refused to give information to the media 
stating only that an internal investigation was underway. 
Prisoners are allegedly demanding to be released saying that 
the government that sentenced them has been deposed. A 
spokesman for the BDF said more trouble was expected and that 
more troops will be deployed.

  [Text] Pretoria April 7 SAPA -- South African Defence Force 
[SADF] Military Intelligence Chief Gen "Joffel" van der 
Westhuizen, prominent in the Goniwe inquest, retired from 
service on March 31, an SADF spokesman confirmed on Thursday. 
He cited medical reasons for his retirement. 
  Maj-Gen Dirk Verbeek was acting in his place, said an SADF 
statement. According to evidence in the Goniwe inquest, Gen van 
der Westhuizen had in 1985, when he was the officer commanding 
Eastern Province Command, allegedly instructed one of his 
deputies, Col Lourens du Plessis, to send an order to the State 
Security Council in Pretoria for the "permanent removal from 
society" of three Eastern Cape activists. 
  In June that year Mr Matthew Goniwe, Mr Sparrow Mkhonto, Mr 
Fort Calata and Mr Sicelo Mhlauli were killed near Port 
Elizabeth. Gen van der Westhuizen has denied involvement in the 
deaths of the "Cradock four". 
  Eastern Cape Judge President Mr Justice Neville Zietsman, 
who 
presided at the inquest, will deliver his findings on May 13.

  [Text] The European Commission says it will propose 
extending the system of generalized preferences to South Africa 
lifting the last sanctions still affecting the country, namely, 
a ban on arms trade, and on cooperation in the military domain. 
  A European Commission spokesman said in Brussels that the 
commission would submit to the EU Council of Ministers a set of 
proposals aimed at developing relations with the new South 
African Government. The measures include provisions for 
granting financial assistance and loans to small and 
medium-sized companies, as well as to government agencies 
wanting to invest in South Africa. The commission also suggests 
that the European Investment Bank be allowed to extend its 
activities to South Africa.

  [Text] British Airways is making arrangements to cancel 
flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town if violence spreads from 
black townships to white residential areas. However, a 
spokesman for the company emphasized that this is a private 
decision, and not one taken by the British Government. The 
spokesman was reacting to reports that the British and 
Portuguese Governments are preparing for the evacuation of large 
numbers of British and Portuguese passport holders from South 
Africa if widespread violence breaks out. It is estimated that 
up to 350,000 British passport holders could be involved in the 
evacuation. NP [National Party] and ANC spokesmen said they 
were concerned about reports on planned evacuation operations. 
Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC said the ANC would consult the 
countries concerned about these plans. He said these reports 
cause unnecessary tension. NP spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk 
said he doubts the practicality of such plans and added that 
South Africans should not allow themselves, as he put it, to be 
led by the nose.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  State of Emergency To `Clamp' IFP -- Johannesburg THE 
CITIZEN 
in English on 4 April in its page-6 editorial finds "something 
quite cynical" about the imposition of a state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal. The government previously refused to impose an 
emergency "because it did not want to frighten off foreign 
investors. It resorted, instead, to the declaration temporarily 
of unrest areas. Another reason was that the African National 
Congress was totally opposed to an emergency, which in the past 
had been used by the government to suppress its revolutionary 
activities." Now the ANC is in favor of a state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal because "it wishes to see a clamp placed on the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] as a preliminary to toppling Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the last strong Black opponent of the ANC." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Two Options for Poll in kwaZulu/Natal -- Referring to the 
unrest in kwaZulu/Natal and the Independent Electoral Commission 
report that an election in that province is impossible under the 
prevailing conditions, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7 
April mentions two options to resolve this problem. The 
politicians "can rely on emergency measures to achieve within a 
couple of days what is needed." But the editorial warns "there 
are limits to what brute force can achieve." Or the politicians 
can "begin now looking for a political deal -- starting at 
tomorrow's four-leader summit." Nevertheless, "it is much too 
late to finalise a deal before the election. What is required 
is a preliminary agreement that offers sufficient guarantees to 
Buthelezi and the electoral process respectively. If agreement 
is not reached the election must nevertheless go ahead as fully 
as possible. Only if an agreement is reached can a delay or, 
preferably, a commitment to repeat the Natal poll, be 
countenanced." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  `Brinkmanship' in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 7 April in a page-8 editorial believes "brinkmanship 
has been a major feature of pre-election politics." "Perhaps 
the most serious place where the game is being played is the 
kwaZulu-Natal area. The situation is so grave that it has 
already crossed the fine line into becoming a matter of life and 
death. The type of destruction -- in one case involving the 
grotesque slaying of a family of 10 -- is becoming routine and 
highly unacceptable. The question whether the elections must be 
held or not is part of this disconcerting problem concentrating 
our minds. The dangers for and against the elections especially 
in Natal-kwaZulu are extremely high and can be costly." 
<H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>
  Natal State of Emergency Welcome -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS 
in English on 3 April in a page-14 editorial finds it "strange" 
that there are political parties "who have found it necessary to 
fault State President F. W. de Klerk's decision to declare a 
state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal." "Given the frightening 
escalation of violence in this region -- particularly in the 
last two weeks -- what was the government expected to do?" CITY 
PRESS believes that "as long as the security forces act 
impartially, drastic measures are the only recourse left for the 
government if the violence is to be contained." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  IFP `Blackmail' To Postpone Election -- Johannesburg BEELD 
in Afrikaans of 31 March states in a page-12 editorial that the 
53 people killed due to the unrest during a Zulu march through 
the center of Johannesburg "have apparently not shocked IFP 
leader Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi to his political senses. 
Instead, he has declared that it will now be a fight to the 
finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation." "One can only 
remind him that he does not speak for the Zulu nation. He only 
represents a political faction -- possibly a minority. But that 
is neither here nor there. What is most worrying is that Mr. 
Buthelezi says the fight to the finish will take place unless 
the election is postoned. Surely this is naked blackmail. He 
expects the country to choose between the election and anarchy. 
The statements by the IFP that free campaigning will be 
permitteed in Natal is only lip service. To many observers it 
has long been clear that the IFP is not an honest boycotter of 
the election, but an active destroyer." The IFP must realise 
that "if it speaks of the final solution, the government and the 
rest of South Africa also have final plans ready. And this will 
not cost only 53 lives...The election cannot be postoned, so 
those who want to drive the country to a final struggle must 
know that it will lead to a tremendous counterreaction. Can 
anyone reconcile that with a Christian conscience?" 
  ANC Above Law in Weapons Search -- In his column on page 13 
of the same issue of BEELD, columnist Lood writes: "Reports that 
the police were unable to search the ANC headquarters in Shell 
House on Tuesday on account of political intervention are 
disturbing. On Monday the ANC admitted in a written statement 
that ANC security personnel had fired on a group of marchers and 
killed or injured people. It may not have been necessary, as 
reported, to commandeer 400 policemen for the search, but when 
people break the law or are responsible for somebody's death, 
the least that can be expected is that a thorough search be made 
-- even inside the ANC headquarters, if necessary. Nothing and 
no one ought to be above the law."

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, 
Burundian minister of state for foreign relations and 
cooperation, who is currently visiting Cairo, has expressed 
shock over the tragic incident that claimed the lives of Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira in Kigali last night. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Burundian minister 
said that the incident was not provoked by any turmoil or unrest 
and that the target was the Rwandan president. He pointed out 
that the incident took place at Kigali airport in Rwanda at 
about 2030 last night and President Ntaryamira was expected to 
arrive in Burundi at about 2105. 
  Minister Ngendahayo said that on board the small Falcon 
plane 
that crashed in Kigali last night were Bernard Ciza, Burundian 
minister of state for planning development and finance; Cyriaque 
Simbizi, Burundian minister of communications and government 
spokesman; and Captain Cizahayo, an escorting officer. 
  Concerning the incident's possible repercussions for 
Burundi, 
Minister Ngendahayo said that there are two unconfirmed 
possibilities about the plane's crash or downing. 
  If the plane has crashed, he said, it is a tragic accident 
for two presidents with good reputations in the continent and 
will have grave consequences for Rwanda, which is going through 
a phase of democratic transformation and whose government is 
conducting talks with the opposition. 
  As for Burundi, Ngendahayo added, it is an extremely painful 
and sensitive situation, as President Ntaryamira has only been 
in power for two month and the country had already lost 
President Melchior Ndadaye last October. 
  In the event the plane was downed, this may foment latent 
problems in Rwanda. As for Burundi, I believe that the incident 
is unfortunate but will have only a temporary effect. According 
to the information I received, the average Burundian took the 
news as a piece of "bad luck."

  [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French troops were put on 
alert in Central African Republic on Thursday [7 April] after 
the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane 
crash in Kigali, military officials said. The officials said 
there were no plans at the moment to send troops into either 
Rwanda or Burundi, where the situation was reported calm 
Thursday although firing was reported in the Rwandan capital 
Kigali. They added that French residents in both capital were 
under no threat. 
  The Rwandan Defense Ministry said the plane, carrying the 
officials back from a regional conference in Tanzania aimed at 
settling ethnic strife in Rwanda and Burundi, had been shot down 
by "unidentified elements" as it prepared to land late Wednesday. 
  The French officials said shots were fired Thursday morning 
in Kigali but said there appeared to be no major disorder there. 
Kigali residents as well as German and Belgian envoys there also 
reported sporadic shooting in Kigali, while the German 
ambassador there, Dieter Hoelscher, said the atmosphere there 
was "tense." 
  The French source said French troops in Africa were put on 
alert each time there was a crisis in a nearby country. Rwanda 
and Burundi are located east of Zaire which neighbours Central 
African Republic. 
  France pulled its last troops out of Kigali late last year 
after UN forces were deployed there. About 10 French military 
troops are in Burundi as part of an aid mission, the source 
said. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed along with government 
aides, including two Burundi cabinet ministers, when their 
aircraft crashed in Kigali late Wednesday.

  [Excerpts] In Libreville, Gabon, the new cabinet was 
formally sworn in yesterday. It is the fourth government since 
multiparty politics was instituted in the country in 1990. 
[passage omitted] 
  Concerning this cabinet, let me add that Jean-Francois 
Ntoutoume Emane, the man appointed minister of state control and 
parastatal reforms, has turned down his appointment. He has 
declined Casmir Oye-Mba's offer. What are the reasons for this 
turndown? Jean- Francois Ntoutoume Emane spoke a short while 
ago with Raphael Mbadinga. As you will hear him pointing out, 
his rejection of the post was not a last minute one. He 
disclosed his stand to the head of government on 31 March, 
adding that he was not consulted before the appointment. Here 
is Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane. 
  [Begin Emane recording] I am not an opposition figure. I am 
in the presidential majority. I am and will remain a member of 
the Gabonese Democratic Party. You are fully aware of 
developments in my constituency. I (?proved my worth) by 
barring the way to Father Paul Mba Abessole of the National 
Lumberjacks Rally in the 1991 parliamentary elections. I did 
the same at the last presidential elections in which my 
constituency gave the president 15,900 votes, a score second 
only to what he obtained in Haut-Ogooue Province. 
  I believe if they wanted me to return to the government, 
they 
should have consulted me first. Thereafter, proposals could 
have been made to me and I should have been given time to 
consider those proposals. Concerning the idea of making me 
minister of state control, let me state, first, that I am 
against the regionalization and tribalization of ministerial 
appointments. For some time now, the state control portfolio 
has been held by indigenes of the Estuaire Province. While 
offering me the state control portfolio they have taken away its 
substance by transferring the parastatals and privatization 
portfolios elsewhere. They rather tagged me with the 
decentralization portfolio. From the intellectual standpoint, I 
would have loved to handle that department but while entrusting 
decentralization to me they assigned the local government 
portfolio to someone else. 
  How can you talk about decentralization or promoting a 
decentralization policy without enjoying the [words indistinct] 
and without a base, which local government areas precisely 
happen to be? It means I would find myself constantly at 
loggerheads with the minister responsible for local government 
areas. I was assigned the territorial development portfolio but 
one cannot talk of territorial development or promote 
territorial development without a base. They added regional 
integration to my tasks but given the present state of the 
Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa where [words 
indistinct] have not been paid for the past two years, given the 
difficulties facing the Economic Community of Central African 
States. 
  The point is not that I am against the composition of the 
government but as a Gabonese, I wish all the same that a smaller 
government had been formed during this time of crisis. I was a 
minister for a long time. For me, it is not a [word indistinct] 
to enter the cabinet. Let those who have never been ministers 
do so. As far as I am concerned, when one is a minister, one 
must be prepared to work but I cannot work in an inconducive 
atmosphere with poorly defined functions. I cannot head a 
ministry made up of knickknacks, namely a ministry that is 
haphazardly constituted. [end recording]

  [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- There was total confusion in 
Kigali tonight, according to correspondents interviewed by AFP 
following reports indicating that the Rwandan presidential plane 
crashed this evening. (In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay announced 
that there were reportedly "no survivors.") 
  The Rwandan national radio did not broadcast any report more 
than three hours after eyewitnesses reported heavy weapons 
firing was heard around the airport shortly after 2100 local 
time (1900 GMT), a military official of the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has stated. 
  The prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana told AFP that 
she has learned from UNAMIR Commander General Romeo Dallaire 
that the plane bringing the president back from Dar es Salaam, 
Tanzania, had crashed but she could not get any official 
confirmation. 
  UNAMIR has sent a team to the area to get more information, 
it was stated at the UNAMIR headquarters. All the Kigali 
inhabitants remained at home for fear of violent incidents in 
the capital, a Radio Kigali reporter said.

  [Text] The minister of defense with profound sorrow 
announces to the Rwandan people the untimely death of the head 
of state, His Excellency Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, 
which occurred on 6 April 1994 at about 2030 at Kanombe, when 
the plane that was to have brought him from Dar es Salaam was 
shot down by unidentified elements in circumstances that are 
still unclear. Aboard the same plane was His Excellency 
Cyprien Ntaryamira, president of the Republic of Burundi, who 
also died in the same circumstances, together with two of his 
ministers who were accompanying him. 
  The army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Deogratias Sabimana, 
Ambassador Jurvenal Renzaho, Colonel Elie, Dr. Emmanuel 
Azingeneye, and Major Thadee Bagaragaza, as well as the crew 
members, perished in the disaster. 
  The defense minister requests all Rwandan residents to 
remain 
at home until they are given other instructions. 
  The minister of national defense also particularly asks the 
National Army to remain vigilant and maintain the people's 
security, and the wisdom and courage that they have always 
ceaselessly displayed whenever the country has gone through 
difficult times.

  [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- National radio in the 
neighbouring African states of Burundi and Rwanda broadcast 
appeals for calm on Thursday [7 April] following the death in a 
plane crash of their presidents. UN forces increased their 
patrols here to avert any disturbances, according to a UN 
spokesman who said that the night passed without incident. But 
a group of soldiers stopped a UN patrol on the airport road to 
Kigali, according to a UN spokesman. "But the problem was 
quickly resolved, we are not making an issue of it." 
  According to a Burundian Government spokesman, the Burundi 
capital Bujumbura was also generally calm. 
  Rwandan authorities confirmed Thursday the death of Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira when their plane crashed in Kigali as they were 
returning from a regional summit in the Tanzanian capital aimed 
at settling ethnic strife in their countries. 
  Rwandan Government officials said all 12 people aboard the 
plane died. The other victims were the country's Army chief of 
staff, General Deogratias Nasabimana, four associates of 
President Habyarimana -- a doctor, a political counsellor, a 
security official and a private secretary -- two Burundi cabinet 
ministers and the three French crew members. 
  The cause of the crash was not known, but at the United 
Nations in New York, Rwandan Ambassador Jean Damascene Bizimana 
charged that the aircraft had been hit by rocket fire as it 
prepared to land at Kigali airport. Some witnesses spoke of 
hearing heavy weapons fire near the airport when their French 
Mystere Falcon came down.

  [Excerpts] First of all, the deaths of the Rwandan and 
Burundi presidents last night: Events seem to be accelerating 
in Rwanda in any case, with the burned-out wreckage that is the 
remains of the Rwandan president's plane, which crashed 
yesterday evening not far from Kigali airport. Eyewitness 
accounts report an explosion or even rocket fire hitting the 
aircraft, bemusement among those who heard the news, and--a few 
hours later--firing in the streets of Kigali. Let us listen to 
the account given by Rwandan Prime Minister Madame Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, who was contacted by Monique Mas just a short 
while ago: 
  [Begin Uwilingiyimana recording] There is shooting, people 
are being terrorized, people are inside their homes lying on the 
floor. We are suffering the consequences of the death of the 
head of state, I believe. We, the civilians, are in no way 
responsible for the death of our head of state. [end recording] 
  So, there was shooting in the streets of Kigali this morning 
following a night that one might describe as rather surreal. 
Dominique de Courcelles reports: 
  [Courcelles] Yes, in Kigali, after a fairly calm night, as 
you have just heard, shooting is now being heard in the town and 
is in particular directed at the residence of the prime 
minister, who is shut up in her home. From the moment the 
announcement of the accident was made by the radio station of 
the government party, the UN peacekeepers stepped up their 
patrols to attempt to prevent any trouble, and the Rwandan 
Government called on the people to remain calm and to stay at 
home. 
  In neighboring Burundi, the national radio station and the 
authorities, including the speaker of the National Assembly, who 
has become the interim president, have called for calm. An 
emergency committee to follow the situation was immediately set 
up. So far this call for calm has been heeded. The 
circumstances surrounding the accident or the attack have not 
yet become clear, but one thing that is certain is that all the 
occupants of the plane are dead -- apart from the two presidents 
of the republics, this includes two Burundi ministers and the 
whole of the French crew. [passage omitted] 
  The UN mission on the spot, the UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission 
in Rwanda], has not so far formed any theories, but it reports a 
large explosion at about 2100 hours local time and firing on the 
ground at the airport. As for the Rwandan Army and Gendarmerie 
Staff Command, they have not issued any information during the 
night, but doubtless it is their weapons that are being heard at 
the moment. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister herself obviously sees a link between the 
shooting and the death of President Habyarimana -- very quickly 
she attempted to get in touch with the Army Staff Command, but 
in vain. The failure to respond appears to indicate that it is 
members of the military who are firing in the streets of Kigali, 
with the Army thus targeting this prime minister who is the 
symbol of a difficult period of transition between war with the 
FPR [Rwandan Patriotic Front] and peace accompanied by 
power-sharing, which was clearly repugnant to President 
Habyarimana. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] A new tragic event has united two countries at 
the heart of Africa: Rwanda and Burundi. [passage omitted] 
  In the minutes following the attack, the UN Security Council 
appealed for calm. Politicians in Rwanda and Burundi did the 
same. It appears that people are keeping quiet in the capital 
of Burundi. However, gunfire was heard last night in Rwanda. 
Clashes apparently broke out this morning near the presidential 
palace. But one must be careful. There is conflicting news: 
some sources mention fighting, some others just sporadic 
incidents. Colonel (Marchal) is the head of the UN force in the 
Rwandan capital. We talked to him this morning. 
  [Begin (Marchal) recording] Last night everything was quiet 
until dawn. In the last 30 minutes or so, tension has been 
quite clearly growing. There is no fighting in town, but people 
are shooting in many places, mainly from military camps and from 
the barracks of the gendarmerie. There are no clashes between 
different parties or factions. As for ordinary people, there is 
nothing much to say. There are no demonstrations. There is 
nobody in the streets. (?We) are trying to keep the situation 
under control with the help of gendarmerie units. [end recording] 
  This interview with Colonel (Marchal) was recorded at about 
0700 hours [local time] this morning. Things might have changed 
since then.

  [Excerpt] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- There was sporadic 
shooting with light and heavy weapons in various areas of Kigali 
this morning, according to inhabitants of the Rwandan capital, 
following the deaths last night of the Rwandan and Burundian 
presidents. However, calm prevailed in Bujumbura where many 
civil servants and traders did not report for work, an AFP 
correspondent said. 
  UN officials in Kigali and the security forces could not 
provide details on possible material damages resulting from the 
shooting which was heard mainly in the center of the city. 
According to a spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
[UNAMIR], security forces have cordoned off the strategic areas 
and UN patrols are cruising the city. The spokesman was not 
able to give details on whether the shooting was between 
organized armed groups. The shooting, which began early this 
morning, could still be heard by 0930. 
  The Rwandan Government has appealed for calm on the radio, 
and has asked people to remain at home, "to avoid panic," and to 
"avoid engaging in acts that could threaten state security." 
  According to various Rwandan sources, the plane that was 
returning Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira from Tanzania was attacked by heavy 
weapons before crashing at Kigali Airport. The UN officials and 
the security forces could not confirm this information. 
According to unofficial sources, the Rwandan presidential 
plane, which was carrying about 10 people who all died in the 
crash, took fire and literally exploded.

  [Excerpts] After the death of the presidents of Burundi and 
Rwanda last night, the authorities in Burundi have taken 
emergency measures to maintain order in the country. According 
to the UN secretary general's representative in Burundi, the 
capital was quiet this morning. The authorities seem to be in 
total control of the situation. In accordance with the 
constitution, the speaker of the National Assembly of Burundi is 
now interim president. A special committee was created during 
the night by the prime minister, to follow events. [passage

  However, the Rwandan Army is apparently in control of the 
main buildings in the city. They are patrolling deserted 
streets. [passage omitted]

UN military observers have been taken hostage by members of the 
Presidential Guard. A UN official says that three of the 
observers were abducted this morning from their residence, along 
with the three ministers and their families. The situation is 
extremely tense in the two countries following the attack in 
which the Rwandan and Burundi presidents were killed. The 
authorities of the two countries have stepped up their calls for 
calm and called on their armed forces to contribute to 
maintaining order. The radio stations are broadcasting messages 
alternating with classical music. The French servicemen have 
been put on alert in the Central African Republic.

  [Excerpts] A summit was organized in Dar es Salaam today 
that brought together Presdents Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, 
Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Juvenal Habyarimana of our country, 
Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, and Kenyan Vice President George 
Saitoti. Zaire, which had been invited, did not attend the 
meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Habyarimana's role in Burundi's problem is known to all. He 
continues to interfere in the issue without helping them to 
solve it. The Party for the Liberation of Hutu People has been 
training continually in Rwanda [words indistinct]. The role of 
our state radio after the killing of President Ndadaye is also 
well known. Now President Habyarimana is among those who want to 
solve a problem that he himself has worsened. 
  The other thing we can say is that the meeting on the 
Burundi 
question was convened by the Tanzanian president, who was the 
mediator in the Rwandan question [word indistinct] Arusha 
agreement. President Habyarimana, who took part in the meeting, 
is responsible for the failure of the implementation of the 
agreement. 
  In reality, what is President Habyarimana's role in the 
Burundi issue, especially now that we know that he played a role 
in it and continues to [words indistinct]. One should solve 
one's own problems before tackling others. His role in the 
Burundi issue will [words indistinct] the hindrances that he 
continues to place in the path of the implementation of the 
Arusha agreement. How can one search for peace for others while 
at the same time hindering peace in one's country?

  [Text] Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman 
Justice Johann Kriegler says the election will go ahead as 
planned in kwaZulu. Interviewed in Johannesburg today, he said 
the political climate and not the election date should be 
changed, and ANC President Nelson Mandela has supported this 
saying he won't agree to a postponement of the election as this 
would effectively be a postponement of freedom. Yesterday, a 
joint IEC-kwaZulu and South African Government working committee 
said an election couldn't be held in kwaZulu-Natal in the 
current political climate. 
  [Begin recording] [Kriegler] I think it would be 
irresponsible for the IEC to give a message to spoilers that if 
they make enough of a nuisance of themselves the election will 
be postponed. We don't say that. We don't believe that. The 
election will carry on. The few spoilers are not going to 
frustrate the vast majority who wish to vote. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Amid speculation that a 
postponement of the election was possible, Mr. Mandela was 
adamant that he opposed such a move. 
  [Mandela] There will be no postponement of the election. 
[applause] 
  [Correspondent] On the possible postponement of regional 
election in Natal-kwaZulu he kept the same strong stance. Later 
at a news conference Mr. Mandela said the IEC report stated that 
a final decision was still in the hands of political leaders. 
He said Friday's summit meeting for him was an opportunity to 
discuss the position of King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  [Mandela] The main purpose is to see how I can address his 
concerns and to allay his feeling that his position is 
threatened by the government of national unity. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Mandela said he believed the ongoing 
violence in the province might be reduced if an agreement could 
be reached with King Goodwill. On the subject of the security 
forces he said it was unrealistic to expect them to control the 
violence overnight. Mr. Mandela left for discussions with ANC 
regional leaders. [end recording]

  [Text] The motives behind the state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal have been criticized by the Pan-Africanist 
Congress [PAC]. PAC President Clarence Makwetu said the 
declaration of the measure had nothing to do with the clamping 
down on violence in the area. Mr. Makwetu was speaking at the 
celebration of the 35th anniversary of the PAC in Soweto. 
  [Begin Makwetu recording] The real intention of the 
emergency 
is to force the opponents of the African National Congress and 
the National Party in that region to tow the line. It all goes 
to show what kind of government we will have should the ANC ever 
be elected to rule this country. It also goes to show what type 
of rule we will have should the National Party scrape through 
with some seats in the proposed cabinet. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, April 6 (AFP) -- A retired senior army 
officer has accused the regime of General Sani Abacha, who 
seized power in Nigeria last November, of betraying the people 
and sacking officers who sought democracy. 
  Lieutenant General David Mark, a former aide to previous 
military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, told the weekly Lagos 
magazine TELL that he and 16 other officers had been retired 
"because we supported democracy and we were totally opposed to 
another extended period of military intervention." "Abacha's 
regime qualifies for a space in the Guiness Book of Records as 
the greatest betrayal of the century," Mark said, in the first 
public comment by any of the soldiers retired after the defence 
minister took power. 
  Mark, a former state governor and subsequently a 
communications minister, described the army-backed government as 
a "betrayal of the people, betrayal of hope and aspirations for 
all Nigerians and a coup against democracy." 
  He and a group of other officers had supported a planned 
transition to democracy under Babangida, Mark said, denying that 
the group had requested that the former head of state should 
annul the presidential election held last June 12. 
  Babangida plunged Nigeria into political chaos when he 
annulled the poll, which Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the 
now defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) claimed to have won. 
  Abacha, who was the military strongman in the Babangida 
regime, was the "main beneficiary" of that annulment, which 
threatened to bring civil war or disintegration of the Nigerian 
federation before the military staged a comeback, Mark said. 
  An interim civilian administration which took over from 
Babangida when he stepped down last August 26 lasted for less 
than three months before Abacha took power and scrapped all 
elected political institutions, with the SDP and the rival 
National Republican Convention. The new regime claimed 
nevertheless that its tenure would be brief. 
  Mark said that when it became obvious that the interim 
government could not manage the affairs of the nation, a group 
of military officers, including Abacha, his deputy, General 
Oladipo Diya, and himself "reluctantly decided to intervene." 
  The three possible options considered were to give the 
government military backing to enable it to conduct a new 
presidential election, or go for a six-month "full military 
regime" during which the poll would be organised, or install a 
"diluted military regime" for not more than one year, at the end 
of which a vote would take place. Though most members of the 
group favoured the first option, the present regime chose to 
adopt the last option, but plans to stay in power for five 
years, Mark charged. 
  The army authorities have recently placed restrictions on 
the 
17 officers, including seven generals, retired after Abacha 
seized power. Most of them had participated in the bloodless 
palace coup that brought Babangida to office in August 1985.

  [Text] The military government of General Sani Abacha in 
Nigeria is coming under increasing pressure to declare its 
intentions and to set a timetable for a return to civilian rule. 
His proposal to hold a national conference took the heat off for 
a while, but now a military man, Lieutenant General David Mark, 
who was a member of former President Babangida's government and 
one of the officers retired after Gen. Abacha seized power last 
November, has launched an attack on the military regime, talking 
of hidden agendas. But there are those asking if Gen. Mark 
might not have a hidden agenda of his own. From Lagos, Sola 
Odunfa reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] Lt. Gen. David Mark described the 
Abacha government as a betrayal of the military officers who 
took part in installing the government and as a betrayal of hope 
and aspirations for all Nigerians. The general told the 
magazine, NEWSWATCH, in an interview published in Lagos that he 
was one of the officers who met towards the end of last year to 
decide what to do about the interim national government headed 
by the civilian business executive, Chief Ernest Shonekan. He 
said that most of the officers favored giving full military 
backing to Chief Shonekan to conduct another presidential 
election, but, under pressure from Generals Sani Abacha and 
Oladipo Diya, they agreed to sack the interim government and 
install a full military government to rule for no longer than 
one year. He said that the option for a return to full military 
government was supported by leading politicians. 
  Lt. Gen. Mark said that the strongest support came from 
close 
political associates of Chief Moshood Abiola, the SDP [Social 
Democratic Party] candidate who was believed to have won the 
annulled presidential election held last June. Lt. Gen. Mark 
said, however, that since the restoration of full military rule, 
the Abacha government had repudiated the original plan that it 
should last only a maximum of one year. He said that all its 
actions showed that the new rulers were seeking to be in power 
for at least five years but they were finding it difficult to 
tell Nigerians their real intentions. 
  The interview contains harsh criticisms of Gen. Abacha and 
his second in command, Gen. Oladipo Diya, and praise for the 
ousted president, Gen. Babangida. These have led many people to 
regard the entire piece as another propaganda work by former 
officers still loyal to Gen. Babangida in the same vein as some 
of the ex-president's former aides talked Chief Abiola into 
writing a private letter to him as a friend and then they leaked 
it to the press to show him up as a person who cared only for 
his personal interests. [end recording]

  [Text] Nigeria and Benin Republic held talks today in Abuja 
touching on matters of interest to both countries and the West 
African subregion. The Beninois team was led by that country's 
president, Nicephore Soglo, while the head of state, General 
Sani Abacha, led the Nigerian team. 
  In the opening session of the talks, Gen. Abacha described 
President Soglo as a distinguished African who has worked to 
strengthen relations between Nigeria and Benin Republic. He 
said President Soglo, as ECOWAS [Economic Community of West 
African States] chairman, has displayed a high sense of 
responsibility in handling issues of unity and security in the 
West African subregion. 
  President Soglo said Africans should always strive to settle 
their differences themselves. The Beninois leader, whose visit 
has to do with the economy of the subregion, the Liberian 
affair, and the Nigeria-Cameroon misunderstanding, advised 
Africans to unite in order to overcome the economic problems 
currently facing the continent. President Soglo and his team 
have since returned home.

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are not deadlocked. That is 
the unanimous view of the two negotiating teams, who said that 
the question of national reconciliation will be dealt with at a 
latter date. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating 
team, told journalists in Lusaka today that understanding has 
been reached with the regime regarding ministerial and 
provincial government posts. Valentim said UNITA has already 
agreed in principle with the portfolios offered to UNITA, namely 
the ministries of health, hotels, public works, and commerce as 
well as deputy minister posts. For a sound national 
reconciliation policy Dr. Valentim said UNITA has proposed to 
the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party] that UNITA should govern Huambo and Benguela Provinces. 
He added that UNITA officials should serve as deputy ministers 
of interior and finance. 
  Jorge Valentim said he was unaware of the proposals 
presented 
by the Luanda government emissaries who were in Lusaka recently. 
He said if there were any proposals, these were presented to 
the mediator. 
  Meanwhile, the government negotiating team left for Luanda 
yesterday; the reason is not known.

  [Text] The UN Security Council meeting on Angola will no 
longer be held tomorrow. The UN Security Council requires more 
information concerning the Lusaka peace talks, and this 
information will only reach New York after UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, have met in Geneva. Radio Angola 
reporter Andeiro Joao has just interviewed Angolan Ambassador to 
the UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda. 
  [Begin recording] [Joao] Good evening, Ambassador Mbinda. So 
we should see the UN Security Council hold its meeting on Angola 
in New York tomorrow? 
  [Mbinda] I can tell you that no date date has been set yet 
for a meeting of the UN Security Council. Informal 
consultations will probably only begin tomorrow and it is quite 
likely that a formal meeting of the UN Security Council will 
only occur next week. That means that this meeting of the UN 
Security Council has suffered a considerable delay. 
  [Joao] What reasons could be at the root of this latest 
postponement of the UN Security Council's meeting on Angola? 
  [Mbinda] I do not know the reasons, but I think that the UN 
Security Council would like to receive a report on the meeting 
which the UN secretary general and UN Special Representative 
Alioune Blondin Beye are scheduled to hold in Geneva today or 
tomorrow. Moreover, the UN Security Council is waiting to 
receive more information so that it can have as much information 
as possible on the talks being held in the Zambian capital. 
Those are the only reasons for the UN Security Council meeting 
being delayed so many times. 
  [Joao] Ambassador Mbinda: If this UN Security Council 
meeting 
does go ahead, what decisions would the Angolan Government like 
to see made? 
  [Mbinda] Well, our government hopes that the UN Security 
Council will make a realistic analysis of the situation on the 
ground and of the Lusaka peace talks, and that it will take 
whatever measures are necessary. 
  [Joao] Mr. Ambassador: When you talk about necessary 
measures, are you referring to a possible new package of 
sanctions against UNITA? 
  [Mbinda] I do not believe that the UN Security Council will 
take such measures. I do not believe that it will introduce a 
second package of sanctions at this juncture. That is because 
conditions are not in place for that to be done. The fact that 
the Lusaka peace talks are continuing, that they have not 
collapsed despite all the problems, all that makes us believe 
that present conditions do not justify drastic measures against 
UNITA by the UN Security Council. In view of that, I think that 
when it holds its upcoming formal meeting the UN Security 
Council will be asking UNITA to adopt a more realistic approach. 
The fact is that UNITA has been given an opportunity. Our 
government offered a number of ministerial portfolios and 
afforded UNITA the possibility of wider participation in 
government. So, the UN Security Council is waiting for UNITA to 
come up with an answer as rapidly as possible. [end recording]

  [Text] A total of 14 political parties, four of which are 
represented in parliament, have formed a front against the 
government. The parties met from 24 to 31 March 1994 to discuss 
peace and national reconciliation. Today they issued the 
following declaration: 
  [Begin Pinto Joao, leader of the Angolan National Democratic 
Convention, CDNA, recording] The political parties have decided 
to conduct joint action within the framework of a process aimed 
at fulfilling the following goals: 
  A. Signing of a cease-fire accord between the government and 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], and 
the immediate conclusion of the Angola peace talks. 
  B. A substantial number of UN blue helmets should be sent to 
cover the country as a whole. 
  C. Complete disarming of the warring forces, including the 
police, private militia, and civilians. 
  D. A stop to the supply of weapons to the warring factions. 
  E. Organization of an extended meeting attended by all of 
Angola's active forces, including churches. 
  F. The establishment of a transitional government of 
national unity. 
  G. Active participation by all political forces in the 
transitional organs. 
  H. Formation of a new army and police that should be free 
from partisan manipulation. 
  I. Establishment of a national military nonaggression and 
mutual security pact, and the declaration of Angola as a 
demilitarized territory. 
  Until those principles are complied with, the democratic 
civilian opposition political parties represented at the meeting 
have decided to hold meetings amongst themselves and with other 
political forces likely to subscribe to the present declaration. 
The democratic civilian opposition political parties have 
adopted a basic agenda for peace and consolidation of democracy 
in line with a planned broad movement for peace and national 
reconciliation. [end recording] 
  The opposition says the present government is illegal, and 
so 
are the Angolan Armed Forces and the police. They have also 
accused the government of monopolizing the news media. In view 
of that, the opposition parties have called for the 
reinstatement of a legal order, giving political parties the 
right of access to the news media as of this month. 
  The new political grouping is known as the Democratic 
Civilian Opposition Political Parties and its members include 
the CNDA, the Angola National Liberation Front, the Front for 
Democracy, the (Umbia-PCN) [expansion unknown], the National 
Convention Party, the Angolan Liberal Party, Liberal Democratic 
Party, the Democratic Party for the Progress-Angolan National 
Alliance, the Social Renovated Party, the Angolan Solidarity and 
Consciousness Party, the Angolan Social Democratic Party, the 
National Union for Democracy, and the Angolan National 
Ecological Party.

  [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
[MPLA], the acknowledged winner of the first Angolan elections 
and, therefore, responsible for the formation of this country's 
first democratic government, today reacted to the statement of 
the 14 parties making up the so-called Democratic Civilian 
Opposition. MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco has granted 
an interview to the People's Television of Angola in which he 
commented on that statement. 
  [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The statement issued yesterday 
by the self-styled Democratic Civilian Opposition is absurd, to 
say the least. That is because we do not understand how a 
country that has existed for some 20 years can remain forever in 
a state of transition. What the so-called Democratic Civilian 
Opposition parties want is for the present institutions, which 
emerged from the 1992 elections, to be scrapped. That is 
absurd. It cannot be accepted. That would be tantamount to 
betraying the large majority of Angolan people who cast their 
votes in September 1992. The people turned out at the polls to 
vote for the party they regarded as being the best and the one 
best equipped to defend their aspirations. It is necessary that 
the electorate's choice of the MPLA be respected in full. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Would the MPLA be in the 
position to make concessions? For instance, those parties have 
asked for the demilitarization of all forces. They also asked 
for a greater number of blue helmet forces to be sent over. 
Would the MPLA be willing to make concessions regarding those 
points? 
  [Lourenco] It seems to me that the so-called Democratic 
Civilian Opposition is beginning to behave irresponsibly, to put 
it mildly. It does not even have an idea about what its 
responsibilities should be. It is true that the country is 
going through a crisis. There is a fierce conflict between the 
government and a political party that is illegally armed. That 
party has begun a war throughout Angolan territory and that war 
has had serious consequences, meaning that the opposition 
parties should act in accordance with the laws in force in this 
country and demand that the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is contravening the law, 
be the only party to be disarmed, so that UNITA can start 
operating in accordance with the Constitutional Law and other 
laws in force in this country. So, if any side is to be 
disarmed, that side should be the one with an illegal army. To 
my knowledge, the sole illegal army in this country belongs to 
UNITA. In view of that, only the UNITA army should be 
demilitarized and disarmed. 
  We believe that it would be at the very least suicidal to 
disarm the Angolan Armed Forces and the Angolan Police. We 
believe such measures would place in jeopardy the very existence 
of the Angolan State. [end recording]

Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] soldiers deployed at Ebo to move in 
the direction of the principal target of Quibala District. 
Those forces were very well equipped. 
  Our glorious patriotic and revolutionary Armed Forces for 
the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] (?pounced) on those enemy forces and 
pushed them back to Ebo village. Benefiting from support from 
the air and other land forces, the enemy did not stay calm. 
Instead, it again turned on the people and attacked positions 
held by the FALA troops, which counterattacked and, after 
intense clashes lasting some three hours, took Ebo village in 
spectacular fashion. This happened at about 1500 on 5 April. 
  The enemy suffered the following losses: our forces captured 
two BMP-1 armored vehicles, two 76mm cannons, one 14.5mm cannon, 
one RPG-7 rocket launcher, four 60mm mortars, two 82mm mortars, 
(?55 AK- 47 rifles), and many tonnes of assorted war materiel, 
including (?hand grenades), mines, ammunition, and so on. Our 
forces also captured many tonnes of food given by the World Food 
Program, WFP, which were also found [words indistinct]. 
  The FAPLA forces also suffered 165 soldiers killed. 
  Those enemy forces who managed to flee did so in disarray 
and

  The people must be protected from the enemy's maneuvers. 
Those who attack us must pay. [end recording] 
  In Bie Province on 3 April, the air force of Engineer Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos attacked civilians and religious figures 
celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Two MiG-23 
aircraft attacked the evangelical missions at Chilonda and 
(Canguengo), killing many civilians, children included. Jardim 
Chiquito Prata, our correspondent in Bie Province, reports: 
  [Begin Prata recording] Finally, they dropped four powerful 
bombs on the evangelical center at Vila Estrela, causing 
irreparable human and material losses. In this genocidal 
operation by the MPLA- PT, nine persons -- including three 
children -- were killed. As yet unconfirmed reports from that 
area also say that another five people are missing. It is 
thought that they may have also been the victims of those 
MPLA-PT air force attacks. [end recording]

  [Text] Colonel Alberto Antonio, spokesman for the Southern 
Front Military Command, says that the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, 
continue to drive back attacks by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces and will continue to 
respond firmly to provocative operations by that movement. He 
described the situation on the Southern Front as tense. Between 
5 and 31 March, the UNITA troops carried out 15 attacks on 
government positions, which were also shelled on 10 occasions. 
Col. Alberto Antonio also said that the rebels carried out 
numerous ambushes on civilian and military vehicles, abducted 
people, stole cattle, mined areas, and moved men and military 
equipment. 
  [Begin Antonio recording] In response to those provocative 
and criminal operations by the enemy forces, the FAA troops have 
inflicted severe losses on them, including: 69 soldiers killed 
and 55 AKM weapons, 31 clips, nine 60mm mortars, 10 RPG-7 rocket 
launchers, six (?mortars), 10 shells of various calibers, and 
assorted ammunition captured. Our forces are also holding one 
UNITA soldier who surrendered and two who were captured. 
  We regret having to report that six FAA soldiers were killed 
and another 16 wounded. We also regret the fact that 13 
civilians were killed and another 11 wounded. [end recording]

  [Text] Jamba Govenor Brigadier Isaias Chitombe gave a long 
interview to the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
[Vorgan] today, speaking of various issues concerning the 
country's political and military situation. The most important 
topic in his interview were revelations of attempts by the 
regime against the rearguard of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA], particularly here in Jamba, 
using the Namibian territory as its launching pad. 
  According to Brig. Chitombe, Namibia and Eduardo dos Santos' 
regime are evidently determined to destroy UNITA, particularly 
in Jamba. The governor draws a clear picture of the situation 
on the field. 
  [Begin Chitombe recording] At 2245 on 24 March, agents from 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA- PT] were detected near the Vorgan antenna installations. 
Surprised by our security forces, they fled in disarray. Our 
forces were however able to capture one of the group. We also 
captured engineering material that the group carried, as well as 
explosives, detonators, wirecutters and so on. 
  We know that with regard to Jamba, the enemy has a two-phase 
program. The first phase would be to mine parts of 
Cacuchi-Jamba road because it thinks that that we obtain 
supplies through this road. Officially, we do not obtain any 
supplies from Namibia because of the economic blockade. The 
enemy also wanted to mine parts of (Buabuata)-Jamba road. If 
they were able to infiltrate and deploy their forces in Jamba, 
they would perhaps mine a number of roads and even destroy 
Vorgan antennas, so as to silence the only genuine opposition 
voice in Angola. This would be the first phase. 
  According to our intelligence sources, the second phase 
would 
be a large-scale phase supported by mercenaries coming from Cabo 
Ledo. These mercenaries are presently in Nambia, in the last 
phase of preparations. The South-West African People's 
Organization [SWAPO] gave the MPLA a piece of land, from the 
bridge over Cubango River in (Bagani) to 2 km before (Chetu). 
The MPLA has deployed its temporary bases on this piece of 
land, from which it would carry out actions in Jamba. On this 
same piece of land that SWAPO gave to the MPLA-PT, there is a 
base called Omega, with a hospital to give first aid to wounded 
troops during the period of action. 
  What is more, at a given period of operations, these troops 
would be supported by an air cover, MI-8 and MI-35 helicopters, 
equipped with cannons. These helicopters would also be deployed 
on the same base, Omega. 
  We have also been informed that the MPLA deployed 2,000 riot 
policemen in Namibia. One thousand of them have already left 
for South Africa to support the African National Congress in the 
elections due on 27 April this year. Of the one thousand 
policemen who remained in Namibia, 400 are in Rundu. These riot 
policemen are led by the following chieftains: Colonel Joaquim 
Mbundu, Colonel Alberto Simao, and Lieutenant Colonel Angelo, 
who is also in charge of border control and physical elimination 
of UNITA cadres and leaders here in our region. Other 
chieftains are Captain Alberto Sitani, Capt. Jacinto Manuel, and 
Chituwawa Mapa. 
  We are also aware that some of these chieftains have already 
left for (Bucussu) on a reconnaissance mission to watch our 
movements. We also know that SWAPO has included MPLA agents in 
its border-guard troops, police, secret services, and 
communications services, and so on. Thus, when SWAPO carry out 
border patrols, it is just doing it to allow the MPLA forces to 
reconnoitre our positions along the border. 
  As in the past, we would like to once again today alert the 
national and international communities that in the event of any 
attack on Jamba from Namibia, we shall retaliate and pursue the 
attackers to where they are based. If this happens, the 
provokers and those assisting the provokers will be exclusively 
and solely to blame. 
  We have decided to reveal this information to the national 
and international communities to enable them to know exactly who 
is not interested in peace. When we are negotiating in Lusaka, 
when it is possible to sign a general cease-fire accord, and the 
MPLA is using mercenaries to attack the free territory 
controlled by UNITA, we call this an act of provocation. It is 
not only an act of provocation, the MPLA is sabotaging the 
efforts being carried out by the entire peace-loving 
international community so that war ends in Angola and the 
Angolan people can begin to enjoy peace. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, in view of this evidence, a source from the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA], gave assurances that all military measures were in place 
to repulse any attempt by joint FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for 
the Liberation of Angola]-SWAPO forces. The source said the 
FALA will not accept any responsibility for the consequences 
resulting from the MPLA adventure. If the Namibian regime wants 
to maintain good neighborly relations with UNITA, it should then 
cease to support the diabolic and treacherous actions by the 
Luanda Communist regime, the source said in conclusion. 
  Here in Jamba, a senior officer of the FALA military command 
said today that in view of threats of aggression from the 
Republic of Namibia, all FALA units have been placed in a 
maximum state of alert. According to the source, in case of 
provocation, FALA forces have instructions to react with the 
greatest violence possible and pursue the attackers to their 
base. The source said UNITA will not accept any responsibility 
for the consequences that could result from this adventure. It 
said in case of attack, the Namibian Government will be solely 
to blame. We want to maintain good neighborly relations with 
all neighboring countries, but this is only possible when there 
is mutual respect, the FALA officer said. He said the United 
Nations must warn Namibia not to internationalize the conflict.

  [Text] The Mozambican Government and the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] have rejected accusations by Africa 
Watch, a human rights organization, that they are hindering the 
mine removal program by failing to ensure the functioning of 
mechanisms created in terms of the General Peace Accord. 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana has said Africa Watch's 
accusations are an attempt to avoid pointing fingers at those 
responsible for the failure to implement the mine removal 
program. 
  In a communique issued in Washington last weekend, Africa 
Watch blamed the Mozambican Government, Renamo, and the United 
Nations for the failure to remove mines that have already 
claimed some 10,000 lives.

  [Text] The two joint commanders of Mozambique's new 
national army, composed of former government and Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] soldiers, have begun their 
first day in office. However, they have no troops to command 
yet, as the soldiers are still being selected for retraining. 
  In an interview after their swearing-in ceremony, former 
Renamo military chief, Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, said 
that from this moment on he ceased to be Renamo. He said that 
he now represented the armed defense forces of Mozambique. 
  Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo, selected by the government 
as joint commander with Gen. Ngonhamo, said the challenge facing 
them was to defend the country and its territorial integrity. 
The two officers will command a 30,000-strong army as provided 
for in the terms of the 1992 peace accords.

  [Text] Generals Lagos Lidimo and Mateus Ngonhamo were this 
week sworn in as commanders of the FADM [Mozambique Defense 
Armed Forces]. It is, therefore, time to demand that both of 
them renounce all commitments of a partisan nature. 
  That is prompted by the following: 
  1. The public remarks Ngonhamo made to promote Renamo's 
[Mozambique National Resistance] standpoint are still very fresh 
in one's mind. (Hopefully, these were his last remarks.) 
  2. Although there are no facts known to the public, many 
observers of our peace process feel that they are right to fear 
that Renamo has not confined all its men and surrendered all 
weapons. 
  3. In 1992, MEDIAFAX reported the transfer of thousands of 
FAM [Mozambique Armed Forces] men to the police. At the time, 
official comments on the issue fell short of answering the 
questions that were raised. Information given to us by reliable 
sources, but which require official confirmation or denial, says 
those men, who were issued with police uniforms, are now in 
Magoanine, believed to be under the command of Lagos Lidimo. 
  The government owes a clear and final explanation on the 
matter. 
  Does Lagos Lidimo or does he not anything to do with the 
Magoanine force? 
  What is the purpose of that force? Is it to replace the PRM 
[Mozambique Republic Police]? 
  If in fact it is a police force, does Compol [National 
Commission for Police Affairs] have any control over it? 
  The country's stability depends on the nonexistence of any 
hidden army, either in Magoanine or in the bush.

  [Text] Voting in the Lukasha constituency by-elections 
started at (?a) low key this morning, with some polling stations 
recording as few 38 voters by midday. A ZANA survey revealed 
that (Chikambi) had the highest number of voters by noon, having 
a relatively good turnout at 69 votes out of 1,664 registered 
voters. 
  Presiding officers in most polling stations visited 
attributed the low turnout to people's preference to cultivate 
their gardens in the morning, but that the situation could 
change by late in the afternoon. There was also the problem of 
people present outdated voters' cards or [words indistinct] 
cards of the late 1980's. 
  Voting in the Mufulira constituency by-elections started on 
a 
very poor note, with some polling stations recording as few as 
10 voters by mid-morning today. The voting, which started at 
0600 has been characterized by apathy, as a snap survey carried 
out by the Zambia News Agency shows, most polling stations 
visited recorded below 30 voters by 1100. 
  At (Antanshe) Primary School in Kamuchanga, only 39 voters 
had cast their votes by 1050, out of a total of 1,032 registered 
voters. 
  In Kahoma East and Kansuswa the presiding officers, who did 
not want to be named, said the turnout was very poor. In 
Kamuchanga, the situation was not different from Kahoma and 
Kansuswa where, by 0900, only about eight people had cast their 
votes. At Kachironda, the turnout was (?a bit) [words

  Meanwhile, voting in the Chinsali by-elections went on 
(?fitfully) at a number of polling stations visited by ZNBC 
[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]. By 1630 about 1,000 
people had cast their votes at (?all) polling stations. Four of 
the polling stations visited by ZNBC did not have permanent 
independent observers to monitor the elections and the United 
National Independence Party [UNIP] did not send its agents 
[words indistinct] stations visited by ZNBC. Counting of the 
votes is expected to start before midnight.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Whitfield, Esther Waugh, and Helen Grange] </F>
  [Text] Proposals will be put to King Goodwill Zwelithini at 
today's bush summit with the country's major political leaders 
which could break the political logjam behind the violence 
sweeping kwaZulu/Natal. There were also indications last night 
that special provisions could be made for the boycotting Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP) to still take part in provincial elections. 
However, Government and ANC sources were adamant that this 
month's poll would not be delayed, either nationally or in any 
province. 
  Sources in all camps were yesterday also warning against 
overdue optimism, predicting that a day of "very tough talking" 
lay ahead. The ANC issued a blunt statement insisting that the 
kwaZulu government be stripped of its powers. 
  Yesterday President de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
met for brief discussions on the meeting. Government and ANC 
negotiators also held talks. The king, De Klerk Mandela and 
kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi will gather at a 
secret bush venue early today for the critical talks, which 
could hold the key to a peaceful election and an easing of the 
crackling tensions in kwaZulu/Natal. The king and Mandela will 
meet from 9AM for about an hour before joining the other leaders 
for day-long discussions. 
  It is evident that the king's position would be critical to 
the outcome of the talks. He is likely to be offered some form 
of constitutional entrenchment of the Zulu monarchy. Although 
he has rejected similar overtures in the past, sources were last 
night confident the king's demands could be accommodated in new 
proposals. 
  "But progress effectively depends on whether the King is 
prepared to soften his demand for independence for kwaZulu and 
Natal," a source said. It was reported yesterday that Zulu 
royals believed the king would be prepared to drop his 
independence demands, but that these would again be linked to 
IFP demands, for changes to the Interim Constitution. 
  Should King Goodwill accept a deal, he will be expected to 
drop his opposition to this month's election. In recent weeks 
the king has said that he could not encourage his subjects to 
vote, but stopped short of calling for a boycott. 
  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice 
Johann Kriegler said yesterday his organisation was 
investigating the possibility of reprinting the provincial 
ballot papers for the kwaZulu/Natal and PWV 
[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] provinces should today's 
summit result in the IFP's participation in the election. It 
would not be possible to amend the national assembly ballot 
paper at this late stage, he said. However, IFP spokesman Ziba 
Jiyane indicated yesterday that if the IFP did decide to 
participate, it would only do so on a national level. 
  The ANC said in a statement last night that it would "not 
accept any attempt to frustrate the holding of elections either 
in Natal or the country as a whole".

  [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini told African National Congress President Nelson 
Mandela on Friday [8 April] morning he would have to distance 
himself from the ANC's shooting of Zulu marchers outside the 
ANC's Shell House head office before their dialogue continued. 
The Zulu monarch met Mr Mandela at an undisclosed venue before a 
meeting between the king, Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  The king's presentation to Mr Mandela was released by Mr. 
Buthelezi's office. 
  "Until and unless you personally distance yourself from the 
shedding of the innocent blood of my father's people by means of 
your personal initiative leading to the conviction of those who 
are guilty of this crime, our dialogue will remain difficult if 
not impossible," King Zwelithini said. 
  King Zwelithini said immediate steps were required from Mr 
Mandela to heal the wounds arising from the Shell House 
massacre. He asked that Mr Mandela make available all 
information related to the killings. 
  "I ask that you do whatever is in your power as the 
president 
of the ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and 
executed the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime," 
he said. 
  The Zulu king also condemned ANC statements on the monarchy 
and the kwaZulu government. 
  "The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and 
particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me at 
numerous times, that I am on the payroll of the kwaZulu 
government or that my Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu is my 
paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive." 
  He said any action taken against the kwaZulu legislative 
assembly would be an action against him as reigning king. 
  He said Mr Mandela and the ANC had repeatedly flouted royal 
protocol in their approaches to the institution of the Zulu 
monarchy. 
  He detailed the failed attempts at arranging a meeting 
between himself and Mr Mandela and said it would be wrong for 
him not to get "these things off my chest". 
  However, he said he did not expect issues of protocol to 
cloud the discussions. "I put them down for the record without 
expecting them to be the cause of any acrimony between us." 
  King Zwelithini said he regarded the state of emergency in 
Natal/kwaZulu as an invasion. "I want to make it clear that I, 
the king of the Zulu nation, consider the declaration of a state 
of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of foreign aggression, an 
invasion of our territory and a rape of our national dignity and 
pride. 
  "I...shall never recognise the legitimacy of the actions 
taken in terms of the declaration of the state of emergency." 
  He said the stigmatisation of his uncle, Chief 
Kwaphindangene 
(Chief Minister Buthelezi) had also caused offence. "It was he 
who destroyed the South African Government's homeland policy, 
and it was his refusal to accept so-called independence that 
destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P W Botha's dream of 
establishing a confederation of South African states." 
  King Zwelithini said the summit was taking place against the 
background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu 
nation -- the Shell House massacre and the state of emergency. 
  "I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from 
my heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime 
purpose of our meeting". 
  He said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the 
sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. He said sovereignty could not 
be negotiated or conferred upon kwaZulu by anybody. 
  "Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was 
Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force 
against colonialism and apartheid." The Zulus had never been 
crushed, he said. 
  He said sovereignty forged by history could not be undone 
by political edict or by the passing of a law or by the forcing 
of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom. "Now 
that apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa 
is being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom. 
  "I am not prepared to talk to you...about whether or not 
there shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa. 
  "The only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing 
the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognitio and 
relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa." 
  He said the kingdom would be bounded by the Transvaal in the 
west, Mozambique and Swaziland in the north and Transkei and 
Lesotho in the south and south-west. 
  He said the 1993 constitution, even as amended, extended the 
"greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom". He said 
he rejected the constitution. He said the kingdom needed a 
militia which the constitution did not provide. 
  King Zwelithini said he had been forced to act decisively by 
the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation. 
Nor was the negotiators' provision for traditional leaders 
sufficient recognition of the Zulu monarchy. 
  "As things stand now I cannot encourage my father's people 
to 
vote on April 26-28 and thereby lend legitimacy to what will be 
the destruction of the very foundations on which the sovereignty 
of the Zulu kingdom rests." 
  He said Mr Mandela was rushing into an election rejected by 
himself and the Zulu people. 
  King Zwelithini said a constitution had been written for the 
state of kwaZulu/Natal in December, 1992. It set out the Zulu 
nation's bottomline demands. 
  He said he had been hoping for a a federal system in which 
the constitution would be recognised. 
  He called on all Zulus to unite and to defend kwaZulu 
freedom 
and sovereignty. 
  "The road ahead is not going to be an easy one," he warned. 
  "We the Zulu nation convene today on the battleground which 
subjugated the freedom of our forefathers. 
  "We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and 
sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at all costs. 
  "Whether we end up as part of one federal state of South 
Africa or as a completely autonomous state will depend on what 
you and others in South Africa do to me and my people. The key 
thing is whether you are prepared to listen to our just 
aspirations or whether, like those who conquered us, you think 
you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my 
nation."

<F P=106> [Interview with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini by CNN </F>
correspondent Brent Sadler; place and date not given; on the 
"Agenda" program, introduction by announcer Tim Modise--recorded] 
  [Text] [Modise] The long-awaited summit between State 
President F.W. de Klerk, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini takes place tomorrow. CNN's Brent Sadler 
interviewed King Goodwill Zwelithini and asked him about his 
expectations ahead of the summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Sadler] Your Majesty, what do you expect 
to happen during these talks? 
  [Zwelithini] Actually, if they can just show if the outcome 
could be a recognition of the sovereign kingdom of the Zulu 
nation, if the acceptance should take place, I would be very 
much grateful to see that. It means that the Zulu kingdom, it's 
not threatened in the new government. Nobody will touch it. I 
pray to the almighty God that it must be the time where maybe 
the turning point should take place and everybody be made to 
understand each other and to listen to each other's problems. 
  [Sadler] Do you fear that a new ANC-led government would 
wish 
to crush Zulu independence? 
  [Zwelithini] If there is any wish of that from any political 
party that will win in ... that will win elections, thinking of 
crushing KwaZulu, that would be a very big mistake because 
within the ANC there is some of my people who are members of the 
ANC, and then in each and every party that will take over, that 
might win the elections, there is some of my people that are 
members of that party so it will be a disgrace if the government 
that might win elections will think of crushing KwaZulu because 
KwaZulu is there. It has been there before the white man set 
his foot here. I am not supportive to anyone being killed, 
especially as the king of the people. I don't like to lead the 
dead. I want to lead the living. It's a very dramatic thing 
that my people today find themselves fighting against each other 
and killing against each other when they need to get together 
and face a new future with a bright things that might happen for 
the Zulu people and the whole of South Africa. 
  [Sadler] Do you expect your people to vote or not in the 
elections? 
  [Zwelithini] I won't advise my people to vote. I have never 
said that they mustn't go to vote, but the only thing that has 
made me to take an initiative of not advising my people to vote 
is because I didn't know what my position and the position of my 
people is going to be in a new South Africa. 
  [Sadler] Do you think your intervention on the political 
scene, by calling for sovereignty, was something of a gamble? 
  [Zwelithini] I was not gambling. I just wanted to make the 
negotiators to understand the importance of any other race group 
in this country. All political parties should just get their 
minds together and look at the issue as it is. I am not 
expecting to see that there are too many bloodshed that is going 
to take place because I'm not....[pauses] I was born not to be a 
man who must create bloodshed. I know that my hands are clean. 
I'm not the one who has created ... who has made this country 
to be what it is at the moment and I'm not the one who have sent 
the people to be killed. I have never instructed anybody to 
kill anyone because I believe that through negotiations, on 
peaceful structures, peace will be created.

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says that neither force nor the threat of a funding 
cut will make him accept the constitution that denies the Zulu 
nation its right to self-determination. Speaking in Ulundi 
ahead of his summit meeting today with State President F.W. de 
Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, and Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini, Dr. Buthelezi said he's always rejected violence, 
but warned of more bloodshed if the election proceeded as 
scheduled. 
  Our political staff reports that the summit meeting is seen 
as a final attempt to avert a war between the IFP and the ANC in 
kwaZulu- Natal. Dr. Buthelezi said that advocates of a federal 
system in South Africa have been elbowed out of negotiations by 
the government and the ANC. 
  The government and the ANC have both indicated that they 
intend to be accommodating of the Zulu king's position. Before 
the summit meeting begins, Mr. Mandela will hold separate talks 
with King Goodwill on the kwaZulu issue. Yesterday Mr. Mandela 
and President de Klerk held preparatory discussions. Various 
international leaders have expressed the hope that the talks 
will produce a settlement. It is not yet known where the summit 
meeting will take place.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says he has information that hit squads were sent to 
assassinate him in recent weeks. Dr. Buthelezi is quoted in the 
British newspaper, THE DAILY STAR. In an exclusive interview, 
Dr. Buthelezi said members of the South African Communist Party 
who were also members of the ANC were guilty of the attempts. 
He told the newspaper that he had little hope that the talks 
with the state president, F.W. de Klerk, and ANC leader Nelson 
Mandela today would produce any result.

  [Text] The ANC has alleged that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] is planning attacks in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region tomorrow as part of a conspiracy to sabotage 
the election. 
  According to the ANC there are plans to assassinate a number 
of ANC leaders, including Mr. Nelson Mandela, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, 
and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa. It also claimed that the IFP is 
planning to infiltrate Chris Hani memorial rallies. The ANC 
said large quantities of arms had been transported to the PWV 
region and stockpiled in at least 16 hostels. 
  The ANC said security at its head office in Johannesburg had 
been intensified and that the information at its disposal had 
been placed before the South African authorities at the highest 
level.

  [Text] The chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC], Mr. Justice Johann Kriegler, says the commission is 
considering amended ballot papers to include the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] in the 27 April election. 
  Judge Kriegler said the IEC had met with representatives of 
the South African printing industry to investigate the 
possibility of producing amended ballot papers even at this late 
stage. He said it was to be hoped that negotiations would 
succeed in bringing the IFP into the election. Judge Kriegler 
said the election would definitely go ahead. 
  The IEC would provide the necessary framework and mechanisms 
for the election to take place. However, it was up to political 
parties and their leaders to ensure that it was free and fair.

  [Text] Port Shepstone April 7 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] is forging ahead with arrangements 
for this month's elections in Natal/kwaZulu and does not think 
they should be postponed, IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke 
said on Thursday [7 April]. Speaking to reporters after meeting 
local IEC officials in Port Shepstone, Mr Moseneke said: "For 
better or for worse there will be voting stations for those who 
want to vote." 
  He said he respected the right of people not to vote, but 
added: "Let it be peaceful." 
  Mr Moseneke was speaking at the start of a tour of 
Natal/kwaZulu to assess the prospects for free and fair 
elections. He said although an IEC technical committee had 
disclosed this week that conditions were adverse for free and 
fair elections in certain parts of the region, the commission 
was pressing ahead to ensure voting took place. 
  "We want to go ahead and establish a government 
representative of all of us." 
  Mr Moseneke said the whole of Natal/kwaZulu was not a no-go 
zone. There were areas where voting was possible. "One shouldn't 
speak in absolutes." 
  He said part of his mission was to make plans to ensure 
people in volatile areas were able to vote. The tour would focus 
on election readiness, determining locations for polling 
stations, securing people to staff them, and security 
arrangements. 
  Natal electoral officer Thabani Jali said after the Port 
Shepstone meeting the province was not "very problematic...but 
there are flash-points". 
  Of the seven districts in the greater Port Shepstone area, 
only two or three had been identified as flash-points. 
  Mr Jali said one of the IEC's plans was to put more polling 
stations in areas around flash-points. 
  Although the IEC trip was announced as a two-day affair, Mr 
Moseneke's programme states he will fly to Johannesburg at the 
weekend and return to Natal for three days next week.

<F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>
  [Text] East London April 7 SAPA -- Representatives of 
several political parties and other interest groups on Thursday 
[7 April] agreed on a code of conduct for free political 
activity in the Eastern Cape region. They also drew up 
proposals for a national code of conduct for the security forces 
during the elections. 
  Several important players in the region were absent from the 
all-day meeting in East London, among them the Transkei 
government and its security forces, the Democratic Party [DP], 
the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] and its armed wing the Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army. 
  Independent Electoral Commission Eastern Cape Mediation 
Director Stax Masango said he had sent invitations directly to 
Transkei ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa and the PAC, while DP 
leader Dr Zach de Beer had played an important behind-the-scenes 
role in encouraging people to attend the meeting. "We are not 
sure why they are not here," he said. "We haven't received any 
apologies from them." 
  He said the absentees would be invited to a follow-up 
meeting 
in East London on Tuesday next week. 
  Representatives of the African Christian Democratic Party, 
African Democratic Movement, African National Congress, National 
Party, Ciskei's interim administration and defence force, SA's 
Police and Defence Forces and business and farmers' 
organisations, agreed on a ten-point code of conduct for parties. 
  Among the points were a commitment to free and fair 
political 
activity in the region, a promise not to disturb other parties' 
meetings, and an undertaking to lodge complaints about breaches 
of the code with the Independent Electoral Commission. "The 
reason why the parties have accepted this code of conduct is 
that it is a reaffirmation of the principles of the Electoral 
Act and its regulations," said Mr Masango. "They merely wanted 
to express their commitment in a forum and also in public." 
  Contraventions of the code could be dealt with through the 
Electoral Act. But the parties had also acknowledged this was a 
historic meeting "and if they did not abide by this, history 
would judge them". 
  Among the issues which delegates felt should be dealt with 
in 
a code for security forces were protection of basic human 
rights, use of armed force, protection of polling stations and 
the relationship between the security forces and the media. 
  Mr Masango said the purpose of the code was to help the 
police and defence force to understand their functions and 
limits "under such difficult circumstances". 
  The proposals would be forwarded to the Transitional 
Executive Council for adoption, he said. If the code was 
promulgated nationally, it would have to be accompanied by a 
massive public information campaign.

  [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- About 3,000 South African 
Defence Force [SADF] soldiers would have been deployed in 
Natal/kwaZulu by Friday, SADF spokesman Cmdt Braam van Wyk said 
on Thursday [7 April]. He said the arrival on Wednesday of about 
700 more troops from 8 division would increase the SADF's 
operational strength in the province to about 3,000 once they 
had been fully deployed. 
  About 1,000 more troops had been called up from April 15 to 
May 15 for the period of the elections. These were citizen force 
members who would be deployed in "normal security functions". 
  Of the five companies of troops which arrived in the 
province 
on Wednesday, four were being deployed in northern Natal and the 
other around Durban to promote stability. "In northern Natal 
they will be deployed in the Eshowe area," he said.

the corps' code of conduct. A statement on Thursday [7 April] by 
the NPKF said Col Duma Mdutyana, until the disciplinary action 
its chief of staff, was "deseconded" from April 5 after the 
force's commander, Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, was informed that a 
court case was pending against him. 
  The other two officers relieved of their duties are Lt-Col 
George Sibanyoni, now former officer commanding Battalion 1, and 
media laison officer Capt Johan Loots. 
  Both Col Mdutyana and col Sibanyoni had joined the NPKF from 
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, 
MK]. 
  The statement said Col Mdutyana was facing a charge of 
drunken driving in an NPKF vehicle following an incident on 
March 20. 
  Col Sibanyoni, who was also dismissed on April 5, faces a 
possible charge of culpable homicide following a motor accident 
in Mamelodi, Pretoria, on the weekend of March 11-13. One person 
died in the accident. Col Sibanyoni was apparently driving an 
NPKF vehicle at the time. 
  According to the statement, Capt Loots of the South African 
Police was dismissed when it was established he had issued a 
press release in the name of NPKF public relations officer Maj 
William Bisho, without the major's permission. "(Capt) Loots 
also falsely claimed to have the permission of the NPKF GOC 
(general officer commanding) to organise a press 'open day' at 
De Brug on March 23, 1994 during the process of (troop) 
evaluation." 
  As a result, media coverage had been unsympathetic. 
  Capt Loots is also accused of breaching the powers of his 
position by dealing with the media without authorisation.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] This morning Radio Pretoria's commentary will carry 
the full text of a statement by the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] on citizen protection. The statement 
reads as follows: 
  The Boer Afrikaner community is three weeks away from an 
event which has the potential of becoming a powder keg. This 
event is the 27 April election. It is a deadly game. All 
responsible observers both here and overseas have warned against 
it. Members of the community and their leaders have a 
tremendous responsibility, and time is very limited. 
  Get hold of existing citizen protection literatude for hints 
as soon as possible. Become a close community. Mark the 
information in these documents according to the changing 
requirements in your community. The whole community must be 
involved: the weak, such as children, the infirm, the aged; and 
the strong and those who can defend their people. Remember the 
key points, the places which need to be protected. These 
include the schools, hospitals, nursery schools, and old-age 
homes. 
  Check on your supplies -- not just food and fuel, but also 
make sure you have sufficient medical supplies. Arrange for 
proper emergency communication facilities such as walkie-talkies 
and citizen band radios. Try to involve the total Boer 
Afrikaner community in this citizen protection exercise -- the 
worker, ambulanceman, doctor, nurse, chemist, priest, soldier, 
policeman, bus driver, train driver, bank manager, farmer, and 
miner. Get the whole community involved in exercises more than 
once, if possible. The whole citizen network must become 
involved. Be positive about the matter. Those who would like 
you to believe this is not a serious matter do not have your and 
your community's interests at heart. Do what you have to do 
thoroughly and earnestly. Do it religiously and help to achieve 
our own free homeland.

  [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the 
Lebowa government have appealed to striking officials to return 
to work immediately in order to restore essential services. The 
director general of the chief minister's office, Mr. J.M. 
(Mahlangu), made the appeal after a task group of the TEC had 
reported on the disruption of essential services, increasing 
tension and lawlessness in the area. The task group also 
reported on the apparent inability of the Lebowa government at 
the Department of Regional and Land Affairs to resolve Lebowa's 
financial problems. 
  Mr. (Mahlangu) said that the TEC had also decided that an 
effective administration had to be established in Lebowa as soon 
as possible and that administrators had to be appointed to 
assist in this. He said that the immediate task of the 
administration would be to appoint independent arbitrators to 
attend to the problems and complaints of officials.

  [Text] Pretoria April 6 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] has 
lodged a complaint with the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] against the African National Congress and its Western Cape 
preimeirship candidate Dr Allan Boesak. In a NP statement 
released on Wednesday, Mr Boesak is accused of lying and of 
making reckless statements "with the intention to defame and 
prejudice" the NP. 
  It is alleged that Mr Boesak told public meetings that 
"R350billion [rands] had been stolen from government coffers" 
and that R70 billion had "disappeared into the pockets of 
cabinet ministers and politicians". 
  According to the NP statement "summons has been served on 
Boesak and the ANC" and the matter is to be heard by Electoral 
Tribunal on Monday. 
  The NP has asked for an order "interdicting Boesak and the 
ANC" from repeating the statements and for the tribunal to 
impose a fine of R100,000.

<F P=106> [Debate between National Party spokesman Andries Beyers and </F>
Freedom Front spokesman Dr. Corne Mulder moderated by announcer 
Freek Robinson in the Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Good evening and welcome to Agenda. 
Well, there are approximately 20 days left before the election 
and the time is drawing near for people to understand more about 
the policies of the various political parties. Approximately a 
month ago, we began a series of debates between various 
political parties involved in the election. Tonight we have the 
National Party [NP] and the Freedom Front, and it is the first 
time they are facing each other because the Freedom Front was of 
course one of the last parties to register for the election. To 
represent these parties tonight, we have Mr. Andries Beyers of 
the NP, on my right, and on my left Dr. Corne Mulder of the 
Freedom Front. Before beginning tonight we tossed a coin to 
determine who would open tonight's debate and it was decided 
that Dr. Corne Mulder would receive one minute to state his 
views, thereafter Mr. Beyers, and at the end of the program we 
will follow the same order. Well, Dr. Mulder, you have one 
minute. 
  [Mulder] Thank you, Mr. Robinson. On 27 April, in all 
probability, the election will take place. Now compared to 
other elections in the recent past in southern Africa and 
South-West Africa, Angola, and Rhodesia, we have here a 
different situation in this specific election. We have 
succeeded, through negotiations, to what I call, force open an 
ethnic door in the interim constitution -- to force open a door 
for ethnicity, for political parties to follow their ideals, and 
this is contained in Article 34 of the interim constitution 
which refers to the issue of self-determination. Now Article 34 
makes specific provision for a community to demand any form of 
self-determination, for this to be made possible in the interim 
constitution. Provision can be made for this if there is proven 
support. For this reason the Freedom Front is taking part in 
the elections, to open this door of ethnicity, and to use the 
opportunity to prove maximum support, real support, for the 
Freedom Front's idea of self-determination for the Afrikaner 
nation. This is what we are doing at present. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Dr. Mulder. That was 1 minute and 15 
seconds. We now give Mr. Beyers of the NP a chance. 
  [Beyers] I think I want to immediately second Dr. Mulder's 
statements and say that the Freedom Front's decision to 
participate in the election is a step in the right direction for 
Gen. Viljoen and his people, as far as the National Party is 
concerned. They are taking part in a one man one vote election 
within an undivided South Africa. They are taking part in a 
constitution negotiated by the National Party, to which they 
have also contributed, and this is exactly what the National 
Party plans, namely, to bring about a constitution making it 
possible for parties to participate. I say that it is good for 
South Africa that they do participate in the election. Their 
decision to enter into the election lends legitimacy and 
credibility to the new constitution, and they are doing what I 
said last year in Parliament, that they and of course every 
other CP [Conservative Party] member will have to do and this 
is, in reality, to follow the leadership of State President F.W. 
de Klerk, right into the new South Africa. Tonight I want to 
tell Dr. Mulder and his people: Welcome. It is good that you 
are here. When South Africa is democratized then we can begin 
to seek solutions to our problems and we will find it. 
  [Robinson] Well, we will have to look at some of those 
solutions and I would like to hear what the real policy 
differences are between the two parties. Dr. Mulder? 
  [Mulder] There are far-reaching policy differences, Freek, 
and there are several important differences, but before I touch 
on these I want to react to statements made by Mr. Beyers, that 
he is so brave [as heard] and happy that we have accepted 
President de Klerk's leadership. That is not correct. We in 
the Freedom Front can think for ourselves. We evaluate 
political developments and we take the necessary steps to 
achieve our ideals. We do not accept the interim constitution. 
From the beginning we have said that the constitution is full 
of defects. The amendments we have succeeded in forcing through 
at the end of February, beginning of March, brought about 
certain improvements in the constitution, concerning 
self-determination, the establishment of a homeland council, 
etc., but in reality there are practical problems with the 
constitution. We reject it. The fact that one uses the 
opportunity to prove real support for the principle of 
self-determination can not be seen as lending legitimacy to this 
constitution. A constitution's legitimacy does not depend on 
whether people are voting or not voting. At the end of the day, 
it will depend on whether this thing can stand the test of time. 
We say it will not be able to do this, but we can use the 
process to achieve our ideals. 
  [Robinson] So you accept the process and you are using the 
process to arrive at a point where you can effect more changes? 
  [Mulder] Certainly, we say that the constitution is 
defective. As part of the Freedom Alliance we have always 
pressed for several changes and improvements to the 
constitution. We pressed for amendments which were later 
written into the constitution. We will come back to those later 
-- after the NP was totally satisfied with the constitution, 
even though it was full of defects at that stage. Now concerning 
basic differences, I want to say the following: The Freedom 
Front is demanding self-determination -- self-determination as 
an internationally recognized principle. 
  [Robinson] Do you regard that as a difference, self- 
determination? 
  [Mulder] Absolutely, a real difference. 
  [Robinson] Now let us stop right there for a while. Mr. 
Beyers, does the NP accept the principle of self-determination 
of not? 
  [Beyers] Well, the National Party went as far as writing it 
into the constitution, after negotiations, that there could be 
forms of self-determination. Indeed, there are meaningful forms 
of self- determination built into the present constitution. You 
see the problem thus far with the homeland -- and this is the 
self- determination proposed by the Freedom Front and it is 
their right to do so -- the problem with this is that the 
proponents of this did not have a plan on the table with which 
they could agree, even in their own ranks. The National Front 
of Gen. Viljoen, last year, and he was the co-leader of this, 
could not put a plan on the table with which the main members of 
the Front, that is the CP and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement], could agree. Indeed, the CP could not produce a plan 
with which their own caucus members could agree. When 
negotiations took place they demanded a homeland before 27 April 
or they would wage war, according to Gen. Viljoen and Dr. 
Hartzenberg, and President de Klerk said: Let's negotiate. 
Eventually President de Klerk wrote into the constitution 
exactly what they asked for, namely, a people's council, and a 
clause according to which further negotiations would be 
possible, concerning self-determination. Can I just conclude by 
saying that State President de Klerk did his best to accommodate 
them even though they could not agree amongst themselves. Then 
he said: Since you yourselves can't find a solution let me make 
this possible by amending the constitution, to make it possible 
for you to also amend the constitution after the election to 
make provision for self-determination. With this step Gen. 
Viljoen took the gap, participated and this was the right thing 
to do, and this is the success President de Klerk achieved. 
  [Freek] The specific question I wanted to ask you, Mr. 
Beyers, is whether the NP, and you as a person, accept the 
principle of self-determination regardless of what form it takes 
in the constitution? 
  [Beyers] Yes, unconditionally, provided that it can be 
practically achieved. It must be so formulated that it does not 
disadvantage other people. When self-determination is 
formulated in such a manner that it is not discriminatory toward 
other peoples and toward other communities, then the NP is 
inclined to accommodate it and, indeed, to press for it being 
written into a future constitution and also the final 
constitution. 
  [Robinson] What form would self-determination take in the 
state which the NP proposes? 
  [Beyers] The NP says there are various forms of self- 
determination. The only practical manner in which to negotiate 
it is to give people the opportunity to organize themselves into 
political parties and power groups, people with the same values. 
They must then be able to negotiate within an open democracy. 
We do not think it is practically possible to divide the 
country into a confederation, a confederation of independent 
states. The different regions and communities have too much in 
common, and therefore we stand for a federal system, and we have 
tried to include in the constitution as many federal features as 
possible. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Beyers. Let's take it a step 
further, Dr. Mulder. Self-determination. We accept that there 
are differences regarding self-determination. From what I see 
in your documents, you believe in a confederal system. That 
means that eventually you want to exercise your 
self-determination outside a unitary state -- an own homeland. 
  [Mulder] We have from the beginning said that we want true 
self-determination and all that it implies. I believe we must 
dwell on this idea of self-determination for a few minutes, 
because to a certain degree it forms the basis of our goal. It 
is not correct to say, as Mr. Beyers did, that the state 
president wrote self-determination into the constitution. The 
South African Parliament wrote it in. The fact is that this 
came about after the negotiation process in which the Freedom 
Alliance together with other parties included in the Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] had negotiated it and insisted that 
such a principle must be included. With all due respect to my 
colleague, I should have expected that the NP would claim to be 
the great patron which provided for self-determination in the 
constitution. That is not correct. The whole issue was 
negotiated. The NP was quite satisfied with the constitution as 
it stood, without the principle of self-determination. In 
December they moved it through Parliament and voted for it as it 
was. 
  [Robinson] The way I understand it, Dr. Mulder, according to 
what Mr. Beyers has said, the NP stands for self-determination 
within a unitary state, self-determination taking place through 
organizers of cultural groups, while your party stands for self- 
determination outside such a unitary state. So the way I 
understand it, they do not reject self-determination, they 
merely interpret it differently. 
  [Mulder] The self-determination for which the NP stands is 
contained in Principle 12 of the constitution. That is what I 
call the Saturday night option, which says you can promote 
social values on Saturday nights in your barn, listening to 
music, and so on. That's not true self-determination. We talk 
about true self-determination, internationally recognized, and 
which makes it possible for a nation, a community, to make its 
own decisions and govern itself. It's got nothing.... 
  [Robinson] But then it must be in an own state. 
  [Mulder] It must be part of a geographical dispensation, 
based on an own state. 
  [Robinson] An own state, an independent state? 
  [Mulder] We say we want a system for southern Africa which 
will bring stability. We believe it is possible, if you can 
have a system which provides for the maximum political 
independence but taking into account the realities of economic 
interdependence. The problem is not that self-determination has 
failed up to now because there was no plan. Mr. Beyers, when he 
was in the Afrikaner Volksunie [National Union], had a plan for 
self-determination. They had maps, everything, but it was not 
acceptable. So the problem was not whether or not one had a 
plan, it was the position of the South African Government and 
the ANC who continually pressed for a unitary state, which we 
maintain is not a federation. 
  [Robinson] Would you say that self-determination in your 
interpretation is only possible if it takes place in a 
geographical state, separate from the rest of South Africa? 
  [Mulder] No. There are various forms of self-determination. 
We believe that part of the solution for South Africa must 
include self-determination for those communities which choose 
it, linked to a geographical basis which we call a homeland. 
But there are also other forms of self-determination, in which 
one can, for example, attend to the interests of certain 
communities through community councils. We are not opposed to 
that, we say it is part of the solution. But if you cannot 
accommodate self-determination on that basis you will not find a 
solution. 
  [Beyers] Freek, I would just like to correct Dr. Mulder on 
the inclusion of the writing of the principles into the 
constitution -- the last of them were written in during March, 
including the principle of he homeland council. Of course, this 
came about through negotiation. But when the vote was taken in 
Parliament, Dr. Corne Mulder's party, the CP, voted against it. 
Only the NP voted for it. In other words, it was not forced 
through, While they were opposing it, the NP made it part of 
the constitution. The NP voted for it. But let's not get 
technical. Let's look at the forms of self-determination as 
proposed by the Freedom Front. I think we must determine the 
truth. The Freedom Front has announced a new policy. They say 
their policy is exactly the same as that of the CP; that the 
only difference is that they are participating in the election 
while the CP is not. What we would like to know from Dr. Mulder 
is: Where is this homeland, and whether other people living 
there will have rights -- voting rights. If these issues can be 
sorted out, one can begin to negotiate the implementation of the 
homeland. I know the CP's position. These people say they 
share the CP's position. Can Dr. Mulder then tell us whether it 
is the Freedom Front's policy that colored and black people will 
not have the vote in their future homeland? It is very 
important to resolve this issue so we can know what their policy 
is. 
  [Robinson] Could I just add, meanwhile, before we have a 
break. Mr. Beyers, last week I asked General Constand Viljoen 
the same question during an interview. He responded to the 
first question by saying the Freedom Front will go along with 
what Mr. Hartzenberg announced as a starting point in 
negotiations. So it seems as though we are going to debate the 
entire evening about CP.... 
  [Mulder, interrupting] But about the right to vote... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] I would like to [pauses]. I have 
noted here in my diary. I would like to give content to policy 
trends within regions, albeit a volkstaat or a new South Africa. 
As I have been made to understand, Dr. Mulder's National Front 
will participate in the election so that it can be determined 
where the volkstaat is going to be, so you have the chance to 
talk about borders before we go any further. 
  [Mulder] I want to just respond briefly to Mr. Beyers's 
question. If the National Party had cooperated in the 
negotiation process, we could have resolved the details of a 
volkstaat a long time ago. We wanted to have this done before 
27 April -- and this fact is already well known. However, there 
were a few practical problems. The first one was that the ANC 
had always questioned whether the National Front had substantial 
support for the idea; and the second point -- one Mr. Beyers 
harps on -- where was the geographic region? Regarding the 
support, we had a problem with that. We said we wanted the 
matter settled before 27 April, so that that date would not only 
be the day of liberation for others only, but for our people as 
well. 
  [Robinson] Good. Now you are going to participate, and you 
are going to prove that? 
  [Mulder] We are going to take part, and we are using the 
opportunity to prove that, because the practical problem had 
been: Even though the ANC had agreed that such a referendum 
could take place before 27 April, it had been the National Party 
which had been the obstacle. And I say it was malicious; it had 
not been in South Africa's interest; not in the interest of the 
Afrikaner and that of the whites; only in the interest of the 
National Party. The NP deliberately blocked it. 
  [Robinson] That political point has been made several times 
already, including by yourself. 
  [Mulder] You are right, but the problem is so large that the 
people out there should know about it. The fact is, if we talk 
about the geographic region, then we negotiated by saying that 
we do not only want to use the opportunity to prove maximum 
support for the idea of a volkstaat and self-determination. We 
also want to utilize the opportunity to determine the region 
where our people physically find themselves -- the people 
striving for this ideal. And therefore provision has to be made 
so that votes come in for the Freedom Front for the sake of this 
ideal, so that votes can be counted from every polling booth, so 
that after the election our people will know where they stand. 
Now to get to the specific point.... 
  [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Mulder, allow me to ask. Granted 
that homeland -- no matter where it is, how it is constituted, 
or whatever -- it is there, whether it is part of southern 
Africa, South Africa, federation or whatever, but that state is 
there. What will go on inside that state. What policies are 
you going to pursue? 
  [Mulder] The perception has been created that such a state 
will be for semi-retarded people and therefore it is going to be 
in a backward place and so on. Not at all. It is going to be a 
modern state like any other state in the world, one that will 
implement modern guidelines, normal world tendencies. So if you 
talk about.... 
  [Robinson interrupting] May I quickly ask you? I have with 
me here a booklet with all the constitutional policies of the 
various parties. And there is a whole series of different 
issues. I have also gone through your policies, and I must say 
with due respect, Dr. Mulder, within your policy principles, 
except the principle of self-determination and a homeland, you 
say very little -- if anything -- about what you want to do 
inside that state. What is, for example, your tax policy? What 
is your housing policy? What is your health policy? What is 
your education policy? What is your policy regarding voting 
rights? 
  [Mulder] We would have liked all those details to have been 
finalized. It was not possible. Now we have brought about a 
constitutional structure -- the Volkstaat [homeland] Council. 
The Volkstaat Council will comprise -- after the election -- 20 
members, with the exclusive purpose of analyzing all the 
relevant detail about a volkstaat, to negotiate and bring the 
matter to finality. Among others, legislative and executive 
structures, the relationship of the volkstaat at provincial and 
national levels, the boundaries, all those things. 
  [Robinson] May I ask you, Dr. Mulder, do you accept 
democratic principles to be entrenched, the fact that there has 
to be voting rights -- freedom to the right to vote? And what 
about those who do not support the volkstaat? 
  [Beyers] For blacks as well? 
  [Mulder] Give me a chance to just complete my answer. Mr. 
Beyers is so.... 
  [Beyers, interrupting] I just want to know, it is 
important.... 
  [Mulder] Mr. Beyers, you have one little point which you 
consider a good point. If you just give me the chance to 
respond then you will have a peaceful sleep tonight. 
  [Robinson] Please carry on. 
  [Mulder] It concerns this matter about the right to vote. Of 
course, each person must have the right to vote, but we differ 
in principle from the National Party. We say it is not 
democracy to draw arbitrary boundaries like is currently being 
done in South Africa -- to dump all communities together under 
one voters' list and then to say vote now, this is democracy. 
That is in no way democracy. We differ on that. 
  [Robinson] Within your state, will there be any blacks? 
  [Mulder] There will be blacks, there will be all types of 
people. 
  [Robinson] Are they going to vote? 
  [Mulder] Let me answer. It is not about blacks or 
non-blacks. It will depend on who is a citizen of that state, 
and who is not a citizen. 
  [Robinson] But will blacks be able to become citizens? 
  [Mulder] That will depend on the rules that will apply in 
that state. I just don't want to create a state, I want to 
create a state for Afrikaners. And as soon as you bring me a 
snow white Zulu, then I will give you a black Afrikaner. It is 
not about being white.... 
  [Robinson, laughing] But aren't you being racist? You are 
using the terminology.... 
  [Mulder] No, no, no. You are asking me about black people -- 
that is a racist statement. All that I'm saying is that we are 
in a dilemma because the Afrikaner is incidentally -- regarding 
race -- white. That is not the only characteristic, there are 
others as well. All I'm saying is.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Let's put it differently and say 
non-Afrikaners, or those who do not identify with the Afrikaner. 
Will they be able to become citizens, and will they be able to 
vote? 
  [Mulder] No, it will depend on certain things. They will be 
treated on the same basis as any other noncitizen is being 
treated in South Africa or in any other state in the world. In 
other words, normal rights, human rights, all those things will 
apply.... 
  [Robinson] In other words the right of access to any place, 
right to property? 
  [Mulder] Of course, but a person who is not a citizen of a 
state cannot lay claims on the right to vote in that state. 
  [Robinson] So that is the only disqualification? 
  [Mulder] Of course, it is determined on the basis of 
citizenship, not otherwise. In other words, the illusion is 
created that it is purely about race. It is not about that. It 
is about citizenship. 
  [Beyers] Could I just respond? You gave Mr. Mulder about 20 
minutes to talk uninterrupted. 
  [Robinson] Go ahead. 
  [Beyers] You see, that is the problem -- namely that Dr. 
Mulder has formed a party. He is asking people to vote for 
them. But after his explanation here tonight, or attempt at 
doing so, nobody knows what they will be voting for if they vote 
for the Freedom Front. He cannot say, the simple question on 
[changes thought]. Nobody knows this evening after Dr. Mulder's 
talk whether there will be a right to vote for all in their 
volkstaat -- yes or no. Nobody knows where the volkstaat is 
going to be for which they are supposed to vote. 
  [Robinson] That has already been mentioned. 
  [Beyers] The point is this: If you vote for the Freedom 
Front in this election, then you are voting for a secret. You 
don't know what you are voting for; and this is the problem we 
had, that the right-wing people -- and I was part of it -- up to 
this evening, could not agree on a plan for a volkstaat. They 
could not agree; and therefore it is a big problem to convince 
other people who are against a volkstaat, to convince them to 
agree to a volkstaat. I am saying tonight if people are living 
in the illusion that somewhere in the world you will get a 
situation that is tolerated where people, on the basis of their 
race or on the basis of their language or whatever, will be 
excluded from the right to vote in the country, region, town, 
city where they live -- then such people are living in a total 
illusion. There is no such thing. But tonight Dr. Mulder has 
unequivocally said that regarding these important things for a 
volkstaat -- they are only still going to negotiate them. 
Whether blacks are going to have the right to vote in that 
volkstaat -- they are still going to negotiate about that in the 
Volkstaat Council. He does not even mention what their 
standpoint is going to be in those negotiations. The point is, 
if you vote for the Freedom Front in this election you don't 
know what you are voting for. You will be voting for a secret. 
  [Robinson] Hang on, Mr. Beyers, you are giving a good 
summary, and I'm sure Mr. Mulder also appreciates the fact that 
his policy is being stated twice, even though under criticism. 
Now we get to your views -- those of the National Party. I 
would imagine -- and I've heard it before -- right or wrong -- 
that Afrikaners are saying that the National Party is not 
telling them what is going to happen to them. What guarantees 
are there for the Afrikaner -- if you say they must not vote for 
the Freedom Front -- inside the state which the National Party 
is going to offer them? 
  [Beyers] The National Party and the state president 
realized in time -- before I even realized it -- that the policy 
of apartheid could not continue; that it did not bring 
protection for Afrikaners and my people. It does not bring 
protection for my children. An alternate plan had to be made. 
And this plan was that South Africa had to be democratized; 
that racism had to be part of the past. 
  The state president had the leadership and the courage to 
carry through an unpopular decision in this regard, thereby 
leading his party and the Afrikaner on a new road to full 
democracy. Now we are saying that the best protection that 
there can be for Afrikaners -- and for all the people in South 
Africa -- is that all people with the same values, Christian 
values, values such as a free economy, private initiative; all 
those people who share the same values -- and there are 
thousands of them. Almost all the Afrikaners have those 
values, all the whites have those values, the great majority of 
coloreds, of Indians. A great number of blacks in South Africa 
have those same values which the National Party and Afrikaners 
have. And the state president has launched the initiative. He 
opened up his party to them. He put those people together in a 
power bloc. 
  [Robinson] What is the guarantee? 
  [Beyers] The guarantee is that -- and this is important to 
the Afrikaner -- those values that he shares with those people 
should triumph in a future dispensation. And if you gather 
those people in one powerful force, as the National Party is 
succeeding in doing, then that is the best protection which you 
can offer them. And in that case you are negotiating a 
constitutional dispensation in which those guarantees are 
protected through checks and balances, through a bill of 
fundamental rights, through constitutional measures such as a 
constitutional court and so on. And I say... 
  [Mulder] And cultural values? 
  [Beyers] The same applies to cultural values. It is the 
National Party which has entrenched this in the Bill of Human 
Rights; and the National Party is the agent of every minority 
group and the next government of national unity -- in which we 
will be presented strongly -- to see to it that the conditions 
of that Bill of Human Rights do support every minority group, of 
which the National Party is part. We say that is the only way. 
There is no other. 
  [Robinson] And if the ANC gets more than 66 percent in the 
election? 
  [Beyers] We will stop the ANC from getting more than 66 
percent; but disregarding that, the National Party negotiated so 
that the 34 constitutional principles are never changed; that 
they should not be changed through any majority. And we in the 
National Party in no way believe that the ANC will get a two 
thirds majority, but people must not be divided. They have to 
stand together, and the only party to stop the ANC from getting 
a two thirds majority is in fact the National Party. That is 
why in the election people must not go and vote for small 
parties such as the Freedom Front, the Democratic Party, and the 
other insignificant parties. The only effective vote to stop 
the ANC, to curb the ANC, is a vote for the National Party. 
President de Klerk has the courage, the leadership, the vision. 
He is a strong man, he knows what he is doing, and he will 
protect our people's interests in the new South Africa with the 
aid of a strong National Party. 
  [Mulder] That is commendable. Freek, I want to react to that 
if you don't mind. I am somewhat surprised. The National Party 
appears to be....[pauses] Mr. Beyers is saying the only way to 
stop the ANC is to vote for this big powerful National Party. 
I'm puzzled. Two years ago, Mr. Beyers stated in his manifesto 
when he won the Potchefstroom by-election that the National 
Party -- and it was not the old National Party but the new one 
with Mr. de Klerk at the head and the ANC unbanned. What did 
Mr. Beyers say in his manifesto? Tonight he is saying there is 
only one way -- we must vote for the NP. What did he say in his 
manifesto? He said there is only one way to stop the ANC from 
stealing our land -- get rid of the National Party government 
which is helping the ANC to establish a black majority 
government in South Africa. He said get rid of the National 
Party government, it's the biggest danger. Now he says this 
evening that the National Party is the party to stop the 
communists. Now I'm puzzled. The National Party, when 
communism was unbanned, Mr. de Klerk said -- and I think I must 
read it to you: The year 1989 will be known in history as the 
year in which communism died. The wave of violence came to en 
end when communism was unbanned. And now? Now he calls a press 
conference to warn South Africa about the enormous number of 
communists on the ANC's candidates' list. I'm puzzled. Has 
communism come to life again? Or was the National Party talking 
nonsense? 
  [Robinson] There are two questions which you asked. The 
first one is a little below the belt -- hitting at your own 
conscience, Mr. Beyers. You will have to bear the pain, and the 
second is about communism. 
  [Beyers] Alright, I'll bear the pain. I have changed my 
political views. I think Mr. Mulder has also changed his 
political views. 
  [Mulder] Not at all, not at all. Same policy, same policy. 
  [Beyers] Let me finish talking. When I left the Conservative 
Party, he and others said that when I started negotiating with 
the ANC I was a traitor, and three months thereafter he and Dr. 
Hartzenberg and others were negotiating with the ANC, and they 
were not traitors then. I don't think that's the point. I have 
altered my standpoint in politics for a better view. And that 
is true. I really believe that what the National Party is doing 
now is in the best interest of my people; because apartheid and 
a volkstaat and separate development we have tried, and they 
brought no protection to my people; and President de Klerk had 
the leadership to look people in the eye and say let's embark on 
another path, and he embarked on that path, and to me that seems 
to be the best path to tread. I therefore have no doubts that 
people will be wasting votes on other parties. 
  [Robinson] The question of communism? 
  [Beyers] Regarding the communists, up to now the CP and Dr. 
Mulder have been saying to ban the communists, put them back in 
jail. But they negotiate with Mr. Mandela and they negotiate 
with Mr. Joe Slovo. Did they, while negotiating with Mr. 
Mandela and Joe Slovo say, look, it is our policy -- you must go 
back to jail and your organization must be banned. The National 
Party maintained that to fight communism effectively you cannot 
lock it up in jails. You must level the playing fields, you 
must democratize the country, and then you tackle it on the 
political playing field. And that is what the National Party is 
doing. And the National Party has been right as far as that is 
concerned. Now it is effective, it can fight communism because 
it differs marginally with communism regarding economic policies 
and so on. 
  [Robinson] Both of you, our time is nearly up. Now I give 
you each a minute's chance to tackle each other. 
  [Mulder] You mean a minute to conclude? 
  [Robinson] Yes. 
  [Mulder] Thank you. I say that every voter out there who 
again trusts the National Party is doing it at his own risk. 
The voters out there should by now have learned that the 
National Party cannot be trusted -- we have seen the referendum 
promises, we have seen election promises -- there was nothing 
for our people in it. 
  Secondly, the National Party has all along been in alliance 
with the ANC during the entire negotiation process. I asked the 
president to name one example where the National Party came out 
in favor of Inkatha during the negotiations and he could not 
name one because there is none. That is why it is easy to play 
down smaller parties. The result will show who the small 
parties are. If you want to vote against the ANC -- and you 
must vote against the ANC as it is dangerous -- if you want to 
vote against it, you don't have to vote for the National Party 
for that purpose. The National Party cannot be trusted any 
more; that is why you can trust the Freedom Front. It is the 
only party which has fought for self- determination, which will 
look after minorities. You can trust General Viljoen, and if 
you do that, there will be a secure future for you. 
  [Robinson] Thank you very much, Mr. Beyers? 
  [Beyers] Freek, one thing is very clear this evening, and 
that is if you vote for the Freedom Front you don't know what 
you are voting for. You are voting for a secret. I say vote 
for the National Party because the National Party is ready to be 
the advocate of all peace-loving, moderate South Africans in the 
next government of national unity. The National Party is ready 
to implement its expertise in administration for the benefit of 
all the country's citizens. The National Party is prepared to 
allow the validity of our policy of private initiative to 
triumph over communism and over policies such as 
nationalization. The National Party is braced for the pressure 
which will come come from the free world, and also from the 
private sector, demanding a free market economy. The National 
Party is in gear to accompany the new government of national 
unity to accept a security strategy through which South Africa 
will be protected. The National Party is ready and able to 
protect the rights of minority groups, to implement the Bill of 
Rights for the protection of our people. The National Party is 
the only party strong enough to curb the ANC. 
  [Robinson] Thank you very much. All the best.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 7 SAPA -- The African Christian 
Democratic Party [ACDP] on Thursday [7 April] launched an 
election manifesto which, it said, provided a basis for the 
social and economic transformation of South Africa. 
  The programme is based on a moral, judicial and ethical 
system, open market economics and direct democracy. The ACDP 
said a mere change in centrl government would not answer South 
Africa's social needs. "If a new government attempts a mere 
lineal approach of more houses, more jobs, more teachers, more 
schools and more hospitals, it will bankrupt the country long 
before the goal is ever reached. A transformational strategy 
through the introduction of a new dimension of freedom is the 
only hope," the ACDP manifesto says. 
  The manifesto was introduced by party leader Kenneth Meshoe, 
Chairman Johan van der Westhuizen, spokesman Dan Maluleke and 
Policy Co-ordinator Nick Addison. 
  Dr van der Westhuizen said communities formed the building 
blocks of the ACDP's programme. "The ACDP stands for the 
centrality of the family as the home for human development and 
the cornerstone for building healthy communities and a stable 
society," the manifesto says. 
  "Community-based development organisations and/or community 
development trusts should assist local government in the 
implementation of the various development and social delivery 
functions on a contractual basis. Community involvement in the 
allocation and uses of scarce resources will improve 
transparency and a more equitable application of these 
resources." 
  Dr van der Westhuizen said the party was committed to 
federalism with a two-tier government, the first tier being a 
small central government and the second being district 
governments. The system's purpose would be to curb the growth 
of bureaucracy and to prevent majoritarian tyranny. 
  The ACDP would create wealth by stimulating entrepreneurship 
and small business. It opposed redistribution of wealth and 
confiscation of land although it supported land restitution by 
legal means. "The ACDP opposes policies which will simply dump 
families on unsustainable plots of land, which will trap them 
into subsistence and poverty. Land allocation will have to meet 
the criterion of viability and will have to be supplemented by 
effective support systems to avoid further depletion and erosion 
of a scarce resource," the manifesto says. 
  Under an ACDP government, social services would be provided 
by district governments while the state would provide services 
within its means. Statutory bodies would be set up to maintain 
national standards which would become equitable over a 10-year 
period. 
  Dr van der Westhuizen said the ACDP had 147 offices 
countrywide and the support of about 8,000 "community" leaders. 
It was formed in December last year to contest the elections 
nationally.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  New Police Union Members Threaten Strike -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 8 April in a page-10 editorial comments on 
the threatened strike by members of the newly formed South 
African Police Union (SAPU), saying the primary grievance 
fuelling discontent is "financial". Union members object to 
discrepancies between their salaries and those paid to soldiers 
in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). SAPU leaders are 
"under pressure to agree to a strike on April 13 if no remedial 
action is taken. The argument of militant members is powerful: 
SAPU memoranda submitted to President de Klerk and the 
Transitional Executive Council have been shelved, but when the 
NPKF recruits went on strike their demands for more pay were 
speedily met." THE STAR believes a strike by SAPU members can 
only "compound the crisis" in police ranks. The NPKF is a 
"small and untested military unit" and "a heavy burden of 
protecting the electoral process already falls on the 
overstretched SADF [South African Defense Force]. If that 
burden is increased by a strike in police ranks, the election 
itself may be imperiled, particularly if there is renewed 
violence outside kwaZulu/Natal." 
  Article Warns of `Undemocratic' Guarantees for Zulu Kingdom 
-- Hugh Roberton writes in an article on the same page that what 
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu 
King Zwelithini are demanding "in essence are guarantees of the 
survival, and future status, of the Zulu king and his kingdom. 
The only way which De Klerk and Mandela can do this is by way 
of constitutional guarantees which do not now exist." For the 
sake of what would be a "precarious peace at best, are De Klerk 
and Mandela prepared to promise to guarantee the king's right, 
for instance, to have a say in the appointment of some of the 
regional kwaZulu/Natal cabinet?" Roberton believes that "while 
a degree of constitutional flexibility is needed in South Africa 
to satisfy the `special circumstances' that might exist in a 
region, such flexibility surely should not extend to granting 
individuals, or groups, powers which they do not now have and 
which they have not had for almost a century. Such a profoundly 
undemocratic dispensing of power in the case of kwaZulu would 
amount to entrenching a 19th century tribal fiefdom into the 
constitution of a country standing at the doorway of the 21st 
century." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Proposals Can Be Made To Satisfy Zulu Leaders -- 
Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 8 April finds it "difficult" to be 
optimistic about the 8 April meeting between President de Klerk, 
ANC leader Nelson Mandela, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. However, SOWETAN is sure there 
are "various proposals that can be made to satisfy both Zulu 
leaders. In any case, isolating Buthelezi will not solve the 
problem: he is a key factor in the politics of kwaZulu-Natal. 
It is now evident that the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front 
-- AVF] is prepared to enter the race, which makes a solution in 
Natal even more vital. The state of emergency cannot be lifted 
immediately even if it were an almost panic-driven move to quell 
the violence." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Emergency Not Enforced in Natal -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN in English for 8-14 April in its page-14 editorial says 
the emergency regulations imposed in Natal were "horribly like 
the emergency regulations of the 1980s, and would fall foul of 
the Bill of Rights the government and the ANC purport to 
support." The security force members have "blanket immunity" 
and the detainees receive "so little protection." However, 
having "given themselves these powers, the authorities then fail 
to use them in any significant way." Among other things the 
soldiers form a "scanty presence in the urban areas," and the 
police "find themselves unable to disarm marchers in Empangeni 
who are blatantly breaking the ban on dangerous weapons." "It 
would have been better to use existing, normal law and order 
powers -- of which the authorities have plenty -- to deal with 
the problem, rather than a showy emergency that is not enforced."

  [Excerpts] Following the untimely death in Rwanda yesterday 
of President Cyprien Ntaryamira and of two of his ministers, the 
speaker of the National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has 
addressed a peace message to the Burundian nation. What were 
the contents of his message, (Christophe Burunziza)? 
  [(Burunziza)] As we reported to you last night, the speaker 
of the National Assembly began his message by stating that the 
Burundian people had once again been hit by tragedy. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya went on to say that the president of the Republic 
yesterday went to the Republic of Tanzania in order to meet his 
counterparts in the subregion. 
  On his way back to Bujumbura, President Ntaryamira traveled 
in the same aircraft as Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. 
The tragic deaths occurred as the presidential aircraft was 
landing at Kanombe International Airport, Kigali. All the 
passengers, the speaker of the National Assembly continued, were 
killed. [passage omitted] 
  The speaker of the National Assembly once again called on 
the 
Burundian people and friends of Burundi to remain calm and keep 
their courage up in spite of these present unfortunate, trying 
times. This was necessary, Ntibantunganya continued, because 
the Burundian parliament and government were continuing to 
perform the functions vested in them. The speaker of the 
National Assembly urged the whole population to safeguard 
security. He called on all Burundians to transcend the current 
situation so that we could together all look for the true path, 
which would open new horizons for us, especially in seeking to 
strengthen peace and security, so that the government and 
parliament could jointly look for a way out of the present 
crisis for Burundi. 
  That is why, the speaker of the National Assembly added, a 
committee in charge of examining the development of the current 
situation was set up yesterday to allow all Burundians, without 
exception, regain peace and security. The committee is composed 
of the following officials: National Assembly Speaker Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya; Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko; Defense 
Minister Gedeon Fyiroko; (Corneille Buzigye), the chairman of 
the Front for Democracy in Burundi parliamentary group; (Vames 
Vantsuhye), coadministrator general of documentation; and 
Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, the Army Chief of Staff. 
  Sylvestre Ntibangunganya ended his message to the Burundian 
nation [break in reception]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Armed Forces to the people and the </F>
bereaved families; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Burundi Armed Forces have just learned with 
dismay and deep sorrow the tragic loss of the head of state, who 
is also the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and of two 
members of the government, in a plane accident over Rwandan 
territory. 
  Unfortunately the accident occurred when our head of state 
was tirelessly working towards getting Burundi out of the crisis 
and the sociopolitical stagnation in which it has been plunged 
since the tragic loss of late President Melchior Ndadaye. 
  The Burundian Armed Forces convey to the entire nation, to 
the family of late President Ntaryamira, and to the families of 
the ministers who died in the tragedy, their deep sympathy and 
join them in this profound sorrow. They urge the people to 
maintain peace and dignity in these hard and trying times. 
  They take this opportunity to reiterate to the follow-up 
committee, to the Parliament, and to the government, their firm 
determination to get our country out of the crisis. 
  Signed, Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted]. Telephone communication with 
Kigali was very difficult this morning. Ghislaine Dupont 
nevertheless managed to get through and gather some details on 
the situation in the capital. The situation in Kigali appears 
extremely tense. 
  [Dupont] Absolutely, grenade and rocket fire can still be 
heard at this moment in Kigali, and this has now been going on 
for several hours. Fighting was reported this morning around 
the presidential palace. People are keeping off the streets, 
and, according to Western sources in Kigali, neither the 
gendarmerie nor the Army control the situation. Some sources 
report gunfire in barracks around Kigali. It remains difficult 
to identify who is shooting in the streets. There is also 
reported to be looting, and ministers are being hunted down. 
The prime minister had time to take refuge in the UNDP [UN 
Development Program] headquarters, which then came under mortar 
fire. Minister for Social Affairs and Labor Landouald Ndasingwa 
was killed this morning, according to diplomats. Three other 
cabinet ministers and three UN military observers have been 
kidnapped by members of the Presidential Guard, according to a 
UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] official. Other 
sources report the arrest of the chairman of the Constitutional 
Court, who, according to the constitution, was due to take over 
the Presidency after the death of President Habyarimana.

  [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- Three Rwandan ministers and 
their three United Nations guards were taken captive Thursday [7 
April] by members of President Juvenal Habyarimana's 
Presidential Guard, a spokesman for the UN mission in Rwanda 
said. "We do not know whether these elements of the 
Presidential Guard were acting on their own initiative or 
following orders," the spokesman said. 
  The three members of the cabinet, all members of the 
opposition, were named as Faustin Rucogoza, Frederic 
Nzamurambaho and Landouald Ndasingwa, the Information, 
Agriculture and Labour Ministers. They were taken from their 
homes, some with relatives, the spokesman added.

  [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- Three Rwandan ministers 
opposed to President Juvenal Habyarimana who died yesterday, and 
three UN military observers posted to guard them, were today 
"kidnapped" by elements of the Presidential Guard, a spokesman 
of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] disclosed. The 
kidnapping of the ministers and the UN observers is "a 
reprehensible act that we view with utmost concern," the 
spokesman added. The three ministers, who were kidnapped at 
their homes with their families in some cases, were Information 
Minister Faustin Rucogoza, Agriculture Minister Frederic 
Nzamurambaho, and Labor Minister Landouald Ndasingwa, the UNAMIR 
spokesman specified. 
  Mr. Rucogoza is a member of the Republican Democratic 
Movement, the main Rwandan opposition party, and Mr. 
Nzamurambaho belongs to the Social Democratic Party while Mr. 
Ndasingwa leads the Tutsi branch of the Liberal Party. The 
government formed in July by President Juvenal Habyarimana 
included ministers from the opposition. The "broad-based" 
interim government, which was expected to have been put in place 
early this year, was also expected to include members of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, a former armed rebel movement of the 
minority Tutsi ethnic group. 
  Sporadic shooting continued to be heard in several districts 
of Kigali this afternoon but no casualty list has been drawn up 
on these clashes which, apparently, involve youths and the Army, 
UNAMIR added. The UNAMIR spokesman also disclosed that the 
Presidential Guard today, without explanation, denied his 
organization access to the spot where the Rwandan president's 
plane crashed yesterday evening. Consequently, the UN office in 
Kigali is unable to confirm the Rwandan Defense Ministry's 
statement according to which the presidential plane was shot 
down by "unidentified armed elements."

  [Excerpts] The situation is very serious in the Rwandan 
capital, Kigali. [passage omitted] It now seems quite clear that 
hard-line factions, including President Habyarimana's 
Presidential Guard are hunting down the moderates, be they Hutu 
or Tutsi. [passage omitted] 
  There are reports of sporadic gunfire in several quarters of 
Kigali, where there are clashes between youths and soldiers. We 
have not yet received any toll for these clashes. What seems 
clear is that there is growing tension between the Presidential 
Guard and the United Nations. The spokesman for the UN 
peacekeeping forces in Rwanda has said that they were prevented 
by the Presidential Guard from going to the scene of the crash 
of the presidential plane. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who is currently on an 
official visit to Romania, said he planned to call on the United 
Nations to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations mission 
in Rwanda. Willy Claes stressed that the Belgian peacekeeping 
forces should intervene to defend Kigali airport.

  [Text] United Nations, April 7 (AFP) -- Three Belgians 
working for the United Nations Mission in Rwanda have been 
killed in the chaos that followed the deaths of the presidents 
of Rwanda and Burundi, a UN spokesman said Thursday [7 April]. 
  It was unclear whether the three who died were the same as 
the three UN guards taken captive Thursday by elements of the 
Rwandan Presidential Guard, the spokesman, Joe Sills said. 
  Another UN spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said there were 
unconfirmed reports that the Rwandan prime minister had been 
killed. 
  There was sporadic fighting in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, 
as the government said that the plane that crashed killing the 
presidents of Rwanda and Burundi had been shot down by 
unidentified attackers.

  [Excerpts] The assassination yesterday of the presidents of 
Rwanda and Burundi has plunged the Rwandan capital into total 
chaos. [passage omitted] 
  The Rwandan prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyamana, has been 
killed in the center of Kigali, near the presidential palace, 
but the circumstances of her death remain unclear. The UN 
mission, UNAMIR, has not been allowed to inspect the site of her 
death. Some sources said this morning that she had tried to 
take refuge in the UN Program for Development headquarters, 
while others say that she was killed while under the protection 
of Senegalese blue helmets. [passage omitted] 
  There are reports of house-to-house massacres, and small 
groups of youths have been seen roaming the streets armed with 
machetes and clubs. The Jesuit community in Kigali also seems 
to have been specifically targeted. Seventeen Jesuit priests 
were savagely murdered at the Christos Center. A group of 
soldiers divided those present, separating the Rwandan priests 
from the foreigners. A jeep full of officers arrived a few 
moments later, and then the soldiers gave the order to execute 
the Rwandans, both Tutsis and Hutus without distinction. This 
is what we were told by one of the surviving priests. 
  This evening, we have also heard from UNAMIR that members of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who had been billeted in the 
compound of the former parliament since the Arusha accords, have 
come under attack from members of the gendarmerie. There has 
been hand-to-hand fighting, but we still do not have any toll 
for today's violence.

  [Text] The death yesterday of the Rwandan president 
continues to be used as a pretext for (?his guards) to 
perpetrate extreme violence. Immediately following the crash of 
the aircraft taking President Habyarimana back to Kanombe 
Airport, sections of the Presidential Guard have perpetrated 
unbridled killings, particularly of an ethnic and political 
nature. Members of the Tutsi ethnic group are being massacred 
indiscriminately, along with senior officials from political 
parties known for their opposition to the despotic ideals of 
[words indistinct]. 
  According to reports reaching us, it is in this context that 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana has been assassinated, 
along with her family. This is reportedly the same in the case 
of Joseph Kavaruganda, the chairman of the Constitutional Court; 
Landouald Ndasingwa, the minister of labor and social affairs 
and vice chairman of the Liberal Party [PL]; and Information 
Minister Rucogoza. 
  Cases of kidnapping by these same Presidential Guards have 
also been noted, notably that of Frederic Nzamurambaho, chairman 
of the Social Democratic Party [PSD], and (Felicien Ngango), 
first vice chairman of the PSD, to mention only a couple of 
people. 
  Massacres are continuing [word indistinct]. Apparently, the 
perpetrators do not intend to stop soon, especially because they 
have been (?aided) by the defense minister's communique, which 
urges the people to remain in their houses, thus making them 
very vulnerable to the killers who, under these conditions, can 
finish off the victims in their homes.

  [Excerpts] The situation in Kigali is dramatic. The 
Presidential Guard is looting and killing. We have just spoken 
to Colonel Marchal, the commander of the Belgian blue helmets in 
Rwanda. He has denied the reports about the death of three 
Belgian military observers. However, 10 Belgian soldiers have 
been taken prisoner by the Rwandan Army. They are being 
detained at a camp in Kigali, but we have no further news about 
them. Two Ghanaian blue helmets have, however, been killed. 
[passage omitted] 
  We are also getting reports of a violent confrontation 
between the Presidential Guard and soldiers of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front, who have left the building where they were 
based in central Kigali.

  [Excerpts] The situation in Kigali has deteriorated 
dramatically. This sums up the reaction of the international 
community after the unleashing of violence following the deaths 
of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi the day before 
yesterday. Yesterday, armed rival factions fought in Kigali, 
where armed men carried out a veritable cleansing of political 
circles and those in favor of democratization. Priests also 
paid the price in this settling of scores, as well as Belgian 
soldiers. The spokesman of the UN force in Rwanda -- 2,000 
soldiers in all -- this morning released the names of 10 Belgian 
peacekeepers shot dead by Rwandan soldiers. The soldiers, all 
Belgians, were responsible for ensuring the safety of the prime 
minister, Madame Uwilingiyimana. [passage omitted] 
  Listen to what Colonel Marchal, who leads the Belgian 
contingent in Rwanda, has to say about it. 
  [Begin Marchal recording] The soldiers were part of the 
mortar platoon of the battalion, which was carrying out escort 
duty for ministers and VIPs, it was a security escort. 
Yesterday, during the day, some of them were separated from 
their ministers, because the ministers were either killed or 
abducted, and they found themselves in the midst of the Rwandan 
armed forces. They were disarmed, taken to a district in the 
center of town, the Kigali camp [as heard], and there, 
apparently, they were maltreated by certain soldiers and shot 
dead. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Apart from the prime minister, the speaker of the National 
Assembly and the chairman of the Constitutional Court were also 
murdered, as were several leaders of opposition parties, along 
with their families. The president of the Human Rights League 
was shot dead by soldiers while she was speaking on the 
telephone to a Belgian interlocutor. [passage omitted] 
  The Belgian reaction was rapid: A meeting of the cabinet was 
held yesterday evening until 0100 this morning. The prime and 
foreign ministers, Dehaene and Claes, who are visiting abroad, 
have been recalled to Belgium, and a further meeting of the 
cabinet is due to be held this morning. The king and the queen, 
who are also visiting abroad, are also returning to Belgium.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 8 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting with heavy 
weapons continued in Kigali this morning, notably in the 
district where the former Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
movement's contingent is based, according to a Rwandan reporter. 
According to telephone reports received in Bujumbura, capital 
of neighboring Burundi, soldiers of the Rwandan Presidential 
Guard, who are almost exclusively Hutus, and Hutu militiamen, 
have killed several Tutsi tribesmen and burned down their 
houses. According to officially unconfirmed reports, several 
ministers and opposition party members who were kidnapped 
yesterday by soldiers of the Presidential Guard have been 
assassinated. It was not possible to establish telephone 
contact with Rwanda this morning from any country other than

  [Excerpt] As was already reported by Kigali Radiodiffusion 
Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in a Defense Ministry 
announcement, and as was reported by the world's radios, 
President Habyarimana has reportedly died in a plane crash near 
Kanombe Airport at around 2000 hours. [passage omitted] 
  Youth Minister Seth Sendashonga, a member of the RPF 
[Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] political bureau, said that under the law it 
was difficult to replace President Habyariman, but that 
politically the problem could be solved. 
  Mr. Seth Sendashonga said that President Habyarimana's 
party, 
the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
[MRND] would provide two candidates, one of whom will be chosen 
in accordance with the provisions of the peace accord. 
  Mr. Seth Sendashonga was also asked about those persons who 
say that the plane might have been shot down by the RPF. Seth 
Sendashonga said the RPF held in contempt the shameful act of 
killing people in that way. He said the RPF had fought a tough 
war and had done enough to prove its power. He said that a 
peace agreement had been signed and that things were almost 
coming to a conclusion. So there was no reason for the RPF to 
kill Habyarimana.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Two countries -- Rwanda and Burundi -- are today 
stunned by the death of their presidents. The plane they were 
traveling in from a summit in Dar es Salam crashed at Kigali 
Airport. There were strong reports that it was shot down. 
President Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprien Ntaryamira 
and the other passengers and crew were all killed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Well, if the presidential plane was shot down, then almost 
certainly an accusing finger will be pointed by some quarters at 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. They fought President 
Habyarimana's government during the civil war, they are still 
armed, and don't see eye to eye with the government over the 
implementation procedures. Timothy Ecort asked RPF Commander 
Major General Paul Kagame if his men had shot down the plane: 
  [Begin recording] [Kagame] No, no. To the best of my 
knowledge, they didn't. The RPF batallion in Kigali is guarded 
by the UN force and the shooting couldn't have come from that 
batallion and we have nothing to do with that incident at all. 
  [Ecort] You are quite certain about that? 
  [Kagame] Yes, I am sure. If I wasn't I should let you know. 
  [Ecort] Do you have any clues as to what happened to the 
airoplane? 
  [Kagame] Nothing at all. Not at all. But... [pauses] well, 
I am not very surprised given the situation we have had in this 
country for quite some time, where everybody has access to all 
types of weapons and with the chaos that has been going on in 
the country, I am not very surprised. Anybody could do that 
kind of job. 
  [Ecort] Are you shocked? 
  [Kagame] Well, I am just aggrieved. I am not shocked. I 
have heard of such a thing happening elsewhere, the kind of 
business we have been engaged in is that of war, so I am not 
very shocked. Such a thing can happen but it is unfortunate. 
  [Ecort] But you are not supposed to be at war at the moment, 
aren't you? Aren't you supposed to be negotiating with the 
government? 
  [Kagame] Yes, that is correct. We are not supposed to be at 
war. In fact, we are not even supposed to be negotiating. I 
think negotiations were also over long ago. We are supposed to 
implement what were agreed on in those negotiations. 
  [Ecort] That is what I mean. You said these things happen 
when you have chaos in the country, but you are saying this 
thing is not related to the problems you are having in reaching 
an agreement with the government. 
  [Kagame] I am saying... [pauses] the incident is certainly 
related to the political chaos going on in the country and there 
are so many parties to that problem. So, I am only imagining 
that could be a result of that situation we have been in for 
quite some time after the negotiations at a time when we should 
be implementing what we have agreed on in those negotiations. 
  [Ecort] What do you think this will do to the situation 
inside Rwanda now? 
  [Kagame] Well, I always imagine this may create some 
problems. I always imagine that people who may come up with all 
sorts of courses of action. So, we are just waiting to see what 
happens. But on our part, we think it is an unfortunate 
incident, but everybody should try and keep on the track on the 
peace process. 
  [Ecort] Do you fear that chaos will break out again? 
  [Kagame] Well, there is a possibility. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the armed wing of the RPF on 7 April; </F>
place not given; read by (Emmanuel Muzinga)] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] (?increasing) deterioration of 
the situation, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] made public a 
communique [words indistinct] (Emmanuel Muzinga): 
  [(Muzinga)] Here is a communique from the Rwandan Patriotic 
Army [RPA] military high command: 
  While regretting the tragic events that caused the death of 
the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and 
Cyprien Ntaryamira, we call on the Rwandan people, and on 
friends of the RPF in particular, to remain calm and allow our 
country to pass through the current difficult period without 
mishap. 
  We also wish to warn certain elements, which are 
exacerbating 
this situation by attacking members of opposition parties or 
Tutsis. By this we mean that at this moment, Rwandans are being 
persecuted, or perhaps even killed, because of their political 
or ethnic affiliations. These acts of violence are mainly 
attributed to sections of the Presidential Guard, who are backed 
by government soldiers. 
  To safeguard the peace process initiated in our country, all 
these acts of violence must cease immediately. This is the only 
effective means of resolving Rwanda's problems. Every kidnapped 
individual and his family must be released immediately. 
  If these demands are not met, or if the relevant authorities 
fail to get the situation under control, the RPF and its army 
will be compelled to take all necessary steps to carry out a 
sacred duty -- that of protecting the country's innocent 
citizens. We hope that reason will prevail over passion and 
that everyone will realize that neither violence nor war can 
help us solve Rwanda's problems.

  [Text] Geneva, April 8 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali Friday [8 April] ordered his special envoy 
in Rwanda to bolster safety measures in the country and 
especially in the capital, where chaos has broken out since the 
deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents this week. 
  In a written statement read by his spokeswoman Therese 
Gastaut, he also condemned "the odious attacks" in which 10 
United Nations peacekeepers died. 
  Butrus-Ghali said he was asking his envoy in Rwanda, 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, "to take all measures to guarantee 
safety throughout the country and particularly in Kigali," the 
capital. 
  There were no details on what measures Booh-Booh would be 
asked to enact. Some 2,500 UN peacekeepers are in the country 
to help ensure a peaceful transition to elections scheduled to 
take place next year. 
  Pandemonium and ethnic violence have broken out in the 
country since the deaths of the two presidents in a plane crash 
Wednesday evening. 
  The UN chief also said he had "learned with great 
indignation 
of the new incidents in Rwanda and especially the tragic death 
of Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana." 
  He was working on a report for the Security Council 
recommending ways of protecting UN staff, the statement said. 
  In Brussels earlier, sources said Rwandan employees of 
foreign aid workers in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan 
troops, while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns 
have been killed amid the ethnic violence. 
  Troops have been blamed for the murder Thursday of 
Uwilingiyimana, killed in the aftermath of the plane crash 
deaths.

  [Text] Nigeria has appealed to the United States to lift 
the ban preventing Nigerian officials from traveling to that 
country. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., Alhaji Zubeiru Mahmud 
Kazaure, made the appeal in Los Angeles in a television program 
on Africa. Ambassador Zubeiru Kazaure said the ban by President 
Clinton had made the collection of visas very difficult for 
Nigerians traveling to that country. He said the United States 
should have allowed Nigerian leaders to intimate her with their 
programs instead of taking a hasty action. Ambassador Kazaure 
also expressed concern on the way and manner Nigerians were 
being maltreated in that country. He said the U.S. should rather 
commend Nigerians, who provide employment for others and those 
employed in American organizations, instead of harassing them 
unduly.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's 
advisers and assistants today worked with the troika of 
observers in Lusaka. The National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] says, however, that it will 
present no one for the National Electoral Council, CNE, adding 
that that is one issue still to be discussed. Pedro Manuel, our 
correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  Some technical issues pertaining to the UN Angola 
Verification Mission-2's mandate and the second round of 
presidential elections were discussed during the meeting. The 
negotiating teams remained in the warmth of their hotels. 
  UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has left for Geneva 
to 
discuss the process of negotiation with UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Beye is only expected back on 8 or 9 
April. Until then, there will be no work for the negotiating 
teams. In fact, some people say that the proceedings will only 
resume on 11 April. 
  There was talk yesterday that UNITA was proposing changes to 
the CNE's organizational and functional framework. Things were 
made clearer today: UNITA believes that competing parties 
should enjoy parity representation on the CNE. What is more, 
Jonas Savimbi's organization also says that public figures in 
the CNE must not be picked by the president of the Republic 
alone. UNITA has described these as necessary changes to some 
points contained in the Electoral Law. 
  Nothing is known about the government's reaction to that 
UNITA proposal. If we think back, however, we will realize that 
the government has always said that legal issues can only be 
dealt with in Parliament.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan and Clive Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Friday's [8 April] summit 
between South Africa's four key leaders comes amid unprecedented 
levels of political violence in Natal/kwaZulu and a hardening of 
positions on this month's election. 
  African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, State 
President F W de Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi are 
to meet at a secret venue in what is widely perceived as a 
last-ditch attempt to save the country from a bloody poll in 
three weeks' time. 
  On the eve of the summit, the ANC, through Mr Mandela and 
its 
Natal region, was adamant there was no chance of an election 
postponement. But IFP marchers in Empangeni this week demanded 
elections be delayed to allow international mediation to run its 
course. 
  A memorandum presented by the marchers warned the 
Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] it would find it difficult to conduct 
peaceful, free and fair elections unless the IFP's 
constitutional demands for federalism were met. 
  This came as violence threatened to engulf the Natal/kwaZulu 
region, with scores of townships and rural settlements already 
under virtual siege and death tolls climbing at alarming rates. 
Despite last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency, 
more than 120 people have been killed in what amounts to an 
average daily toll of more than 17 lives. 
  Although IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke said on Thursday 
the commission was forging ahead with preparations for elections 
in Natal/kwaZulu, electioneering has become virtually impossible 
in many areas of the region. 
  His view was endorsed by IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler. Elections would be held in kwaZulu in spite of 
political unwillingness, Mr Justice Kriegler said. 
  At least two voter education workshops have been attacked 
and 
a National Party MP in northern Natal was forced to flee a mob 
while putting up posters last week. 
  KwaZulu MPs and tribal chiefs have also made it clear to Mr 
Justice Kriegler that the IEC is unwelcome in many rural areas 
under kwaZulu control. 
  ANC Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe said the ANC was 
hoping Friday's summit would pave the way for free and fair 
elections in Natal. "We'd like the king to indicate to all his 
subjects that it is a democratic right for everyone to vote. 
The ANC would also like to indicate to His Majesty what we feel 
about the future of the Zulu monarchy. We are hoping to dispel 
some misconceptions," he said. 
  Mr Radebe said Mr Mandela would meet King Zwelithini 
privately at the undisclosed summit venue before the four 
leaders meet. 
  IFP Central Committee member Thembinkosi Memela said his 
party remained inflexible on its rejection of the negotiated 
interim constitution. "We will be firm on these issues, and 
that is the reason why international mediators have been called 
in to settle the constitutional dispute -- because we are firm." 
  He said Zulu self-determination and King Zwelithini's 
demands 
for sovereignty would also be addressed at Friday's talks. 
  A Durban newspaper on Thursday reported King Zwelithini was 
prepared to become ceremonial head of kwaZulu/Natal and drop his 
demand for an independent Zulu kingdom if this would help reach 
a settlement. Mr Memela, however, said he was unaware of this 
development. 
  Questioned on whether anything concrete was likely to come 
out of the summit, Mr Memela said: "In the light of escalating 
violence, everyone is serious about solving these problems. But 
I'm neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic. I expect the 
leaders to do the best they can under the circumstances." 
  Meanwhile, University of Durban-Westville political analyst 
Kiru Naidoo said: "It would be too much to expect a significant 
breakthrough at this extremely late stage. I can't imagine 
anything that can be arrived at that would pave the way for the 
IFP's participation in elections. If (Friday's) meeting can 
secure free and fair political activity, that is the most 
significant thing one can expect. To reduce tension, we would 
need King Zwelithini to urge his followers -- as difficult as 
they would find the situation -- to allow the democratic process 
to continue unhindered."

  [Text] Cape Town April 7 SAPA -- Former Western Cape MK 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
commander and ANC Regional Secretary Tony Yengeni on Thursday [7 
April] night said he was communist and always would be one. 
  Addressing more than 1,000 ANC Western Cape Youth League 
members he said the organisation had planned a weekend full of 
events to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of SA 
Communist Party [SACP] Secretary-General Chris Hani. 
  SACP Chairman Joe Slovo is to address rallies in Guguletu 
and 
Khaylitsha this weekend. There will be an ANC/SACP alliance 
march from Guguletu to the Manenberg police station. 
  Mr Yengeni called on the Youth League members to pull up 
their socks to explain to coloured people the position of the 
ANC and spread the organisation's word on trains, to "reduce the 
tensions between African and coloured people" in the peninsula. 
  "I am a communist and I have always been one. I will 
struggle and also die for the interests of the workers in this 
country as Chris did," Mr Yengeni said. 
  An MK leader representing the Western Cape region at ANC 
headquarters in Johannesburg, James Makhaya, who lived with 
Chris Hani said it was Hani who solved the 1982 MK mutiny in 
Angola. He said: "Chris was like a messiah and Jesus to many 
comrades in exile. He would solve any problem."

  [Excerpts] Before I begin this news bulletin, please listen 
to an official government communique read by the minister of 
human rights and refugees, the interim spokesman for the 
government, Issa Ngendakumana: 
  [Ngendakumana] Here is an official government communique: 
This morning, 7 April 1994, Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko 
held an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers and 
members of the government. The meeting was to brief council 
members on the tragedy in which the president of the Republic of 
Burundi died. [passage omitted] The meeting participants 
studied steps to be taken immediately to maintain calm and peace 
in our country. 
  The Council of Ministers first of all observed one minute's 
silence in memory of the distinguished man and his aides who 
died. 
  Analyzing the facts, the Council of Ministers noted that the 
tragic event leading to the deaths of the Burundian head of 
state and some of his close aides was caused by an accident that 
occurred when the Rwandan presidential aircraft aboard which 
they were traveling exploded. That is why the members of the 
government once again urge the Burundian people to remain calm 
and ignore any rumor intended to divide them for purely 
political reasons. Similarly, the Council of Ministers urges 
all political and administrative officials to stand aside from 
party positions and motivated reporting in the face of the 
present sad event. This call is also addressed to the state and 
private media. 
  As everyone knows, this tragedy has occurred unfortunately 
just when our country was beginning to emerge from its last 
crisis, which was brought about by the death of Melchior Ndadaye 
during the night of 20-21 October 1993. The work ethic was 
beginning to reassert itself and industry was reviving. In the 
light of this new tragedy and the resumption of a socioeconomic 
situation which has already been noted, the Council of Ministers 
deems it relevant to take the following steps: 
  First: A period of national morning is declared from today, 
7 April 1994, until the day of the funeral. Work will be 
suspended for three days; that is, Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
of the current week. 
  Second: Flags will be flown at half-mast throughout the 
national territory and at our diplomatic missions abroad. 
  Third: Suitable music and biographies of the distinguished 
people who died will be broadcast on Bujumbura Radio-Television 
Nationale du Burundi Radio. 
  Fourth: Books of condolences will be opened. 
  Fifth: Missions composed of the people's representatives and 
security force officials will proceed on working tours of the 
provinces to support local governments during these difficult 
times. 
  Finally: The members of the government take this occasion to 
send sincere condolences to the wives of the distinguished 
figures who died and to the Rwandan Government and people. 
  [Dated] 7 April 1994, Bujumbura.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The government of Captain Strasser in Sierra Leone 
has well and truly fallen out with the German ambassador, Karl 
Prinz, and wants him sent home. It all came to a head at Mr. 
Prinz' reported contacts with NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, in neighboring Liberia. Taylor 
is frequently accused of backing the rebels in southern and 
eastern Sierra Leone. From Freetown, Victor Silva telexed this 
report. 
  At a press briefing this afternoon, the foreign secretary, 
Dr. Abass Bundu, revealed that the Sierra Leone Government had 
today sent a request to Germany to recall Ambassador Prinz. Dr. 
Abass Bundu said that Sierra Leone was forced to take this line 
of action because of what he called the unfriendly and 
undiplomatic behavior of the ambassador, adding that Karl Prinz' 
behavior was prejudicial to relations between Germany and Sierra 
Leone. Dr. Bundu was careful to point out that the move was not 
in any way meant to disrupt relations between the two countries 
nor their peoples, but was meant only to have Karl Prinz 
replaced as Germany's representative here. And he has been 
given a 10-day period during which he should leave. 
  Today's announcement by the foreign secretary comes in the 
wake of press reports here culled from a German newspaper, DER 
SPIEGEL, which reported that the German ambassador had visited 
Charles Taylor in Gbarnga and had held private discussions with 
him. Dr. Abass Bundu revealed that Karl Prinz had never 
informed the Sierra Leone Government that he was leaving on this 
visit, but merely sent a note to the Foreign Office saying that 
he would be out of the country. The Strasser regime believes 
that Foday Sankoh's RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels have 
received arms from Charles Taylor's NPFL with their headquarters 
at Gbarnga and regarded the action of Karl Prinz as covert and 
not in the interest of Sierra Leone's security. Dr. Abass Bundu 
said that despite efforts to get an explanation from Mr. Prinz, 
he was treated with contempt by the German ambassador who, 
instead, informed his office that he would be going on annual 
leave on 15 April. We do not, said Dr. Bundu, discourage any 
attempts at bringing peace to Liberia and Sierra Leone, but we 
have the right to be informed of activities involving Charles 
Taylor, a man who has caused untold misery in our country, and 
Ambassador Prinz has not acted in an acceptable manner.

  [Text] The Government of Sierra Leone has declared Mr. Karl 
Prinz, ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Sierra 
Leone, as persona non grata. 
  According to a release from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs 
and International Cooperation, the Sierra Leone Government took 
the decision in the interest of preserving the excellent 
bilateral relations between the two countries. The statement 
further said the government had (?been constrained to take) this 
unpleasant decision because of the behavior of Ambassador Karl 
Prinz, which it considers as undiplomatic, unfriendly, and 
prejudicial to the maintenance of the excellent bilateral 
relations which existed between Sierra Leone and the Federal 
Republic Germany prior to the arrival of Ambassador Karl Prinz.

  [Text] Following the tragic death of His Excellency Cyprien 
Ntaryamina, president of the Republic of Burundi, and two of his 
ministers, Bernard Ciza and Cyriaque Simbizi, on 7 April in a 
plane accident in Kigali, Rwanda, the Government of the Republic 
of Burundi has sent the Rwandan authorities an official request 
seeking an explanation of the exact circumstances of the tragedy 
which resulted in the death of the Burundian head of state and 
two of his aides. 
  The government reiterates its thanks to the Burundian people 
for remaining calm and maintaining peace and security in the 
country during these trying times and encourages them to 
persevere along this path, the only profitable one. 
  Information concerning the accident and repatriation of the 
bodies will be made public as soon as it becomes available.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ministry of Defense; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Rwandan men and women, the Armed Forces once again 
announce that, following the death of the head of state, 
security has been disrupted, particularly in Kigali. This was 
mainly caused by some soldiers who escaped from their barracks 
in anger to attack and harm people. 
  The Armed Forces cannot tolerate such shameful criminal 
acts. 
That is why they hastened to do everything possible to maintain 
security. At the same time, they searched for and arrested the 
criminals so that by yesterday evening, this reckless behavior 
had subsided. 
  The Armed Forces once again urge the people to be vigilant 
and to help them stop the wrongdoers. 
  The other issue they are informing people about is that the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers who were staying at Kimihurura 
Parliament building left the building and launched an attack on 
the Presidential Guard barracks. Their attack was repulsed. 
They also launched other attacks in Remera district, near the 
national stadium, and at King Faysal Hospital [word indistinct]. 
  Rwandan men and women, as you can see, security has not been 
properly restored, but the country's Armed Forces are doing 
everything possible to protect those in trouble. You are also 
requested to support the Armed Forces so that they can continue 
to maintain security. Stay alert.

  [Text] Well, a lot now depends on what action the RPF 
[Rwandan Popular Front] is likely to take. They denied any 
involvement in the air crash and insisted that they still want 
to cooperate in implementing the Arusha peace accord and that 
they don't intend to go back to war. But their battalion in 
Kigali has been attacked, and there have been reports that RPF 
reinforcements were being sent in from the north. On the 
satellite link with (Biyunda) in northern Rwanda, Hebe Saley 
asked RPF commander Paul Kagame how they saw the situation: 
  [Begin recording] [Kagame] What we can confirm is that our 
force in Kigali is under attack by some forces on the government 
side, and they have been fighting since yesterday. So 
certainly, in that kind of situation, one contemplates 
reinforcing them. Certainly there is a chaotic situation in 
Kigali, where people are being killed anyhow, and we think we 
should contribute to stabilizing the situation. 
  [Saley] So, have you actually sent people, sent 
reinforcements to Kigali? 
  [Kagame] Our forces may have to walk there sooner or later. 
  [Saley] Can you tell us what is actually happening to your 
people at Kigali at the moment? 
  [Kagame] At the moment, Kigali is again confused, but our 
force is still in the same occasion as it was before this 
incident. But they have been attacked by, I understand, the 
Presidential Guards, and they have been fighting for quite some 
time -- since yesterday. So that is all I know. 
  [Saley] Have you been in touch with them today? Have you 
got fresh information? 
  [Kagame] Yes, I talked to them in the morning. They started 
fighting from six o'clock in the morning. 
  [Saley] How many of your men are engaged in battle, as far 
as you know? 
  [Kagame] We have a full battalion there, and the whole of it 
is engaged. 
  [Saley] And how many have you lost? 
  [Kagame] By last night, there are only three injuries, but I 
haven't seen any reports of casualties since morning. 
  [Saley] Well, I mean that sounds, that is very difficult to 
believe that they have been under attack since yesterday and 
there are only three injuries. 
  [Kagame] You may have the whole day people fighting, and you 
don't even get one injury. It depends on where you are fighting 
from and how you are doing it. [end recording]

  [Text] In Rwanda, the situation is threatening to get even 
further out of hand. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels 
have left their positions in the north of Rwanda and are 
advancing on the capital, Kigali. It is reported that the 
rebels have crossed the buffer zone agreed to in the cease-fire 
in March of last year. It is said that in some places they have 
engaged with government troops. Our correspondent Else 
Temmerman is now in the north of Rwanda and sends this 
eyewitness report: 
  [Temmerman] The RPF's advance toward the capital, Kigali, 
started last night. There is fighting in various parts of the 
buffer zone. Artillery explosions can be heard as far away as 
here in Mulindi. The fighting is especially fierce on the main 
road to Kigali. There are reports that the rebels are now at a 
distance of 35 km from the capital. 
  RPF Vice President Patrick Masinpaka said here in Mulindi 
that the main aim of the operation is to reinforce the 600 UN 
troops being held prisoner in the parliament buildings in 
Kigali. Second, the RPF wants to help the United Nations 
restore order in the capital. 
  We have decided to fight this clique, RPF leader Paul Kagame 
said here this morning on the local radio. We regard everyone 
standing in our way as conspirators with the murderers and we 
will treat them accordingly. 
  The rebels say they are surprised by the cease-fire mediated 
by the United Nations. We have no knowledge of such an 
agreement, the vice president said here. 
  The RPF also opposes the new interim government. It is a 
government installed by the United Nations. It is based on 
nothing and, therefore, is not legally valid, the vice president 
said. 
  The RPF also says that it will cooperate with foreign troops 
if they want to evacuate their nationals. 
  How strong will be the opposition by the government army, 
and 
what the international community -- and especially the French -- 
will do, remain open questions.

  [Text] Kampala, April 9 (AFP) -- French troops in the 
Rwandan capital should not "stand in the way" of the rebel 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops marching on Kigali, an RPF 
spokeswoman said in the Ugandan capital Saturday [9 April]. 
  Spokeswoman Christine Umutoni Nyinawumwami said the RPF "had 
taken it upon themselves to move to Kigali, but would not allow 
French troops to stand in their way during this mission." 
  She said the Rwandan rebels were heading for Kigali to 
"rescue people from the carnage" triggered by the plane crash 
death on Wednesday of President Juvenal Habyarimana and his 
prime minister the following day in a revenge attack. 
  Thousands have died in the inter-ethnic bloodletting that 
followed the president's death. 
  "We understand that there are some French troops in Kigali, 
but they are warned that they should not break our way to this 
mission. If they do it, we are ready to face them, as they have 
blood and can be killed," Nyinawumwami, who is a member of the 
RPF political bureau here, told AFP. 
  She was referring to some 300 French troops who took control 
of the Kigali airport early Saturday. The French troops are to 
organise the evacuation of the 600 French nationals in Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] The civil war in Rwanda started all over again 
following the rejection last night of the new acting president, 
Theodore Sindikugbabo, by the Rwandese Patriotic Front, RPF, 
rebels. Seen as a close ally of the late President Habyarimana, 
who was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April], the 
rebels said they would continue their march to capture the 
capital, Kigali, where some of their fighters are trapped. 
[passage omitted] 
  Just as we were about to go on the air, we received a call 
from the information spokesperson of the RPF rebels. Wilson 
Wutasira is in Mulindi. Alice Martin asked him what news he had 
of their forces march to the capital: 
  [Begin recording] [Wutasira] The latest information I have 
just got is that some of our troops are just between 10 to 15 km 
from the capital, Kigali. 
  [Martin] How many troops? 
  [Wutasira] Well, there are two units, two units, all 
fighting 
units, which have gone along the Wumba-Kigali axis. 
  [Martin] And what is happening at the moment? Are they 
fighting all the way or are they just walking in? 
  [Wutasira] Yes, they are fighting all the way as they come 
across the government forces. 
  [Martin] Has there been much fighting? 
  [Wutasira] Well, there is a lot of fighting along the way 
but 
some have managed to go through. 
  [Martin] So you say that two battalions have crossed through 
the so-called demilitarized zone and they are within 10 to 15 km 
of the capital. 
  [Wutasira] That's right, that's right. 
  [Martin] Now, why should I be sure that you are telling me 
the truth? 
  [Wutasira] Well, it is good that we give information as to 
the progress of the forces as they advance. 
  [Martin] And who is leading the forces? Is Paul Kagame at 
the head of the battalion? 
  [Wutasira] Well, he is with the troops. 
  [Martin] What do you intend to do? 
  [Wutasira] Well, we intend to....[pauses] Those two forces 
are supposed to go and reinforce our battalion which has been 
locked in fighting for the past two days. 
  [Martin] So, you are going to relieve a battalion of 600 who 
are in the center of Kigali. 
  [Wutasira] That's right. 
  [Martin] And what else will you do when you are in Kigali? 
  [Wutasira] Well, we could also assist the UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda] and those other forces there who 
want peace and security restored in Kigali. 
  [Martin] Aren't you going to try and take over? 
  [Wutasira] Well, if that is necessary to regain security for 
Kigali, then it can also be considered. [end recording]

  [Text] There is a danger of the fighting in Rwanda 
spreading between the Rwandan Army and the Rwanda Patriotic 
Front [RPF], which is marching toward the capital to link up 
with its forces in the town. The RPF forces could reach Kigali 
this morning if they do not meet too much resistance. What is 
the RPF's aim? We spoke to Emile Roua Massirabo, one of the 
RPF's leaders in Kampala, Uganda: 
  [Begin Massirabo recording] We have to get to Kigali. This 
is quite obvious. We have to arrive in Kigali to save and to 
aid the population, which is being massacred at this very 
moment. Our forces are advancing on Kigali. I can't tell you 
exactly where they are right now, but they are advancing along 
the road from the north. We want to put an end to the massacres. 
We want to arrest those responsible for these massacres, so as 
to put the country back on the democratic path. The opposition 
forces have systematically been exterminated. It has never been 
our aim to seize power. [end recording]

United Nations is evacuating its staff to Bujumbura and Nairobi. 
For its part, Kigali has started a real race against time to 
try and contain the situation, which is slowly returning to 
normal in the Rwandan capital. However, the peace accord signed 
between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] on 
4 August appears to be in doubt. From Kigali, Thomas Kamilindi

enforced in the capital since 8 April. But for how long? It's 
difficult to tell. Hostilities seem to have resumed in Mutara 
in the northeast of the country and in the northern Ruhengeri 
region between RPF and government troops beyond the 
demilitarized area [word indistinct] government positions. 
  According to a communique from the RPF, a column of at least 
20,000 men are moving to within 100 km of the capital. But a 
spokesman of the Kigali Army staff headquarters says it is a 
whimsical deception. The government has strongly urged the RPF 
to stop its war mentality and to favor dialogue in order to 
establish a broad-based transitional government within six 
weeks, as demanded by Resolution 909 of the UN Security Council.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners, due to the grave moments Rwanda 
is going through, mainly characterized by insecurity in the 
country particularly here in the capital, Kigali, and also 
characterized by the obstinacy of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF], which has unilaterally decided to resume war, because of 
all this, our colleague Jean-Francois Nsengiyumva approached 
Colonel B.M. Gatsinzi, the interim chief of staff of the 
national Armed Forces to ask him how the country's Armed Forces 
and those in charge of security felt about all these issues. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Nsengiyumva] Col. Gatsinzi, you are the interim chief of 
staff since the tragic disappearance of titular chief of staff, 
Deogratias Nsabimana, who disappeared in the accident, I mean, 
the presidential jet that was shot down as it approached Kanombe 
[airport]. [passage omitted] 
  Following this tragic disappearance, some elements of the 
Presidential Guard and even other elements of the civilian 
population who were angered by the disappearance indulged in 
violence, sometimes unprecedented, which cost the lives of many 
personalities of the country, including the prime minister, 
Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana. Therefore, I would like to ask 
you what concrete actions you are taking, as the security 
forces, to restore peace in the country and contain the 
situation so that the population can once again live peacefully. 
  [Gatsinzi] [passage omitted] This tragic event afflicted and 
saddened the entire Rwandan population including the Rwandan 
Armed Forces. Unfortunately, there are some in the Army who 
left their barracks and with anger, maybe seeking revenge, 
killed some personalities and people. These people were not at 
all sent by the command of the military authorities. (?These 
are) (?people) who strayed, who spread left and right through 
the town. But I would like to assure you that at the moment 
this trend has been contained and the soldiers have been called 
back and kept in their barracks. 
  The authorities have given instructions that peace must be 
restored in the city center and in the surrounding areas of 
Kigali, using elements that are usually charged with security, 
the gendarmerie and the military police, to go and search for 
those who strayed and bring them back to their barracks and to 
stop these activities. I can assure you that the situation is 
currently returning to normal. We continue to do everything 
possible to restore peace and calm. But unfortunately there are 
some other people, bandits, who have taken advantage of the 
(?uprising) and interfered in the problems by looting and 
massacring the population, sometimes for the sake of settling 
scores. [sentence indistinct]. 
  Now, measures have been taken and are being implemented for 
the gradual restoration of peace in the country. This is the 
number one concern of the Crisis Committee, to see the return of 
peace and for the political authorities to recoup the leadership 
of the state, to give all instructions as befits their power for 
the return of peace and the resumption of normal life so that 
the government can function. 
  We have helped to facilitate government members, who were 
scattered left and right, (?to meet) so that they alone can 
decide on the future of the country. The Army has not 
interfered in any way. We have just facilitated their meetings 
and contacts. And all the decisions were taken by the 
government, and the establishment of the latter is the 
prerogative of the political authorities. The Army has not 
interfered in that. 
  [Nsengiyumva] Colonel, alongside this regrettable situation 
of insecurity, we have learned that the RPF-Inkotanyi decided 
two days ago, I think, to resume war instead of helping the 
Rwandan Government, its new partner. According to the terms of 
the Arusha Accord, it is the Rwandan Government that is the 
other signatory, so instead of helping this partner to restore 
peace in the country, the RPF has unilaterally decided to resume 
hostilities. For your part, are you ready to face these [words 
indistinct] attacks in order to reassure the population? 
  [Gatsinzi] It is very regrettable that the RPF has resumed 
hostilities by leaving the premises of the National Development 
Council, where it was staying, and attacking the military 
barracks of Kimihurura [in Kigali] whose soldiers carried out 
massacres on the population. As I have said, it was not all the 
soldiers, but just some of them--in fact, maybe people disguised 
as soldiers. Investigations have been launched, and these will 
establish the truth. But it is very regrettable that the RPF 
has taken up arms and resumed hostilities. 
  But as it is the duty of the Rwandan Armed Forces to protect 
the population, the security forces and the Rwandan Armed Forces 
in particular have contained the attacks of the RPF, which 
indeed, are [word indistinct] on the entire northern front 
[words indistinct]. At the same time, we were trying to help 
the establishment of the government so that it could continue 
contacts and negotiations with the RPF within the framework of 
implementing the peace accords, despite the recent 
disappearances, to avoid having a political vacuum. 
  The Rwandan Armed Forces urgently call upon the RPF partners 
to use their goodwill to restore the climate of peace and 
negotiations, and not to favor war, for one cannot trust war as 
a solution, since it can be (?fatal).

  [Text] Paris, April 10 (AFP) -- Rwandan army forces and 
rebels clashed Sunday on the outskirts of Kigali, the Red Cross 
said from the Rwandan capital. 
  The two sides fought with mortars, grenades and automatic 
weapons, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. 
  The report appeared to contradict a Belgian UN commander's 
assertion that the two sides, which have engaged in an orgy of 
violence since the death of the Rwandan president in a plane 
crash last Wednesday, had agreed to a ceasefire Sunday and were 
generally respecting it. 
  Western countries scrambled Sunday to evacuate their 
nationals from the tiny central African country.

<F P=106> [By Marie-Goretti Uwibambe] </F>
  [Text] Kigali, April 10 (AFP) -- Ethnic killings, mainly of 
the Tutsi minority, and manhunts were still under way in the 
Rwandan capital Kigali on Sunday [10 April], leaving many bodies 
lying in the streets. 
  The massacres were taking place mostly in working-class 
districts, an AFP correspondent reported, four days after 
Rwanda's president and his counterpart from neighbouring Burundi 
were slain when their plane was reportedly shot down. 
  The correspondent saw at least 20 bodies piled up in front 
of 
her own home in a northeastern part of Kigali. Vans were 
picking up the dead to take them off for burial in mass graves. 
  Many people were murdered in their homes, and most Kigali 
residents dared not venture into the streets except to purchase 
essential food supplies. 
  Residents of the Hutu majority in the capital, sometimes 
backed by members of the Rwandan army, were murdering Tutsis in 
the latest flare-up of the central African nation's endemic 
ethnic strife, following the death of the Hutu president Juvenal 
Habyarimana. 
  Red Cross workers reported light arms fire in the morning 
Sunday, but said they could no longer hear any heavy weapons 
fire. 
  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also 
stated that there were "too many bodies in the streets and the 
ICRC is giving priority to the living, the injured." 
  The ICRC earlier reported that "thousands" of people had 
been 
killed and wounded in ethnic bloodletting which brought the 
country to the brink of civil war since the death of Habyarimana 
in what the Rwandan government described as a rocket attack on 
his plane. 
  The president had been on his way home from a regional 
summit 
in Uganda to discuss UN-sponsored peace-making efforts in Rwanda 
and Burundi, also troubled by strife between Hutus and Tutsis. 
  His government last year signed a ceasefire and political 
deal with Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), but 
the front had yet to be brought into government.

  [Excerpts] The airlift established in Kigali, the capital 
of Rwanda, has made it possible to evacuate a significant number 
of French civilians in the face of the threat of a civil war, 
which is getting more real every hour despite statements about a 
cease-fire agreement between the rebels of the Patriotic Front 
and government troops. [passage omitted] 
  Apparently, some 4,000 rebels resumed the offensive this 
afternoon to try and take the capital, Kigali. According to 
some reports, nearly 20,000 people have died in the country 
since the beginning of the conflict. A first consequence: 
fighting, which seems to have decreased... [pauses] We are not 
sure about that for the time being, because we are getting 
contradictory reports every minute. Colonel Luc Marchal, the 
commander of the Belgian UN troops in Rwanda, has just confirmed 
-- although he is still unsure -- that weapons, with few 
exceptions, are reported to have gone silent. The UN officer 
spoke to Benoit Colombin: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] There has not been any fighting 
since this morning. Around 1000 hours, there was a cease-fire, 
and, apart from limited and sporadic shooting, the cease-fire 
has been respected throughout the town. 
  [Colombin] Do you think that it will be respected? Indeed, 
there have already been cease-fires. 
  [Marchal] Indeed, there was a cease-fire yesterday, but it 
was a verbal cease-fire that was not based on the prospect of 
negotiations. This is no longer the case. This was negotiated; 
there is a written text. I agree that cease-fires are only bits 
of paper and that everything depends on the way the units are 
controlled on the ground. 
  [Colombin] Why can the French only be evacuated by air? 
  [Marchal] Because only the French have been given permission 
to land and to take off. There has been a new government for 
two days now. These authorities -- who are competent -- made 
the decision. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Rwanda, there is no cease-fire. However, the 
belligerents are reported to be willing to respect a truce. In 
any case, it will be a short one and its aim will only be to 
make the evacuation of foreign nationals possible. Colonel 
Marchal, the commander of the Belgian contingent within the UN 
Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], gives some explanations: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] The cease-fire that was 
negotiated this afternoon has changed names. It is now called a 
truce that will be implemented as soon as the document is 
signed. It will be valid for 48 hours. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] When is the document going to 
be 
signed, Colonel? 
  [Marchal] The document remained to be drafted and then, of 
course, signed by the two sides. I assume that this is 
happening right now. As soon as the document is signed, there 
will be a 48-hour time limit for the evacuation of expatriates. 
  [Correspondent] This means that this is a 48-hour truce. In 
other words, fighting may continue, it is likely to continue 
after these 48 hours, right? 
  [Marchal] Fighting is indeed supposed [as heard] to resume 
after these 48 hours, unless the political side of the 
UNAMIR...[pauses] which had the opportunity to use this 48-hour 
time limit to make progress in the negotiations which have been 
started. [end recording]

  [Text] There was another day of man-hunts and looting in 
Kigali on Sunday [10 April]. The corpses lying around on the 
ground are being picked up in vans and buried in common graves. 
Alongside these ghastly events, there has been fierce fighting 
on the outskirts of Kigali between the army and the Patriotic 
Front. Jean Helene is there: 
  [Begin Helene recording] Firing started close to the 
Meridien 
Hotel, 200 meters from the frontline -- or at least the one in 
Kigali. Government sources speak of three other combat zones in 
the north. In the capital, the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] are still fighting around the former parliament 
building against the Presidential Guard, which is probably 
supported by units of the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
  After a calm morning, heavy artillery could be heard 
throughout the afternoon, and violent shelling shook the town 
for 20 minutes this evening. 
  The RPF reinforcements that have been announced are still 
awaited. Evidently they have been slowed down in their advance 
toward Kigali. 
  UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] soldiers are making forays 
every day from the Meridien, where stray bullets burst from time 
to time: They are going to fetch expatriate families scattered 
around the districts affected by the fighting. There are nearly 
500 expatriates in the Meridien today, waiting for evacuation, 
which can only be done when there is calm. [end recording]

  [Text] Rwanda -- Jean Kambanda, the head of the provisional 
government said that the famous Presidential Guard -- accused of 
being responsible for the violence in Kigali in the past few 
days -- cannot be blamed for everything: 
  [Begin Kambanda recording] I cannot say that the 
Presidential 
Guard has control of the capital. The Presidential Guard cannot 
be singled out. I have the impression that the Presidential 
Guard has been considered to be different from the rest of the 
Army. What I can say is that, all in all, our soldiers remained 
quite calm and behaved well. Here and there -- among the 
soldiers of the Presidential Guard and others -- there have been 
some undisciplined troops. Because of some undisciplined 
troops, we cannot say that the Rwandan Army took an active part 
in the massacres. [end recording]

  [Text] The situation is dramatic in Rwanda where fighting 
with heavy weaponry continued last night around the Meridien 
Hotel, Kigali where fighters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] are encamped. The RPF not only refuse to recognize the 
government set up by close aides of assassinated President 
Juvenal Habyarimana but they are currently marching on Kigali 
to, according to them, stop the carnage by government forces. 
As I said earlier, it was initially thought that a cease-fire 
was possible between the two parties but in reality that is not 
so. The RPF's movement toward Kigali continues. This was 
confirmed this morning by Augustin Mukama, an RPF officer in 
Kampala, Uganda, in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga. 
  [Begin Mukama recording] We formally and categorically deny 
that there have been any negotiations on a cease-fire between 
the RPF and the puppet government set up in Kigali. There have 
been no cease-fire negotiations. There have never even been any 
negotiations on a truce. It is strange that Europeans and 
foreigners are being given the right to come to the rescue of 
their citizens while the RPF is being asked to stop doing the 
same for Rwandans who are in a much more critical situation than 
the foreigners in Kigali. It is therefore our responsibility, 
our sacred duty, to march on Kigali and to save the people. 
Yesterday afternoon, at 1500, our troops were 8 km from the 
capital. Now, we are in the outskirts of the city and even 
within Kigali commune. [end recording] 
  We now bring you the reaction of the Republican Democratic 
Movement, the assassinated Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana's party. Its West Africa representative, Mr. 
Kaberuka, refutes the RPF's statements. He was interviewed this 
morning by Raphael Mbadinga. 
  [Begin Kaberuka recording] The truth is that the RPF is 
looking for a dual cease-fire. It wants a cease-fire in Kigali 
alone but rejects a nationwide cease-fire as proposed by the 
government. You will understand that there can be no question 
of a cease-fire in Kigali while fighting continues in the rest 
of the country [words indistinct]. Either we cease fire and 
drop the war option or we leave out the question of a cease-fire 
and choose war. It seems the RPF has chosen the warpath which 
is exactly what the interim government does not want. This is 
what the interim government and the Rwandan people have never 
wanted. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Theodore Sindikubgabo, CND speaker </F>
and acting president; place and date not given-- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sindikubgabo] As everyone 
knows, the death of the president of the Republic was 
unfortunately followed by tragic events, during which others, 
like Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, were killed. We 
convey sincere condolences from the Rwandan Government and 
people to the bereaved family. 
  Finally, in accordance with Article 42 of the Constitution 
of 
10 June 1991, the vacant post of the president of the Republic 
is assumed by the speaker of the National Development Council 
[CND]. Rwandans, it is in that capacity that I address you 
tonight, given the tragic moments we are experiencing that force 
us to take the following urgent measures. 
  The five political parties taking part in the current 
transitional government, namely the National Revolutionary 
Movement for Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic 
Movement [MDR], the Social Democratic Party [PSD], the Christian 
Democratic Party [PDC] and the Liberal Party [PL], have agreed 
to put in place a transitional government whose most urgent 
tasks are: First, the effective management of state affairs, 
notably by restoring order and the security of people and 
property; second, the continuation of contacts with the Rwanda 
Patriotic Front [RPF] with a view to putting in place the 
broad-based transitional government, and this within the 
shortest time possible, in any case before the expiration of the 
six-week period set by the UN Security Council; third, to seek 
ways and means of solving problems related to the famine that 
has claimed victims in certain regions of the country as well as 
the resettlement of those displaced. 
  The political parties taking part in the newly formed 
transitional government have decided to appoint Mr. (Jean 
Kabanda) as prime minister. We have approved this. We have 
also approved the list of ministers for his government that he 
submitted to us. 
  They are: 

  -  (Jerome Bicamumpaka) minister of foreign affairs and 
cooperation; 
  -  Faustin Munyazesa, minister of interior and communal 
development; 
  -  Agnes Ntamabyaliro, minister of justice; 
  -  Augustin Bizimana, minister of defense; 
  -  Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of agriculture and livestock; 
  -  Dr. Andre Rwamakuba, minister of primary and secondary 
education; 
  -  Dr. Daniel Mbangura, minister of higher education, scientific 
research and culture; 
  -  Emmanuel Ndabahizi, minister of finance; 
  -  Prosper Mugiraneza, minister of civil service; 
  -  Eliezer Nitegeka, minister of information; 
  -  Justin Mugenzi, minister of trade, industry and crafts; 
  -  Dr. Augustin Ngirabatware, minister of planning; 
  -  Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, minister of health;

energy; 
  -  Gaspard Ruhumuliza, minister of environment and tourism; 
  -  Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, minister of family and women's 
promotion; and 
  -  Callixte Nzabonimana, minister of youth. 
  Rwandans, dear friends of Rwanda, the times we are 
experiencing demand that we increase our vigilance twofold. The 
security of people and property is a necessity [words 
indistinct] the Rwandan Armed Forces in particular. In this 
regard, I would like to express the Rwandan people's gratitude 
to the members of the Rwandan Armed Forces who continue to take 
on their duty with dedication, selflessness and love for their 
country. We encourage (?them) to persevere on this path. 
[passage omitted] 
  Issued in Kigali, 8 April 1994; 
  [Signed] Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, president of the 
Republic.

<F P=106> [Inaugural address by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda; place </F>
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] I, Jean Kambanda, in the name of the Almighty, 
swear before Rwandans that I will carry out my duties, that I 
will not act against the Republic of Rwanda and the head of 
state, and that I will work for all that is useful for Rwandans, 
that I will abide by the Constitution and other laws. 
  Your Excellency, madame deputy speaker of the National 
Council of Development; Your Excellency, the minister [as 
heard]. Rwandans, our country is currently going through 
difficult times. We are going to set up a government which will 
deal with the very difficult question of war and also the 
question of insecurity in the country and famine, especially 
among those displaced by the war. The three points make up the 
program of the present government. The present government will 
therefore carry out its duties especially by providing security 
for people and property and by restoring understanding among the 
people. That is why the ministers in charge of security, that 
is, the ministers of defense, communal development, and justice 
will do everything possible to restore peace as soon as 
possible. Let us say within about two weeks. 
  The minister of justice should do his utmost to convene a 
meeting of all heads of tribunals so that they can start 
investigations to identify all wrongdoers, such as those who 
killed and looted in many areas of the country, especially in 
Kigali town. The minister of defense must do everything 
possible to restore peace and tranquillity in the entire 
country, especially in Kigali town. The minister of interior 
and communal development is asked to convene a meeting of all 
prefects as soon as possible so that they may look for ways of 
restoring peace and pacifying the Rwandans. 
  Second, the current government will continue talks with the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] so that transitional institutions 
based on the Arusha agreement may be set up in six weeks' time. 
The Rwandan Government believes that there is no other way of 
restoring peace to the country apart from continuing talks with 
the RPF. 
  That is why it stresses the fact that the RPF should know 
that the problems with which our country finds itself following 
the death of the president of the republic, His Excellency Major 
General Juvenal Habyarimana, followed by that of the prime 
minister and some government members and innocent people, should 
not be a pretext for renewing the fighting since, as we said 
earlier, the government is going to do its utmost to restore 
peace in the country. 
  I thank the outgoing government for everything it did 
towards 
setting up transitional government institutions despite the many 
hindrances to the implementation of the planned program. The 
Rwandan Government will do its utmost to ensure that all the 
hindrances to setting up the transitional government are removed 
so that the Arusha agreement may be implemented as agreed. This 
will be done with only the welfare of the people at heart and 
not personal or group interests. 
  Concerning famine, which is the third objective of this 
government, the Ministry of Planning and Communal Government is 
called upon to start talks with the nongovernmental 
organizations which have always assisted us in our problems so 
that we may get enough assistance to go to the rescue of the 
people affected by famine almost everywhere in the country, 
especially those displaced by the current war which we have 
known for almost four years. 
  Rwandans and friends of Rwanda, this country is in a very 
critical situation. The contribution of everyone is necessary 
so that we can solve the difficult problems. That is why we 
call upon international organizations and traditional friendly 
countries to support this government so that it can carry out 
its three-point program. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Inaugural speech by President Theodore Sindikubgabo; place </F>
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Your Excellency, the deputy speaker of the 
National Assembly; Your Excellencies, the ministers of the 
government that has just been sworn in; Your Excellency, deputy 
and secretary of the National Assembly; heads of the parties 
that are part of the government present here, and guests, my 
speech is short because in my speech to all Rwandans last night, 
I explained the reason for today [as heard]. I will also repeat 
it today or tomorrow and explain at length why we have taken the 
present important decision. 
  At present, I would like to thank those who make up the 
government which has just been set up for agreeing to assist us 
at a time when our country needs the strength of its children. 
I would also like to thank and give support to our country's 
forces who acted swiftly after the death of president and did 
their utmost, as always, to preserve the peace of Rwandans, 
especially here in the capital. We also thank the Army for the 
good decision it made with the assistance of some civilian 
leaders and set up a Crisis Committee. We shall inform you 
about those who make it up. 
  The Crisis Committee is made up of some high-ranking Army 
officers and other officials. The Crisis Committee's role was 
very crucial. Without it, so that it could take important 
measures to follow what was happening in Kigali after the 
enemies [word indistinct], we could have found ourselves in more 
trouble in relation to peace. I ask those present to help me to 
thank the members of the Crisis Committee. 
  As I told you at the beginning of my speech, the day before 
yesterday, the members of the Crisis Committee, after consulting 
the five parties which are in the transitional government took 
an important and useful step that was in keeping with the 
Constitution before the broad-based transition started after the 
Arusha agreement. Basing themselves on the Constitution, 
especially Article 42, they asked me to implement the content of 
the article. I found that what they asked me to do was correct. 
I agreed to this because I believed that all of you, the Army, 
ministers and all Rwandans who love their country supported me. 
  The deputy speaker of the National Assembly said it best: We 
have not violated any article. We are within the law. We 
consulted our legal experts on the legality of the decision. 
They said that we were right. Some who do not understand the 
Constitution enough will surely criticize our action. However, 
that is normal. The decision we made was to extricate the 
country from the constitutional vacancy. There was no longer 
any leadership. After the killing of the president, the prime 
minister and some of the ministers, there was no longer a 
leadership. Before the setting up of the broad-based 
transitional institutions, there was a need for courageous 
Rwandans to make a decision like the one we made. 
  The prime minister has just summarized his government's 
program. He has asked some of his ministers to act fast to 
explain to Rwandans why we made the decision and reflect this in 
their work. 
  I said that my speech would be brief. I will have enough 
time to explain to Rwandans and foreigners, to explain our 
program for the next few months so that we may lead our country 
up to the setting up of broad-based transitional institutions as 
contained in the Arusha agreement, without any obstacles in our 
path, while our people are in peace. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dear listeners of Radio Rwanda, we have just 
broadcast the recorded swearing-in ceremonies of the new 
government headed by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda. 
  The government is composed of nine ministers of the 
Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
Party. They are the same as in the preceding government. They 
are in their previous posts. All the Republican Democratic 
Movement ministers are new. They include: the minister for 
foreign affairs and cooperation, Jerome Bicamumpaka; the 
minister of primary and secondary education, Dr. Andre 
Rwamakuba, and the minister of information, Eliezer Nitegeka. 
For the Social Democratic Party, there are also three new 
ministers: the minister of agriculture and livestock, Straton 
Nsambumukunzi, and the minister of public works and energy, 
Yacinthe Nsengiyumva. For the Christian Democratic Party, there 
is one minister who has kept his post. He is Gaspard 
Ruhumuliza. For the Liberal Party [PL], there are two ministers 
who have kept their portfolio: Justin Mugenzi, who remains at 
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Agnes Ntamabyaliro, 
who keeps her Ministry of Justice. A new minister of the PL is 
Jean de Dieu Habineza, who has been appointed as minister of 
works and social affairs. 
  It seems that ministers whose whereabouts were unknown were 
replaced. Others are those who were replaced for political 
reasons. The government was set up by the five political parties 
which make up the government. The president of the Republic, as 
you know, is Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, former president of the 
National Development Council [parliament]. Three ministers were 
not sworn in. These are the minister of interior and communal 
development, Justin Munyazesa, who is on a mission. The same 
applies to the minister of defense, Augustin Bizimana, who is 
also on a mission. Minister Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of 
agriculture and livestock, was also not sworn in. He was in 
Butare at the time of the swearing in. 
  The government has a six-week term. That is, it should carry 
out necessary negotiations for setting up the broad based 
transitional government in cooperation with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] in six weeks, as requested by the UN 
Security Council. The government therefore has a precise role: 
to manage the crisis situation, to continue negotiations with 
the RPF and to assist the people who are threatened by hunger 
and famine, in some prefectures such as Gikongoro and Butare or 
in the camps of displaced people.

<F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>
  [Excerpts] ...because of the insecurity that has prevailed 
lately, the first meeting of the Council of Ministers today made 
decisions on this issue. Concrete measures and decisions were 
made. By 11 April at the latest, there will be a meeting of all 
the prefects of prefectures which will be presided over by the 
interior minister upon his return from a mission abroad. If he 
has not returned, the meeting will be chaired by the prime 
minister, Jean Kambanda. [passage omitted] 
  Today's Council of Ministers also expressed regret over the 
unilateral decision of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to 
resume the war. Because this decision has been made, 
preparations are under way on the Rwandan Government side. That 
is why the Council of Ministers called upon the national Army to 
redouble its vigilance to eventually counter the attacks and 
advances of the RPF, if it persists in adopting this war 
mentality that we thought we had buried with the signing of the 
Arusha Accord last August. That is why the Rwandan Government 
urges the RPF to abandon this war mentality which benefits 
nobody, certainly not the RPF. 
  The government urges the RPF to readopt the logic of peace 
and to resume discussions with the Rwandan Government which is 
the other signatory to the Arusha peace accord. In this way the 
broad-based transitional institutions as provided by the Arusha 
peace accords can be put in place in the coming six weeks, to 
meet the deadline given by the UN Security Council on 5 April 
when it rediscussed the Rwandan case on whether or not to 
maintain UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda in our country.

  [Text] Following the bloodbath by presidential guards in 
which almost the entire government has been wiped out including 
the prime minister, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a new group 
has declared itself as members of the new government in Rwanda. 
  The new group is headed by Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, as the 
new president, and Mr. Jean Kambanda as prime minister. The 
government also includes Mr. Justin Mugenzi and Agnes 
Ntamabyaliro from the controversial faction of the Liberal 
Party. The new government is unlikely to succeed because all 
the members have been strong opponents of the Arusha peace 
agreement. The Arusha peace agreement is supported by the 
majority of the Rwandan Republic and the agreement is now 
enshrined in the fundamental law of the land. 
  This new government has been (?formed) by the opponents of 
the Arusha peace agreement in a meeting of the party leaders 
that was convened on 26 and 27 February 1994. In this meeting, 
those who are opposed to the Arusha peace agreement wanted the 
government of the late Agathe Uwilingiyimana replaced. They 
called for the formation of a government of hardliners who would 
force the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to accept the terms of 
the extremists. [Words indistinct] they could not find any legal 
framework in which to form their new government. 
  The government has only been formed after bloodshed that has 
claimed almost the entire political leadership in Rwanda. The 
methods are highly suspicious. But one thing is clear. The 
so-called government in Rwanda cannot get Rwanda out of the 
current crisis because this government consists of people who 
are against national reconciliation, which is now cherished by 
the majority of the Rwandan public. 
  The so-called government is made of people who are fighting 
hard to keep the political power within the clique that has been 
ruling for the last 20 years. The political struggle in Rwanda 
and the wars that have lasted for more than three years have 
been against the political monopoly by the ruling clique. This 
new scheme calling itself the Government of Rwanda should brace 
itself for a showdown with the democratic forces in Rwanda.

  [Text] The former Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels say 
that they are marching on Kigali. Emile Boua Massirabo, one of 
the leading officials of this movement, was interviewed by 
telephone from Kampala. Dominique de Courcelles asked him why 
the RPF had refused to recognize the new government in Kigali 
and why it had broken the cease-fire. 
  [Begin recording] [Massirabo] We did not sign any 
cease-fire, 
we did not negotiate any cease-fire with anyone. 
  [Courcelles] You did not even begin? 
  [Massirabo] No, never. This idea of a cease-fire was put 
forward by UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], we do not 
accept this, we did not negotiate any cease-fire, this is a lie. 
As soon as the massacres began in Kigali, the systematic 
massacres of political opponents and Tutsi people, the Arusha 
Agreement was violated and the RPF stood idly by while the whole 
civilian population in Kigali was being slaughtered. It was our 
duty -- and I believe no one can condemn us for that -- to 
intervene. 
  [Courcelles] Was there any hope for an end to massacres with 
a new government? 
  [Massirabo] I would also like to mention this government. 
Who is in this government? The government is made up of 
members of the MRND [Republican National Movement for 
Democracy], of the (?CDR), of the section supporting late 
President Habyarimana, of the MDR [Republican Democratic 
Movement], of the PL [Liberal Party], it is a product of this 
clique that organized these systematic killings in the capital. 
It is inconceivable for the RPF to consider this government as 
a valid partner. We would have expected the international 
community to denounce this government, as well as the Army and 
the Presidential Guard, which killed innocent, defenseless 
people. I do not believe anyone can condemn us for the 
resumption of the war. This government is not a partner for us. 
  [Courcelles] Therefore, the only solution for you today is 
the resumption of war, you rule out any negotiation? 
  [Massirabo] Negotiations are impossible since we are dealing 
with a wild horde systematically killing people. 
  [Courcelles] Who are you fighting now? Are you fighting the 
Presidential Guard and the whole Army, or is part of the Army on 
your side? 
  [Massirabo] You know that there is a part of the Army that 
is 
not with the murderers. Our main enemy now is the Presidential 
Guard, but it goes without saying that all the people who side 
with the Presidential Guard are enemies of the country, are 
enemies of democracy. 
  [Courcelles] Do you believe that part of the Army will join 
you? 
  [Massirabo] We called on the Rwandan Army. We called on all 
those who are outraged by what is happening in Rwanda to join 
us. We hope that part of the Army, as well as most of the 
Rwandan population and of the international community will join 
us. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwanda Patriotic Front 
[RPF] rejected the new government immediately after the 
announcement of its formation on 8 April. Political analysts in 
Kigali are discussing how the RPF dares reject a government that 
is coming to fill the constitutional vacuum left by the almost 
simultaneous tragic loss of the head of state and the prime 
minister and other leading figures of the country. For them, 
this attitude means the RPF does not want any interlocutor, but 
that it alone wants power and that it wants to take it by force. 
  This attitude is also seen as destined to mark the beginning 
of ethnic struggles within the RPF where General Paul Kagame, 
the head of the movement's army, which is mainly Tutsi, is 
reported by Kigali private Radio Television Libre des Milles 
Collines to have carried out a coup d'etat in which the 
president of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, and many other 
Hutu officials have been killed. The RPF has not denied the 
information.

<F P=106> ["Message" by RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe on 10 April; </F>
place not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] His Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, the rebel 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, is alive. In fact, the 
following is his message to Rwandans. Let us remind you that 
this message was issued yesterday. He begins with the words, 10 
April. 
  [Kanyarengwe] Today, 10 April, I want to send you this 
message. Rwandan men and women, we are going through grave 
times. Since President Habyarimana and the Burundi president 
died in a plane crash at Kanombe Airport on 6 April, it becomes 
clearer as the days go by that Habyarimana's death was planned 
by those in charge of his security. It is said that the plans 
were agreed upon. 
  Habyarimana's guard troops, (?watchmen), and their 
collaborators are the ones who implemented this criminal scheme 
of causing bloodshed and mourning in the country. The death 
gave them a pretext to kill innocent people and politicians 
opposed to the Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic 
[MRND-CDR]. The killers had hoped that the massacres would 
annihilate the Arusha peace agreement once and for all. 
  Those who hatched the assassination plot are the very ones 
who killed the late prime minister, politicians including 
cabinet ministers, and leaders of parties opposed to the 
MRND-CDR. They killed the president of the Constitutional Court 
with the aim of restoring the former Parliament made up of MRND 
members and to establish a puppet government of the CDR militia, 
as its self-styled president said himself at the swearing-in 
ceremony on 9 April. 
  Rwandan men and women, these bloodthirsty criminals are 
deceiving themselves. They will not win the war they have 
plunged themselves into. The affliction and mourning they have 
brought to the Rwandan children are about to backfire. Let them 
get ready to face the law. This government of killers which was 
announced to Rwandans is not legitimate in the country and has 
been denounced abroad. We the RPF have vowed to fight it. We 
call upon all Rwandans, particularly peace-loving soldiers, not 
to be alarmed by or to obstruct the RPF forces. Instead, they 
are requested to cooperate with the RPF and all the peace-loving 
people to fight these criminals. 
  Rwandan men and women, we are saddened by the fact that the 
youth continues to be deceived into being accessories to these 
killings and riots. We call upon the youth to be realistic and 
to avoid actions that might have bad consequences for them. Let 
them know that those who have deceived them into such actions 
have started fleeing the country. Even at this very moment some 
of them have fled, while others boarded planes this morning for 
foreign countries. These are the same ones who made use of the 
Rwandan Armed Forces, notably the [word indistinct], the CDR 
militia, and the pro-MRND militia who have started retreating. 
We call upon the youth, whether in the National Armed Forces or 
in the CDR militia, and the pro-MRND militia to stop the 
criminal activities they have been plunged into. 
  Rwandan men and women, many innocent people have been killed 
on a daily basis. These people committed no other crime than 
disagreeing with the MRND-CDR, or affiliation to a different 
tribe or region. We must all fight rid Rwanda of such shameless 
injustice. I am asking you from the depth of my heart to 
support all those who have lost family members, to assist and 
console them during these difficult times. We are with you all 
in these difficult moments. Thank you.

  [Text] Admiral Lanxade, chief of staff of the French Armed 
Forces, who is commanding the French operation in Rwanda from 
Paris, spoke to Laurent Boussie about the difficulties lying 
ahead of the mission to evacuate foreign nationals: 
  [Begin recording] [Lanxade] As things stand, we hold Kigali 
airport in liaison with the Rwandan Armed Forces. This means 
that we are able to land planes and bring in units, which we 
will be continuing to do in the afternoon. We will then proceed 
to transfer expatriates from their homes in the city to the 
airport. You must realize that there are great difficulties at 
the moment. There is fighting between the town and the airport, 
so we need extra forces, which are on their way, in order to 
ensure the security of this transfer. 
  [Boussie] What are you most afraid of in the coming hours? 
  [Lanzade] We fear an extension of the trouble in Kigali. In 
the slightly longer term, we are very worried about a possible 
resumption of fighting between Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
forces in the north of the country and the Rwandan armed forces. 
We are worried that this fighting might take place near or even 
in the city itself, and with a much higher level of fighting 
than we are currently seeing. [end recording]

  [Text] According to the French Defense Ministry, the 400 
French soldiers deployed at Kigali airport in Rwanda should be 
able to continue the evacuation of foreigners this morning in 
good security conditions. A first Transall plane left last 
night with about 40 French nationals on board, as well as a 
number of other foreign nationals. We have just learned that 
about 10 members of the late President Habyarimana's family were 
also on board.

  [Excerpt] The night seems to have been calm in Kigali, 
although some sporadic fire is reported. 
  Yesterday, 400 Belgian paratroopers took off to take part in 
the evacuation. The Rwandan Government has officially 
authorized our planes to land, but, according to the Belgian 
Defense Ministry, it is not at all clear whether the Rwandan 
Army is obeying the new government's orders. Kigali airport 
remains blocked, and the situation is becoming more and more 
dangerous for Belgian nationals. Jean-Philippe Seti of Radio 
Suisse Romande reports from Kigali: 
  [Seti] The white population is not being directly targeted, 
but it is becoming increasingly dangerous to step out into the 
street, since you can be murdered for your valuables. There is, 
however, a new element: The hunt for Belgians has begun. It is 
very dangerous to be a Belgian in Kigali. I have been stopped 
at several checkpoints and brutally asked whether I am Belgian. 
It is clear that Belgians are being targeted. The Belgians are 
particularly afraid. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to Colonel Luc Marchal, the commander of 
Belgian UN forces in Kigali, the situation is relatively calm 
this morning in Kigali. A cease-fire came into force today at 
1000 between the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] and the Rwandan 
Government armed forces. The Patriotic Front has halted its 
offensive toward the capital, and the Front, he says, has only 
advanced 10 km from its initial positions in northwestern Rwanda. 
  Colonel Marchal confirmed to Valerie Hirsch that 
negotiations 
are still underway with the Rwandan Armed Forces to obtain their 
accord for the landing of Belgian forces. A parachute operation 
has been ruled out: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] The situation does not require 
direct intervention to protect the lives of our compatriots. 
  [Hirsch] Can you confirm that there is no hunt for Belgian 
civilians? 
  [Marchal] No, this kind of thing is not going on. 
  [Hirsch] We have reports of two Belgian civilians killed a 
few days ago. Have any more Belgians been killed this weekend? 
  [Marchal] More than two Belgians have been killed. The 
number is quite small, and those who were killed were not killed 
because they were Belgians. Most of them were killed because 
they were caught up in a combat zone or because they were caught 
in crossfire. 
  [Hirsch] How many Belgian civilians have been killed? 
  [Marchal] As far as I know, four have been killed. 
  [Hirsch] If the Belgian forces cannot arrive quickly, might 
the French evacuate Belgian civilians? 
  [Marchal] I think that anything is possible. It is clear 
that their ability to act is directly governed by the attitude 
of the Armed Forces and the gendarmerie. If they oppose it, it 
is clear that the French contingent is not large enough to carry 
out a general evacuation in decent security conditions. 
  [Hirsch] They are dealing with the French in priority, when 
it seems that the Belgians are far more threatened. 
  [Marchal] Yes. They are dealing with the French first. [end

  [Text] The first Belgian paratroops have landed at Kigali 
airport in Rwanda. Our editorial department has learned this 
from an informal but very reliable source. Thus the go-ahead 
has been given for the evacuation of our fellow countrymen from 
Rwanda. All afternoon the airport remained closed to Belgian 
planes. The Rwandan soldiers were blocking the runway with 
armored vehicles. The Belgian Embassy had started negotiations 
with the Rwandan authorities to have the airport opened, 
apparently with success.

  [Text] All the French nationals living in Rwanda should be 
evacuated today. There are about 600 of them. They have the 
best deal, since only French planes can land and take off from 
Kigali airport. On the contrary, the Belgians and the Americans 
are making their nationals leave by road. So far, 246 French 
nationals have already left Rwanda. Cooperation Minister Michel 
Roussin hopes all French nationals will be able to leave by this 
evening thanks to the rotation of the five Transall planes. 
  This is possible, but it all depends on the ground situation 
in Kigali. This is what the person in charge of the Belgian UN 
soldiers in Rwanda, Colonel Marchal, told Benoit Colombin: 
  [Begin Marchal recording] The duration of the evacuation 
depends directly on the number of available planes. For the 
time being, only France has started to evacuate. No other 
country has started to evacuate, at least with planes. The 
United States is preferring to evacuate by road. Since 
yesterday, convoys have been heading toward the south of the 
country through Butare to reach the other side of the border, 
Burundi, and in all likelihood to wait for the situation to 
stabilize and to return to normal here. [end recording] 
  This is unfortunately far from being the case. Indeed, 
violence between Hutus and Tutsis is continuing in Kigali. This 
violence is extreme. Listen to a report by Jean Helene, who is 
with Radio France Internationale: 
  [Begin Helene recording] The church square is smeared with 
blood. In the aisles, two rescue workers collect an 
unconscious, wounded man. The man has been lying in a room 
under the nave for 24 hours, dying. He locked himself in there 
with four other people, but assailants threw a grenade through 
the basement window. He is the only survivor. Nearly 100 
people took refuge in the church. Just after yesterday's 
service, dozens of armed militiamen invaded the mission. They 
jumped over fences, and the slaughter started. There was 
nothing else we could do, an eyewitness says. Those who fled 
into the street were systematically butchered. The mission 
employees buried nearly 70 bodies this morning, and the ICRC 
came to collect almost 30 wounded, including many who will not 
survive. 
  At the hospital, the situation is not safe. Soldiers came 
into the wards yesterday and executed seven wounded people. 
This morning, they came and beat up the wounded in the MSF 
[Medecins Sans Frontieres] dispensary and threatened to come 
back in the evening to kill them. 
  The march of the RPF troops on Kigali is making soldiers 
increasingly nervous. If the RPF tries to take the capital, the 
survivors of the massacres will probably be finished off. Jean 
Helene, RFI, Kigali, for France Inter. [end recording] 
  According to the Red Cross, the RPF rebels have just arrived 
in Kigali. The Meridien Hotel, which has been housing the 
foreign nationals about to be evacuated, was bombed. It is 
impossible for the time being to know whether any foreigners 
were still there.

its Belgian staff now in Rwanda in light of the anti-Belgian 
feeling reigning in the country. Medecins Sans Frontieres

  [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk he would "walk the 
extra mile" in an attempt to seek a solution to the violence in 
kwaZulu/Natal, but negotiations had "reached the end of the 
road". 
  The ruler of the region's eight million Zulus was addressing 
Mr de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela 
during their summit meeting at Skukuza in the Kruger National 
Park on Friday [8 April]. 
  The king accused Mr de Klerk of ignoring the "hideous and 
despicable crime" when eight IFP members were shot dead and at 
least four injured on March 28 outside the Shell House 
headquarters of the African National Congress in Plein Street, 
Johannesburg. 
  Referring to a reported agreement between ANC leader Nelson 
Mandela and the police, in which the police agreed not to enter 
Shell House on condition that weapons inside the building were 
handed over to them, the king said: "You saw them being 
ambushed, attacked and massacred... yet your police did not 
enter Shell House to arrest the perpetrators and to secure 
incriminating evidence." 
  King Goodwill said it was clear that meetings he had held 
with Mr de Klerk had not been "fruitful" and "we have reached 
the end of the road which we together opened on January 17, 
1994". 
  He said it was obvious that the only way in which Zulus 
would restore their kingdom was "through our own efforts as 
Zulus and as freedom fighters". 
  Mr de Klerk was still defending a unitary state which gave 
no 
recognition for the separateness of the Zulu kingdom and nation, 
he said. The Zulu nation had endeavoured to seek a peaceful and 
negotiated solution, but any possible freedom in the territory 
had been abolished by the "invasion" of the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] and SA Police to enforce the state of emergency 
in kwaZulu/Natal. 
  "I came (to the summit) because I felt it is my obligation 
to 
walk the extra mile in an effort to seek a solution to our 
problems. 
  "However, I feel that you, Mr President, and I have 
discussed 
all that there is to discuss and that the time for discussion 
has somehow run its course. I always feel that deeds speak 
louder than words," the king said. 
  He said the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu had to be 
resolved before an election was held in South Africa. "I am not 
sure how we can make progress and in which direction. I know 
that I am not prepared to go over again matters which you and I 
have discussed at great length," he said. 
  The Zulu king said the key to successful negotiations was 
whether the other leaders were prepared to listen to Zulu 
aspirations, or whether, "like those who conquered us, you think 
you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my 
nation".

<F P=106> [Statement on Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's presentation </F>
to ANC President Nelson Mandela on 8 April issued by Office of 
the Chief Minister of kwaZulu on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Our meeting is taking place at a most crucial 
juncture in the history of our country. I feel that this meeting 
is somehow overdue and that because of the many postponements of 
our meeting we are now faced with a more difficult situation. 
  Before we proceed into any discussion I think it is 
important 
to remind oneself of the background which leads us to meet today. 
  The most immediate element of that background is the Shell 
House massacre of my subjects. I would fail in my duty and 
responsibility to my subjects if I were not to raise this issue 
at the very outset of our discussions. No words can express the 
horror I feel for the massacre of my father's people who were 
peacefully demonstrating for the restoration of the Kingdom of 
kwaZulu. 
  In this respect my pain is great and I do not wish that my 
grief obfuscates my objectivity in assessing and describing what 
happened in front of the headquarters of the political 
organisation you lead. In order to be objective I wish to refer 
to the description of the relevant facts in the editorial of the 
Sunday edition of THE TIMES of London, a paper with a world-wide 
reputation for objectivity and impartiality. 
  "... Last week's horrific events in central Johannesburg: 
the 
ANC is determined to take power by riding roughshod over whose 
who stand in its way. The movement's true nature was exposed 
when its gunmen mowed down Zulu traditionalists exercising their 
democratic right to demonstrate their opposition to the election 
and their support for their king's call for independence for 
kwaZulu/Natal. As our investigation of events shows, witnesses 
(including ANC officials) saw Zulus slaughtered in cold blood 
merely for having the temerity to march close to the ANC 
headquarters. 
  "Yet three days earlier tens of thousands of ANC supporters 
had marched through Durban, a city divided between it and 
Inkatha. They went past Inkatha's offices, yet none was shot. 
When the Zulus did the same last Monday in Johannesburg, 53 of 
them were slaughtered. While it preaches democracy, the ANC 
practices totalitarianism. It prefers to kill its opponents 
rather than use reason and argument. Its intolerance to 
criticism and its adherence to communist ideals means South 
Africa will be a virtual one-party state. As its officials 
gloated over its `victory' last Monday, they refused to allow 
the police entry to their headquarters to gather ballistic 
evidence." 
  It will take time to heal this wound, but some steps can be 
taken immediately and must be taken immediately. In the name of 
my father's people I must ask that you allow access to all 
information in the possession your organisation related to the 
Shell House massacre, including ballistic evidence. I must ask 
that you do whatever is in your power as the president of the 
ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and executed 
the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime. Until and 
unless you personally distance yourself from the shedding of the 
innocent blood of my father's people by means of your personal 
initiative leading to the conviction of those who are guilty of 
this crime our dialogue will remain difficult if not impossible. 
  Our meeting today takes place after you cancelled at the 
last 
moment our scheduled meeting in Ulundi on March 18, 1994. I 
hoped to meet you in Ulundi as originally scheduled. Ulundi is a 
very special place for me, and it is very right that I meet you 
here in this place which is so poignant with the living history 
of the Zulu people. It was on the plains of Ulundi around us 
that the British finally defeated King Cetshwayo's army. When 
decisions had to be made about the location of the kwaZulu 
legislative assembly, there was only one decision which we Zulus 
could make -- to locate the kwaZulu legislative assembly there 
on that historic site in order to rise again from the ashes of 
British conquest on July 4, 1879. 
  We have, as a nation, been involved in a struggle for our 
very existence, and we have gone through wars and rebellions and 
two of the great Zulu kings, in whose footsteps I now walk, 
suffered arrest, banishment and exile. Our choice of Ulundi as 
the capital of kwaZulu reflected a historic decision to use the 
kwaZulu legislative assembly and this place to unite the Zulu 
people, and to face them towards the final phase in our struggle 
for liberation from colonialism and apartheid. 
  I feel I have to pause, sir, to help you understand the 
reasons underlying my previous request that you meet me in 
Ulundi. And I want you to understand why it was the refusal of 
Mr Walter Sisulu and those who were released with him to do so, 
and their demand that they meet me in one of my palaces located 
in the Nongoma district, that was so offensive to the Zulu 
people. You will remember that when you and I spoke on the 
telephone shortly after your release, you tried to persuade me 
to meet Mr Sisulu as he had demanded, as a condition for you to 
subsequently meet with me. 
  The Zulu monarchy and all its institutions are surrounded 
and 
protected by hallowed traditions and protocol that have evolved 
over nearly two centuries. Zulu kings are kings indeed, and 
today I speak as the king of the Zulu nation when I say that the 
Zulu monarchy is so fundamentally important that each Zulu king, 
each in his own term, is no more than the humble custodian of 
the institutions of the monarchy. When I speak of the monarch as 
a reigning Zulu king, I do not speak for myself, and I 
personally claim no great eminence. I am speaking of it as an 
institution of the Zulu people. Any Zulu king who sought 
personal eminence would betray the institutions of the monarchy, 
and individual kings were never more important than the monarchy 
itself. They evolved as part of the developing soul of the Zulu 
people. However much I subsume the unity and the well-being of 
my father's people in my own being, it is not I the person, 
Zwelithini, who has any pre-eminence. 
  When therefore I say, Mr Mandela, that you, sir, offended 
the protocol which surrounds myself and which has surrounded 
other great Zulu kings in whose footsteps I walk, I am not 
putting myself above yourself when I say what I am saying to you 
on this question. I very much regret the fact that we are only 
meeting today four years after your release from prison. When 
you requested through the prince of kwaPhindangene as your 
former colleague in the ANC and lifetime friend, to see me, I 
immediately agreed. I had planned to see you in the important 
traditional home of King Dinuzulu at Osuthu Royal Residence on 
the 10th of May 1990. 
  I stated that I would then have another meeting with you on 
the 11th of May at kwaKhangelamankengane Palace for a discussion 
which I hoped was to be around the violence that has so racked 
my nation. You requested that I should accompany you with my 
prime minister, the prince of kwaPhindangene, to lay a wreath at 
the grave of the founder of the Zulu nation, King Shaka, and I 
agreed to do so, regardless of the fact that it is not our Zulu 
tradition to lay wreaths on our king's graves, but I was 
prepared to do so in deference to you. 
  Why did we want to do all these things for you, particularly 
as I do not know you at all? I wanted us to honour you as a 
friend of both my late father, King Bhekuzulu ka Solomon, and of 
my uncle, Prince Mangosuthu. I also felt that whatever the 
circumstances of your incarceration were, you deserved honour 
after having sacrificed 27 years of your life in jail for the 
cause of black liberation. 
  This is why I was saddened by all sorts of issues that crept 
in and upset all the arrangements that my prime minister and I 
had so carefully made for your visit to kwaZulu. I heard that it 
was stated by you, and repeated in one of your letters to me 
that you were told to come alone. I think this is a 
misunderstanding as we could never expect anyone of your status 
to come alone. The only distinction we wanted to make to your 
visit to Osuthu, was that this would be a visit to our important 
ancestral home where there would be no need to bring all your 
colleagues, who could be present at the discussion we were 
hoping to have the following day. But there was no suggestion 
that you should visit Osuthu just by yourself. 
  You will recall that my uncle, Prince Mangosuthu, broke 
protocol and gave you all my private phone numbers. By doing so, 
this showed the measure of the high esteem with which you are 
regarded by us. You phoned me from England and I spoke to you 
and agreed to a time when you expected to see me. I have never 
been unwilling to receive you, Mr Mandela. Why should I be 
unwilling to see you with the background that I have given. 
  I was quite insulted when a suggestion was made that I was 
prevented from seeing you by my prime minister and uncle, Prince 
Mangosuthu. This was repeated by many people in your camp, such 
as Mr Phathekile Holomisa, and several Natal leaders of your 
organisation. This I took as an insult to me, my uncle and my 
people. Why would the chief minister see you with alacrity each 
and every time you have wanted to meet with him, and then be 
unwilling that I should meet with you. 
  When you were quoted in your address to a rally at Princess 
Magogo stadium in kwaMashu as saying that you have asked Mr Zuma 
to ask me to give you a date on which you can have an audience 
with me, and you added that this was the last time you would 
make such a request, I was astounded. With the respect I have 
for you as someone of your age and as a leader, i began to 
wonder what sort of person you are, as I do not know you. And 
when you added that you would not kiss the ground before me, I 
became even more confused. I have never demanded that anyone 
does that before me. 
  I think it would be wrong for me not to get all these things 
off my chest. I am not expecting these things to cloud the 
issues that you have publicly stated you wish to discuss with 
me. I put them down for the record without expecting them to be 
the cause of any acrimony between us. 
  I also want to say that various members of the National 
Executive Committee of the ANC and leaders of the ANC in the 
region of kwaZulu-Natal, have also failed to understand the 
protocol sur- rounding myself as the Zulu monarch. A Zulu king 
is not just another black leader who should be approachable by 
just anybody. When your lieutenants either sought to see me 
themselves, or sought an audien- ce with me for you, they did 
not understand that the way to the monarch had necessarily to go 
through the protocol of making ar- rangements through my prime 
minister, the prince of kwaPhindangene. In fact, they approached 
various IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leaders who have nothing to 
do with the Zulu royal court. 
  I hope, sir, that the audience that I have given you will be 
conducted with the dignity and the wisdom of Zulu protocol. The 
introduction of yourself to me by my prime minister was very 
correct, and I sincerely hope that you, sir, will accept that in 
future protocol will be properly observed. 
  Mr Mandela, I have to say these things to show my own 
respect 
to the institutions of the monarchy in which I serve as reigning 
king. I also want you to understand that the slight to my person 
and to my dignity I am talking of so simply and so openly, took 
on many forms and was repeated many times. I, as the reigning 
monarch of the Zulu people, have thus far been protected and the 
monarchy has thus far been preserved for a provisional time by 
my location in the kwaZulu legislative assembly as a 
constitutional monarch. 
  The ANC's attitude to the kwaZulu legislative assembly in 
which I am located and surrounded by kwaZulu legislative 
assembly protocol, has also been most offensive to me. There can 
be no action against the kwaZulu legislative assembly without it 
at the same time being action against me as reigning king. The 
kwaZulu legislative assembly is a place where debates take place 
and it is a place where policy is formed. It is therefore a 
place where opinion and counter- opinion is pitted against each 
other. There is room in the kwaZulu legislative assembly and its 
proceedings for differences of opinion. 
  The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and 
particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me 
numerous times that I am on the pay roll of the kwaZulu 
government, or that my prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu, is my 
paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive. It is 
the traditional duty of my people to build my residences, to 
till my land and to look after me as their king. The Ethula 
custom obliged many of the subjects of the king to deliver gifts 
of cattle to the king and this is our tradition. The Zulu nation 
is the only one in southern Africa that developed to statehood 
to the extent of having a standing army. This is why even now I 
am the only ruler or king who has what are called amabutho or 
regiments. Even my uncle the chief minister belongs to one of 
the king's regiments -- called the Manukelana Regiment. It was 
set up by prince Mshiyeni ka Dinuzulu during the interregnum 
when he was acting for my late father, King Bhekuzulu ka 
Solomon, during his minority. 
  The British monarch is supported from state coffers. The 
Swedish king is supported from state coffers. The Norwegian king 
is supported from state coffers. The Belgian king is supported 
from state coffers. The Danish monarch is supported from state 
coffers. The Dutchc monarch is supported from state coffers. The 
king of Tonga is supported from state coffers. The king of 
Lesotho is supported from state coffers. The king of Swaziland 
is supported from state coffers. What should be so exceptional 
about the Zulu monarchy in this respect? Why does the ANC do 
what it is doing to hurl these sort of insults at me? My uncle 
the prince of kwaPhindangene as chief minister, and members of 
his cabinet, have a national duty to uphold the dignity of my 
office, my monarchy and kingdom. 
  The African National Congress has never entered any kwaZulu 
election and has been completely unrepresented in the kwaZulu 
legislative assembly. It has been unrepresented because the ANC 
disdained the assembly itself, and talked about it, and 
propagandised against it, in terms which my people will insist 
are vile terms. When the ANC launched a national mass action 
campaign in July 1990 after your release from jail to destroy 
the kwaZulu government and to have the kwaZulu Police disbanded, 
all Zulus true and good were offended. 
  The ANC promoted by means of the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] and the declaration of the state of emergency the 
invasion of kwaZulu by the South African Defence Force and the 
South African Police. I want to make it clear that I, the king 
of the Zulu nation and my father's people consider the 
declaration of a state of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of 
foreign aggression, an invasion of our territory, and a rape of 
our national dignity and pride. I the king of the Zulu nation 
and my father's people shall never recognise the legitimacy of 
the actions taken in terms of the declaration of the state of 
emergency. 
  I also wish to mention that the constant stigmatisation of 
my 
uncle, the prince of kwaPhindangene, as a surrogate leader by 
yourself, sir, also gave rise to great offence. My uncle, the 
traditional prime minister of my people, proudly takes his place 
in the kwaZulu legislative assembly as an arena in which he has 
confronted apartheid. It was he who destroyed the South African 
Government's homeland policy, and it was his refusal to accept 
so-called independence that destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P 
W Botha's dream of establishing a confederation of South African 
states. You, sir, I understand, have latterly given credit where 
credit was due in praising the role of the prince of 
kwaPhindangene in these matters. For us participation was a 
strategy. You yourself, sir, wrote that non-participation was a 
strategic concept and should not be elevated to a principle. 
  I want also, sir, to say that I could go on for some 
considerable time to talk of the offenses to which the Zulu 
nation has taken exception, and to the many ways in which the 
ANC has shown disdain for the Zulu people, the monarchy and the 
kwaZulu legisilative assembly. We meet today against the 
background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu 
nation and to any Zulu in South Africa: the Shell House massacre 
and the declaration of the state of emergency in kwaZulu, with 
consequent military invasion. 
  I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from 
my 
heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime 
purpose of our meeting. 
  I understood the purpose of this meeting to enable you, sir, 
to express whatever views you wish to express on my demand for 
the recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. A 
kingdom is either sovereign or not. Sovereignty can not be 
granted, nor can it be pleaded for. It is not something that can 
be negotiated for or conferred on us by anyone. 
  Allow me, sir, to talk to you briefly about the sovereignty 
of the Zulu kingdom. The Zulu nation is the only nation in the 
whole of southern Africa which had to face the full might of the 
British or any other army. The Zulu nation was the last nation 
to take up arms against the colonial enemies of black South 
Africa. When the Bambatha rebellion erupted, it led to the 
arrest, conviction for treason and the exiling of King Dinuzulu 
ka Cetshwayo, who was my great-grandfather and the maternal 
grandfather of my uncle, the prince of kwaPhindangene, whom your 
organisation so disdains. 
  The Zulus were the only people in the whole of South Africa 
on whom the bantu authorities system had finally to be forced, 
and throughout the period between the forcing of the bantu 
authorities system on us and the final fall of apartheid, Zulus 
played as proud a role as they had previously played between 
1910 and 1948. 
  It was through the kwaZulu legislative assembly that my 
prime 
minister, Prince Mangoshuthu Buthelezi, as chief minister, with 
his colleagues, foiled the plans of the National Party 
government to denationalise all black South Africans. This is 
what prompted the former chairman of the Anglo-American Company, 
Mr Gavin Relly, to say of him in May 1986: 
  "No one, the ANC included, has done more to halt the 
ideological thrust of apartheid than Buthelezi because he has 
rejected violence as an instrument to bring about national 
change, he naturally stands in a better light for many than 
those who do not. It is easy to forget that he was the only 
black leader with an authentic power base to have faced the 
heat, a long time ago, of a government still determined to 
enforce apartheid. I think history, if reasonably and 
objectively written, will endorse the fact that he was the anvil 
on which apartheid ultimately faltered." 
  The founding father of the old African National Congress was 
a Zulu, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, who was married to my grand-aunt, 
Princess Phikisile ka Dinuzulu, and it was a Zulu, Chief Albert 
Lutuli, who salvaged the ANC from disarray and disrepute in the 
first five years of National Party rule, when it was almost 
moribund. 
  Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was 
Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force 
against colonialism and apartheid. The British set out to 
dismember and destroy the Zulu kingdom after we were finally 
defeated at the battle of Ulundi. They did conquer us, but they 
never crushed us. 
  The sovereignty that was indisputably ours in the 19th 
Century remained a living reality in southern Africa. Our 
sovereignty was forged by history. It is simply a fact, sir, 
that sovereignty forged by history can not be undone by 
political edict, or by the passing of a law, or by the forcing 
of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom which 
they reject in part and in whole. 
  I repeat, that under the kwaZulu legislative assembly the 
Zulu monarchy was given interim protection by the South African 
drama as the struggle for liberation ran its course. Now that 
apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa is 
being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom. I am 
not prepared to talk to you, sir, about whether or not there 
shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa. The 
only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing the 
sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognition and 
relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa. 
  In these matters about which I am prepared to talk, there is 
a great deal to discuss. I and my prime minister have always 
known that the kwaZulu legislative assembly was a transitional 
structure which would finally evolve into a permanent 
governmental structure within the context of the wider South 
Africa. The kwaZulu government initiated the Buthelezi 
commission and then later the kwaZulu-Natal indaba [meeting] in 
two very serious attempts to break new ground in negotiation 
endeavours to conceive of race-free alternatives to apartheid. 
  It was my great, great-grandfather King Cetshwayo ka Mpande, 
who was in many respects the first new South African who saw 
that the old historic order of things in the sub-continent would 
have to be changed. It was he who took to diplomacy and the 
writing of letters and dispatches which he used to replace the 
shield and the spear. He recognised that it was by diplomacy and 
the drawing up of treaties that the new South Africa would be 
shaped. He saw over a century ago what we now call the new South 
Africa. He recognised that the Zulu empire which actually spread 
its influence from the Caledon River in the south, right through 
what is now the centre of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, would have to 
be abandoned. He recognised that the kingdom of kwaZulu, bounded 
by the Umtamvuna River in the south, the terrains of King 
Moshoeshoe in the west, the Mcmahon boundary between kwaZulu and 
Mozambique and the boundaries of Swazi domain in the north, set 
fixed boundaries. He also recognised the final kwaZulu boundary 
in the west would be fixed by treaty and negotiation, but would 
extend well into the present day Transvaal. 
  One of the wisdoms distilled out of the colonial and post- 
colonial periods was that post-colonial Africa had to start with 
boundaries of states as they were produced by history in the 
colonial period. There is virtually no state in Africa which 
could not lay traditional claim to territories beyond its 
boundaries. But African states have generally employed the 
wisdom of not fighting wars over claims and counter-claims to 
the territorial limits of states. I accept this wisdom of 
Africa, and I say that the sovereign kingdom of kwaZulu will be 
bounded by the Transvaal in the west, Mozambique and Swaziland 
in the north, and Transkei and Lesotho in the south and south 
west. 
  Mr Mandela, I must inform you, sir, that I reject the 1993 
constitution even as amended, because it extends the politically 
greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom. The 
kingdom of kwaZulu must preferably be made part of the new South 
Africa, but never at the expense of the sovereignty of the 
kingdom. I and my people would like to have just elbow room 
within a greater South Africa. My people can police their 
region. A nation such as ours must have militia, for example, 
and all these things are not possible under this constitution. 
The 1993 constitution makes no provision for this sovereignty. 
It equates the Zulu monarchy with the institutions of 
chieftainships elsewhere. The provisions it makes for the 
representation of traditional leaders quite obviously were not 
drawn up by anybody who had any insight into Zulu society and 
who were prepared to accommodate the Zulu monarchy. 
  When I saw the failure of negotiations and particularly the 
failure of negotiations to deliver federalism, in which the 
kwaZulu-Natal province would be sufficiently autonomous to 
accommodate a sovereign Zulu kingdom, and the role of the Zulu 
monarchy, I had to act decisively. 
  I therefore informed the prince of kwaPhindangene that I 
wished to see the state president and to lay before him the 
claim of Zulu sovereignty for the kingdom. I did so. To my 
dismay the state president sat and listened, and then sought to 
establish negotiations about the sovereignty of the kingdom. 
There was no acceptance of the sovereignty of the kingdom which 
would have permitted discussion about how that kingdom would be 
organised internally, and how its internal organisation would 
interface with the rest of South Africa. 
  I now see that you, sir, and the prince of kwaPhindangene, 
have agreed to submit your differences to an international 
mediation process. Inevitably that process will deliver either 
failure or success which will impact on my own position. 
  As things now stand I cannot encourage my fathers's people 
to 
vote on the 26th, 27th and 28th of April and thereby lend 
legitimacy to what will be destructive of the very foundations 
on which the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom rests. You, sir, 
are rushing into an election which I and the Zulu people reject. 
After the Shell House massacre, the Zulu nation carries an 
additional open wound: those who died because they were 
exercising their democratic right to oppose the election, shall 
be celebrated and remembered in various ways which we will 
announce soon. This makes discussions between us on this vital 
matter both extremely urgent and very, very difficult. 
  As you react to my introductory words, sir, you must 
consider 
that I am bound by my duties and responsibilities towards my 
father's people and towards the Zulu nation. It is my duty and 
responsibility to ensure that the interests of the Zulu nation 
are protected and preserved in the present unfolding of 
historical events in South Africa. As I speak about the 
interests of the Zulu nation, I am deeply aware that such 
interests combine together the wants and aspirations of all the 
past and present generations of Zulus, and of all the 
generations of Zulus yet to come. 
  I, as the king of the Zulu nation, am part of that 
continuum. Throughout that continuum of unfolding historical 
events, the Zulu nation has sought its right to exist on its 
land as a nation and as a people. Since the battle of Ulundi the 
Zulu nation remained a sovereign nation, even if our sovereignty 
was limited by the external coercion of the governments which 
had conquered us. In fact, the Zulu nation and my father's 
people continued to exercise their sovereignty and 
self-government to the fullest extent allowed under the 
circumstances. It is true that the Zulu nation not only 
preserved its language and culture but also its laws and 
societal organisation. The sovereignty of the Zulu nation in 
this respect continued to exist through the institution of the 
Zulu monarchy. The Zulu nation did not choose to be organised in 
the form of a self-governing territory within the grand scheme 
of apartheid, for the self-governing territory was imposed on 
the Zulu nation. However, the establishment of the kwaZulu 
government under the regime of apartheid provided a structure of 
convenience for the self-governance of the Zulu nation. 
  As we are moving into the final stage of liberation, I, as 
the king of the Zulu nation, have a duty to ensure that my 
father's people and the Zulu nation preserve their right of 
self-governance. The Zulu nation never considered its right of 
self-determination to be an exclusive one, for the Zulu nation 
has always expressed its right of self-determination along with 
all the other people who share its ancestral Zulu territory. 
  This was clearly shown by the effort of the Buthelezi 
Commission and the kwaZulu-Natal indaba which led to the joint 
administration of the territory of the Zulus by the joint 
executive authority. Throughout this process, the Zulu nation 
sought to harmonise its interests with the interests of all the 
other people living in kwaZulu/Natal in a shared vision of 
democracy, freedom, mutual respect and pluralism. 
  This process culminated in the adoption of the constitution 
of the state of kwaZulu-Natal on December 1, 1992. The adoption 
of this constitution expressed more than the right of 
self-determination of the Zulu nation. It was also a covenant 
which the Zulu nation undersigned for the benefit of all the 
other people living within the ancestral territory of the Zulu 
nation. 
  The constitution of the state of kwaZulu/Natal set out the 
bottom line for the Zulu nation. It was a compromise between the 
aspirations of the Zulu nation to self-governance and its 
willingness to participate in a united South Africa. The 
constitution of the state of kwaZulu/Natal has the purpose of 
bringing together the Zulu people along with all the other 
people living in the territory. At the same time it recognised 
Zulu sovereignty and translated it into the formation of a 
member state of a federation of states. We dearly hoped that a 
federation of states, such as the United States of America, 
could be formed through negotiations at central level. We had 
hoped that such negotiations would recognise the constitution of 
the state of kwaZulu/Natal. 
  I, the king of the Zulu nation, supported the adoption of 
the 
constitution of the state of kwaZulu/Natal as a compromise 
document and as a means of reconciliation. The constitution of 
the state of kwaZulu-Natal would have left the people of our 
region to decide on all matters of importance to us. The 
constitution would have recognised to our region the right to 
decide on all matters related to our societal organisation. 
Among those matters are important things such as family, 
criminal, contract, commercial, and administrative law. 
  Moreover, the constitution of the state of kwaZulu-Natal had 
the purpose of entrenching a special area of protection and 
autonomy for the Zulu monarchy. In fact the constitution 
entrenched traditional law and customs of which I, as the king 
of the Zulus, am the custodian. The production and protection of 
traditional law would have remained within my domain. No law of 
the central or provincial parliament could have undermined or 
interfered with the importance of traditional law in organising 
and preserving our society. Moreover, and very importantly, the 
constitution would have entrenched communal property and our 
system of courts. In addition, the electoral system adopted in 
that constitution was particularly designed to cater for the 
needs of the Zulu monarchy and our traditional structures, such 
as amakhosi [chiefs] and indunas. 
  The process of negotiation at the World Trade Centre ignored 
the constitution of the state of kwaZulu-Natal and proceeded to 
develop a constitutional framework in which I as the king of the 
Zulu nation and the Zulu nation itself, had no space or 
recognition. Under the 1993 constitution as amended, the 
national parliament could legislate on any matter related to 
communal property on the land of the Zulu nation. Moreover, the 
central parliament will have all residual powers which will 
allow the central government to establish a unitary form of 
societal organisation with only one family or criminal law, for 
instance. Under the World Trade Centre constitution the Zulu 
nation will not have the opportunity to remain a society within 
a broader South African society. 
  It was for this reason that the demands for sovereignty and 
self-determination of the Zulu nation cannot be accommodated 
within the structure of the 1993 constitution. It was for this 
reason that I, the king of the Zulu nation, had no choice but to 
pursue the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu as it existed 
before its conquest by those who undermined our sovereignty. 
  I have met on several occasions with Mr F W de Klerk in his 
capacity as the state president of South Africa. To him I 
clearly and with no uncertainty signified that the claim of the 
Zulu nation for its sovereignty and self-determination cannot be 
accommodated within the structures of the 1993 constitution. To 
him I clearly with no uncertainty said that I as the king of the 
Zulu nation am under an obligation to ensure that the 
sovereignty and the aspirations of the Zulu nation would not be 
obliterated by the 1993 constitution. In that respect, I made it 
very clear that since the sovereignty and self-determination of 
the Zulu nation, as I expressed them to the state president, are 
irreconcilable with the present constitution, it becomes 
necessary that the sovereignty of the Zulu nation shall continue 
to exist irrespective of the present constitution. 
  For this reason on March 18, 1994, the day on which we were 
supposed to meet in Ulundi, I gave a report to the Zulu nation 
detailing the history of my negotiations with the state 
president on the issue of the restoration of the kingdom of 
kwaZulu. On the occasion I made the following statements to my 
father's people and the Zulu nation: 
  "History is calling on us to finalise the liberation of our 
people from over a century of foreign domination. We have 
reached the point of no return at which we are faced with 
enormous responsibilities. 
  "We have reached the end of a road and we are faced with the 
harsh reality that the South African Government can not and will 
not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of 
kwaZulu. We are faced with the harsh reality that the South 
African Government can not and will not facilitate the 
restoration of the sovereign kingdom of kwaZulu. We are faced 
with the historical dilemma of either succumbing and forever 
relinquishing our inalienable right and sovereignty, or to take 
it upon ourselves to realise and bring into existence what is 
ours, what belonged to our fathers and what belongs to our 
children. The Zulu nation is now left with the responsibility of 
finding the strength and the resources to bring about the 
restoration of our kingdom and to achieve our national 
self-determination in a free and independent country." 
  We must have faith in our final victory and in the success 
of the liberation of our people. We shall resist any attempt to 
constrain the forces of our liberation. I have requested 
President de Klerk to sort out this issue of our sovereignty and 
the future of the kingdom of kwaZulu, before the election. 
  The holding of elections under the 1993 constitution in 
terms 
of a unified South Africa, is an immediate denial of our claim 
for sovereignty and self-determination. In this regard, there 
can be no compromise or flexibility and I have the duty as the 
king of the Zulus to express this message in clear and 
unequivocal terms. In the circumstances, I find it quite 
impossible to recommend that any of my subjects who are loyal 
to the throne should participate in the forthcoming election, 
unless this matter is settled. 
  I call on you, my father's people and the Zulu nation, to 
bring to reality the realisation of our dream. The call for 
our freedom can no longer be delayed. Freedom is never 
granted, sovereignty is never granted. Either it exists and is 
recognised, or it does not exist. We the Zulu nation convene 
today on the battleground which subjugated the freedom of our 
forefathers. 
  We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and 
sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it all costs. 
  I, King Zwelithini Goodwill ka Bhekuzulu, fulfil today my 
historical role and responsibility to declare my commitment to 
the freedom and sovereignty of the Zulu nation, and to assert 
the sovereignty of my father's people over their ancestral 
territory. 
  I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the kingdom of 
kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to 
defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern Africa 
who will dare to challenge it. The road ahead is not going to be 
an easy one, but I know that you, my father's people and the 
Zulu nation, will meet with courage, determination and pride the 
challenge that history has put on all of us. God bless all our 
efforts for the restoration of our kingdom. 
  I hope that my comments to you, sir, have made it clear that 
the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu is a now fact of 
history. It is also a fact of history that I will not encourage 
the Zulu nation to participate in any election under the 1993 
constitution in its present formulation. The rejection of the 
Zulu nation's self-rule within a federal formula leaves us with 
no other option, whatever it may cost us. 
  The position of the kingdom of kwaZulu in relation to the 
rest of South Africa is something that will emerge through our 
negotiations and dialogue. 
  It is therefore with some interest that I will sit back and 
listen to whatever comments that you and members of your 
executive care to make, and i hope you will also listen with 
attention to what some of my people may want to say on this 
important matter of the Zulu monarchy, the Zulu kingdom and the 
position of that kingdom within a free South Africa. Whether we 
end up as part of one federal state of South Africa, or as a 
completely autonomous state, will depend on what you and others 
in South Africa do to me and my people. The key thing is whether 
you are prepared to listen to our just aspirations, or whether, 
like those who conquered us, you think you must trample with 
your feet on those just aspirations of my nation.

<F P=106> [Proposed draft agreement by the ANC on kwaZulu tabled at </F>
meeting between ANC President Nelson Mandela, State President 
F.W. de Klerk, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 
April] 
  [Text] Proposed draft agreement between the African 
National Congress and the Royal House of kwaZulu. 
  The African National Congress: 
  Recognising the importance of the institution of the royal 
house of kwaZulu and its royal head, his majesty the king; 
  Further recognising the grave injustice caused by the 
present 
and past designation of his majesty as the paramount chief of 
the Zulus; 
  Mindful of the historic role played by the king, the royal 
house of kwaZulu and their forebears in the struggle against 
colonialism and apartheid and in the promotion of the national 
objective of an independent, unfragmented, democratic, 
non-racial and non-sexist South Africa; 
  Convinced that his majesty, the king and the royal house of 
kwaZulu will continue to make an important contribution towards 
the realisation of these objectives; 
  Further mindful of the high esteem in which the ANC itself 
and the people of our country rightly hold his majesty the king 
and the royal house of kwaZulu ; and, 
  Conscious of the imperative for all government institutions 
to operate within the provisions of the constitutions of the 
Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993, as amended, as well as 
the Bill of Rights; 
  Hereby agrees with his majesty the king and the royal house 
of kwaZulu as follows: 
  1. The African National Congress undertakes actively to 
promote the restoration of the dignity of his majesty the king 
and the royal house of kwaZulu. 
  2. Towards this end, the African National Congress further 
undertakes to ensure that, within the kwaZulu/Natal 
constitution, as envisaged in Section 160 of the constitution of 
Republic of South Africa act of 1993, as amended, (hereinafter 
referred to as "the constitution"), his majesty the king and the 
royal house of kwaZulu shall have and enjoy a place suitable for 
persons in their regal position. 
  3. In particular, the African National Congress undertakes 
to 
ensure that: 
  (a) His majesty the king shall be recognised as a king with 
constitutional powers, prerogatives, rights and obligations 
which shall extend throughout the province of kwaZulu/Natal. 
  (b) His majesty the king shall have and exercise directly or 
indirectly, through a person or persons designated by his 
majesty, both ceremonial and traditional powers and prerogatives 
which shall be specified in the constitution of the province of

  (c) His majesty the king shall be crowned in such a manner 
as 
may be agreed with him, which may include coronation by the

  (d) The king shall have and exercise such rights and powers 
as will be provided for in the constitution together with the 
royal court, as determined by Zulu custom and tradition. 
  (e) The constitution shall provide that the king shall, on 
an 
annual basis, officially open the proceeding of the provincial 
legislature. 
  (f) The king shall also be advised and assisted by a royal 
council comprising the premier of the province of kwaZulu/Natal 
(elected in terms of Section 145 of the constitution), members 
of the royal house of kwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature and a 
specified number of members of the kwaZulu/Natal house of 
traditional leaders (established in terms of section 183 of the 
constitution) 
  (g) The king shall be constitutionally empowered to 
designate 
a member of the royal house as his majesty's adviser and 
assistant on all traditional and customary matters; 
  (h) Such adviser and assistant shall have a status and 
concomitant powers and privileges equivalent to those of members 
of the provincial legislature of the province of kwaZulu/Natal 
and shall, as such, represent his majesty at all meetings of the 
provincial legislature of kwaZulu/Natal in a non-voting 
capacity. 
  (i) His majesty the king shall receive regular reports and 
briefings from the premier of the province of kwaZulu/Natal on 
all legislative and executive actions of the government of the 
province. 
  (j) The king shall have authority to install all chiefs in 
the province of kwaZulu/Natal. 
  (k) In case of a dispute in a family or community regarding 
the issue of chiefly succession, the king shall have authority 
to appoint and install the rightful chief, after consultation 
with the relevant parties. 
  (l) All traditional leaders and authorities in the province 
of kwaZulu/Natal shall have their constitution, position and 
authority guranteed in terms of Chapter 11 of the constitution. 
  (m) The provincial legislature of kwaZulu/Natal shall, 
annually, approve a budget to cover the expenses of his majesty 
the king and the royal house of kwaZulu, which budget shall be 
operated by a person or persons approved by his majesty for this 
purpose. 
  (n) The provincial legislature shall establish by law a 
royal 
constabulary which, as a special unit of the kwaZulu/Natal 
policing authority, shall be responsible for the security of his 
majesty and the royal house of kwaZulu. 
  (o) The constitution of the province of kwaZulu/Natal shall 
determine the titular relationship between his majesty the king 
and fixed public property in the province. 
  (p) The provincial legislature shall, after consultation 
with 
his majesty the king, give an appropriate name to the province 
of kwaZulu/Natal, which name shall be adopted and legislated by 
the provincial legislature as the official name of the province 
of kwaZulu/Natal. 
  4. Prior to the adoption of the constitution of the province 
of kwaZulu/Natal as envisaged in the constitution and prior to 
the passing of appropriate legislation by the provincial 
legislature of kwaZulu/Natal, the African National Congress 
undertakes to ensure the security of the position, powers, 
prerogatives, rights and privileges currently held or, as the 
case may be, exercised and enjoyed by his majesty and the royal 
house of kwaZulu. 
  5. His majesty the king and the royal house of kwaZulu 
undertake actively to promote the right of all South Africans, 
irrespective of party political affiliation, to enjoy freedom of 
political activity, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, 
freedom to protest and to petition authority peacefully, as well 
as all other relevant rights and freedoms. 
  6. In particular, his majesty the king and the royal house 
of 
kwaZulu undertake to guarantee that all political parties and 
organisations, both those opposed to and those participating in 
the forthcoming general elections, shall not be hindered by any 
persons or authority in their unarmed and peaceful campaigns. 
  7. His majesty the king and the royal house of kwaZulu 
further undertake to do all in their power, in collaboration 
with the Independent Electoral Commission, to ensure that all 
persons seeking to participate and vote in the forthcoming

<F P=106> [Joint statement by State President F.W. de Klerk, King </F>
Goodwill Zwelithini Kabhekuzulu, ANC President Nelson Mandela 
and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi issued by the ANC on the 
SAPA PR Wire Service on 9 April] 
  [Text] Delegations led by the state president, Mr F W de 
Klerk, King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr N Mandela and Chief Minister 
M G Buthelezi met today for several hours in the Kruger National 
Park. The delegations discussed a number of issues, including 
the future constitutional accommodation of the Zulu monarchy, 
calls for Zulu sovereignty, the problem of violence, the state 
of emergency and proposals for international mediation. 
  The parties agreed on the necessity to make proper 
constitutional provision for the recognition of the Kingdom of 
kwaZulu and tabled substantial proposals in this regard. They 
agreed to establish a working group to deliberate further on 
these proposals and to report back to the respective leaders by 
Thursday next week. 
  The parties agreed that, on the subject of outstanding 
constitutional issues, international mediation should proceed in 
order to seek a constitutional settlement and political 
reconciliation. Urgent negotiations should take place to reach 
agreement on the terms of reference and the procedures to be 
followed. A follow-up meeting late next week is foreseen to 
discuss the progress achieved in negotiations and to consider 
the implications arising from this. 
  His majesty the king and the three leaders were unanimous in 
their condemnation of violence and of the known and hidden 
forces that are involved in fomenting violence. They made an 
urgent appeal to their followers and to all South Africans to 
end the killings, to exercise maximum restraint and to pursue 
their objectives by peaceful means. Kruger National Park 8 April

<F P=106> [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk, Zulu King </F>
Goodwill Zwelithini, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, and ANC President Nelson Mandela near Skukuza at the 
Kruger National Park on 8 April-- recorded, broadcast in 
progress] 
  [Text] [De Klerk] ...they had to adapt and make special 
arrangements to enable us to meet at this venue and we thank 
them very much for the very efficient service which they 
rendered to us and the discomfort they also had in the process, 
during a very popular week, in making available this special 
venue of which we made use. We have distributed a joint 
statement, which no doubt you will interpret that it hides more 
than it discloses. If that is your conclusion you are 
absolutely right because that was the intention, not because we 
have not had fruitful discussions, but because our discussions 
in many senses of the word have not been completed. For that 
reason we have appointed a task group with a specific 
instruction. You might say, oh, another task group. [laughter] 
I would like to say that this one is different in that it has 
to report back in less than a week, to the leaders, and in that 
there is an agreement for a follow-up meeting during which the 
discussions will be taken further, and this is the main reason 
why the statement is incomplete on all the burning issues, which 
are not dealt with specifically in the statement. 
  I feel that we have made good progress in some respects 
today. On the burning issue and the very important issue of the 
accommodation and the full recognition of the monarchy of the 
Zulu nation, of the Zulu kingdom, I am confident that this task 
group will come up with good results because my perception is 
that between our proposals, the proposals of the ANC, the 
proposals from the side of Chief Minister Buthelezi and the 
kwaZulu government, there is already discernible, a broad 
consensus and that it is now a question of putting together the 
how -- of the accommodation and recognition of the Zulu kingdom. 
The fact that it is to be recognized, and that that is to be 
done constitutionally, I think can be accepted as having been 
fully established and that there is a broad consensus on that. 
  On some of the other issues I am disappointed that we 
haven't 
made more progress, but the door is not closed and discussions 
will continue. There will now be a broadened basis of 
discussion on the issue of mediation and mediation can play a 
constructive and a positive role and the government will be 
cooperative on the basis that we reach agreement on a number of 
outstanding aspects affecting the issue of mediation. If we can 
reach such agreement mediation can make a constructive 
contribution towards bringing us nearer to solutions on many of 
the substantive issues at stake. In general, I think we have 
achieved today the beginning of a discussion and a continued 
negotiation process between main role players which should have 
started long ago. I have for many, many years been advocating a 
meeting like the one we have had today and I'm glad that at last 
it has taken place, and as far as the government and the 
National Party is concerned, we will seek ways and means of 
ensuring that also this important forum which has been brought 
together today, will continue to operate and interact with each 
other because there lies a heavy responsibility on the shoulders 
of the four people and that which they represent in public life, 
sitting before you. To a certain extent we have come to the 
brink of a very serious situation, and our responsibility is to 
through dialogue and negotiation, find ways and means to defuse 
the issue in the province and to ensure that peace comes to all 
the people of South Africa, and that the full opportunity for 
all those who want to participate, to participate freely and 
without fear, will be ensured and for those who choose the other 
options, and that is not to participate, to also do so without 
interference. Participation or not is a choice. It is part of 
the democratic process, but the rights of those who want to 
participate is as sacrosanct as the rights of those who don't 
want to participate, and I'm glad that nothing has happened 
today which in any way takes away from a previous agreement 
reached between me and Chief Minister Buthelezi, that this 
principle of free democratic organization for those who 
participate and who don't participate, is an important principle 
which should be upheld throughout our country in every inch and 
every corner. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Zwelethini] Well, from all that the state president has 
been saying, I should say to the discussions that have taken 
place in the meeting, which actually everybody has been ... has 
been looking for, I'm so pleased that the meeting has taken 
place today although some of my demands, as far as I'm 
concerned, has never been met yet, but as far as this meeting is 
concerned I hope that it's going to be very concerned about the 
problems that have been accumulated in this country, especially 
from the political parties whom actually their followers are in 
a problem of fighting against each other, which I hope that 
today, this meeting of today is going to show, especially to the 
grassroots level, that the leaders themselves -- what do they 
want from their own followers. So, I don't think there is 
anything that I can say thereof, except that the joint press 
statement for myself and the chief minister is going to be right 
by him. Thank you. 
  [Buthelezi] Today his majesty, the king of the Zulu nation, 
leaders of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC and the 
South African Government and the National Party, and their 
respective delegations met in a summit in a venue within this 
Kruger National Park. The parties in this summit exchanged 
presentations on their respective positions with respect to the 
grave issues which are facing the country in the present 
national crisis. 
  Unfortunately, progress could not be made with respect to 
most of the fundamental issues tabled by his majesty the king of 
the Zulus and by the Inkatha Freedom Party to which the leaders 
and the delegations of the South African Government, National 
Party and of the ANC, could not provide any responsive answer as 
they still had to consult with their cabinet and with the 
members of the working group through the ANC before responding. 
The IFP upholds the summit to seek ways and means to reach a 
constitutional compromise which could form the basis for a 
broader political settlement and reconciliation which would 
enable the IFP to join the electoral process on an equal footing 
with all other political parties of South Africa. In this 
respect the IFP felt that a postponement of the election date is 
essential to achieve an all inclusive participation. Both his 
majesty the king and the IFP also tabled the issue of the Shell 
House massacre and of the most disturbing lack of police action 
to secure evidence and ensure the conviction of those who 
perpetuated that carnage. The issue of the sovereignty of the 
kingdom of kwaZulu was tabled once again by his majesty the king 
and the Zulu nation and an ANC proposal continued provisions to 
be implemented by a government of national unity after elections 
was found to be unacceptable by His Majesty and his delegation. 
The issue of violence in the country and especially in the 
kwaZulu-Natal area was discussed and the IFP tabled its firm 
opposition to the declaration of the state of emergency in 
kwaZulu-Natal and intervention of the SAP [South African Police] 
and the SADF [South African Defense Force], which has already 
proven to escalate the situation of violence and arrest in that 
region. 
  The IFP insisted that the immediate lifting of the state of 
emergency is a necessary precondition to the holding of free and 
fair elections in the region. In order to seek compromise and 
reconciliation the IFP tabled further proposals to reach a 
constitutional settlement contained on pages five and six of the 
presentation delivered by the president of the IFP. Such 
proposals were not even discussed. International mediation 
between the South African Government, the IFP, and the ANC was 
also discussed and all parties stated their commitment to it. 
In this respect the president of the IFP further proposed the 
involvement of Norway in the mediation process, to which there 
was no objection from the other parties. 
  That is a statement which His Majesty commanded me to read 
to 
you just now, and I must say that just like the state president, 
I feel that although there may be that disappointment that there 
has been nothing concrete as far as the expectations of many 
people in this country and also outside this country are 
concerned -- but nevertheless I do believe that the day was not 
wasted. I believe that every minute that was spent in 
addressing the issues of the king and the kingdom, in addressing 
all the other issues that the state president has mentioned and 
also issues that I mentioned, were well spent. 
  [Mandela] Firstly, I would like to say that the statement 
read by the chief minister comes to me as a complete surprise. 
I certainly was not informed about it before now. The 
statement that has been distributed to the press was drafted by 
committee representatives -- all the parties involved in this 
discussion -- and I would have expected that if there was a 
separate statement we should have been informed, warned about 
this. The second point I want to make is that the IFP wanted the 
date of elections to be postponed. We have emphatically 
rejected that. That day is sacrosanct and there can be no 
compromise over it whatsoever. 
  The third point I would like to make is that we would expect 
the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to give full facilities to the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to deploy the voting 
stations and to make all preparations for the elections, as has 
happened in other parts of our country. There is no area in 
which the IEC has encountered problems and we would appeal to 
the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to cooperate with the IEC. 
Those who want to participate in the elections should be free 
to do so and those who want to boycott the elections should also 
be free to campaign for the boycott of elections, after all, 
that is what democracy is all about. The only issue which we 
(?are against) -- as we have done in our resolution, is the 
question of seeking to obtain ones objective through the 
employment of violence. We have harshly condemned these 
massacres and called upon our followers to commit themselves to 
peace and we have condemned all forces, including those that are 
known and unknown which are responsible for this violence, but 
we hope that the authorities in that area will give full 
cooperation to the IEC in its work. 
  Now, we made certain proposals to his majesty, as the ANC, 
in 
order to meet his concerns. We went out of our way to address 
everything which we believe a constitutional monarch would like 
to enjoy -- the powers, the rights which are sovereign 
everywhere in the world, in a constitutional dispensation, 
enjoy. There is hardly any power in our view which we reserved, 
except perhaps we were silent on the question of the right of 
His Majesty to communal land and to indigenous law. When this 
was pointed out to us we indicated that as the African National 
Congress we are prepared to address this question because we are 
keen that the fears and the concerns of his majesty must be 
fully addressed and I will be going back to my organization to 
point out that amongst the proposals that we made, his majesty 
felt that this particular question of his rights in relation to 
communal land and to indigenous laws is a matter which he feels 
we should have addressed, and we will treat this with all 
seriousness. This discussion with his majesty is going to 
continue. We will address it if we are unable to resolve it 
before the election. We propose to continue after the election. 
  Without going into details I do not want us to have 
exaggerated expectations about the task group because the 
reasons for the reservation that have been expressed -- his 
majesty expressed a certain reservation about the proposals that 
were made to him and in my view these are reservations which 
cannot be properly addressed by a task group. They are 
reservations which can properly be addressed by a government of 
national unity. Nevertheless, I will not oppose any mechanism 
which my colleagues and all the other parties involved think 
might be useful, but I would like to warn you that we should 
have no exaggerated expectations as to what this task group is 
likely to achieve. 
  Now the issue of the powers, the rights, the privileges of 
His Majesty, have nothing to do with the form of state. Whether 
it is a federation, or a unitary state, or a hybrid state, his 
majesty will enjoy the rights of a constitutional monarch, with 
all ceremonial powers. I believe that you must have gone 
through our proposals because they are now in the hands of the 
press, and we believe that subject to the two issues on which 
our proposals seem to be (?based), subject to those two, we 
believe we have gone a long way to address the concerns of his 
majesty. But the addressing of his concerns is totally 
unrelated to the form of state and that is the spirit in which 
we handled the affair. 
  Now in regard to the Shell House massacre, that was raised 
by 
His Majesty and I pointed out that this matter is now in the 
hands of the Goldstone Commission and we better wait until that 
commission has made a finding. We will then take up the matter 
on the basis of the finding of the learned judge, and I believe 
that we saw more or less eye to eye on this point. Now we are 
unable to place before you any tangible results of these 
discussions, but of course as you know the fact that we sat 
together to exchange views is itself progress. We now know what 
the concerns of his majesty are, what the demands of the IFP 
are. We have responded to them. They know what our point of 
view is and further discussions, therefore, will build on what 
we believe the basis that was made and the proposals that were 
made to his majesty are a basis for further discussion of his 
position. The African National Congress is very much concerned 
about the demands of his majesty. It is one of the most 
illustrious royal houses in this country and we would like his 
majesty to feel sure that we are proud of the achievements of 
that illustrious royal house, and it is for that reason that the 
ANC has gone out of its way in order to meet the fears of his 
majesty, and we are, therefore, leaving the meeting in the 
knowledge that we have tried our best to meet the concerns of 
his majesty, and as I say the discussions between ourselves on 
his position, and his majesty, will go on before the 27 April, 
and if we do not reach a solution, those discussions will go on 
after the 27 April, but I want to make sure there should be no 
doubt, whatsoever, about the elections on the 27 April. As I 
said elsewhere, we cannot postpone our freedom and we are 
determined to set up a government of our own choice on that day 
and I hope that everyone will understand why we are so 
determined that the elections should take place as scheduled. 
  [Buthelezi] I just want to clarify one thing that Mr. 
Mandela says, when he says that he was not informed about a 
separate statement that I have made. I think the issue Mr. 
Mandela has discussed very clearly and I think that it was Mr. 
Matthews in our party who stated there was a time when we were 
not, in fact, in favor of issuing part of a joint communique, 
but then the state president said that there were issues in 
which we had agreed, that in fact we all agreed -- it was sure. 
We are making it very clear that each person has the right to 
make their own statement. The fact that we have put down what, 
in fact, is our point of view doesn't mean to say that there is 
no right to state our own point of view, but I mean it wasn't as 
if we were doing this secretly. I don't know whether, maybe, 
Mr. Mandela could not have understood the argument. There are 
some arguments about it when we agreed on this matter, and I 
would also like to, and I would also like to say that as Mr. 
Mandela has put it, the discussions have gone -- inasmuch as the 
state president has stated -- but concerning, you know, 
elections the head of state in this country, Mr. de Klerk, has 
stated to you that in fact I have not deviated from all the 
undertakings that I made to him previously, and in fact all of 
you have got my statement which I have given to you and all of 
you are aware of the fact that it isn't as if on our part we are 
trying to, you know, to deprive the IEC of any facility that it 
is within our competence and powers to make available, and 
thirdly, I would say that when the king raised the issues that 
he has raised about the sovereignty of his people, and also the 
whole issue of the Zulu kingdom, you stated that if there had 
been a federal state that we would never had raised the issue. 
  So that, therefore, I think that the issue arises precisely 
because the issue of the federal state, the three of us -- I 
think the president, the president of the ANC, and myself we are 
not at the negotiation council, except that they attended of 
course the Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] 
plenary sessions, which I did not attend. But I would say that 
the issues that the king has raised have a lot to do with the 
self- determination of the Zulu people, that the issue is not 
just a personal issue which his majesty the king raises, you 
know, about himself and his person and his family. It's an 
issue which he raises on behalf of his people as a whole, and if 
the issue is not, actually sorted out, and he has pleaded that 
it should be sorted out from January this year, when he spoke to 
the state president, then it is a very problematic situation 
because, therefore, I mean those of us, who may be members of 
the IFP who are Zulu speaking will find it very difficult to 
participate in the elections. 
  But I would like also to draw your attention to my statement 
that I think I have made some very reasonable proposals because 
the IFP intends participating in the elections, in fact we do 
want to participate in the elections, and therefore, we made 
some very reasonable compromises in an effort to try and have 
this issue resolved before the elections because we do want to 
participate in the elections. Now to say that when there should 
be a government of national unity, and we should be called the 
government of national unity, in which we are not part of -- I 
think that of course is a misnomer because we cannot really be a 
government of national unity in this country -- in which quite a 
large segment of the people of South Africa are not represented. 
  So I just wanted to clarify those issues, and to say to Mr. 
Mandela that there is no -- our meeting has gone on very 
amicably and there was no tensions in the discussions, even 
between us and that, therefore, there is no subterfuge, there is 
no issue of us issuing a statement which was secretly (?drawn 
up).

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Political Position of Zulu Monarchy Viewed -- "The failure 
of 
the ANC and NP [National Party] this week to persuade King 
Goodwill Zwelithini to withdraw his support for the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP] boycott tactics may well count as one of 
our country's defining moments," begins a page-26 editorial in 
the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 10 April. "The 
implications for peace or continuing war are enormous." 
Although the king on Friday rejected the proposal of having a 
constitutional monarchy entrenched, the editorial urges the king 
and his advisers to "carefully consider the implications." "The 
institution of the Zulu monarchy has survived war, invasion, 
plague and natural disaster," "yet now the king, the 
institution, is deeply locked in politics, caught in a violent 
war of position between the ANC and Inkatha." The editorial 
continues by admitting that "the IFP's decision not to take part 
in the election is legitimate and democratic. Its steadfast 
defence of federal powers -- long after the National Party had 
capitulated in a welter of nudges, back-channel deals and 
obfuscatory rhetoric -- is to its eternal credit. But that is 
not the point. Inkatha's opposition to the election now verges 
on the seditious -- a campaign to destabilise the election and 
to deny citizens their fundamental right to vote. Unimaginable 
violence looms." 
<H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>
  Transition Urged on After Failed Leaders' Summit -- "We 
believe that after the failure of this summit where the ANC 
presented an extraordinary package to address the king's 
so-called concerns, to no avail, the ANC, the NP and the South 
African society as a whole have finally discovered that 
Buthelezi will never be satisfied," states the Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 10 April in a page-6 editorial. 
"Therefore -- no matter how radical it sounds -- the only 
reasonable thing to do is to ignore Buthelezi and move ahead 
with the transition process. It is also a shame King Goodwill 
Zwelithini has not yet discovered that Buthelezi is geared to 
make him lose something for nothing." In conclusion the SUNDAY 
NATION writes that "we hope that the three remaining weeks 
before the adoption of the new constitution will be enough for 
the king to see the light and take a more realistic approach if 
he really cares about the well-being of his people and the Natal 
province as a whole." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Kruger Park Leaders' Summit -- "A mountain gives birth to a 
mole hill" is how a page-18 editorial in the Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 10 April dubs the unsuccessful leaders' 
summit meeting at Skukuza on Friday night. "In spite of healthy 
skepticism from those watching the complicated political 
process, there had been great expectations in the South African 
public that the summit between the government, the ANC, the IFP, 
and the Zulu king would send out a positive message. Correctly 
or incorrectly, these expectations had been built up like the 
proverbial mountain. The one that gave birth to a mole hill." 
"Expectations have been cherished and built up -- but 
disappointment and dissatisfaction have followed with regular 
monotony." At the Skukuza summit, the ANC reiterated its 
standpoint: postponing the election was out of the question. 
"And indeed the postponement of the election date was the one 
item high on the IFP's agenda." Furthermore, nothing has come 
from the proposed international mediation which had earlier 
built a "glimpse of hope." "At this late stage, RAPPORT is 
appealing to all political leaders to seek with renewed 
enthusiasm an all-inclusive solution," while the "thinking" 
South African public appeals for "room in which all views will 
be considered."

  [Text] The situation remains quite calm here in Burundi 
following the death of the head of state last Wednesday [6 
April] in a plane crash, in which the president of neighboring 
Rwanda was also killed. 
  This morning the chairman of the National Assembly and also 
the chairman of the Crisis Committee addressed the nation and 
thanked all the citizens for the calm and security that they 
have maintained during these hard moments. Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya said this is the sign that Burundians are 
determined to end the crisis which has paralyzed the country 
over the past five months. He said the authorities are doing 
everything possible to restore and maintain lasting peace. 
  The special representative of the UN secretary general to 
Burundi Ahmedou Ould Abdallah also said the situation in Burundi 
is far more encouraging compared to what is happening in 
neighboring Rwanda. Mr. Abdallah expressed his satisfaction to 
see that Bujumbura has become a platform for humanitarian 
operations on foreign nationals living in Rwanda. [sentence as

  [Text] Bujumbura, 8 Apr (KNA) -- The speaker of Burundi's 
National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, is getting ready to 
succeed the late president Cyprien Ntaryamira, who died 
Wednesday [6 April] in a plane crash near Kigali, the capital of 
neighboring Rwanda. 
  In his second address to the nation on Thursday evening, 
Ntibantunganya repeatedly appealed to Burundian citizens to 
"preserve the existing calm". He commended the country's higher 
organs and security forces for their "positive role in the 
management of the crisis born from the sudden death of the head 
of state". 
  Meanwhile, Radio Bujumbura reported that Ntibantunganya held 
talks in the presidential palace with ambassadors in Bujumbura, 
to "inform them of the situation prevailing in the country and 
ask for their support", the national radio reported. 
  In case of vacancy of power, the Burundi Constitution says 
the speaker of parliament acts as the interim president for a 
maximum period of three months, pending the election of a new 
president.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 9 Apr (PANA) -- The speaker of the 
Burundi Parliament, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has confirmed the 
arrival of U.S. planes at Bujumbura Airport, for the 
repatriation of its nationals from neighboring Rwanda, where a 
civil war broke out on Wednesday [6 April]. 
  Ntibantunyanya, who made the announcement on national radio, 
gave no detail on the type and number of planes expected in the 
Burundian capital. He only said that immediately the Americans 
applied for landing, the Crisis Committee met urgently and gave 
the go-ahead to the U.S. planes. 
  The speaker appealed for understanding saying it was purely 
a 
humanitarian gesture. "The American planes have no other mission 
than to repatriate U.S. nationals who risk death in Rwanda", he 
explained. 
  The speaker, who under the Constitution is to lead the 
country for an interim period of between 45 days and three 
months, ended his short radio address by commending the 
Burundian people for "the dignity they have shown so far in 
these times of trial". He urged them to continue to safeguard 
"peace which honors Burundi in the eyes of the international 
community". The Crisis Committee comprises six eminent 
personalities, including Ntibantunganya, Defense Minister 
Colonel Cedeon Fyroko, and Armed Forces general chief of staff, 
Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu.

  [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- The summit of South Africa's 
four top political leaders was still underway in the Kruger 
National Park late on Friday [8 April] afternoon. The four -- 
State President F W de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela -- began their talks 
at 3.30PM and there was no indication when the meeting would end. 
  A large contingent of journalists were restricted to the 
Skukuza area as they were not allowed into the Jakkalsbessie 
Camp, the venue for the talks, government spokesman Marius 
Kleynhans said. 
  King Zwelithini was at Skukuza on Thursday night, while Mr 
Mandela, Mr Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk arrived on Friday morning. 
  The ANC leader and the Zulu king met from 9.30AM to 2PM, Mr 
Kleynhans said. 
  King Goodwill's delegation included about 20 indunas 
[chiefs], and the ANC was represented by Secretary-General Cyril 
Ramaphosa, Executive Committee member Mac Maharaj and Communist 
Party Chairman Joe Slovo. 
  The four leaders met to discuss the future of kwaZulu/Natal, 
violence, and whether elections would be possible in the 
province. 
  Journalists battled to file stories as only one pay card 
telephone line was available at Skukuza for the media. 
  While the government and other delegations earlier refused 
to 
disclose the venue of the talks, the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] had advance notice and arrived at 
Skukuza with an outside broadcast truck to provide coverage of 
the event.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The international aid effort in Liberia continues to 
be hampered by the activities of rebel groups. Last week, 
several aid agencies including the French charity, Medecins Sans 
Frontieres, or MSF, accused the Liberian Peace Council of 
murdering two nurses in Grand Bassa County, and they expressed 
concern for the lack of respect being shown for humanitarian 
efforts. Well, today, the Liberian Peace Council's secretary 
general, Octavius Walker, called us up from Monrovia, and he 
told Josephine Hazely that he objected to the claim that they 
had been involved in the killing of the two MSF workers. 
  [Begin recording] [Walker] Sorry, it is not true. It is just 
designed to spoil the good reputation of the Liberian Peace 
Council. Since the war started, we have never killed any 
civilians. We have never killed any civilians, so when the 
story came out I went to the Medecins sans Frontieres office in 
Monrovia and their director showed me a copy of the release that 
(?reported it). They told me that it was a local newspaper that 
accused the Peace Council of killing the two nurses. But 
according to the release, no faction's name was mentioned. In 
fact, on that particular day, the Liberia Peace Council and the 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fought so they do not 
know exactly which faction killed the two nurses. 
  [Hazely] But it is a bit superfluous for you to say since 
the 
war started you have not killed any civilians, is it not? 
  [Walker] I can prove it, yes, it is true. We have never 
killed any civilians. Even if the NPFL fighters surrender to 
us, we do not kill them. 
  [Hazely] Why are you so sure that you did not kill the two 
male nurses of Medecins sans Frontieres? After all, you were 
fighting, it could have been you. 
  [Walker] I am sure my boys....[pauses] In fact we are 
fighting a professional fight. We do not shoot when NPFL are 
shooting at us. We wait till they are tired before we attack 
them. So my boys are professionals and I trust them. 
  [Hazely] Our reports say these two aid workers were killed 
at 
Compound No. 2. Now, who controls Compound No. 2? 
  [Walker] The Liberian Peace Council presently controls 
Compound No. 2. 
  [Hazely] Well, so, there you are. You could have killed 
them. 
  [Walker] No way. We took over 6,000 civilians from that camp 
and turned them over to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in Bassa. We have 
never killed any civilians. 
  [Hazely] All right, then. The aid agencies were generally 
complaining about the manner in which you are harassing and 
making their work completely difficult in Grand Bassa, where you 
are. Now why are you preventing the aid agencies from operating 
normally? 
  [Walker] For the aid agencies now going to our territory, 
they and myself are now negotiating. For the past two weeks, 
they have been inviting us to meetings and they went to my 
chairman, Dr. George Foley, and we have worked out modalities. 
Just on the 29th of last month, March, we (?carried) ECOMOG 
chief of staff with other members of the (?High Command) of 
ECOMOG. We went to Rivercess, and our territory and they saw 
the whole area, so we are working out modalities for the 
Medecins sans Frontieres to go and start their work. 
  [Hazely] Well, okay. Have you or have you not been stopping 
aid agencies from working in your areas? 
  [Walker] We have never stopped anybody. They came to us to 
talk to us to allow them to go in. We have never [words 
indistinct] those modalities yet. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of government statement; date not given] </F>
  [Text] The attention of the Federal Military Government has 
been drawn to the text of an interview granted by NEWSWATCH 
magazine to the former minister of communications under the 
immediate past military regime, retired Brigadier General David 
Mark, and published in the current edition of the magazine. 
Having carefully gone through the text, the Federal Military 
Government wishes to make the following statement: 
  1. That the said interview is wholesomely sinister and that 
it is part of a well funded and well organized scheme by a few 
disgruntled elements to destabilize government through sponsored 
publications of crass falsehood and deliberate blackmail about 
the present administration. 
  2. [Words indistinct] such tendentiously seditious and 
criminally libelous publications, the sole purpose -- as has 
been discovered in some documents which are already in the 
possession of security agencies -- is to set out to undermine 
the integrity of some members of the present leadership, and 
thereby discredit the administration. 
  3. That the government is utterly aware that part of the 
objectives of such allegations in [words indistinct] press 
interviews is to preempt the outcome of some of the current 
corrective measures already embarked upon by the administration, 
including the ongoing series of investigations into some 
government parastatals, especially in cases where the 
disgruntled members of the discredited cabal are known to have 
some vested interests as will be discovered later in this 
statement. 
  4. That the government is also aware that one way by which 
the cabal seeks to achieve the above stated objectives, as could 
be identified from the contents of the NEWSWATCH interview, is 
to instigate disaffection and undermine discipline within the 
Armed Forces as well as to create confusion and unnecessary 
anxiety among the civil populace by deliberately setting one 
ethnic or tribal group against another. 
  5. That some of the said documents that are already in the 
possession of security agencies have also revealed that the 
group has succeeded in enlisting the support of some selected 
media organizations which are to be used for publications of 
material and press interviews that would not only be 
deliberately criminal and libelous against some well targeted 
individuals in the government but would aggressively canvass the 
sabotage of the administration's program by actively fanning the 
embers of disunity in the country. 
  6. That the NEWSWATCH interview of a member of this [word 
indistinct] acclaimed clique, coming into play at this crucial 
and most sensitive period of this administration's tenure, 
clearly falls in line with the above extremely mischievous 
motives. 
  7. The Federal Military Government wishes to remind 
Nigerians that these are the same people whose actions, while in 
government, have brought the nation to its present precarious 
situation in which the economy was almost bleeded [as heard] to 
death through large scale corruption and barefaced looting of 
the nation's resources. 
  8. It will be recalled that Brig. Gen. David Mark, who 
incidentally has escaped abroad, was minister of communications 
between 1987 and 1990 under the immediate past military regime, 
and that the ministry supervising the operations of Nigerian 
Telecommunications-Plc, NITEL, one of the nation's prime and 
resourcefully endowed parastatals. It is therefore not 
unexpected that David Mark, like some members of his clique, 
should feel very much uncomfortable with the ongoing 
investigations being instituted by the government into the 
activities of NITEL and other agencies. 
  9. The purpose of this statement, therefore, is to alert 
members of the Armed Forces and the police as well as the public 
to be circumspect and not to be quelled by these evil 
machinations. 
  10. For avoidance of doubt, the Federal Military Government 
would like to warn that no amount of cowardly acts such as 
blackmail or mischievous propaganda by these disgruntled 
elements, some of whom are not courageous enough to stay at home 
and defend their stewardships, will deter the administration 
from actively pursuing its set goals to their logical conclusion. 
  11. The Federal Military Government, through the security 
agencies, is already closely monitoring the activities of these 
elements whose movements are also being placed under 
surveillance and warns that anyone found to be working towards 
undermining the nation's security and corporate existence will 
be summarily dealt with. 
  12. Let it be stated for the umpteenth time that much as the 
ongoing investigations in selected government parastatals are 
not geared at witch-hunting individuals, the Federal Military 
Government is determined to implement fully, without fear or 
favor, the recommendations of the probe panels. 
  13. The Federal Military Government is equally not unaware 
of the current trend whereby as a result of the declining 
fortunes of some media houses occasioned by the temporary 
downturn in the economy, some of them have made themselves 
cheaply accessible to criminally libelous or seditious 
publications for financial gains to the detriment of 
professional ethics and national security. 
  14. The administration would therefore like to repeat its 
earlier warning that much as it is committed to the creation of 
an enabling environment for an unfettered, virile press in the 
country, it strongly believes that freedoms should be exercised 
with some responsibilities. 
  15. For avoidance of doubt, let it be acknowledged 
emphatically that this administration is conscious of its 
responsibilities to the ordinary people of this country and it 
would definitely not fold its arms while some mischievous, 
selfish, and unpatriotic Nigerians threaten the peace and 
security of this great country. The gimmicks in whatever form, 
either through publications or other mass media channels, will 
be handled with all the forces at the government's disposal. 
Liberty is not license.
