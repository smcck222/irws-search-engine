  [Excerpts] Lagos, 11 Apr (PANA) -- The chief executive of 
Nigeria's influential Lagos-based weekly news magazine, 
NEWSWATCH, Ray Ekpu, has been arrested along with his deputy, 
Yakubu Mohamed, the magazine said. An official of the 
publication said that Ekpu and Mohamed were arrested in Lagos 
and northern city of Lokoja at the weekend. 
  No official reason was given for their arrest by state 
security officials, which followed the arrest Thursday [7 April] 
of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Dan Agbese. The arrests are 
believed to be in connection with last week's NEWSWATCH 
interview with an official of the old administration of Gen. 
Ibrahim Babangida which ruled from 1985 to 1992. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some media and human rights organisations, in separate 
statements after Agbese's arrest, condemned the action as a new 
wave of media clampdown in the West African country, which is 
acclaimed to have one of the freest press in Africa. The 
organisations include the Nigerian Union of Journalists and the 
Nigerian Magazine Publishers Association. 
  "Events in the recent past have shown that unlawful 
harassments of media practitioners have never achieved any 
positive results for the government," the association said. 
  Agbese, Mohamed and Ekpu, left the NATIONAL CONCORD 
publication of millionaire Moshood Abiola in 1983 to set up 
NEWSWATCH, whose founding editor-in-chief, Dele Giwa was killed 
in a parcel bomb delivered to his Lagos home in 1986. There has 
been no arrest or prosecution of Dele's killers, some eight 
years after his slaying.

<F P=106> [Interview with retired Brigadier General David Mark by </F>
Jeremy Skiss in London; date not given; from the "Focus on 
Africa" program -- first paragraph is announcer's introduction] 
  [Text] The military government in Nigeria has accused a 
retired general of threatening the country's stability. The man 
at the center of the controversy is former Brigadier General 
David Mark, one of the officers who backed the coup which 
brought General Abacha to power last November. In an interview 
in NEWSWATCH magazine last week, Gen. Mark accused the ruling 
council of having a hidden agenda and of planning to stay in 
power for another five years instead of one year as agreed 
before the coup. Since the coup, Gen. Mark has been retired 
early from the Armed Forces and is now living in London. When 
he came into the studio, Jeremy Skiss put it to him that he has 
gone public because of bitterness over the way he had been 
treated by his superiors. 
  [Begin recording] [Mark] That certainly is not true because 
I 
don't have to be bitter about it. I haven't said anything 
personal against Abacha or any other person in the 
administration. I have simply said we agreed on a program and 
they should release that program and follow it religiously. 
  [Skiss] So do you think you were retired because you were 
seen as an ally of General Babangida? You were one of 
Babangida's boys. 
  [Mark] Far from that; so was Abacha, if there is anything 
like that. Abacha was Babangida's right-hand man. But even if 
that is the case, why can't this administration come up with a 
timetable showing when they are going to hand over. They are 
working on a constitutional conference; they are going to elect 
people into that constitutional conference; they are going to 
accommodate the elected members in the constitutional conference 
in Abuja. They haven't built the houses in Abuja yet. You 
don't build a house overnight. Those who are going to be elected 
don't even know the format of the election yet and the 
constitutional conference is going to be designed to stay some 
time before they start. At the end of that constitutional 
conference, we are going to have an election. There is no 
program, so it is common sense to see the way it is going. It 
doesn't take a genius to understand that. 
  [Skiss] The government has criticized the interview you gave 
to NEWSWATCH in saying it's all part of a plot to destabilize 
the Abacha government. Would you agree with that? 
  [Mark] Nobody wants to do Abacha government that favor. It 
will be a favor to that administration to destabilize it. 
Nobody wants to do them that favor. They should be honorable 
enough to quit on their own. Nobody would like to do them that 
favor. 
  [Skiss] Now, since you gave the interview the editor of 
NEWSWATCH has been detained. What do you say to the Abacha 
government: Release him immediately? 
  [Mark] Well, this is the beginning of dictatorship and that 
is how dictators start. They start first by dealing with 
journalists. They are their first victims. I have accepted and 
I gave an interview. Nobody is challenging the contents of the 
interview I have given. People are skirting round it. The 
government is skirting round it. They haven't addressed one 
single issue that I raised in my interview because those were 
simple facts, the honest truth. 
  [Skiss] But the editor was arrested. Would you be willing to 
go back to Nigeria and swap places with the editor? 
  [Mark] I am going back on the 30th of May because my program 
here.... [pauses] I am going to finish what I have come to do by 
the 30th and I've booked a flight to go back. I certainly would 
not run away from Nigeria, I would be the last person to. 
  [Skiss] Some people would say that this interview is the 
beginning of your political career; your military career is now 
over; you are going to launch a political career. Is that right? 
  [Mark] I have no intention whatsoever of playing politics? I 
don't have that intention. 
  [Skiss] But you played politics before? 
  [Mark] I haven't. I have never played politics. 
  [Skiss] Well, when Abacha took over, that is what I call 
playing politics. 
  [Mark] Well, I am a patriotic Nigerian and I will go for 
anything that will ensure the goodness of that country so if 
what we did was barely to.... [pauses] I mean, was just to make 
sure that we got the best for Nigeria, if you call that 
politics, yes, but otherwise I have no desire whatsoever to go 
into politics. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Abdou Diouf by Assane Diop in </F>
Paris; date not given] 
  [Text] Many African heads of state have already expressed 
an opinion about what is going on in Rwanda. Senegalese 
President Abdou Diouf is visiting Paris. He told Assane Diop 
that he agrees with the Western intervention there. 
  [Begin recording] [Diouf] I favor the international 
community's stand against this violence and its attempt to stop 
it in order to allow political dialogue to start again under 
better circumstances. 
  [Diop] Do you think intervention by an international force 
sponsored by the United Nations, the OAU or a third country such 
as France is useful in situations like the one in Rwanda today? 
  [Diouf] I think it not only useful but absolutely necessary. 
It is necessary because it is obvious that those in charge on 
the spot cannot solve anything by themselves in the very short 
term. They must be helped to solve their problems. This is why I 
am in favor of an international solution. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] And as if the situation in the war zone in Sierra 
Leone was not confused enough, a new factor has emerged on the 
side of the government forces battling the RUF [Revolutionary 
United Front] rebels. Alhaji Koromah, whose ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia 
has been torn by splits between him and another faction based in 
Freetown, has now taken on the RUF as well as Nii Nartey Allison 
reports in this telex from Monrovia. 
  It was confirmed here today that ULIMO is engaged in 
fighting 
inside Sierra Leone against Foday Sankoh's rebels. ULIMO leader 
Alhaji Koromah said today that his forces, under the command of 
Loseni Yamah, have set up a command post at the Sierra Leone 
border and are advancing toward Kekema, 10 miles inside Sierra 
Leone. This, said Koromah, was to open a security corridor so 
that Liberian refugees in Kenema could return home. Koromah 
said: It is a full- scale operation, and we have informed the 
government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations of our battle 
in Sierra Leone. But the situation remains confused, because 
later today, the Lofa Defense Force, a new faction fighting 
ULIMO for control of Liberia's northern Lofa County, said here 
that their forces have successfully dislodged Koromah's units 
and have secured control of the territory stretching from the 
Saint Paul River Bridge bordering Lofa and Bong counties to the 
Foya District on the Sierra Leone-Guinea access. They boasted in 
a statement of being in control of the administrative seats of 
Voinjama and the towns of Golu, Salaye, Zosa, and Konia.

  [Text] Rwandans: As we have been telling you over the last 
few days, as some of you have indeed witnessed, the small group 
[words indistinct] killings starting from Kigali town. Many 
people have died and continue to die after this small group 
decided to liquidate the Tutsis and everyone else who does not 
agree with the ideas of the Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense of 
the Republic. 
  The small group of killers, as usual, believed that they 
would go on killing innocent people while citizens just stood 
by. The killers then came to realize that the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF], some government troops, and other Rwandans who do 
not want their country [word indistinct] had decided to resist. 
Some members of the small group among the Presidential Guard, 
Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi [pro-Habyarimana militias] have 
started fleeing after realizing that Rwandans were going to 
[words indistinct]. They are fleeing through Butare and Cyangugu. 
  Citizens, especially in Butare and Cyangugu areas and 
elsewhere [word indistinct], must unite to protect yourselves 
and fight the killers. The RPF combatants are on the outskirts 
of Kigali town and are determined to rout the small group. That 
should be the aim of all citizens. 
  We again thank government troops who have dissociated 
themselves from the Presidential Guards, thereby (?making it 
easier) to fight the latter. We also thank all Rwandans who 
have now identified their country's enemy and are joining hands 
with the RPF in Rwanda. We call on you to persevere on this 
course and hope that those who have not yet joined will do so 
soon. The RPF is with you. Continue to help one another to 
protect our country.

been killed since President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and 
Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed in a plane crash last 
Wednesday [6 April]. Fighting is reported to be going on in the 
city center and around the airport. 
  The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front based in the north of the 
country is reported to have confirmed that its fighters have 
reached the outskirts of Kigali. It said that the main 
objective is to fight the Presidential Guard, who are reported 
to be killing civilians, especially Tutsis. 
  Meanwhile, efforts to evacuate foreigners are continuing. 
Among those who have left Kigali are Asians, who have gone to 
Burundi and Kenya.

  [Text] Kigali, April 12 (AFP) -- There was heavy shooting 
Tuesday [12 April] morning in the Rwandan capital Kigali as 
rebel forces neared the capital, and departing French troops 
handed over the evacuation of foreigners to Belgium. The 
shooting was concentrated in the southern Gikondo area, 
according to Captain Eric Millet of the French Third Parachute 
Regiment. The shooting, now coming from the north, had earlier 
come in the east of the city where the rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) had a battalion of 600 men. "It is hard to tell if 
the forces shooting from the north are RPF reinforcements 
(advancing) from the position they held two days ago 15 
kilometres (nine miles) away, or if the rebels in the east have 
repositioned themselves," Millet added. 
  On Tuesday the French Embassy had completely closed down, 
adding to the sense of panic among Rwandans trying to escape the 
fighting. the troops, sent to help the now completed evacuation 
of French nationals, said they would leave as soon as control 
over the city's remaining foreign population had been handed 
over to Belgian forces. 
  More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from Kigali by 
air 
to date, the French troops said. The remaining foreign 
nationals, waiting at the French school, were to be brought to 
the airport in a convoy. A group of about 50 Rwandans who had 
sought refuge in the French embassy were brought to the airport 
Tuesday morning in a convoy of trucks. Their breakfast plates 
were still lying on the tables of the deserted embassy, whose 
doors had been left open. 
  "Everyone has left," confirmed the branch chief of Kigali's 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Philippe 
Gaillard, who had placed sand bags around the ICRC offices in 
preparation for the fighting to come.

  [Text] [Announcer] How close are the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] rebels to Kigali? Linda Dewin put this question to 
the RPF representative in Brussels, James Ruego. 
  [Ruego] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is 2 km from the 
capital. There is information of two battalions of 4,000 
soldiers each. 
  [Dewin] Why are you not attacking? 
  [Ruego] Foreigners are still being evacuated, and the RPF 
promised that it would allow them to leave and to be evacuated. 
  [Dewin] Is that not risky? Can the RPF continue waiting? 
  [Ruego] We want the evacuation to be finished. I have heard, 
and this is very encouraging, that all foreigners might be gone 
from here within the next 24 hours.

  [Text] Kampala, 12 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels Tuesday [12 
April] said their forces had entered the capital, Kigali, and 
were about to join a batallion of 600 fellow fighters surrounded 
by government troops in the city. "Our forces are now within 
eyeshot of the place where our 600-strong unit is," said 
Christine Umutoni, spokeswoman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front 
(RPF) office in Uganda. 
  She told AFP that RPF forces were not in a hurry to take 
Kigali and would move slowly to avoid massive destruction of the 
city. Many government troops were deserting and joining rebel 
forces, she claimed. Umutoni said RPF was "suspicious" of the 
French soldiers who had gone to Kigali to help evacuate 
foreigners. "They are showing signs of wanting to stay around 
and help this murderous regime," Umutoni said. 
  Some 500 French soldiers flew into Kigali over the weekend 
to 
ensure the safe evacuation of the 600-odd French citizens in 
Rwanda. Umutoni complained the French troops were not leaving 
although the rescue mission had been completed. 
  Reports from Kigali said the interim government left the 
Kigali hotel where it had taken up residence for an unknown 
destination as shooting intensified in several areas around the 
city.

  [Text] If a Rwandan human rights organization in Brussels 
is to be believed, the killing of members of the opposition and 
looting spread today to the southwest of the country, in 
particular to the Cyangugu region, which is a town on the border 
with Zaire. 
  As for Zaire, the ambassador of Zaire in Brussels says that 
calm reigns throughout the whole country, especially in Goma, 
another border town, this time on Lake Kivu near the Rwandan 
town of Gisenyi. Nearly 1,000 refugees have poured into the 
town in the last few days, including 900 expatriates. These 
refugees are regarded as guests by the Zairean Government, the 
ambassador says.

  [Text] Kigali, 12 Apr (AFP) -- Rwanda's interim government 
this morning left the Hotel de Kigali, where it had taken up 
residence, for an unknown destination, thereby causing panic in 
the city. Shooting intensified in various districts by midday 
leading to speculations that rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
reinforcements from the north may have joined those already in 
the capital. However, there is no reliable information about 
the exact location of the front.

<F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Fighting has continued in Rwanda today, five 
days after clashes first broke out in the wake of the plane 
crash which killed President Habyarimana. A force of RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] fighters has been advancing on the 
capital and fighting has also been reported between the RPF and 
government troops in some northern districts. [passage omitted] 
  UNAMIR, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, has clearly had 
little success in brokering a cease-fire between the RPF and the 
government. Both the Presidential Guard and the gendarmes have 
been involved in clashes with the rebels. And today the United 
Nations began to withdraw some of its military police from the 
country. On the line to Kigali, Robin White asked UN spokesman 
(Mokthar Guei) what they have been doing to bring about a 
cease-fire today. 
  [(Guei)] Well, indeed over the past five days, we have been 
trying to bring the two parties together to agree to a 
cease-fire. Our efforts are continuing, not very successul, but 
we have not given up any hope to bring them back to relaunch the 
stalled peace process. 
  [White] Why is it you cannot stop the fighting in the 
capital? 
  [(Guei)] Well, our mandate is not to impose the peace. We 
are here to assist. It is up to the parties to stop the 
fighting. 
  [White] How much fighting is actually going on in the 
capital 
today? 
  [(Guei)] Well, as all the other days, very intermittent. 
Sometimes very, very intense and sometimes very light. All 
types of arms, we understand, are being used: light machine 
guns, shellings, mortars, [words indistinct]. 
  [White] Are you yourself beginning to get frightened? 
  [(Guei)] I have no comment on that.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, 12 Apr (AFP)--Rwanda's interim prime 
minister said his government was ready to comply with 
eight-month-old peace accords to end the ethnic warfare in the 
country provided there was no "cheating." "We see no reason to 
start negotiations from scratch," despite the fighting between 
government forces and rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF), Prime Minister Jean Kambanda told AFP late Monday [11 
April]. "We want a truce that would allow us to open overall 
negotiations on a ceasefire, then political negotiations," he 
said. 
  The RPF has refused to recognize the interim government 
which 
it says has only members opposed to the rebels. Rebel 
reinforcements Monday were reported to have advanced to the 
outskirts of the city amid fresh fighting in the capital as UN 
commanders tried to secure a truce between the two sides. 
  Kambanda said he saw no problem with provisions in the peace 
accord signed last August in Arusha, Tanzania, that gave the RPF 
five ministers and 11 deputies, saying he felt divisions among 
political parties and "individual initiatives" of certain 
leaders had prevented implementation of the accord. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kambanda, a member of the main opposition group the 
Democratic Republican Movement, said certain political leaders, 
including ministers, had "tried to keep out members of their own 
parties in favor of the RPF" in talks on the transition 
government. "People's frustrations built up, and exploded in 
the rage triggered by the death of the head of state," he said. 
  Kambanda said one of the obstacles to a truce to end the 
latest bloodletting was the RPF's demand to negotiate directly 
with the Army and not with the interim government. 
  The interim government, most of whose members are staying in 
a hotel in the capital Kigali, also has "questions" about how 
the 600 RPF troops who arrived in Kigali obtained heavy weapons, 
he said. Kambanda said they were only to be armed under treaty 
provisions with light weapons for their mission to ensure 
protection of RPF leaders in the capital. One member of the 
government said the RPF Monday destroyed an Army tank "with a 
rocket they were not supposed to have." 
  Some Hutu politicians have viewed Belgium as pro-Tutsi, but 
Kambanda has refused to join in their accusations that the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda -- which includes Ghanaians and 
Bangladeshi troops along with the Belgians -- did not correctly 
monitor RPF troops or that Belgium supplied the rebels with 
arms. [passage omitted] 
  Kambanda would not confirm reports that Habyarimana's plane 
was shot down, but he said he had "just learned" that Rwandan 
Army troops prevented UN soldiers from examining the plane and 
he would "negotiate with the Army to resolve this problem."

  [Text] Recent foreign media broadcasts referring to a 
cease-fire agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
and the government are unfounded. The RPF cannot sign an 
agreement with a government it does not recognize. 
  The so-called government is null and void politically and 
legally. The clique calling itself a coalition of parties which 
were part of the previous government actively comprises 
individuals jointly motivated by a desire to divide Rwandans. 
The government comprises the small group of people who fought 
the Arusha agreement and did everything possible to ensure it 
was scrapped. 
  The RPF cannot hold talks with the clique, which does not 
recognize the Arusha agreements. As far as the RPF is 
concerned, there is no government in Rwanda. It does not even 
recognize the man who calls himself president of the Republic 
after being installed unlawfully. He has said himself that he 
was installed as president under Article 42 of the Constitution 
of 10 February 1991. He says so himself. However, he well knows 
that the article is no longer valid. The president of the 
Republic had been sworn in under the peace agreement and was to 
have been replaced in accordance with the same agreement. The 
agreement stipulates that the president of the Republic is to be 
replaced by the president of the transitional broad-based 
National Assembly. Theodore Sindikubgabo is only president of 
the National Development Counci [CND], which is now irrelevant. 
His government cannot hold talks with the RPF. It is not a 
government of Rwandans but a clique with Coalition for the 
Defense of the Republic [CDR] ideas which conflict with the 
Arusha agreements. It is a government that has not been 
recognized by a single foreign country. Even international 
radios call it the CDR. 
  [Words indistinct] the United Nations has not recognized it. 
The so-called government cannot hold talks with the RPF, because 
it has exterminated the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana. 
  A close look shows that the government is made up of a 
clique 
which usurped power by shedding blood. What it did is no 
different from a coup d'etat. It has been said on several 
occasions that the clique wanted to replace the government with 
another which would oppose the RPF. To install such a 
government they first had to kill all their opponents in the 
government, which they did. 
  What also exposes their plan was killing Felicien Ngango, 
who 
was to have become president of the broad-based National 
Assembly and would therefore have replaced the president of the 
Republic. They made it even clearer with the death of Joseph 
Kavaruganda, the president of the Constitutional Court, who was 
empowered to swear in the individual who would have replaced the 
president of the Republic and his friends. 
  The clique had always nursed its plan of capturing power, 
but 
failed to obtain the ways and means to carry it out. They found 
a way through the death of President Habyarimana, which the 
clique must have paved the way for so as to bring to realization 
the objectives of those who called themselves power. [as heard] 
That is why some conclude that what was done was no different 
from a coup d'etat, as there are killings causing tears. Over 
10,000 have already died. The government is still cooperating 
with the killers although it [words indistinct] part of its 
program. That is why the RPF must fight the clique until 
dictatorship and division are disposed of in Rwanda. 
  The RPF decided to resume fighting for three main reasons: 
First, to support the RPF combatants in the CND compound, who 
have been and continue being attacked by the Presidential Guard. 
Second, to stop the killings of innocent people. Third, to 
restore peace in the country. 
  The RPF continues to implement its goals. In fact, the RPF 
has entered the outskirts of Kigali. It is fighting the 
Presidential Guards and their supporters. That is why it asks 
all citizens to support the RPF combatants [words indistinct] 
and that if they see them they should know they are coming to 
rout Rwanda's enemies. 
  We call on government soldiers who do not support the clique 
to support the RPF combatants. The UN Assistance Mission to 
Rwanda's contribution is also necessary. They should avoid the 
clique's traps, especially by refraining from bringing the RPF 
leaders messages from the clique. This is not a clique to hold 
talks with, but one to be fought by all Rwandans. If we unite, 
we shall get rid of it.

  [Text] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels have sent 
troops to Kigali. This morning, Farida Ayari managed to get 
through to one RPF official, Emile Roua Massirabo. He is in 
Kampala, Uganda. She asked him whether his movement was 
considering negotiations with the interim government set up in 
Kigali: 
  [Begin Massirabo recording] We hold this government 
responsible for everything that is happening at the moment. 
When one sees who is included in this government, one can 
easily see that this is the most extremist gang in Rwandan 
politics. Let us take the example of the incumbent interior 
minister, Faustin Munyazesa. You may have heard of what was 
called the death squad. He is a member of this death squad. He 
was cited in the international commission for human rights' 
report during the Buguesera massacre. 
  How can you expect us to negotiate with people who are 
behind 
these killings? How can you negotiate with people who, over the 
last two or three days, slaughtered more than 10,000 people? It 
is beyond anything you can imagine. What they are doing now is 
marching on Kigali as quickly as possible and trying to save 
what can be saved. [end recording]

  [Text] Kampala, 11 Apr (AFP) -- A Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF) spokeswoman in Uganda on Monday [11 April] refuted claims 
by a Rwandan pro-Hutu extremist group that its chairman and 
military commander had been killed. "The rumour is a work of 
the CDR [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] just to give 
morale to the Rwandan Army...It is totally untrue, it is just a 
work of a clique of people in Kigali who may be trying to 
disorganise our camp, Christine Umutoni, a member of the 
Political Bureau of the RPF, told AFP. 
  The radio of the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic 
(CDR), a pro-Hutu extremist movement fiercely opposed to the 
incorporation of the mainly Tutsi RPF in the Rwandan Government, 
had earlier Monday reported that RPF commander Paul Kagame and 
Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe had been killed in a power struggle 
within the movement. 
  Umutoni said she had contacted the RPF High Command in 
Rwanda 
at 8.00 A.M (5.00 GMT) on Monday morning and was informed that 
rebel forces were advancing towards the Rwandan capital and were 
now at Kabuye, eight kilometers (five miles) from Kigali. She 
could not tell when they will storm the capital where ethnic 
warfare continues to rage since the death of the Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart in a 
suspect plane crash on Wednesday. "We have not encountered any 
significant resistance on the battle front," Umutoni said.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ministry of National Defense; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] After hearing the lies spread by Radio Muhabura, the 
Ministry of National Defense informs Rwandans and the Rwandan 
Armed Forces of the following: 
  1. All Rwandans, the entire Rwandan Armed Forces -- that is 
the Army and the Gendarmerie -- are called upon not to believe 
the lies broadcast by Radio Muhabura which are meant to divide 
Rwandans and their Armed Forces. 
  2. Radio Muhabura is spreading lies saying that the Akazu 
[Habyarimana, his relatives, and close friends] forces are 
killing the Nduga [Hutus from the south] and other people whose 
opinions differ from those of the Republican National Movement 
for Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic. The words are baseless and are only geared 
towards dividing Rwandans into two. They are saying that some 
are Kiga [Habyarimana's Hutu subclan] while others are Nduga so 
that they do not unite and so that the enemy can take over the 
country. The tricks of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have 
been known to Rwandans for a long time. 
  3. Radio Muhabura is consistently lying that the soldiers 
who guarded his excellency the president of the Republic started 
the war and that other Army units stopped assisting them. This 
lie is also not surprising since lying is one of the 
characteristics of the RPF. Soldiers, gendarmes, and all 
Rwandans have decided to fight their common enemy, who they have 
all identified, together. The enemy is still the same. He is 
the one who has always been trying to return the overthrown 
monarch. 
  4. The Ministry of Defense calls on Rwandans, soldiers, and 
gendarmes to do the following: Citizens are asked to act 
together, to carry out patrols, and to fight the enemy. 
Citizens are asked to support their Armed Forces by showing 
them the location of the enemy. The Armed Forces are asked to 
continue to carry out their duties by protecting our country and 
its citizens. Rwandans and the Rwandan Armed Forces are called 
upon not to listen to the lies of Radio Muhabura and other 
radios which spread RPF news, as this is meant to divide 
Rwandans and to cause fear. It is really sad to see how the 
rebels are sending the youth to the war front, trying 
unsuccessfully to fight a war they cannot win and believing that 
they can capture the country. That is just a dream, as all 
Rwandans are alert.

in violation of the country's constitution and other known 
agreements related to the formation of a government. [passage

  The MDR calls on the group of soldiers and their supporters 
who are [words indistinct] not to plunge the country into an 
abyss of endless misery. If these people aim to preserve their 
personal interests, they should know that this is no longer 
possible since the current times and the country cannot accept 
it. They should abandon the policies of (?selfishness) and 
adopt the policy of multipartyism, since it is the one accepted 
by the Arusha agreement.

  [Text] Concerning the repatriation of the expatriate 
community in Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the 
UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] today signed an 
agreement to make the repatriation operations easier. Here is a 
summary of the agreement in three points: 
  1. The beginning of hostilities between RPF combatants and 
soldiers of the presidential guard led to some foreign countries 
asking for their nationals to be evacuated from Rwanda. 
  2. The RPF commits itself to facilitating the evacuation 
operation as long as the following conditions are respected: 
  A. The evacuation operation will last 48 hours as of 
0700 on 12 April. 
B. Foreign troops charged with carrying out the evacuation 
operations will be organized in convoys and accompanied by 
UNAMIR observers. 
C. UNAMIR will inform the RPF, at least one hour 
beforehand, of the distances to be covered and the itinerary to 
be followed by the convoys, and also the approximate duration of 
the various operations. 
D. The RPF will authorize the passage of convoys under its 
control and will stop fighting along the axes used by the same 
convoys. 
E. UNAMIR will verify that these RPF conditions are 
respected and will report the slightest incident to the RPF in 
the shortest possible time. 
  3. At the end of the evacuation of the expatriate 
community, foreign troops who are not members of the UNAMIR will 
have a period of 12 hours to leave the country. It is UNAMIR's 
duty to inform the foreign troops deployed in Rwanda for 
evacuation operations that they must respect the terms of the 
agreement. 
  The agreement, whose contents have just been read, was 
signed 
between the RPF and UNAMIR today. Seth Sendashonga, youth and 
culture minister in the broad-based transitional government 
signed on behalf of the RPF and Major General Romeo Dallaire 
signed on behalf of UNAMIR.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Gui Polspoel in Kigali by Jan </F>
Becaus in Brussels within a "special" newscast on the situation 
in Rwanda -- live] 
  [Text] [Becaus] And we return to the crisis in Rwanda, 
ladies and gentlemen. If all goes well, I will now have my 
colleague Gui Polspoel on the line from Kigali. Gui, do you 
hear me? 
  [Polspoel] I hear you loud and clear, Jan. 
  [Becaus] Where are you at this very moment, Gui? 
  [Polspoel] I am on the tarmac at the airport where we landed 
some 10 minutes ago aboard a C-130 of the Belgian Air Force. 
  [Becaus] What is going on there? 
  [Polspoel] Mostly military movements. The C-130s are still 
shuttling between Nairobi and Kigali, flying in military 
equipment inlcuding trucks, jeeps, and so on, because only then 
can the Belgians start their operation. The go-ahead for that 
rests with the Rwandan authorities who thus far have not 
permitted them to leave the airport. The French can leave, but 
the Belgians must remain in place. Negotiations are continuing. 
  [Becaus] Can you judge from there how the evacuation is 
proceeding? 
  [Polspoel] It is being carried out reasonably well, but 
mainly with the French, who can pick up people in town. A 
flight with 75 people onboard left for Nairobi, Kenya some 30 
minutes ago. The passengers will be flown back from Nairobi to 
Belgium probably on board two Belgian Air Force planes, actually 
passenger planes, which are waiting at Nairobi airport. Most of 
those 75 are Belgians, but we do not have the exact information 
on their identities. 
  [Becaus] If I understand it well, Gui, the Belgian military 
is still inactive at this very moment? 
  [Polspoel] Yes, that is correct. Obviously they are helping 
the refugees arriving at the airport, but they have not been 
permitted real operations in the town or outside the airport yet. 
  [Becaus] Can you hear, from where you are, hostilities in or 
around Kigali? 
  [Polspoel] No. Last night, however, the Air Force people 
told us that when they left here around 1800, there was heavy 
shooting in this neighborhood. 
  [Becaus] Well, thanks Gui Polspoel. We will certainly hear 
from you later in our next newscast.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] About 250 Belgian citizens left 
Kigali for Nairobi in Kenya today on board Hercules C-130 
aircraft of the Belgian Air Force. So the operation to evacuate 
Belgians from Rwanda -- there are about 1,500 of them -- really 
has started, although fighting continues in the capital of 
Rwanda between the regular army and the troops of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front. Francois Riquemont, our special correspondent 
in Rwanda, has just arrived in Kigali, and here are his first 
impressions: 
  [Begin recording] [Riquemont] The first Belgian refugees 
left 
Kigali Airport early this afternoon for Nairobi. There must be 
about 250 of them who have already left Rwanda. In general the 
people arriving here are very calm, even if they have been 
through a lot in the last few days in the town. They are calm, 
and everything is going peacefully and without panic. People 
are saying that as soon as the French paratroops and then the 
Belgians arrived they felt much safer, even if many of them were 
threatened and had to take refuge in somewhat safer places 
before leaving for the airport in convoy. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So how are the convoys going? 
  [Riquemont] It is known that the Belgians have in a way been 
caught in a trap. They were unable to leave by road, since the 
Belgian convoy was forced to turn back, and the Belgians in the 
convoys of foreigners were made to get out of the cars and they 
were stopped from getting through. So in the end convoys were 
arranged under very strong escort. There have been no incidents 
with these Belgian convoys, except for one, where there were 
serious threats, and stones were thrown, but nothing very 
serious. I must also tell you that the people we have spoken to 
here are worried about leaving, and also worried about the 
Rwandans they know and about the future, what they expect their 
future to be. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any idea about the scale of the 
fighting that has and is taking place in Kigali? 
  [Riquemont] There is total anarchy in the town. We haven't 
been able to get into the town ourselves, but we have had many 
very reliable and consistent accounts. There is anarchy. There 
is still serious fighting, even if it is sporadic, between the 
Rwandan Army, the regular army, especially the Presidential 
Guard, and the rebels, or former rebels, of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] On the subject of the RPF troops, is it just 
rumor that they are close to the capital, Kigali, or is this 
well grounded information? 
  [Riquemont] They are close to Kigali. We don't know how far. 
From what we have been told, they are waiting before entering 
the town. [end recording] 
  That was Francois Riquemont, with whom we spoke by telephone 
just before this program.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Belgian paratroopers in the 
Rwandan capital Kigali have escorted the last 50 Belgians in the 
city to the airport. Some 1,000 Belgians remain in the rest of 
the country. The paratroopers will first attempt to safeguard 
the people in the southern part of Rwanda. The expatriates will 
be flown to Zaventum via Nairobi, Kenya.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Michel Marlaud, French ambassador to </F>
Rwanda, by Christophe Boisbouvier in Kigali on 11 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Marlaud] We have evacuated 617 expatriates so far. 
This is last night's figure. Another 89 were evacuated this 
morning, and a third convoy is on its way to the airport. 
  [Boisbouvier] Are these expatriates of different 
nationalities? 
  [Marlaud] They are of different nationalities. Of course, 
most of them are French nationals, but there are also Belgians, 
Canadians, nationals from Oman, Indians, nationals from 
Mauritius, several nationalities including, of course, nationals 
from almost all European Union countries such as Greeks and 
Germans, a wide- ranging number of nationalities. 
  [Boisbouvier] What about the numerous Belgians who are still 
here? 
  [Marlaud] The Belgians have now arrived in Kigali. As far as 
we are concerned, we will continue to include Belgian nationals 
in our evacuation plan. There is a significant number of 
Belgian nationals in the convoy which is on its way to the 
airport. I believe that the Belgians who are arriving will 
gradually take care of their own nationals. 
  [Boisbouvier] Will any French nationals be left in Rwanda 
after the evacuations? 
  [Marlaud] There is a number of French nationals who, if need 
be, could decide to stay in Rwanda although the Foreign Ministry 
has strongly encouraged our nationals to leave this country, but 
we cannot compel those who do not want to leave to do so. 
  [Boisbouvier] Have you got an example? 
  [Marlaud] There are a number of priests and nuns who 
sometimes refuse to be evacuated despite our advice and despite 
the help we are ready to give them. Moreover, the embassy 
remains open for the time being. 
  [Boisbouvier] Do you intend to evacuate all diplomatic staff 
at the end of the evacuation operation? 
  [Marlaud] The embassy is open for the time being. As long as 
no other decision is made, it will remain open. 
  [Boisbouvier] What is the mission of the French force in 
Kigali now? Is it only to carry out the evacuation, or is it 
also to maintain order at the airport and in other sensitive 
zones? 
  [Marlaud] The mission of the French forces is to ensure the 
safety of French nationals and other nationals who wish to leave 
Rwanda. 
  [Boisbouviere] Nothing else? 
  [Marlaud] This is the mission that was given to them. I 
believe that this was said in Paris quite clearly. 
  [Boisbouvier] Did many French nationals die? 
  [Marlaud] Well, apart from the crew of the presidential 
plane, one death has been confirmed. 
  [Boisbouvier] That of a white father in southern Rwanda? 
  [Marlaud] Yes, but please allow me not to give too many 
details because I am always wary of the closest relatives 
hearing about it before they have been told directly. I would 
rather not elaborate. 
  [Boisbouvier] There has been talk of a cease-fire in the 
country between the government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front 
[RPF] rebels, for 24 hours. What is the situation this Monday 
at noon? 
  [Marlaud] There are still on-going talks between the 
government and the RPF. The UN Mission in Rwanda is acting as a 
go-between. No agreement on a cease-fire has been reached so far. 
  [Boisbouvier] Do you think that it will be possible to reach 
an agreement over the next few hours, given the conditions 
demanded by the two sides? 
  [Marlaud] The Rwandan government called for a cease-fire 
right away. So far, the RPF has rejected it. It remains to be 
seen whether the RPF will finally agree to this cease-fire 
throughout the country. 
  [Boisbouvier] The Rwandan government, which was appointed a 
few days ago, has been denounced by some as a government with a 
hard line against the RPF. What do you think about that? 
  [Marlaud] As far as the replacement of President Habyarimana 
is concerned, the new interim head of state is the former 
speaker of the National Assembly. This is in keeping with the 
provisions of the former Rwandan constitution and with the 
provisions of the Arusha agreement. The sharing out of 
ministries and ministerial posts between the political parties 
has remained the same as it was as far as the sharing out of 
power provided for by the Arusha agreements is concerned. As 
for the political balance of power within this government, 
everybody can judge it differently. 
  [Boisbouvier] If there is a cease-fire tomorrow, do you 
think 
that a political agreement in the spirit of the Arusha 
agreements is still possible after all that has happened over 
the last few days? 
  [Marlaud] What is certain is that there is no solution to 
Rwanda's problems if there is no reconciliation, if people are 
not able to work and live together. The Arusha agreements were 
an effort in that direction and it is the only way out of the 
Rwandan crisis.

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France closed its embassy 
in the Rwandan capital Kigali Tuesday [12 April] as hundreds of 
foreigners fleeing tribal warfare in the central African nation 
arrived in France, officials said. 
  A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Ambassador 
Jean-Michel Marlaud had left Kigali and was on his way to 
Bangui, Central Africa. 
  The ministry said the ambassador had been asked to close the 
embassy in Kigali, given the "deterioration of the situation" in 
Rwanda. 
  French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin meanwhile met 474 
French, German and American evacuees from Kigali at Paris' 
Roissy airport early Tuesday. 
  Those on board the Air France Boeing 747, which arrived via 
Nairobi, included the Marlaud's wife and Jean-Yves Pare, French 
commercial attache in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi. 
  Pare said the French embassy's archives in Kigali had been 
totally destroyed during the violence between the country's 
majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. 
  "I have lived through the longest five days of my life in 
Kigali," Pare said. "Shots were coming from every direction. 
Overnight Thursday, my house was hit twice by gunfire." 
  The Belgian Defence Ministry also announced Tuesday that 
nearly 400 evacuees, mainly Belgians, had arrived at Brussels 
airport Tuesday from Nairobi. 
  They were flown in on two planes, one carrying 195 people -- 
186 Belgians and nine people of other nationalities and another 
carrying 204 people, 158 of them Belgian. 
  It said a total of 446 Belgians had fled Rwanda, a former 
Belgian colony, and about 1,000 others remained behind. It was 
impossible to know how many of those wanted to be evacuated, the 
ministry said. 
  Late Monday French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said all but 
a "very small number" of French nationals had left Rwanda. 
  A ministry spokesman said Tuesday that "a very small number 
of French nationals had chosen to remain in Rwanda." They were 
mainly priests and nuns. 
  Earlier on Tuesday, 205 evacuees from Rwanda, including 94 
Rwandan orphans, were also flown into Roissy on a French 
airforce Airbus. 
  According to the Belgian Defence Ministry, the Belgian 
evacuation operation, being conducted by Belgian troops, should 
be completed within three or four days. Belgians made up the 
largest group of foreign nationals in Rwanda, with more than 
1,500 living there. 
  Another flight from Nairobi, carrying 400 people, was 
expected in Brussels early Tuesday afternoon. 
  In Paris, meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said two flights 
from Bangui were expected later Tuesday carrying about 55 French 
nationals and 30 people of other nationalities.

  [Text] Despite all the appeals, nothing seems to be able to 
put an end to the fighting and slaughter in Rwanda. However, 
the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] is hoping to 
increase the number of its staff in Kigali, but it also fears 
that the work of its staff will become increasingly difficult in 
the capital. (Daniel Oxberger) is the ICRC delegate: 
  [Begin recording] [Oxberger] Unfortunately, the situation 
has 
worsened this evening. I take this opportunity to call on all 
Rwandans to respect the actions of the Red Cross, its 
humanitarian work, and to enable its staff to work. We are 
trying to help all civilians who are the victims of the 
conflict. The situation is extremely worrying today in Kigali, 
where we have lost count of the number of wounded and dead. 
Unfortunately, our work has become extremely difficult over the 
last few hours. It is important to repeat the need to respect 
the neutrality of the ICRC delegates who are trying to evacuate 
the numerous wounded people in town. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Has the ICRC already decided, 
whatever happens, to leave its staff on the ground? 
  [Oxberger] If need be, we are going to call all delegates 
back to the ICRC headquarters in Kigali and, should the 
situation deteriorate further, we would consider other measures. 
For the time being, far from withdrawing, the ICRC is even 
increasing the number of its staff. As I speak, five medical 
staff are flying to Bujumbura and we are hoping that they will 
arrive in Kigali tomorrow morning if the roads are still open.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 10 Apr (AFP)--The Zairian President 
Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko has just sent his special adviser in 
charge of security, Mr. Honore Ngbanda Nzambo-Ko-Atumba, to 
speak to his Kenyan, Ugandan and Tanzanian counterparts, it was 
learned from a source close to the presidency of the Republic. 
  The Zairian head of state is supposed to ask his 
counterparts 
"to cooperate and not worsen the situation " in Rwanda and 
Burundi, the same source said, adding that Marshal Mobutu "asked 
the Kenyan, Ugandan, and Tanzanian leaders to jointly make the 
necessary efforts to curb the violence prevailing in Rwanda and 
Burundi." 
  On 8 April, Mr. Mobutu asked for the setting up of an 
international investigation mission that would identify the 
authors of the attack that claimed the lives of his Rwandan and 
Burundian counterparts at the Kigali airport on 6 April. He 
also offered to receive the family and relatives of late 
President Juvenal Habyarimana.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 9 Apr (AFP) -- Zairean television reported 
today that the constitutional act to govern institutions in 
Zaire for the 15-month transitional period leading to the Third 
Republic was promulgated yesterday by the head of state, Marshal 
Mobutu Sese Seko. The act was formally adopted on 8 April 
during the closing ceremony of the extraordinary session of the 
High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT). 
The act had been the subject of a heated debate between the 
presidential and opposition groups, concerning the method for 
appointing the prime minister during the transition period. 
  This act essentially defines the relationship between the 
government and the president of the Republic, and gives the 
HCR-PT the power to check on government actions. It fixes the 
duration of the transitional period at 15 months, during which a 
constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative 
elections are to be organized. According to the act, the powers 
of the government have been strengthened, whereby they receive 
effective control of the Central Bank and the security forces. 
The head of state, who remains supreme commander of the Army, 
has had his powers reduced, especially when it comes to 
appointing high-ranking civil servants. Such appointments 
henceforth are made "at the government's proposal." 
  The prime minister is presented by the political group to 
which the head of state does not belong, after consultations 
with the political class. The political class is given a 10-day 
grace period within which to make this appointment. After this 
period, the HCR-PT is expected to take the matter up and find 
the ways and means to resolve the issue.

  [Text] Kishasa, 9 Apr (AFP) -- Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo 
Passinya, president of the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) in Zaire, announced 
yesterday that an agreement was reached on the procedure for the 
appointment of a prime minister, who will no longer be elected 
by the HCR-PT or the head of state. This announcement was made 
during the closing ceremony of the extraordinary session of 
parliament in the presence of the diplomatic corps. The two 
political groups, comprising pro-Mobutu and anti-Mobutu 
movements, will have 10 days, from the day the head of state 
promulgates the constitutional act, to appoint a prime minister. 
  According to the prelate, quoting the transition 
constitutional act, the appointment by the head of state will 
then only be an official recognition of this appointment, and at 
the end of the process the HCR-PT will endorse the prime 
minister, its government, and its program. "It is now up to 
politicians to accord their tune very well. If they need the 
mediation of the standing committee of the HCR-PT, the committee 
will take care of that, but it is not the parliament's duty to 
interfere in the internal affairs of political groups," 
Monsignor Monsengwo stated. 
  The extraordinary session of the HCR-PT is expected to form 
a 
new standing committee of the HCR, which will include former 
National Assembly members, to amend the act on constitutional 
provisions concerning the transition period, and to draw 
standing orders from the transition parliament.

  [Text] Brussels, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Zairean radical 
opposition abroad today in Brussels rejected the recent adoption 
of a new constitutional act, and accused Monsignor Laurent 
Monsengwo, the president of the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-TP) of "betrayal." 
  The "Committee of Zairean Opposition of Forces in Favor of 
Change" (COZAFAC), whose delegates from France, Germany, the 
United States, and Belgium met yesterday in Brussels, observed 
in a communique that Monsignor Monsengwo "betrayed the people by 
selling out the achievements of the Sovereign National 
Conference." The COZAFAC called on the Zairean opposition to 
reconstitute themselves around Etienne Tshisekedi, elected prime 
minister by the national conference in August 1992 and dismissed 
by Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko in January 1993. 
  The HCR-PT on 31 March adopted a new "constitutional act," 
which is supposed to govern the democratic transitional period 
in Zaire toward a Third Republic. On 8 April, Monsignor 
Monsengwo announced that an agreement was reached on the 
procedure for the appointment of a future prime minister.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 8 Apr (AFP)--The installations of a 
private cellular telephone company, which has for many years 
replaced Kinshasa's public communications system, was the target 
of "sabotage" by an eight-man commando unit, according to 
reliable sources in the Zairian capital. 
  The commando unit attacked TELECEL's antennae field, located 
in central Kinshasa, and cut communication cables, rendering 
stations inoperative. In a press release, the company said that 
it would not be capable of providing service until further 
notice. The "sabotage" came 24 hours after a meeting to discuss 
frequency allocation between the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications and enterprises hoping to use the 
telecommunications network.

  [Text] When the talks resume in Lusaka, the electoral 
process will certainly be concluded. The National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] says there should be an 
amendment in the electoral law and a change in the composition 
of the National Electoral Council. It wants a more active role 
by the United Nations and UNITA in this organ. Jorge Alicerces 
Valentim, UNITA information secretary and chief negotiator, says 
on the issue: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] The UNITA delegation has prepared 
and delivered to the UN representative a document containing its 
views on the conclusion of the electoral process, which are an 
innovation in that they give the United Nations the right to 
help the electoral commission prepare for the election. There 
is also the need to alter the electoral law concerning the 
counting of votes at the polling booths, and to ensure 
significant UNITA participation in all the electoral process. 
When we talk of elections, we are assuming there will be peace 
in Angola. Afterward, can the elections be held. [end recording] 
  Paradoxically in Angola, the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party has intensified its air raids 
against civilian targets. 
  [Begin Valentim recording] However, while we are preparing 
peace in Lusaka, very alarming reports from Huambo say that 
yesterday as of 1000 [0900 GMT] there were massive air raids 
against the city of Huambo, in which dozens of people died and a 
number of houses were completely destroyed. The government 
aircraft dropped every kind of bomb on Huambo residents. We 
believe that this intensification of war in Angola does not meet 
the wishes of the Angolan people or the expectations of the 
international community. 
  The UNITA delegation once more reiterates that it is willing 
to continue with the talks. It will remain in Lusaka, but it 
appeals to the international community, the UN Security Council, 
and observer countries to firmly condemn this intensification of 
war and the government's air raids. [end recording]

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks, which went into recess last 
week, are likely to resume tomorrow. This has been diclosed by 
Conde [as heard], assistant to UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye. That UN official also said that there is no 
danger that the talks might collapse. He expressed concern, 
however, about continuing military clashes in general, and in 
particular about bombardments by the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola- Labor Party, MPLA-PT air force against 
cities controlled by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, UNITA. 
  It is noteworthy that the team led by Faustino Muteka, which 
surprisingly left the Zambian capital last week, has now been 
back in Lusaka since yesterday. When the Angolan peace talks 
resume tomorrow, they will be focusing on the issue of the 
second round of presidential elections. This has been disclosed 
by a UN source quoted by the Portuguese Broadcasting 
Corporation, RDP. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim 
has 
said today that the second round of presidential elections will 
depend on three indispensable factors of a material, 
psychological, and political nature. He noted that the second 
round of presidential elections will be held when the country 
has achieved stability and the administrative sector is ready to 
provide equal service to all people, irrespective of where they 
may live or the party they support. It is necessary that the 
people experience security so that all political parties can go 
openly about their political work. 
  For the second round of presidential elections, UNITA is 
demanding that the former National Electoral Council, CNE, be 
scrapped. UNITA has also demanded parity with the government in 
the future CNE.

can implement its resolutions. 
  [Begin Moura recording] We have been observing that [words

[UNITA] is solely to blame for the crisis facing our country. 
This being the case, the UN Security Council should be able to

Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT], backed by mercenaries, must stop doing so, unless 
they want to see their interests set ablaze. This warning comes 
from the Armed Forces Command of the National Union for the

been closely following the concentration of troops and 
logistical equipment in Cabinda to carry out attacks on Soyo. 
The source said the situation still remains under control.

  [Text] At least 2,000 Angolan civilians and troops have 
been killed in UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola]-held Soyo since a government offensive began there 
three weeks ago. Witnesses from neighboring Cabinda, where many 
Soyo residents have fled, said the Angolan Air Force began 
bombing UNITA positions in the north western oil base last year. 
The Angolan authorities reported that heavy fighting was 
continuing for control of the southern Huila region and Moxico 
in eastern Angola, but they remained tightlipped about the 
military situation in Soyo. 
  Angola was plunged back into a long-running post 
independence 
civil war after UNITA lost a United Nations supervised general 
election in September 1992.

we are receiving reports of further bombardments. UNITA is 
accusing the government troops of firing on Huambo again. The 
spokesman for the UNITA delegation in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim, 
has just told us what happened: 
  [Valentim] There was heavy bombardment by the government air 
force from 1000 hours [0900 GMT] yesterday, in an unexpected, 
irrational and blind way. Bombs were dropped everywhere in 
waves, on houses. Many houses disappeared... 
  [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] Have the 
government armed forces or the Angolan Government acknowledged 
these renewed attacks? 
  [Valentim] Well, there is no way they can deny these 
attacks, 
because there were international observers. These had to go to 
the shelters too, including an American representative visiting 
Huambo. 
  [Announcer] That was UNITA spokesman in Lusaka, Jorge 
Valentim, speaking to us moments ago. He accuses the Angolan 
Armed Forces of resuming bombardments on Huambo.

Cubango Province, appears to be returning to normal after the 
clashes which occurred on 8 April. It is noteworthy, though, 
that the government forces which were dislodged from their 
temporary base in the vicinity of Cuelei, are now regrouping. 
It is not yet known whether they plan to launch yet another 
military offensive. 
  The military command for the independent area of Menongue 
today announced that technical preparation combat maneuvers are 
to be carried out over the course of this week in a bid to 
contain new attacks. That command also asked people in National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola-controlled areas in 
general, and in the area of Cuchi in particular, to remain calm, 
adding that the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA, 
will know how to defend the interests of the civilian population. 
  The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party's adventurous plans to attack and take Cuchi District cost 
its People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, 
91 soldiers killed and 193 wounded. Major Americo, of the 14th 
Infantry Regiment, was among the dead.

important thing is that they be held in October, as scheduled. 
Samo Gudo also noted that the setting of an election date will

  (David Amuzanda), of the Patriotic Action Front, FAP, also 
expressed agreement with the election dates. He conveyed, 
however, concern about delays in the implementation of parts of

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Subsidies: the proposal of the CNE"] </F>
  [Excerpts] (Maputo) The National Elections Commission, CNE, 
has just proposed subsidies for its members that are 
considerably higher than the salaries paid to members of 
government. Should the proposal be approved, CNE Chairman Dr. 
Brazao Mazula will get a subsidy twice the monthly salary of the 
president of the Republic. [passage omitted] 
  The following is the subsidy proposal the CNE has presented 
to the president of the Republic: 

  -  CNE chairman: 8,000 contos [1 conto equals 1,000 meticals] 
(114 times the minimum national wage); 
  -  deputy CNE chairman: 7,400 contos; 
  -  members: 6,000 contos. 
  For the Provincial Election Commissions: 

  -  chairmen: 4,500 contos; 
  -  deputy chairmen: 3,400 contos. 
  For the District Election Commissions: 

  -  chairman: 2,300 contos; 
  -  deputy chairman: 1,900 contos; 
  -  members: 1,700 contos. [passage omitted] 
  The following are some of the monthly salaries and benefits 
enjoyed by members of government: 

  -  president of the Republic: 3,500 or 4,000 contos (we could 
not obtain official confirmation); 
  -  prime minister: a basic salary of 3,000 contos, state and 
personal transportation, security personnel. 
  The representation budgets of the prime minister and of 
the president of the Republic have no fixed limits; the Finance 
Ministry ascribes a sum in accordance with the average expenses 
of previous years. 
  Ministers: 2,500 contos (there are tax deductions), plus 800 
contos for representation expenses, protocol vehicle (a Mercedes 
Benz), personal vehicle with minimum 1,800 cc horsepower (to be 
paid in installments over five years), a driver (who is an 
employee of the relevant ministry) and an aide (who is a police 
officer). 
  The Council of Ministers has proposed the following monthly 
salaries for the CNE: 

  -  The CNE chairman should get 3,000 contos, the deputy 
chairmen 2,600 contos, and the other members 1,100 contos. The 
provincial commissions would see subsidies of 500 contos for 
their members, 1,000 contos for the deputy chairman, and 1,500 
contos for the chairman. 
  -  For the district commissions: the chairman would get 800 
contos, the deputy chairman 600 contos, and the members 250 
contos each. 

    The CNE has 21 members. Each of the 11 provincial 
commissions has 19 members and the same applies to the district 
commissions. There will be 158 district commissions. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial comment: "Cyclone Nadia for the General State </F>
Budget"] 
  [Excerpt] (Maputo) The Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] has been preaching to the government because of the 
skeletal budget that has been awarded the university but, then, 
it goes along with a proposal for high subsidies for members of 
the National Elections Commission, CNE. In other words, a CNE 
member earns more money in two months than the amount that has 
been budgeted for the running of the Faculty of Economy. 
  The unarmed opposition has often accused the government of a 
lack of clarity and austerity in public spending. They are 
quite right. However, so far none of the three members who 
represent the unarmed opposition in the CNE appears to have come 
forward to protest this proposal for such high subsidies and 
benefits. 
  This CNE proposal is ideal for the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo], which has 10 members in the CNE. Those 10 
people will be earning fabulous salaries -- particularly by 
comparison with the minimum wage -- and Joaquim Chissano can now 
start saying: "look, Frelimo costs so much but the opposition, 
if it wins the upcoming elections, will cost three times as 
much." 
  It looks, therefore, like the CNE and its appetites may yet 
be the Cyclone Nadia that the General State Budget needed to 
become as ravaged as Nampula Province. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] leader, said in Maputo today that there was a 
suggestion to train half the number of troops for the future 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, instead of the 30,000 men 
stipulated in the Rome Accord. 
  The Renamo leader said he had discussed the matter with 
President Joaquim Chissano this morning. The two men discussed 
the peace process, among other things. Dhlakama backed the 
idea, saying that so far not even a quarter of the men have been 
trained yet because there are neither good conditions in 
training camps nor financing. 
  Dhlakama said that countries like Italy had offered to make 
available instructors, military equipment, and financing, as 
well as to rehabilitate the training camps, but approval of the 
idea will depend on the technical proposals to be advanced by 
government and Renamo generals.

  [Text] Harare April 7 SAPA -- About 10,000 South Africans, 
fearing electoral violence, have taken refuge in Zimbabwe. The 
mini exodus of mostly white South Africans began at the weekend 
and resort hotels are still full. "We will return only when the 
peace situation has improved," said Ms Marie Potgieter of Louis 
Trichardt, in the northern Transvaal. Ms Potgieter, who had set 
up a tent in Harare's Coronation Park camp site said: "Life is 
more important than the franchise." 
  At the weekend, usually vacant campsites north of Beit 
Bridge 
sprung up into small towns, with scores of large caravans and 
multi- coloured tents. "We're bursting at the seams and it's 
mostly South Africans who want to get away from the tension," 
said Ms Noreena Ellwell, manager of Goodwood Hotels, which owns 
hotels on the main road to the northern border and at Kariba. 
  Zimbabwean homes are also filling up as South African 
relatives and friends arrive. "I've got five families with me. 
At three meals a day, they're eating me out of house and home, 
and I've got them until well after the election," a white Harare 
butchery manageress said. 
  The South African trade mission to Zimbabwe has made 
arrangements for residents to vote in Harare and Bulawayo. 
  A curio dealer in Masvingo said a group of South Africans 
had 
parked their vehicles in a circle at the Mutirikwi National 
Park. "There are a circle of tents inside the ring of vehicles 
and a large fire in the middle. It's so strange, they've gone 
into laager, using fancy caravans instead of covered wagons. 
And to think 14 years ago it was the Rhodesians going in the 
other direction when (President Robert) Mugabe came to power."

  [Text] Nairobi, 11 Apr (KNA) -- The first batch of over 20 
Kenyans from Kigali, Rwanda, arrived in Nairobi today with 
horrifying accounts of the carnage in that country. The 
Kenyans, who were evacuated by the U.S. Air Force plane, 
included Kenya Airways employees, embassy officials and their 
dependents. Also in the same plane were over 40 American 
citizens. 
  They were met on arrival by the American ambassador to 
Kenya, 
Ms. Aurelia Brazeal, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy 
chief of protocol, Mr. F.O. Oyaya. 
  Those interviewed by the press narrated about the brutal 
ethnic killings since the death of the Rwanda and Burundi 
presidents. The Kenyans expressed gratitude to the U.S. 
officials in Kigali, who provided escort to their convoy from 
Kigali to Bujumbura.

  [Text] A spokesman of the Somali National Alliance [SNA] 
has said today that lately there appeared troublemakers opposed 
to the peace of the Somali people recently agreed upon in 
Nairobi, Kenya by Somali organizations with the intention of 
weakening and undermining the various settlements of Somalia. 
He added that the Somali people are not ready today to go back 
to the civil war and, hence, the SNA leadership is calling on 
the Somali people to take the following steps: 
  1. The peace-loving Somali people are being called upon to 
remain vigilant and counter these troublemakers wherever they 
may be. 
  2. The SNA warns those undermining the peace to stop 
meddling. Their actions will not be tolerated any longer. 
  3. The communities which have no peace among themselves 
should solve their problems as soon as possible in their 
settlements so as to contribute to overall peace in the country. 
  The spokesman concluded his speech by saying that the Somali 
people should join together and do away with whatever happened 
in the past.

  [Text] The government has said it is making every effort to 
rescue Tanzanians who want to return home following the ongoing 
heavy fighting between the Rwandan Government troops and the 
forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. (?A statement) 
issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation said those Tanzanians who are in Rwanda and who want 
to leave the country should contact embassy officials currently 
living at the residence of the Tanzanian ambassador in Kigali as 
soon as possible so that arrangements can be made for them to 
travel back home. 
  In the statement, the government calls on Rwandan Government 
troops and the RPF fighters to ensure the safety of Tanzanians 
in the country and that of those who want to return home. The 
government also called on the sides involved in the country's 
conflict to immediately stop fighting so as to save the lives of 
all Rwandan citizens as well as those of foreign citizens in the 
country. 
  The statement said Tanzania was still determined to continue 
seeking a solution to the Rwandan conflict and called on the 
sides concerned, particularly the Rwandan Government and the RPF 
fighters, to implement the Arusha peace accord as it is the only 
way of solving their problems.

  [Text] Dr. Buthelezi today said the levels of anger have 
never been as high as they are now in kwaZulu-Natal. In Ulundi 
today, he briefed the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] Central 
Committee on yesterday's leaders' summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] The IFP's 
monthly meeting of its Central Committee today was dominated by 
the outcome of yesterday's leaders' summit at Skukuza. The 
party's leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said that despite the 
leaders' meeting the road forward did not look promising. 
  [Buthelezi, in English] In my whole lifetime, in all the 
years I have lived on planet earth, I've never seen the anger of 
the people reaching the levels which it has reached. 
  [Alfonso] The IFP leader also said his party wanted the 
election to be postponed across the entire country and not only 
in kwaZulu-Natal. He also warned that people in the region 
would act on their own against what he called strong-arm methods 
by the government and the ANC to suppress the Zulu king's 
followers. 
  [Buthelezi, in English] The people themselves here are our 
last line of defense because people themselves here are incensed 
about what is being done to them. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Office of the Chief Minister of kwaZulu </F>
on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 9 April] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Resolution 1 </H5>
  We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] re-state our unqualified commitment to seek 
an all- inclusive solution for the present national crisis. 
We further 
  1. Fully support the international mediation effort aimed at 
resolving outstanding issues so that a solution to the national 
crisis can be found prior to the holding of any election. 
  2. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation must 
be to seek a constitutional settlement on the basis of the 
outstanding constitutional issues identified in the respective 
IFP and ANC terms of reference and on the resolution of the 
issues related to the claims and demands of His Majesty the king 
of the Zulu nation. 
  3. Re-state that the above said constitutional compromise 
must be translated into amendments to the 1993 constitution so 
that it can form the basis for a broader political settlement 
and reconciliation to take place before elections. 
  4. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation and 
of the constitutional settlement is to enable the Inkatha 
Freedom Party to rejoin the electoral process on an equal 
footing with all other political parties. 
  5. Re-state that the election date of April 27 is to be 
postponed so as to offer an opportunity for international 
mediation to bring about the results we all hope for. 
  6. State the willingness of the IFP to resolve by means of 
international mediation any outstanding differences between the 
terms of reference of the IFP and the ANC. 
  7. Re-state that international mediation is not and shall 
not 
become international arbitration and that the role and function 
of the international mediators is to facilitate the process of 
negotiations between the IFP and its counterparts with respect 
to the issues which divide us. 
  8. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation is 
not to determine who is right and who is wrong, nor is it to 
assess the value of the 1993 constitution against any abstract 
constitutional model. The purpose of mediation is to 
acknowledge the objective differences between the requirements 
of the IFP for the establishment of a federal and pluralistic 
system of government and the provisions of the 1993 
constitution, as amended, with a view to seeking a fair and just 
point of settlement and reconciliation, which the IFP has 
submitted to be provided by its compromise proposals contained 
in the December 19, 1993 yellow paper. 
<H5>  Resolution 2 </H5>
  The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes 
with 
approval that the leadership of the African National Congress 
has at long last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu 
nation. It applauds the statesmanlike manner in which His 
Majesty set out the question of sovereignty of the Kingdom of 
kwaZulu. 
  The Central Committee wishes to place on record that it was 
saddened by the proposals made by the ANC in its so-called 
"offer" made to His Majesty the king. The document displays a 
great deal of ignorance and some aspects are even colonial in 
character. 
We therefore: 
  1. Applaud the fact that the leadership of the ANC has at 
last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation. 
  2. Formally note that the so-called "offer" to His Majesty 
the king was clearly drafted by people unfamiliar with African 
customs and protocol and will thus give offence to the Zulu 
people. It is wittingly or unwittingly prescriptive in 
character and typical of centralised thinking. 
  3. State that any proposals relating to His Majesty the king 
or to the Kingdom of kwaZulu must be based on an acceptance of 
the principle of sovereignty and self-determination of the Zulu 
nation. The proposals of the ANC are in breach of these 
principles. 

<H5>    Resolution 3 </H5>
  The Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom Party has received 
with satisfaction the report by the President Prince Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi of the historic summit with his Majesty King 
Zwelithini Goodwill Ka Bhekuzulu, Dr Nelson Mandela, president 
of the ANC and State President FW de Klerk, held at Skukuza camp 
at the Kruger National Park on April 8, 1994. 
  The Central Committee notes that presentations and proposals 
were made by the various parties. Particular attention needs to 
be drawn to the concerns expressed by His Majesty the king as 
well as to the detailed proposals made by the president of the 
IFP whose aim was to facilitate an all-inclusive political 
settlement that would enable the IFP to join the electoral 
process. 
  The Central Committee regrets that the summit was not 
immediately productive but nevertheless endorses the decision to 
press ahead by means of a task group charged with producing a 
package of proposals vis-a-vis His Majesty the king and 
constitutional issues that have to be placed before the 
respective leaders of the summit by Thursday 14 April 1994. The 
Central Committee supports a second summit to be held towards 
the end of next week to take final decisions. 
<H5>  Resolution 4 </H5>
  We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party place on record our total opposition to the state 
of emergency imposed on kwaZulu-Natal to achieve party-political 
gains for the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party]/NP 
[National Party] alliance at the deliberate expense of the 
kwaZulu government and the people of kwaZulu-Natal. 
  This construct of the ANC/SACP-dominated TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] amounts to an invasion of this region and 
will therefore be resisted by all citizens who will 
democratically reject this assault on their basic and lawful 
rights. 
  After the revolutionary coup in Bophuthatswana, the 
politically motivated imposition of a state of emergency in 
kwaZulu-Natal is another stage in the breakdown of legality in 
South Africa to silence any dissent and political opposition to 
the ANC/SACP strategy to seize power at whatever cost. 
  We call for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency 
as necessary and essential for the continuation of negotiations 
seeking a peaceful resolution of the present national crisis and 
the holding of free and fair elections. 
  We reject the notion of electoral processes and negotiations 
being conducted in the shadow of armoured vehicles and under the 
intimidation of armed forces which are no longer required to 
respect basic human rights. 
  The freedom of the people of kwaZulu-Natal cannot be 
subjugated with iron fist measures. History will defeat those 
who engage in totalitarian follies equal to those perpetuated 
during the darkest years of apartheid. 
<H5>  Resolution 5 </H5>
  The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes 
with 
dismay the growing partisan character of the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] as reflected in the utterances of its 
chairman and vice- chairman. The comments of some officials of 
a statutory body charged with quasi judicial functions have been 
loud and improper. 
  Both those wishing to participate and those wishing not to 
participate in the elections are citizens entitled to equal 
fundamental human rights. It is unedifying for those holding 
public office to hurl gratuitous insults at citizens of the 
country. 
  We call upon officials of the I.E.C to act with decorum and 
to desist from making partisan comments. 
<H5>  Resolution 6 </H5>
  We the members of the Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom 
Party add our voice to the many millions of South Africans who 
were equally appalled by the cold-blooded slaughter of Zulu 
citizens peacefully marching in support of their king in 
Johannesburg. 
  We call for all witnesses to the massacre of these people 
outside Shell House, in front of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters and at the Library 
Gardens to come forward and testify in the best interests of 
justice and democracy. 
  That there was publicly observed evidence of killer snipers 
firing from buildings occupied by the ANC and that police 
investigations in this regard were blatantly and deliberately 
thwarted is nothing short of a national disgrace. We demand: 
  1. That the commissioner of police immediately provides the 
people of South Africa with a precise explanation as to why a 
proper investigation was not conducted inside both Shell House 
and the ANC's PWV headquarters as a priority. 
  2. We demand a report on the current status of the enquiry 
into the murders. 
  There appears to have been a conspiracy of silence drawn 
over 
the public assassination of these men and women and the apparent 
lack of the ability of the relevant authorities to arrest any 
perpetrators is an outrage. The Central Committee of the IFP 
salutes these sons and daughters of kwaZulu, and it grieves for 
them, their families and their loved ones. We are determined 
that their deaths will not be allowed to be forgotten and we 
will annually commemorate the anniversary of their brutal 
slaying in the Shell House massacre. 
<H5>  Resolution 7 </H5>
  We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party are alarmed to hear that it is intended to move 
members of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military 
wing] operating within the National Peacekeeping Force into the 
East Rand next week. 
  Members and supporters of the IFP are adamantly opposed to 
the deployment of this non-inclusive, non-proven and highly 
controver- sial force into the area. They warn of grave 
consequences given the already notorious conduct of some of its 
leaders and ordinary members and fear for their lives. 
  To choose the East Rand for the first placement of this 
fledgling force, given the long history of death and destruction 
in the area, is an irresponsible act of extreme provocation. 
<H5>  Resolution 8 </H5>
  We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party yet again mourn a much loved son of our party, Mr 
Jeff Sibiya, who was brutally slain yesterday in the East Rand. 
  Mr Sibiya who was a youth leader, publicity spokesperson and 
peace committee member and monitor was felled by SADF [South 
African Defense Force] bullets, when according to numerous 
witnesses, he was attempting to mediate and while wearing his 
peace monitor jacket and holding a torch. 
  The IFP has already called for an immediate enquiry into his 
tragic and unnecessary death and he joins many other IFP 
leaders, who were active in peace committees, who have been 
killed throughout the country. 
  Our deepest condolences go to his family and to all his many 
friends and colleagues who will remember Mr Jeff Sibiya's 
ability to always smile in the face of adversity as he sought 
peaceful solutions amidst the horrors of living the life of a 
hostel dweller in the East Rand.

  [Text] Although the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] insists 
that it will not participate in the election, the party is 
apparently spending considerable amounts of money on election 
posters. Several IFP election posters were seen in the streets 
of Durban and surrounding areas, some with the message "vote 
when the time comes." 
  [Begin IFP spokesman Arthur Koningkramer recording, in 
English] There's nothing contradictory in it. We still believe 
in elections. We are absolutely convinced that it is not 
possible to go ahead with democratic elections without a major 
player like the IFP. In addition, as you're well aware, the 
concerns of His Majesty the king, in terms of self-determination 
of the Zulu people, have not been addressed. We are confident 
that they will be addressed. And in conclusion I would just 
like to say that we're absolutely committed to elections. There 
will be genuine all-inclusive elections, and the IFP will fight 
them. [end recording]

  [Text] Zulu chiefs are believed to be considering a mass 
action campaign over the election period which would require 
their subjects to attend the campaign, preventing them from 
going to polling stations. A senior Inkatha source said at the 
weekend he had heard this speculation, but denied it was an 
Inkatha plan. He said Inkatha wanted to prove that the 
constitution was unacceptable by ensuring its members backed an 
election boycott. 
  Traditional chiefs might take action to frustrate the 
Independent Election Commission's (IEC) efforts to ensure free 
elections. The rumoured mass action campaign was one of these 
actions. He also denied rumours that Inkatha leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi had called on all kwaZulu public servants to report to 
Ulundi on April 27 in an attempt to prevent them from going to 
polling stations. He said it had become clear that government 
and the ANC were prepared to bulldoze the election regardless of 
opposition. 
  "(ANC president Nelson) Mandela keeps saying that the 
elections cannot be postponed because the people will be too 
angry and will revolt. Well, the fact is that the majority of 
people in this region are angry that the elections are going 
ahead and their concerns are being ignored."

  [Text] The Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, said he 
will not enter into any agreements with the ANC which he had not 
been party to in drawing up. King Goodwill, in an interview 
with the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation], 
responded to a draft proposal which the ANC presented to him 
during Friday's [8 April] leaders' summit in the Kruger Game 
Park. According to the agreement, the ANC has undertaken to see 
to it that the king's position, rights, and powers will be 
constitutionally recognized and defined. 
  [Begin Zwelithini recording, in English] I want to put it 
clearly to my people that I was not intent to sign any agreement 
which was not drawn by all political concerns [as heard]. I was 
thinking that everything is going to be supported out, 
especially for the sovereign kingdom, with the Zulu monarchy. 
But I was surprised to see that the ANC's agreement proposals 
were just concerning the status of the king and the royal house. 
All what I need is to see that the sovereign kingdom and the 
Zulu monarchy and the self-determination of the Zulu people 
being looked at before elections. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring and Ray Hartley] </F>
  [Excerpts] A desperate bid by ANC leader Nelson Mandela to 
persuade Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to support peaceful 
elections in Natal was torpedoed at this week's summit by 
Inkatha president Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Mr Mandela played what 
he hoped would be his ace. He offered King Goodwill powers as a 
constitutional monarch with sway over the whole Natal province. 
But Chief Buthelezi scuppered the proposal by insisting that 
the offer could not be considered unless all Inkatha's other 
concerns were handled at the same time. [passage omitted] 
  The 13-hour meeting at Skukuza began badly for the ANC, 
which 
had hoped Mr Mandela and King Goodwill could meet in private. 
However, despite two attempts by Mr Mandela to meet the king 
privately, the king's advisers, Frank Armstrong and Mario 
Ambrosini, insisted that the king should be accompanied by his 
full delegation. 
  Sources at the meeting said that the king then read out in 
Zulu a hard-line, 12-page document which referred to perceived 
past insults from the ANC and attacks on his supporters. 
  Only when he had finished was Mr Mandela able to table for 
discussion his proposals for a Zulu monarch. [passage omitted] 
  King Goodwill, sources at the meeting say, responded by 
asking 30 minutes to consult his advisers. Royal household 
member Prince Vincent Zulu returned to the meeting with the 
blunt message: "The king has examined your proposals and finds 
them unacceptable."

Chandler] 
  [Text] kwaZulu could face an intensified security crackdown 
if last-gasp talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in 
the electoral impasse. There are widespread fears that violence 
in kwaZulu/Natal might soar if the special working group -- set 
up to provide the summit sequel with fresh initiative -- fails. 
  Yesterday there was deep pessimism in both Government and 
ANC 
circles over prospects for a breakthrough. "Even if we manage 
to reach agreement in the working group -- which is possible -- 
it appears that it will be blocked by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] leadership," said a senior Government source. They 
pointed out that encouraging progress in talks between the king 
and Mandela on Friday [8 April] had been reversed after he 
consulted the full IFP delegation. 
  With the failure of the four-way Skukuza summit, it is 
understood that security action will be considerably intensified 
if tensions in the province continue to lead to bloodshed. 
KwaZulu politicians acknowledge that the next four days will be 
crucial to the territory and the Zulu monarchy. They fear that 
if their demands are not met, the low-key civil war now raging 
in the region could escalate out of control. 
  The situation in the territory was generally quiet 
yesterday. 
South African troops had not been mobilised by nightfall at 
their temporary base at the Eshowe showgrounds. It is 
understood that mobilisation could begin by Thursday, depending 
on the success of the task force discussions. Yesterday Ulundi 
was abnormally quiet, according to local residents. The local 
hotel had only three guests, and normal Saturday trade at the 
bar and restaurant was non- existent. 
  With hopes of an ANC-IFP constitutional resolution all but 
shattered by Friday's inconclusive summit, attention is also 
focusing on getting as many kwaZulu/Natal voters as possible to 
the polls. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer, speaking in 
Cradock yesterday, said it was estimated about 60 percent of 
Natal's inhabitants would be able to participate freely in the 
election. But IFP supporters, especially north of the Tugela, 
were actively intimidating people not to take part in the 
election, he said. Meyer warned that if the election was 
postponed, the future of the country would be determined by 
radical elements of the Left and Right, and that a Bosnian-style 
situation would develop. None of the arguments that were now 
being brought up by the IFP were new and there were no solutions 
for them, he added. 
  The IFP warned at its central committee meeting on Saturday 
that kwaZulu citizens would resist the state of emergency, and 
demanded its immediate lifting. In resolutions addressing the 
reasons for rejecting the ANC's "offer" at Friday's summit, the 
IFP central committee said it had displayed a "great deal of 
ignorance" and some aspects were "even colonial in character". 
The committee said the offer was a political promise with no 
legal effect on the Interim Constitution, and amounted to an 
offer to the king "as a person" and not as the head of the Zulu 
nation. It gave him ceremonial functions but provided no space 
for the autonomy and self- determination of the Zulu nation. 
  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi told THE STAR: "We are very 
depressed. In my whole lifetime I have never seen such anger by 
our people." He added that the state of emergency was not a 
recipe for peace.

  [Text] Mmabatho April 9 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk said 
on Saturday [9 April] that the SA [South African] Government 
could not take over kwaZulu as had happened in Bophuthatswana. 
He said at a news conference in Mmabatho that fundamentally 
different situations prevailed in the two territories. The 
president was speaking after talks with Bophuthatswana's two 
joint administrators, Mr Job Mokgoro and Prof Tjaart van der 
Walt. 
  Mr de Klerk said the de facto situation in Bophuthatswana 
before the takeover was that former President Lucas Mangope was 
no longer in charge. This was not the situation in kwaZulu. He 
said the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal had no political or 
constitutional aim but was intended to ensure stability and 
create a climate conducive to free and fair elections. 
  He said no comparison should be drawn between Bophuthatswana 
and kwaZulu. If Mr Mangope had acted differently he would still 
have been in power and would have handed over that power on May 
1, when the Legislative Assembly for the new provinces would 
meet for the first time. 
  Mr de Klerk said the talks with the two administrators had 
been to iron out "hitches". He said it was important that what 
had been built up in Bophuthatswana should not be put at risk 
because the territory would soon become part of the South Africa 
again. It was important that tension should be overcome so that 
things could normalise and return to stability. Both 
administrators had informed him that they were cooperating well. 
"Things go relatively well here," Mr de Klerk said.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "A welcome </F>
perspective"; article published in English] 
  [Text] The international backing which emergency rule in 
Natal has received is unsurprising. 
  After all those who demanded the ending of apartheid and the 
ANC's elevation to power were mostly silent on violation of 
rights, including mass murder, elsewhere in the world. 
  That is why support for emergency rule from outside South 
Africa carries little moral weight. 
  A discordant and perceptive note was however sounded in an 
editorial in the London SUNDAY TIMES. 
  The editorial states that an election under present 
circumstances will do nothing to reconcile South Africans, and 
that as such we are on the brink of civil war. This is "not 
simply a legacy of apartheid, but of the bungled way the 
transition has been handled." 
  ANC and NP [National Party] "propaganda machines insist the 
election will be substantially free and fair, and that once a 
popularly elected government is in place peace will blossom." 
  But, it is predicted that neither will happen. 
  "Rather than addressing the underlying reasons for the 
violence, the ANC and the government blindly push ahead, 
believing states of emergency and military force will provide 
solutions. They persist is claiming that the new constitution 
they have drafted is a federal one, even when scores of foreign 
experts have pointed out it is not." 
  The ANC, it is correctly pointed out, has won everything it 
wants, and all who remain in the way are Zulu leaders. But, 
though Dr Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelithini are dismissed 
as spoilers: "All they are asking for are federal powers along 
the lines enjoyed by German, Canadian or American states or 
provinces. Is South Africa to be plunged into a bitter civil 
war for this?" 
  The article predicts that South Africa, under present 
arrangements, is heading towards an authoritarian, effectively 
one- party state. 
  "Declaring states of emergency and sending in the army is no 
solution. They will be able to take Ulundi, the kwaZulu 
capital, but will face an unwinnable guerilla campaign in the 
hills of northern Natal. At some point, a political solution 
will have to be found." 
  "Mr Mandela and Mr De Klerk must take the plunge ... at this 
week's summit with Chief Buthelezi and King Zwelithini they 
should postpone the election, not just in Natal, as they are now 
belatedly considering, but nationwide." 
  It is also recommended that, using international mediation, 
they should give serious thought to granting real autonomy for 
regions. 
  Though this all may not be politically correct, the 
editorial 
is entirely sensible. If this route is not followed this kind 
of view will be repeated many times as the folly of ANC/NP 
[National Party] handiwork becomes more evident. 
  This view will also be expressed by those who really count 
-- 
foreign investors. They will express their view by withholding 
their capital from South Africa, to the impoverishment of all. 
  This consideration is far more important that the 
sycophantic 
support of State Department or Foreign Office officials, whose 
job after all is the cultivation and flattery of foreign 
governments and by implication ruling parties. And it is also 
far more important than mere expressions of "moral" support from 
foreign governments, or from mutual admiration societies like 
the UN or OAU.

<F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley and Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Excerpt] "One of us will come out bruised, and it will not 
be me," ANC president Nelson Mandela has reportedly said about 
his much-awaited television encounter with President F W de 
Klerk, scheduled for Thursday [12 April] this week. 
  With just four days to go until the cameras beam the two 
leaders into the living rooms of millions, election image-makers 
on both sides have expressed jitters about the high-risk 
encounter. A bad performance by either leader could cost him 
thousands of vital votes from those still undecided -- perhaps 
even determining whether or not the ANC will get the 66 percent 
vote it needs to write the constitution on its own. 
  While Mr Mandela will project the image of a stately saint, 
there are those in his campaign team who fear he may be too 
stiff and long-winded to cope with the strict time limits. ANC 
insiders believe Mr Mandela appears uncomfortable on television, 
often insisting on buttoning up his jacket in the correct old 
school way and failing to make eye contact with viewers by 
looking into the camera. 
  And NP [National Party] election guru's are fearful that Mr 
Mandela will launch a strong personal attack, which could 
unnerve President De Klerk, who has often said he prefers 
playing the ball to playing the man. 
  The ANC considers the debate to be the most crucial event 
between the two leaders so far -- even more important than the 
showdown at Codesa 1. "It epitomises the climax of this whole 
election campaign in which people will have to make a choice 
between oppression and despair and democracy and a better life," 
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. Mr Mamoepa said the debate had 
the power to swing votes, but the ANC was confident Mr Mandela 
would come out tops. "Obviously we don't think for one split 
second that our president can fluff it," he said. 
  Mr Mandela is taking seriously preparations for the debate, 
leaving nothing to chance. On Wednesday, he will spend an 
entire day with senior members of the National Executive 
Committee being briefed on issues, and deciding which ones to 
project. They will even decide on what he will wear -- dark 
suit and certainly no grey shoes. 
  The preparations will not include matters of presentation, 
apart from the cautionary plea -- "keep it short and concise, 
please Madiba". Like all ANC candidates, Mr Mandela has already 
been through a course in television technique. He has had to 
undergo mock interviews in front of a television camera where a 
room full of people have fired questions at the candidate. They 
assess the performance later. 
  NP election guru Martinus van Schalkwyk is equally upbeat 
about Mr De Klerk: "He's really a natural. Of course, we will 
prepare him, but because he's a natural, we won't over prepare 
him," he says. But he would give no details on the preparation.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC Department of Information and </F>
Publicity on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 April: "Dirty Tricks 
Campaign To Discredit ANC"] 
  [Text] April 10th will be marked throughout South Africa as 
a tragic anniversary marking the brutal murder of Comrade Chris 
Thembisile Hani, general secretary of the South African 
Communist Party and member of the National Executive Committee 
of the ANC, at the hands of ultra-right conspirators. 
  During the weeks preceding this dastardly act, a vicious 
disinformation campaign, orchestrated by forces intent on 
derailing the transition to democracy was set in motion. The 
objectives of those behind the campaign became clear only after 
the assassins had struck -- they were to besmirch the character 
of Comrade Chris Hani and thus lend legitimacy to his murder. 
  The ANC has noted with grave concern the unfolding of a 
similar campaign as we approach April 10th. Entire communities 
are awash with wild rumours and irresponsible speculations about 
impending disaster. A malicious rumour, that was promptly denied 
by the British authorities, to the effect that preparations were 
in hand to evacuate British citizens in the event of unrest 
after April 27th was floated. Shoppers have been panicked into 
the stockpiling of non-perishable foods against the continency 
of shortages that will allegedly follow the first democratic 
elections. Spokepersons of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have 
brazenly proclaimed their intention to make the holding of 
elections impossible in a number of provinces including the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Natal. 
  It is against this backdrop that the ANC wants to warn the 
South African public about a reckless conspiracy which its 
authors hope to operationalise over the next few days. The 
information at our disposal has already been placed before the 
South African authorities at the highest level. 
  The ANC has been reliably informed that: 
  (i) Presently large quantities of arms have been transported 
into the PWV region and stockpiled in at least 16 hostels, with 
a view to launching armed attacks in that province commencing 
Saturday 9th April. The flats and houses of ANC members resident 
in the Hillbrow-Berea-Yeoville area of Johannesburg have been 
targeted. 
  (ii) The IFP has come into the possession of at least 2,000 
ANC T-shirts and other paraphernalia, with a view to 
infiltrating the Chris Hani memorial rallies scheduled for this 
weekend so as to stage a provocation that will result in 
bloodshed, loss of life and consequently heighten the tensions 
in the PWV. As a bonus such a provocation would also serve to 
bring the ANC into disrepute by linking it and its supporters to 
acts of violence. 
  (iii) Attempts will be made on the lives of a number of ANC 
leaders in order to deepen the atmosphere of instability and 
possibly provoke a backlash among ANC supporters. Comrades 
Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa have been 
mentioned in this regard. 
  (iv) The ANC head offices on Plein Street in Johannesburg 
have been placed under surveillance by rotating reconnaissance 
teams in preparation for an armed assault. 
  (v) A comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence is 
planned to coincide with the last three weeks before the 
elections in the hope of producing a low turn-out, especially 
among African voters. 
  It is not our intention to cause alarm, but the information 
we have received is extremely disturbing and should be brought 
to public attention. There have been a number of clear 
indications that the gun running trail uncovered by the 
Goldstone Commission is still operational. Recent reports 
concerning the transfer of firearms between persons in the 
employ of Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] and members of 
hit squads confirm this. Specific ANC leaders have been 
subjected to surveillance by suspicious persons and at least one 
member of our security department has been shot and seriously 
injured by unknown assailants in the streets of Johannesburg. 
  The ANC will not be intimidated by these tactics and we 
intend to pursue and implement every aspect of our programme and 
election campaign over the coming weeks. Any attempts to disrupt 
our activities commemorating the life and work of Comrade Chris 
Hani will be dealt with firmly. We shall not allow the spoilers 
and wreckers to destroy South Africa's chances for free and fair 
elections.

  [Text] Reiger Park April 10 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela addressed a memorial service 
for slain SA [South African] Communist Party General Secretary 
Chris Hani at the St Anthony's Catholic Church at Reiger Park on 
the East Rand on Sunday [10 April]. He said the service in the 
Catholic Church for the slain communist leader showed the 
importance of the Church in the struggle for change in South 
Africa. He said Mr Hani had been one of South Africa's most 
important revolutionaries. 
  Outside the church, Mr Mandela addressed about 300 people. 
"We want a better life for all our people without exception. 
We are the only organisation in this country which has been in 
the forefront of building a national unity. And this audience 
indicates our success. We have all communities represented here. 
I hope to come here and thank you after April 27 (election 
date)," he said. 
  ANC supporters formed a guard of honour outside the church 
where they hoped to catch a glimpse of Mr Mandela as he left the 
church grounds. The group of about 400 men were armed with 
traditional weapons and stood silently with their fists raised 
in a black power salute on either side of the road. The armed 
men were dressed with sheets and blankets under which many of 
them hid their weapons. They were reportedly from surrounding 
squatter settlements on the East Rand. 
  Peace monitors and ANC marshals formed a human chain between 
the men and the middle of the road through which the Mandela 
convoy was expected to travel.

<F P=106> [Report by Micel Schnehage] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Apr 10 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela said he would seek another 
meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini next week despite the 
king's rejection of proposals to accommodate a Zulu monarchy 
after the April election. 
  Addressing supporters at a rally to commemorate the SA 
[South 
African] Communist Party [SACP] Secretary General Chris Hani at 
Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday [10 April], Mr Mandela said 
the Zulu king had been offered a status higher than the one he 
currently enjoyed under the present kwaZulu constitution. 
  Mr Mandela said after King Goodwill had rejected the 
proposals put forward at an emergency leadership summit at the 
Kruger National Park on Friday, he had approached the Zulu 
monarch and asked him "do you want the same rights enjoyed by 
(Britain's) Queen Elizabeth?" 
  He claimed the question had not been answered by King 
Goodwill. 
  Turning to the security issue in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Mandela 
said the ANC fully supported the state of emergency implemented 
on March 31 to restore stability in that province and to ensure 
a free and fair election in the region. 
  Mr Mandela appealed to the masses to support police and 
South 
African Defence Force [SADF] actions in that region who "have a 
difficult task to ensure all people are disarmed". He said the 
purpose of security forces deployed in the province was to 
protect life and property and to ensure a free and fair election 
was conducted in the area. 
  Mr Mandela said security operations had to continue under 
the 
current political climate in kwaZulu/Natal and appealed to the 
SADF and SA Police to "behave in a manner which will allow us to 
rely on them". He stressed the need for confidence in these 
forces who in the past had not enjoyed the support of the people 
because of senior members' involvement in violence and 
corruption. 
  The ANC leader accused State President F W de Klerk of 
complicity in the violence in that region because of the 
involvement of the so- called third force in fomenting the 
violence. "De Klerk is part of the massacres in that region", 
he told a wildly cheering crowd of about 8,000 supporters. 
  He urged the crowd to recommit themselves to peace and to 
end 
"finger-pointing" accusations for the violence in the country. 
"Each one of us must take responsibility to end crime and 
violence", he said. 
  In further criticising Mr de Klerk and his National Party 
[NP], Mr Mandela said although recent election polls had 
indicated the ANC had lost support to the NP and the Democratic 
Party he again referred to the NP as a "mouse". "We are dealing 
with a mouse, the NP is a mouse and they think they can fight 
the ANC, an elephant". "If a mouse overfeeds it will gain 
weight, but it will remain a mouse" he told the cheering crowd. 
  He noted that many South Africans were gravely concerned 
about the future of the country which was going "through a 
difficult time" and urged all South Africans to re-commit 
themselves to peace. 
  Mr Mandela discouraged supporters from carrying weapons and 
said "neither we the ANC and the IFP should carry unlicensed 
weapons to prevent the killing of innocent people" and to ensure 
a free and fair election. 
  Refer6ing to slain SACP secretary general who was gunned 
down 
by assassin Janusz Walus in his Dawn Park, Boksburg, home on 
April 10 last year, Mr Mandela said Mr Hani was a "true patriot" 
who died preaching peace. 
  Mr Mandela told supporters the greatest tribute they could 
pay to Chris Hani's memory was to elect a democratic government 
in South Africa to provide "a better life for all". He said Mr 
Hani had died an untimely death but not in vain. Mr Hani, he 
said, stood for peace, democracy and justice which also 
underlined the ANC's policy. 
  Two shots rang out as the rally ended but no incidents were 
reported in Soweto west of Johannesburg during the gathering. 
  A police spotter plane and helicopter monitored the rally 
from above and a small SADF contingent presence was maintained 
directly outside the stadium. Security arrangements with the 
security forces had been discussed ahead of the rally to ensure 
it ran without incident.

  [Text] Commemorative services on the East Rand, Soweto, and 
the Western and Eastern Cape to commemorate the assassination of 
Mr. Chris Hani a year ago, have ended peacefully, but in 
Pietermaritzburg a rally had to be canceled when about 600 
people threatened to disrupt the activities. 
  Thousands of people packed the Orlando Stadium in Soweto 
where they were addressed by Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Hani's 
widow, Limpo. The rally was preceded by talks between the ANC 
and the police after the ANC had received reports of plans to 
disrupt the meeting. Rallies on the East Rand were initially 
prohibited in terms of emergency regulations but went ahead 
after talks with the police. 
  Members of the National Peace-keeping Force were deployed on 
the East Rand for the first time to monitor the rallies. REUTER 
reports that troops barred 50 armed right wingers from laying 
wreaths on graves of whites at the Elspark Cemetery in Boksburg, 
where Mr. Hani's family gathered.

<F P=106> [Report by Ernest Oelofse] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 9 SAPA -- A row is brewing 
between East London newspaper THE DAILY DISPATCH and Mrs Winnie 
Mandela, the president of the African National Congress Women's 
League. According to the newspaper a secret ANC report, in which 
it was found that Mrs Mandela had stolen money from and 
defrauded her own party to the tune of hundreds of thousands of 
rands, was leaked to a DISPATCH correspondent in Cape Town. 
  A recent report in the DISPATCH said the ANC was still 
trying 
to work out how much money was missing. Mrs Mandela, who is 
widely tipped as a future cabinet minister in the new South 
Africa, had refused to appear before an ANC commission into the 
affair headed by late ANC chief Oliver Tambo, it said. 
  The ANC commission's report, claimed the DISPATCH, had found 
that Mrs Mandela had been caught counting piles of United States 
dollars and cheques after a visit to the United States. The 
money was "donations" Mrs Mandela had collected during her visit 
and had failed to declare to the ANC. 
  There was also evidence that Mrs Mandela had pocketed 
"substantial" amounts of interest yielded by funds deposited 
into her account. These funds were legally destined for the 
ANC's social welfare department. 
  Mrs Mandela is also suspected in the ANC report, according 
to 
the dispatch, of taking an alleged R190,000 [rand] "kickback" on 
a farm bought by the ANC for returning exiles. The price paid 
for the Walkerville property was R350,000, yet it was only worth 
R160,000. Mrs Mandela was a main party in the deal. 
  According to the ANC report, Mrs Mandela had admitted 
shaving 
R74,000 off a donation destined for the ANC's social welfare 
department. The money had, to date, not been paid back. A 
statement issued by Mrs Mandela on Saturday said she had 
instructed her lawyers to undertake litigation against the 
DISPATCH.

  [Text] The leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand 
Viljoen, says his party still has to sign two agreements with 
the ANC before the elections. Addressing a public meeting in 
Vereeniging, Gen. Viljoen said the first dealt with procedures 
for counting votes to establish Afrikaner support for a 
volkstaat [homeland]. It would also make provision for 
community councils for areas outside the volkstaat to enable 
Afrikaners who did not live in the volkstaat to keep in touch 
with the volkstaat government. Gen. Viljoen said it was hoped 
that the agreement could be signed within days. 
  He said the second agreement would define the term self- 
determination. Gen. Viljoen said it was necessary to define the 
term to avoid any misunderstanding after the election. It also 
enabled people voting for a volkstaat to know exactly what they 
were voting for. He said he insisted on as many representatives 
at foreign embassies as possible to be present at the signing of 
the accords to forestall a turnabout by the ANC after the 
election .

<F P=106> [Report by Claire Roberston] </F>
  [Text] Dwarfed by a two-metre-high arrangement of 
drift-wood and strelitzias in the lobby of the Freedom Front's 
[FF] new offices, General Constand Viljoen's daughter-in-law is 
making soothing sounds. "But if the volk [people] doesn't 
vote," Sharon Viljoen tells a caller, "we have nothing". 
  Convincing the volk to vote this month is the uphill battle 
being waged by the small Freedom Front from its smart new 
offices in the Pretoria suburb of Lynwood, at public meetings, 
on the telephone and on "Why you should vote" tape cassettes, 
available for a donation of R[Rand]5. 
  Relatives make tea and man the phones, and the press 
secretary straps on his side-arm to double as a bodyguard. The 
mood of urgent elation infects the group of largely Afrikaner 
Volksfront defectors -- except perhaps Dr Pieter Mulder, veteran 
campaigner newly cast from the comfortable, watertight 
organisation of the Conservative Party [CP]. "No party lists, 
no voters rolls...It makes me nervous from a profession a point 
of view. One day, the lines are jammed -- but then, it only 
takes 20 people to jam the lines." 
  Former AVF [Afrikaner National Front] head and now Freedom 
Front leader General Viljoen is nervous, too. With no party 
political background, he cannot appreciate the organisational 
feat of nine regional offices and a headquarters being set up 
within a week. Every morning he heads a strategy meeting of his 
handful of troops and then, as the Front's single greatest asset 
in this election of personalities, he begins his punishing 
schedule of between one and three meetings a day. In East Rand 
towns and beyond, his stern-jawed face adorns every lamppost, 
courtesy of the at least R400,000 [rand] in election funds the 
Front has received in terms of the Electoral Act. But, only a 
few weeks old and tottering to its feet, the Freedom Front is in 
danger of being hoisted by its own rooi/swartgevaar [red black 
threat] petard. 
  "We have programmed them for years to see April 27 as 
doomsday, to believe that to vote is to surrender," says CP MP 
and now Freedom Front campaign manager Corne Mulder. 
  The Right have also made much capital out of a decades-old 
fear and mistrust of the "Communist anti-Christ", as the African 
National Congress is known in these circles. Now the FF has a 
few weeks in which to convince its followers to vote, and to 
trust the ANC's word. 
  There are three right-wing approaches to the election, says 
Dr Mulder: 
  "We can pretend it isn't happening. 
  "Or we can recognise there is a massive tidal wave, 30 
stories high, that will hit South Africa 18 days from now. (We 
can) stand on the beach, put our hands up and say `Stop!'. 
  "Or we can say, how do I use the energy of the wave? To do 
this I need a surfboard, and I need it fast. "The Freedom Front 
is that surfboard." [quotation marks as published] 
  Conservative Party MP Tom Langley, top right-wing negotiator 
and AVF executive member, is a member of the group clinging to 
the Canute option. But he looks set to climb on the surfboard: 
Spotted entering General Viljoen's office on Thursday morning, 
he later concedes he will probably vote -- for the Freedom Front. 
  "My personal opinion is that there is no hope of getting a 
volkstaat [homeland] before April 27." 
  As General Viljoen tells a meeting in Vereeniging that 
night: 
"If there is a volkstaat before April 25, fine. If not, voting 
is the next best option." 
  As the Freedom Front campaign gathers momentum -- and sheds 
any association with the neo-Nazi right-wing fringe -- so do the 
crowds increase. Six hundred at the first meeting in 
Potchefstroom last week, twice that number if Vereeniging on 
Thursday. 
  An Iscor executive at the Vereeniging meeting had learned 
the 
right-wing lesson well. "I will never vote. It is better to 
die on your feet than live on your knees." He and thousands of 
others like him, according to Dr Mulder, cannot get beyond 
Nelson Mandela's public vow that there will not be a volkstaat 
-- although Dr Mulder takes ghoulish comfort in the 75-year-old 
ANC president's rider "in my lifetime." 
  Polls show more than 70 percent of rightwingers are 
determined to vote -- but not all are convinced the FF is their 
best option. "I would have considered voting for the CP, the 
National Party or the Democratic Party," said a Vereeniging 
pensioner at a Viljoen meeting on Thursday night. "I will 
listen to the Freedom Front, because I respect the general. But 
I think a vote for the NP is a stronger vote against the ANC." 
  The Front believes it has in hand a deal which offers not 
only opposition to the "communist alliance", but the only hope 
of attaining a volkstaat. Volkstaters this year negotiated 
crucial amendments to the constitution, allowing for the 
establishment of a 20-member council whose task will be to 
convince parliament that a volkstaat is desirable and feasible. 
No guarantees are given that it will then be established -- but 
the constitution does specifically provide for any volkstaat 
boundaries to override provincial boundaries in that event. 
This constitutional amendment is a window of opportunity 
granted to the volkstaters; if they do not record enough support 
on April 27-28, it will close. 
  "If you do not support me, if we do not get massive support, 
we will get no volkstaat," General Viljoen warned the 
Vereeniging audience. The only path then open would be the one 
espoused by rightwingers boycotting the election: insurrection. 
  A 21-one-year-old businessman at Viljoen's meeting, mindful 
no doubt of the Bophuthatswana execution of Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members, 
reacted to this option: "If a war starts, I will leave for 
Holland the next day." 
  To the Freedom Front this national, multiracial election is 
not a plebiscite of 22-million South Africans, but a referendum 
of 2.8- million Afrikaners. An accord with the ANC and National 
Party has been drawn up, allowing special counting procedures at 
the 1,000-odd polling stations in predominantly white areas, to 
determine volkstaat support. 
  "The ANC wants to accommodate us -- not because they like 
us, 
but they realise that up to 90 percent of the boere [farmers] 
with a small 'b' are also Boere, capital B," said Dr Mulder. 
"Our people are the farmers, and the ANC is desperate to ensure 
food security." 
  For now, his battle is to convince the Right that attaining 
the dream of a volkstaat is "not just a question of putting up a 
poster and saying this is our volkstaat".

    [Editorial Report] Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 10 
April on page 9 carries a three-quarter-page advertisement for 
the Freedom Front (FF). The top eighth of the ad features the 
slogan: THE FREEDOM FRONT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE! In the middle 
of the ad, taking up more than half the space is a scale with 
weights on both sides. The left hand side has three weights of 
different sizes. The biggest is marked ANC, the next NP 
(National Party) and the smallest has the SACP's (South African 
Communist Party) hammer and sickle. On the right side of the 
scale is one big weight marked Freedom Front, and below that the 
words "throw your weight in behind Gen. Viljoen and the Freedom 
Front now." Below this are the words: "If you vote against the 
ANC/Communists (and you must chose between the NP and the 
Freedom Front), remember: 

  -  Vote for a party that did not yield to the ANC throughout 
the negotiations. 
  -  Vote for a party that did not alienate moderate partners such 
as Inkatha, Bop (Bophuthatswana), and Ciskei. 
  -  Vote for a party that did not break its election promises. 
  -  Vote for a party that is not in alliance with the ANC/SACP 
behind the scenes. Do not allow the NP to catch you again with 
hollow promises." 

    Directly below the scale are the words: "Trust Gen. Viljoen 
and the Freedom Front to make the difference." To the left of 
this is a photograph of Gen. Viljoen, and alongside it "FREEDOM 
FRONT" and the party's logo. Above the scale appear the words: 
"The NP has been weighed...and found to be too light.

  [Text] Independent Electoral Commissioners Dikgang Moseneke 
and Gay McDougall say that the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] has the capability to conduct an election in 
kwaZulu-Natal. Speaking after a brief tour of the region Miss 
McDougall and Advocate Moseneke said they had found that the 
majority of people in the region anted to participate in the 
elections. Mr. Moseneke said the IEC would be flexible in the 
way it organized the elections there, and where necessary it 
would shift voter stations out of trouble zones to the border of 
South Africa and kwaZulu. He said security would be stepped up 
and the routes to the voting stations protected by the SADF 
[South African Defense Force].

  [Text] With the countdown display at the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] reception registering 19 days to go 
before the election, 193,000 electoral officers -- who will have 
to run the voting stations during the three days of the poll -- 
still have to be trained or have their training upgraded. 
  The final training programme, which will equip them for 
their 
duties at the stations, is only due to kick in next week and 
will continue until April 24. 
  Training of electoral officers who have specialised 
functions 
-- such as counting the votes -- will continue right up until 
the election. 
  The tasks facing the IEC in the three short weeks before the 
election are daunting, and international observers working with 
the commission are convinced it is too late for the massive 
election operation to be implemented as originally planned. "We 
are concerned that they have left it too late," an insider said 
diplomatically. "But there is nothing to be done except to push 
ahead." 
  The outstanding tasks include: 
  -- The training of more than 12,000 electoral monitors, who 
will be the eyes and ears of the IEC on the ground during the 
poll and will help the commission decide whether the election 
has been free and fair. 
  The IEC has 8,171 monitors in hand, with another 2,300 due 
to 
join them at the end of the week. The cut-off date for the 
training of monitors is April 17. Their deployment around the 
country has not yet been finalised. 
  -- The location of nearly 3,000 polling stations around the 
country. Of the 8,500 stations, 5,740 have been designated. 
  Equipment for all the stations has been ordered and it is 
planned that everything will be in place three days before the 
election. 
  In addition, the National Electoral Observer Network (Neon), 
which is accredited by the IEC, this week began recruiting the 
50,000 local observers they hope to have in place for the poll. 
  The observers -- who can only report incidents to the IEC's 
election monitors -- are expected to provide vital support to 
the monitors who will be stretched thin on the ground during the 
poll. 
  The national co-ordinator of the network, Stiaan van der 
Merwe, complained: "The IEC is paying very little attention to 
making this work, despite good arrangements being made". 
  But the IEC's chief media officer, Pieter Cronje, is not 
unduly worried. "Our election readiness plan is computerised, 
and when you look at the graphics we are on target," he said. 
  The logistical problems are not the only ones currently 
besetting the IEC. One insider said that while the commission 
was being pushed on by "plenty of good people working helluva 
hard", the operation has picked up "underqualified freeloaders 
who walk around waiting for their beepers to go off for lunch." 
  The IEC has almost 180,000 people on its payroll and the 
number is growing as more operations get under way. And, 
although many staffers are equipped with cars, beepers and 
cellular phones, they seem to have difficulty communicating with 
each other and bureaucratic snarl-ups have proved a constant 
hindrance. 
  Last week, over 200 monitors threatened to go on strike 
after 
they did not receive salaries. 
  "They are there to represent civil society but they have 
assumed a kind of bureaucratic attitude which is not explained 
by the pressures of time. They are not transparent at all," 
said Van der Merwe, who is trying to co-ordinate Neon's 
observers with the commission. 
  Cronje responded: "Any large body of people working together 
will produce complaints about process and product. We have to 
work fast."

  [Text] Members of the biggest contingent of Commonwealth 
observers put together to monitor an election have begun 
arriving in Johannesburg. The Commonwealth secretary general, 
Emeka Anyaoku, arrived in South Africa on Friday [8 April] and 
will brief members of the mission who are already here. Former 
Jamaican prime minister, Michael Manley, who will lead the 
120-strong Commonwealth Observers' Group to South Africa, is 
expected to arrive on Wednesday. The aim of the mission is to 
form an independent judgment on whether conditions exist for a 
free election, and if the result of the election reflects the 
will of the people. Mission members will be deployed throughout 
the country from 16 April.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Schnehage] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The arrival of 
additional high-ranking observers from more than 30 member 
countries makes the Commonwealth Observer Group to South Africa 
(COGSA) the largest election observer group yet assembled by the 
Commonwealth. 
  COGSA will be headed by former Jamaican Prime Minister 
Michael Manley and will include political figures, 
parliamentarians and election experts. 
  The group's deputy chairman, former New Zealand Governor 
General Sir Paul Reeves, told reporters in Johannesburg on 
Monday COGSA would concentrate its efforts on the Natal and PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions -- the two ?reas 
most likely to be problematic during the election. 
  Sir Paul said COGSA's main task would be to submit a report 
on whether or not the election was free and fair. A core group 
of 60 additional observers would join Commonwealth personnel 
already on the ground, including members of the Commonwealth 
Observer Mission to South Africa. 
  According to a statement issued at Monday's informal news 
briefing, COGSA would "observe all relevant aspects of the 
organisation and conduct of the elections in accordance with the 
law". 
  The group would act "impartially and independently" to form 
"an independent judgement as to whether conditions exist for a 
free expression of will by the electors and if the result of the 
election reflects the wishes of the people". 
  A preliminary COGSA report would be submitted before the 
announcement of the election results whereafter a final report 
on its findings would be submitted to Commonwealth Secretary 
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku. The final report would be 
forwarded to the South African Government, political parties and 
commonwealth heads of governments.

  [Text] East London April 10 SAPA -- International and local 
observers were labelled "CIA agents" by a PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] official at a funeral in Ngangelizwe, Transkei, on 
Saturday [9 April]. 
  A schoolboy who reportedly tried to take a short cut through 
the stadium where the funeral was taking place, was shot and 
killed, allegedly by a PAC marshal. 
  The funeral, on Saturday, was of the chairman of the PAC's 
Port St Johns branch, Mr Mvumelwano Mapipa, killed in a shooting 
incident on the Port St Johns-Umtata road last month. 
  A member of the PAC's Transkei executive, Mr Victor Zamela, 
told the crowd of about 300 that United Nations, international 
church monitors for peace and network of independent monitors 
observers in the stadium were "CIA agents", and that they were 
there to foil the PAC's struggle for freedom. 
  Earlier, a Ngangelizwe schoolboy, Xola Jafta, was shot dead 
at the stadium, allegedly by a PAC marshal. 
  A source said the youth had apparently been trying to take a 
recognised short cut through the stadium grounds to shops on the 
other side, and got into an argument with a marshal. "This PAC 
marshal took a gun and shot him right in the chest," he said. 
  When the police were summoned, the marshals fled, and the 
PAC 
leadership made no attempt to help the police, the source said. 
Jafta was dead on arrival at Umtata hospital, he said. 
  Speakers at the ceremony also claimed the ANC was 
responsible 
for Mr Mapipa's death, and attacked Transkei ruler Major General 
Bantu Holomisa, saying the PAC had protected Transkei and now 
Transkei was turning against them. 
  The comments came only two days after IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission]-brokered peace talks in Umtata between the 
ANC and PAC. 
  The talks, called to halt months of violence in the Port St 
Johns area, ended with a commitment from both sides to an 
immediate truce, and to a peace summit.

Umtata on Wednesday [13 April], Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen 
Bantu Holomisa told supporters at Qumbu on Monday. The African 
National Congress candidate said the IEC had agreed to increase 
the number of cards from 200,000 after a meeting with the ANC. 
  Gen Holomisa again warned Transkeians not to accept food 
from 
the National Party because maize meal and sausages had been 
laced with a chemical which would prevent imbibers from voting. 
He promised residents his government would investigate claims 
that homeland police and soldiers, ANC and South African 
Communist Party members were linked to crime in Qumbu.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] would not hesitate to prosecute 
employers who retained their employees' temporary voter cards 
against their will, the IEC said in a statement on Monday [11 
April]. It said it had come to the attention of the IEC's 
Investigation Department, via reports from specialist monitors 
in the Western Cape, that temporary voter cards were in some 
instances being retained by farmers on behalf of their workers. 
  This also appeared to be the practice among some employers 
in 
the Western Cape. 
  According to Advocate [Lawyer] Nicholas Tee, national 
co-ordinator of the IEC's Investigation Department, the IEC 
would investigate any complaints lodged by any workers who 
alleged their cards had been retained by their employers against 
their will. 
  "The practice of retaining temporary voter cards and id 
documents for employees is injudicious. If it is found to have 
occurred without the consent of the worker, prosecution in terms 
of the Electoral Act and prescribed regulations will follow 
immediately," the IEC said.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler has written to 
the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to warn that its 
timetable to inaugurate a new government may have to change. The 
judge reminded the TEC in a letter that his commission had up to 
10 days to decide whether the election was "substantially free 
and fair". 
  The TEC has decided on a series of dates to inaugurate South 
Africa's new national and provincial governments. 
  They are May 5 for the inauguration of the nine provincial 
assemblies, May 6 for the inauguration of the national assembly 
and May 10 for the inauguration of the new state president. 
  In terms of the Electoral Act, the IEC may not pronounce the 
elections free and fair within two days after the election. The 
law gives the IEC another eight days in which to hear electoral 
disputes. 
  An IEC spokesman said the IEC had until May 9 to declare the 
elections free and fair. If it took this long, the TEC's 
inauguration dates would have to be changed. 
  Although both TEC and IEC sources said the judge was merely 
pointing out the legal position, he was also pointing out the 
possibility of a delay that would have practical implications 
for the logistics of the transition. 
  The period between the end of the elections and the 
inauguration of a new government could see the multiparty TEC 
assuming effective control of the government, a TEC source said. 
  "There has been concern about who is in charge after the 
elections. This may mean that the TEC will have to take 
control," the source said. 
  He pointed out that in normal democracies, the levers of 
power are held by the former government until a new government 
takes charge. But if the ruling national party loses by a 
landslide and if there is an electoral dispute, the TEC may have 
to step into the vacuum. 
  The TEC's management committee which comprises, among 
others, 
of members of government, the NP, the African National Congress 
and the South African Communist Party, was due to meet for the 
last time on April 25. 
  However, the management committee has now decided that it 
will meet again on April 29, ostensibly to wrap up its affairs. 
  The TEC source said the question of who would control the 
security forces in the period between the election and the 
inauguration of a new government had been referred to legal 
advisers after a dispute about the issue in the TEC-appointed 
joint military command council.

  [Text] Pretoria April 9 SAPA -- The rightwing "burgerraad" 
[citizens' council] of Pretoria says that because of the history 
of the Union Buildings it would be unwise to inaugurate the new 
state president at this venue. In a statement sent to the main 
South African political players, the South African Police, 
foreign embassies and the media, the burgerraad called for an 
alternative site to be used. A copy of the statement sent to 
SAPA said no-one could guarantee security at an event which was 
expected to draw the biggest crowd ever in the history of the 
country. 
  It called for an alternative site to be used, saying no-one 
could guarantee security at an event which was expected to draw 
the biggest crowd ever in the history of the country. [as 
received] 
  The burgerraad argued that most of the people living in the 
vicinity of the Union Buildings were Afrikaners and the 
inauguration could lead to "bitterness" among these citizens. 
Unlike a sports stadium, the Union Buildings could not 
accommodate a massive crowd of people. Up to 300,000 could 
attend the inauguration on May 9 or 10, it said. Also, the 
union building was an ideal place for a sniper attack and crowd 
control would be next to impossible.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumbra] </F>
  [Text] Will Thabo Mbeki or Cyril Ramaphosa be deputy 
president of South Africa in a month's time? And if it's 
Ramaphosa, will Pik Botha hang on to his post as Foreign 
Minister? 
  The imminence of the election -- now just 17 days away -- is 
sparking furious debate in political circles about who will be 
occupying key posts in the new coalition Cabinet after the 
voting is over, according to reliable sources. Intense interest 
is focused on the race for one of two deputy presidencies 
provided for in the Interim Constitution. 
  Polls suggest that F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the party 
likely to come second in the election, will win one of the 
posts. But ANC leader Nelson Mandela -- the overwhelming 
favourite for president -- will have to choose the second deputy 
president from his own ranks. Mbeki and Ramaphosa are regarded 
as the top contenders, with Mbeki's seniority in his favour, and 
Ramaphosa's stronger showing on the ANC list boosting his 
chances. 
  The outcome could affect Botha's future. If Mbeki were not 
to achieve the deputy presidency, he would be a very strong 
candidate for the Foreign Ministry. As incumbent president, De 
Klerk's most senior Cabinet Minister, Botha -- now the 
longest-serving foreign minister in the world -- is certain to 
be one of the NP MPs to be included in the Cabinet which is to 
be announced early next month. 
  ANC sources said debate on the new Cabinet was now at an 
advanced stage within the organisation. 
  The national executive committee had been scheduled to 
discuss the issue and make recommendations on the issue this 
week, but the meeting was postponed until next week because of 
yesterday's four- way summit of leaders to discuss "the Natal 
problem". 
  Mbeki and Ramaphosa are the two main candidates for the 
position of South Africa's first deputy president, who will come 
from the biggest party if no more than one other party wins more 
than 20 percent of the vote. The ANC sources said there were 
sensitivities over this discussion, with each man's camp making 
a strong claim for the position. Ramaphosa's backers argued 
that as the candidate placed immediately after Mandela on the 
ANC's national election list, he should be heir-apparent to the 
septuagenarian ANC leader. Mbeki's supporters -- many in the ANC 
Youth League -- said he had been placed second on regional 
lists, and claimed that as the list which saw Ramaphosa 
leap-frogging to second spot was a result of the national 
conference attended by party bosses, it did not represent "the 
will of the people". 
  Should Mbeki get the deputy presidency, Botha -- whose only 
other challenger is said to be ANC deputy international affairs 
director Aziz Pahad -- is almost assured of the Foreign Affairs 
post. 
  In terms of the Interim Constitution, South Africa's new 
president will be obliged to appoint Ministers from parties 
which have polled at least 5 percent of the vote "on the advice 
of the parties to which the relevant portfolios have been 
allocated."

    [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 
on 10 April in the Business Times Supplement on page 6 carries a 
full-page advertisement from the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC]. The Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 11 April on 
page 11 carries an almost identical full-page advertisement, 
omitting the last two sentences. The text is as follows: 
  "A message from the TEC to all public servants 
including members of the security forces in South Africa, the 
TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and the 
self-governing territories 
  "In less than three weeks' time South Africa will be 
participating in a unique and historic event: the elections of 
26/27/28 April 1994. 
  "It is in the interests of all South Africans that this 
crucial and important phase of the South African transition to a 
non-racial and non-sexist democracy be peaceful and successful. 
  "This election will relegate past differences to history and 
usher in a new era of hope, reconcilliation and prosperity for 
all South Africans. 
  "At the same time the TEC is aware of: 
  "-- The increasing concern among public servants, including 
members of the security forces, about their future, pensions and 
salaries. 
  "-- Strikes and rumours about strikes. 
  "-- Concern about promotions and job security. 
  "The TEC has already taken concrete steps to address these 
concerns and problems: 
  "1. Public servants are being made aware of the provisions 
of the Constitution of South Africa which comes into effect on 
27 April 1994. In terms of section 236 of the Constitution, a 
person who was immediately before 27 April employed by any 
department of state (including a police force), administration, 
military force or other institution performing government 
functions shall continue in such employment. Furthermore, there 
is clear and unambiguous provision that -- 
  "(a) the terms and conditions of such employment shall 
continue to apply; 
  "(b) the pensionable salary or pensionable salary scale of 
such a public servant shall not be reduced; and 
  "(c) there shall be a Public Service Commission which shall 
exercise its powers relating to public administration fairly, 
impartially and independently. 
  "2. Although the Constitution comes into operation only on 
27 April 1994, the TEC has, on the basis of the provisions of 
the Constitution guaranteed all public servants their jobs, 
salaries and pensions. 
  "3. Certain steps have already been taken by the TEC in 
preparation for the implementation of the Constitution: a task 
force of the TEC was appointed to deal specifically with the 
concerns of public servants and to co-ordinate the participation 
of all public servant organisations in the preparation for 
rationalisation of the various public services. 
  "4. This task force has already intervened in specific 
instances to assist in restoring normality and addressing 
concerns of public servants. 
  "5. Where necessary, as in the case of the concerns of 
members of the South African Police and Correctional Services, 
the Management Committee of the TEC will meet organisations of 
public servants to address problems. 
  "The is convinced that the elections cannot and must not be 
postponed. It is vital that the elections proceed in an 
effective and organised fashion, without any disruption. 
  "Public servants are essential to the success of the 
elections. 
  "Your dedication to serving our country and your skills are 
indispensable to a successful transition. 
  "In the interests of a peaceful and democratic future for 
our 
country. 
  "The TEC urgently appeals to all public servants 
  "a) to accept the assurance from the TEC that their future 
is secure after 27 April 1994 and that in the meantime any 
urgent problem will receive the necessary attention; 
  "b) to give their full support and participation to the 
administration and security of the election; and 
  "c) to take part in the process of rationalisation of the 
public services, to accept responsibility for ensuring a 
democratic and peaceful transition, and to refrain from any 
action, particularly strike action, which can benefit only those 
who want to disrupt the elections. 
  "A successful election will lead to a stable country and an 
effective government that can, as a matter of urgency, attend to 
the concerns and problems of public servants. 
  "The TEC calls on all public servants, including members of 
the security forces, to play their part."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by Janine Lazarus] </F>
  [Text] Members of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] 
might be linked to Eskom's sale of arms to the kwaZulu Police. 
On March 25, the day the parastatal announced it had uncovered 
and cancelled plans to sell 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to an 
arms dealer for resale to the kwaZulu Police, 10 weapons were 
signed out of Eskom's arsenal and loaded into a truck parked 
outside Eskom's Megawatt Park headquarters. A source within 
Eskom said the truck was accompanied by a number of other 
vehicles, including a grey Mercedes-Benz bearing the 
registration NVB131T. Senior police sources said this week that 
the Mercedes was registered in the name of the NIS at a Skinner 
Street, Pretoria, address. 
  According to official Eskom documents in WEEKEND STAR's 
possession, two transactions for the removal of 20 LM-4 
semi-automatic rifles to an unknown destination took place two 
weeks ago. The weapons were apparently checked out to a 
"bearer". WEEKEND STAR knows the identity of the "bearer", but 
for legal reasons cannot name the person. 
  Eskom officials insist that the "bearer" is not one of their 
employees. A form authorising removal from Eskom stores was 
signed by Eskom manager Johan van der Walt, who, with Eskom 
security head Floris Bonthuys, was suspended last week after the 
utility investigated the weapons deal. The weapons then 
mysteriously returned to the stores. 
  Repeated attempts to find out from the NIS, Eskom and the 
State President's office failed to establish what an NIS vehicle 
was doing at Eskom, the identity of the "bearer" who signed for 
the weapons, and why further weapons were being sold after Eskom 
had publicly undertaken not to sell arms. 
  An NIS spokesman, who refused to be named, denied that his 
organisation was linked to any arms deal between Eskom and the 
kwaZulu Police. "There is no question whatsoever that we could 
be involved there. We do have contact from time to time. It's 
formal liaison -- just a question of talking about what things 
are like. Then we drive to the front door." 
  The spokesman at first refused to take down the 
Mercedes-Benz's registration details, but then agreed to check 
the information. He called back later to say the information 
was wrong, and attempted to support this by quoting a different 
registration number, which he said belonged to a BMW registered 
to a financial house in Orkney. He laughed when he was told the 
information had been gleaned from reliable police sources. "And 
you trust them?" he asked. 
  The police sources double-checked their information and 
confirmed that the registration number noted at Megawatt Park at 
the time of the arms deal belonged to the NIS. 
  An Eskom spokesman, given the name of the mysterious 
"bearer" 
and asked who he was, said the only people who would know were 
the two suspended Eskom employees who set up the weapons deal. 
"And is it fair to worry them after they have been suspended?" 
he asked. 
  Late last Thursday Eskom's public affairs senior general 
manager Bongani Khumalo promised he would come up with some 
answers. After arranging a meeting last Friday to clear things 
up, he referred WEEKEND STAR to Eskom's acting chief executive, 
Dr George Lindeque. "We've designated him spokesman on this." 
However, Lindeque was not prepared to clear up the mystery 
surrounding the NIS vehicle. "We have appointed an 
investigative committee," he said. I can't pre-empt any finding 
right now and it would not be right to comment on any of the 
findings. We are going to go public on all the findings." 
  Richard Carter, President's Office communications department 
director, said his office was "grateful" for the information 
provided, but said it was "impossible" to make any comment. "I 
will pass it on to the people concerned," he said, and referred 
WEEKEND STAR to the NIS -- which was, after all, where we had 
started.

  [Excerpts] Pretoria April 9 SAPA -- The National 
Intelligence Service [NIS] on Saturday [9 April] strongly denied 
a published report saying its members "might" be linked to the 
sale of arms by electricity supply giant Eskom to the kwaZulu 
Police. The WEEKEND STAR reported members of the NIS "might be 
linked to Eskom's sale of arms to the kwaZulu Police. [passage 
omitted] 
  But on Saturday the NIS said in a statement the Service 
strongly denied it was in any way involved. It regretted the 
publication of the report, especially after the reporter 
concerned had been provided with the "correct facts". The NIS 
was to refer the matter to the Media Council in light of the 
newspaper's treatment of the Service, said the statement. It 
added that because of the sensitivity concerning the 
availability of weapons in South Africa, the NIS was also to 
approach the Goldstone Commission in an attempt to establish if 
there had been any bad faith (kwader trou) attempt to involve 
the NIS in the matter.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Eskom [Electricity 
Supply Commission] said on Monday [11 April] it had agreed with 
the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of 
Metalworkers of South Africa and South African Iron and Steel to 
conduct an urgent investigation into alleged arms sales by some 
employees of the parastatal. 
  To be co-ordinated by the Independent Mediation Services of 
South Africa [IMSSA], the investigation will focus on further 
arms sales and the position of surplus arms in Eskom in relation 
to security, the possibility of some employees within Eskom 
supporting destabilisation, and political conflict within Eskom 
in relation to possible interruption of electricity supplies. 
  Eskom said it and the three trade unions were drawing up 
terms of reference for submission to the IMSSA commission of 
inquiry. Last month, two Eskom employees were suspended after 
they apparently concluded a deal to sell scores of surplus 
weapons from the company to the kwaZulu Police.

  [Text] Are you physically, intellectually and morally brave 
and enterprising with self-discipline, an open mind, 
objectivity, selflessness and dedication? 
  Would you like to work in a "new South African" organisation 
with a non-racial, non-sexist recruitment policy, updated 
management systems, formal labour relations practices and 
specialist training which concentrates on developing human 
resources to the utmost? 
  If so, you should join "one of the oldest professions in the 
world". In case you have the wrong idea, this is intelligence- 
gathering, according to a recruitment brochure of the National 
Intelligence Service [NIS]. 
  Under the heading "It's time for the true facts about the 
National Intelligence Service," the glossy handout explains that 
the NIS regularly distributes "products" to 150 "clients", 
including the state president, state departments and 
interdepartmental committees. 
  It says that because of the secrecy that surrounds it, the 
intelligence profession is beset by "the most misperceptions and 
ignorance." 
  In fact it renders a service that cannot be obtained 
elsewhere, while its "systematic way of processing intelligence" 
ensures that "the NIS does not spread unconfirmed rumours". 
  To reassure the tender of conscience, the NIS insists it is 
not above the law and that "extensive legislation dictates its 
activities", that it is "under no circumstances an instrument in 
the hands of a political party", that it has no executive 
powers, and that secrecy "does not imply a violation of human 
rights; it is however necessary to safeguard sensitive 
information". 
  It insists that it does not use "poisoned umbrella tips", 
but 
adds that advanced technology is an "important aspect of the 
current intelligence world". 
  According to the brochure, the NIS has a defensive counter- 
intelligence function which includes safeguarding information, 
VIPs, installations and equipment, "as well as neutralising 
foreign intelligence operations." It says brightly: "Although 
South Africa now has more friends than earlier, we are not so 
naive to believe that we only have friends." 
  Most information is obtainable from the media or is 
collected 
openly, the brochure says. But it concedes "we do snoop...", 
explaining: "It is important to also obtain essential 
information in a clandestine manner, employing covert agents and 
technological capabilities." 
  If you are interested you will need, in addition to the 
sterling qualities listed above, a tertiary education for most 
posts. You will also be subject to security clearances and 
psychometric tests. The brochure provides no address for 
applications.

  [Text] The African National Congress has warned members of 
the South African Police not to embark on a proposed strike in 
two weeks' time. ANC spokesman Pravin Gordhan said the police 
should not become participants in disrupting and sabotaging the 
elections. He said they should instead become part of the 
process of protecting the election to ensure it was free and 
fair.

  [Text] Cape Town April 9 SAPA -- The Police Prisons and 
Civil Rights Union [Popcru] has threatened to embark on mass 
action if its dismissed and suspended members are not 
reinstated, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reported on Saturday [9 April]. This follows the alleged 
failure of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) and the 
Department of Correctional Services and Justice to address the 
union's grievances. Speaking in Cape Town, the union's regional 
chairman, Mr Nathan Ramalane, condemned the TEC for not acceding 
to Popcru's demands.

  [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] is set to 
treble the election allowance paid to about 80,000 police 
officers in an attempt to avert a threatened strike. An 
announcement expected on Tuesday [12 April] will increase the 
daily payment to police on active duty from R22.50 [rand] to 
R61.50 -- equal to the total allowances granted to National 
Peacekeeping Force members. 
  A police general said a top-level decision to back the SA 
[South African] Police Union appeal to the TEC for substantial 
increases in pay between the ranks of constable and colonel was 
made on Friday. 
  A memo signed by Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe 
late 
on Friday supporting the daily allowance increase is expected to 
be distributed in the force tomorrow.

  [Text] Five-hundred members of the ANC's armed wing, 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; MK], and the PAC's 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] military wing, APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army], have set aside their differences to undergo 
joint training. The soldiers are in the Zimbabwean capital, 
Harare, where they are being trained for their incorporation in 
the South African Defense Force with the knowledge of the South 
African Government. This report from the BBC in Harare. 
  [Begin recording] [BBC announcer] In the bush of Zimbabwe, 
this is the kind of training given to the future members of 
South Africa's unified defense force. Five-hundred men and 
women have been transformed from the guerrillas of yesterday to 
the regular soldiers of tomorrow. Bush fighters who spent their 
lives executing hit-and-run raids into South Africa have been 
taught how to foil their acts of sabotage which were their stock 
and trade. Members of the rival African National Congress and 
Pan Africanist Congress have buried their differences to train 
side by side. 
  [MK Commander Siphiwe Nyanda] Well, it's not easy, but it's 
something we have to do. At the political level there is 
reconciliation, and at the military level as well. We have to 
work with our former adversaries. We found that in discussions, 
which have been going on up to now, that it's possible that they 
are also officers and professionals, and in the near future we 
will have to form one defense force. 
  [APLA Commander David Romero] Yes, there is political will, 
more especially on the part of the PAC, and I believe on the 
part of the ANC there's also that political will. That's why we 
are confident that we will ultimately reach a solution in our 
country. 
  [BBC announcer] They graduated early. Four months' training 
was squeezed into three to be ready in time for the elections. 
These are the elite -- future senior officers who will command 
key posts and confront the difficult task of integrating 
soldiers, their former enemies. 
  [Constantine Chiwange of the Zimbabwe Defense Force] Working 
with members of the past regime is not a problem, as long as 
they have accepted change, and they accept the fact that a black 
majority rule is inevitable. That is not a problem at all. And 
of course, once they have outgrown racism, that's not a problem. 
  [BBC announcer] Many white Zimbabwean soldiers fled their 
ranks after independence in 1980, taking their valuable 
experience with them. One lesson the Zimbabwean trainers have 
taught the South Africans is how to rebuild that knowledge. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Peter De Ionno] </F>
  [Text] The "Blue Berets" of the National Peacekeeping Force 
[NPKF] are to be deployed in township battle zones this week. 
On Tuesday [11 April], 1,300 members of Battalion 2 of the NPKF 
will leave the De Brug training camp near Bloemfontein for the 
East Rand, where they will take over from the SADF's [South 
African Defense Force] Group 41. Another 2,000 peacekeepers 
will be deployed from the base after further training. Other 
NPKF troops, being evaluated after their initial training at 
Koeberg near Cape Town, are expected to be sent to Natal in the 
last week of this month. 
  One of the three senior offices dismissed from the NPKF 
earlier this week, Captain Johan Loots, said he would begin 
legal steps tomorrow to challenge his sacking. The NPKF 
dismissed the officer for allegedly arranging an unauthorised 
media visit to the De Brug camp and dealing with the media 
without approval. Captain Loots, a media liaison officer 
seconded from the SAP [South African Police], said he had been 
made a scapegoat "because the NPKF has had negative publicity". 
"I always acted within the code of conduct," he said. 
  NPKF liaison officer Major Muff Anderson said certain media 
statements had "created antagonism between the troops and the 
TEC [Transitional Executive Council] ". Colonel Duma Mdutyana, 
NPKF chief of staff, and Lieutenant-Colonel George Sibanyoni, 
former commander of Battalion 1, were also relieved of their 
duties on April 5 after NPKF commander Major-General Gabriel 
Ramushwana was informed of court cases pending against them. 
  Colonel Mdutyana is facing a charge of drunken driving in an 
NPKF vehicle in Johannesburg on March 20. Colonel Sibanyoni was 
charged with culpable homicide after the NPKF vehicle he was 
driving was involved in a fatal accident in Mamelodi on the 
weekend of March 11-13.

  [Excerpt] The Inkatha Freedom Party has expressed strong 
opposition to the deployment of members of the ANC's military 
wing as part of the National Peacekeeping Force. Units of the 
force arrived in the Witwatersrand over the weekend and will be 
deployed in Thokoza and Katlehong, among others. 
  [Begin SABC reporter Andries van Zyl recording] At De Brug 
outside Bloemfontein, where the major part of the peacekeeping 
force is being trained, Television News was refused admission. 
We were told that instructions have been received that no news 
teams are to be allowed in as the force is going through final 
preparations before deployment. The seven companies of about 
1,800 men who have passed the training evaluation will be the 
first to be deployed. The pilot group was deployed in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] last week, but today 
there was some uncertainty as to whether all the seven companies 
will be sent there. Latest information is that the main force 
will leave De Brug by Wednesday and be deployed on Thursday. 
The five companies who have failed the evaluation are in the 
meantime being retrained. According to initial planning they 
will begin their duties next week. [end recording] 
  [Begin recording] [SABC reporter Jessica Pitchford] East of 
Johannesburg residents of Katlehong and Thokoza are growing 
accustomed to the soldiers in blue who arrived in the area at 
the weekend. The South African Defense Force [SADF] will 
withdraw from the area this week, after which the new 
peacekeeping force will begin patrolling the area. Members of 
the new force were being shown the ropes today by the defense 
force. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] East Rand region has condemned the deployment of 
National Peacekeeping Force members in the region. "Their 
deployment in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
areas, especially in Katlehong and Thokoza, is uncalled for," 
organiser Thabani Dlamnini said in a statement. 
  "We believe it is a force that is set to wipe out all those 
who do not obey the instructions of the National Party and the 
African National Congress. This is not a solution to our 
problem..."

<F P=106> [Report by E Oelofse] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 9 SAPA -- The National Hostel 
Residents Association [Nahora] says that from today it will be 
deploying its "own military" at hostels throughout South Africa 
and that the South African Defence Force [SADF] will "no longer 
be welcome at the hostels". In a telephone statement to SAPA on 
Saturday [9 April], Nahora spokesman Thulani Simon Mlotshwa said 
the decision had been taken because of events on March 28 in 
Johannesburg where Zulus were "butchered by Umkhonto We Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members who were assisted 
by security forces". 
  Moreover, hostels had been raided after the March 28 
massacre 
but not the African National Congress Johannesburg HQ which 
building had been at the centre of the violence, Mr Mlotshwa 
noted. "This, proves the partiality and bias of the so-called 
security forces," he said. 
  On Friday the East Rand Buyafuthi hostel was targeted by 
SADF 
troops who allegedly shot and killed Inkatha Freedom Party 
leader Jeff Sibiya, who, said Mr Mlotshwa, was involved in 
promoting peace in the area. 
  With this in mind, Nahora had decided it would be better to 
deploy its own military structures in defence of hostels and 
hostel residents. "From today our enemies had better be on 
their guard because we will be replying to all letters sent to 
us. We cannot sit with our arms folded while our heels are 
being bitten by mice."

  [Text] A prominent IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] youth 
leader, Mr. Jeff Sibiya, was killed in a shootout between the 
defense force and hostel residents at Katlehong early this 
morning. Coetzee Zietsman and cameraman Cedric Muller filed 
this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Zietsman] Trouble broke out in Katlehong 
early this morning. Two people died in a shootout between the 
defense force and residents of the Buyafuti hostel. Soldiers 
raided the hostel in search of weapons. They were allegedly 
fired upon and returned fire. Jeff Sibiya of the IFP Youth 
League died here and according to the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] he was caught in the crossfire. Troops urged 
upset residents to remain calm, but the message wasn't well 
received. The situation remained tense and soldiers kept a 
strong presence. Later Mr. Themba Khoza, the Transvaal 
organizer of the IFP, arrived on the scene to assess the 
situation and to talk to hostel dwellers. Weapons were carried 
openly. Mr. Khoza rejected the SADF's version of the incident. 
  [Khoza] It is not just untrue, but lies. 
  [Zietsman] Colonel C.P. du Toit, defense force commander in 
the area does not agree. 
  [Du Toit in Afrikaans] My facts are that shots were fired on 
troops and we returned fire in a disciplined manner. [end

<F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 10 SAPA -- Five hundred and fifty 
two people died in politically related violence during March, 
reversing a seven month-long downward trend, the latest Human 
Rights Commission [HRC] report said on Sunday [10 April]. It 
was more double the 245 deaths recorded in February and also the 
fourth highest monthly death rate since the HRC began monitoring 
politically related violence in 1990. 
  The HRC recorded 640 incidents of political violence, 
compared with February's figure of 361. Nearly half of this 
year's total of 1,529 incidents took place in March. 
  The death toll in Natal in March increased by 73 percent to 
311 deaths compared to February. This was "the most concerning 
element of this months' figure as it is the only region in which 
high levels of ongoing violence are occuring", the report said. 
  The HRC recorded 4,139 deaths since the election date was 
announced in July 1993 and 13,464 deaths since July 1990. 
  The number of injuries has increased more than three times 
from 302 in February to 1,053 in March. 
  The 643 political arrests were made in March. This was the 
highest number of arrests during the past 18 months, excluding 
August 1993. The figure was inflated by the arrest of 405 
prison warders taking part in an illegal gathering, the report 
said. 
  The Bophuthatswana uprising, the Zulu royalist march through 
Johannesburg on March 28 and prisoners' protests contributed to 
the high figures, according to the report.

  [Text] Durban April 11 SAPA -- The kwaZulu Police [KZP] on 
Monday [11 April] reported 10 weekend murders in the homeland 
while the SA Police [SAP] in Natal reported at least 24 deaths, 
pushing the violence toll in kwaZulu/Natal since Friday to at 
least 34. The number of reported killings in the province since 
the state of emergency was declared on March 31 now stands at at 
least 167. 
  Most deaths have been politically linked, while some have 
resulted from ordinary crime. 
  The SAP on Monday afternoon reported three further killings 
in separate weekend attacks in Ladysmith's Ezakheni township. In 
total, four people were killed there since Friday. 
  The KZP, meanwhile, reported 10 killings in kwaZulu -- most 
in townships south of Durban. Two people were also killed in a 
taxi dispute in the Nongoma area of kwaZulu, said the kzp. 
  Reports indicated violence was widespread in Natal at the 
weekend. 
  Among the victims were three people who were shot dead in 
the 
North Coast area of Stanger on Friday night when gunmen opened 
fire on pedestrians. Two people were injured. The dead were 
named as Nanthani Mbonambi, Lizwe Gcaleke and Walter Magwaza. 
The motive for the attack appeared to be political, police said. 
  KwaMashu and Inanda remained flashpoints of violence in 
areas 
north of Durban. 
  Police said three suspected robbers were caught by community 
members and stabbed to death in the Amawoti area of Inanda on 
Sunday. Local police said a man was shot dead in nearby J 
section of kwaMashu while a man was fatally shot at the 
township's Tembalihle railway station on Sunday.

  [Text] Johannesburg Apr 11 SAPA -- South Africa's foreign 
investment unit, the financial rand, plunged to its worst level 
and the commercial rand followed suit in a bruising day's trade 
Monday [11 April]. The finrand, an indicator of foreign 
confidence in the country, rapidly slid to R[Rand]5.7150 to the 
U.S. dollar, crashing 77 cents or 16 per cent from its 
pre-week-end closing level of R4.9200. 
  Traders said international investors took an extremely 
gloomy 
view of the failed summit between the country's political 
leaders which ended late Friday. "All hell broke loose. Just as 
we thought it was finding its bottom, it fell further," a trader 
lamented. 
  "In the run up to the elections, the finrand is going to 
head 
lower. Particularly, the situation in Natal seems to prevent 
free voting and in fact it's likely to be a bloody 
confrontation." 
  The finrand's previous worst level was recorded in August 
1986 when it breached R5.5500 to the greenback after the then 
President P.W. Botha's security crack-down and failure to 
embrace reform. 
  Another trader said the bleak statements issued by President 
F.W. de Klerk, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, 
Inkatha chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelethini 
after the Friday summit "initially got the ball rolling with 
offshore investors taking an extremely bearish view of the 
outcome of the meeting". 
  Rumours sprung up on the currency market of a large 
disinvestment order, and coupled with a reluctance by market 
participants to be short of dollars pummelled the investment 
unit even lower, dealers noted. 
  The bearish sentiment spilled over into the commercial rand 
market as importers rushed to buy foreign currency requirements 
in anticipation of the rand weakening further. 
  The rand plunged to a record low of R3.6148 before regaining 
some composure to close at R3.5928 from Friday's R3.5525 close. 
  The local unit was not helped by a stronger U.S. dollar on 
world markets, as it added to the uncertain waters the SA 
economy would wade through before April 26-28 -- the election 
date. 
  A dealer said that there had been no sign of Reserve Bank 
intervention in either the commercial or financial rand. 
  Reserve figures released ahead of the week-end indicated the 
bank had little resources to continue to prop up the rand. 
  Analysts said the foreign exchange reserve figures showed 
the 
Reserve Bank in fact had to borrow on its foreign "overdrafts".

<F P=106> [Report by G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- South Africa was on 
the brink of becoming southern Africa's newest "basket case 
banana republic", the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance 
Movement -- AWB] said on Tuesday [12 April]. The AWB's finance 
committee said in a statement it was not surprised by the 
collapse of the financial and commercial rand as the AWB had 
predicted this in a statement several weeks ago. 
  "It is significant that the sale of Kruger Rands has 
increased by 1,000 per cent over the past few months. This has 
been caused by the liberals of big business, despite their 
apparent communist sympathies, suddenly taking fright at the 
policies which they have been propagating all along," the 
statement said. 
  "They simply preach one thing and practise another. The 
flight of capital out of this country is horrendous. We now 
predict a further fall in the Rand [R], both financial and 
commercial, as we slip deeper into the financial abyss." 
  The AWB said that with debts of R209 billion, South Africa 
was on the verge of becoming "another third world (if not a `no 
world') tin pot banana republic, ignored and laughed at by the 
civilised world". 
  The Boer people had to "get rid of this government and once 
again make our fatherland a home for our children. If this does 
not happen, our children will suffer a fate too ghastly to 
contemplate".

<F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- The SA Chamber of 
Business [SACOB] has alerted its 40,000 member enterprises to 
set up contingency plans in the run up to and after the April 
elections, SACOB legal affairs Director Ken Warren said on 
Friday [8 April]. 
  Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Warren said businesses should 
plan for a "worst case scenario", in view of the social turmoil 
and violence which has gripped the country ahead of its first 
all race polls. SACOB tentatively defined the worst case as a 
scenario in which the level of violence rises to a point that 
damages business property and the security of staff. 
  The chamber sent in early March a circular advising all its 
members to bolster and check their provisions with regard to 
security, fire-fighting equipment, communication networks and 
the supply of essential production materials. 
  Mr Warren said business had also set up day-to-day 
communication channels with the civil protection authorities in 
each area to monitor potential flashpoints. 
  Violence has escalated, specifically in Natal-kwaZulu, ahead 
of the poll scheduled for April 26-28. More than 130 people 
have been killed in Natal-kwaZulu since the imposition of a 
state of emergency in the province on March 31. 
  More than 50 people were killed in central Johannesburg and 
neighbouring areas in late March in confrontations during a Zulu 
protest march, disrupting many companies and threatening the 
safety of staff working in the central business district. An 
accountant died after being hit by bullets while working on his 
personal computer in his downtown office. The pc had been 
situated near a first floor window. 
  The turmoil has raised fears in the business community that 
plant, equipment, raw materials and products could be damaged or 
destroyed, as well as employees wounded or even killed. 
"Planning and precautionary measures should commence 
immediately... Great care will have to be taken to prevent or 
minimise unnecessary anxiety or panic among employees," the 
SACOB circular advised. 
  It recommended that plans be implemented to ensure the 
safety 
of employees travelling to and from work, and it could be 
necessary to house key personnel on the business premises. 
"Vehicle hijacking can be expected to increase, with freight 
vehicles and combis as likely specific targets, as a result of 
inter alia, pressure to transport voters to polling booths." 
  In addition, the chamber urged enterprises to plan for power 
disruptions, and the provision of essential supplies of water, 
raw materials, food and fuels. 
  Mr Warren said SACOB hoped a worst case scenario would not 
arise, but it made prudent business sense to be prepared for any 
eventuality.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer] </F>
  [Text] At least one major European aircraft manufacturer 
has withdrawn from this month's Johannesburg air show, Aviation 
Africa '94, after direct intervention of ANC military chief Joe 
Modise. Several other companies, including French aircraft 
builders and a Swiss manufacturer, have considered cancelling 
their stands at the event. 
  British Aerospace [BAe] said it would not participate in the 
continent's premier air exhibition because Modise "made quite 
clear" to the Gompany's South African representative that "an 
exhibition of defence equipment would break the United Nations 
arms embargo" against South Africa, which is still in place. 
BAe was planning to show its Hawk jet trainer system, of which 
it has sold close to 800 aircraft to the U.S. Navy, the 
Zimbabwean, Kenyan, and other air forces worldwide. Aware that 
the South African Air Force is currently investigating potential 
replacements for its aging Impala trainer, the company was keen 
to show its system at the bi-annual air salon. 
  Buying the Hawk, argues BAe, would allow Atlas Aircraft 
Corporation and Denel to pitch for maintenance work for other 
African air forces. BAe was to have displayed a full-scale 
model of the Hawk, said the company's representative in South 
Africa, Robbie Roberts. "But of course we were in a bit of a 
predicament when the good Modise said forget the future if you 
come to this show." 
  Modise is widely tipped to play a major role in military 
affairs in future, either as minister of defence or chief of the 
defence force. In either positions, he would be key to any 
large-scale procurement decisions, including the purchase of jet 
trainers. Observers have expressed surprise at Modise's apparent 
determination to see the arms embargo adhered to, despite its 
imminent demise. But ANC spokesperson Gill Marcus explained that 
the organisation felt "that South Africa's policy on arms should 
only be looked at once the UN embargo has been lifted". That 
will happen only after the elections. 
  Other European manufactures were also approached, via their 
embassies in Pretoria. According to French sources, the first 
call from Modise was rather unspecific and seemed to suggest the 
ANC was opposed to Aviation Africa '94 as a whole. The embassy 
was told "it would be insensitive to be represented at the air 
show", without being told specifically whether this referred to 
civil or military participation in the event. A subsequent 
letter from foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki said there had 
been a misunderstanding, and that civil aircraft were welcome. 
But French manufacturers, including Airbus Industrie, 
Aerospatiale, and Eurocopter France, met in Paris early this 
week to consider withdrawing completely from the show. It is 
understood they agreed to participate, showing only civilian 
aircraft. 
  Swiss manufacturer Pilatus, which produces short take-off 
spotter aircraft and recently sold replacements for the obsolete 
Harvard trainer to the SAAF [South African Air Force], is also 
rumoured to be considering withdrawing from the air show after 
an approach from Modise. Aviation Africa '94 organiser Lynn 
Brown said she had been in touch with the ANC's foreign affairs 
department, which had "expressed support for the show, but asked 
us to remind all participants of the UN arms embargo". 
  But press information issued by the organisers still refers 
to "a number of local and international exhibitors" which "will 
be exhibiting military hardware, including Denel's Rooivalk [red 
falcon]". 
  Czech manufacturer Aero, which built MiG fighters until 1972 
for the Warsaw Pact air forces and which currently has light 
attack aircraft in its manufacturing programme, is featured in 
publicity material for Aviation Africa '94.

<F P=106> [Report on population growth issued by the South African </F>
Institute of Race Relations on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The population in South Africa is not growing as 
fast as it was, 57 percent is urbanised, and the country's 
education levels are improving slowly. Cape Town, in the 
meantime, has become one of the fastest growing cities in africa. 
  These trends emerge from statistics supplied by the latest 
[South African Institute of] Race Relations survey. The survey, 
recording the results of the most recent census, shows that 
between 1986 and 1991 the population of South Africa (excluding 
the `independent' homelands) grew at an average rate of 1.9 
percent. A year, compared with 2.3 percent. Between 1980 and 
1985. 
  Nevertheless, by the year 2018 the country's population will 
be close to 80m [million], the maximum number of people South 
Africa's water and other resources can support. 
  In 1993 the total population (including the ten homelands) 
was 40.3m, according to an Urban Foundation estimate quoted in 
the survey. 
  Key projections, recorded in the survey, indicate that by 
2010, 69 percent (33.2m) of the total African population will 
live in urban areas and 31 percent (15.2m) in rural areas. This 
means that some 22m additional people will have to be provided 
for in urban areas by 2010. 
  By 2000 the population of Natal will comprise 23 percent of 
the total South African population, of which 54 percent will be 
living in the Durban area. With an average growth rate for its 
African population of more than 13 percent a year between 1982 
and 1992, Cape Town is one of the fastest growing cities in 
Africa. The African population of Cape Town more than trebled 
between 1982 and 1992 from 200,000 in 1982 to more than 900,000 
in 1992 -- an increase of 350 percent. 
  Despite widespread school disruptions, the survey records 
that the proportion of the population with standard six or more 
increased from 32.6 percent in 1985 to 37.4 percent in 1991. 
Those with some form of post-matric education increased from 3 
percent in 1985 to 3.7 percent in 1991. 
  The survey notes, however, that 3m people over the age of 18 
(10 percent of the population) have no schooling at all, while 
1.4m (14 percent of the population of school-going age) are not 
at school. 
  The survey records that Zulu, Afrikaans and northern Sotho 
are the most widely spoken home languages in the country and the 
majority of South Africans are Christians. Of these the largest 
proportion (5.4m people) belong to African independent churches, 
followed by the Dutch Reformed Church (3.2m people) and the 
Roman Catholic Church (2.3m people). 
  According to the World Bank, the survey notes, the pattern 
of 
urbanised land in South Africa is contributing to the 
inefficiencies of its cities. This includes the spatial 
separation of (former) black and white cities, the high 
concentration of jobs and services in (former) white areas, and 
the location of high-density, low-income areas on the fringe of 
the cities. 
  Recommended solutions include increasing the densities of 
residential areas (which would require a change in current 
land-use zoning regulations) and concentrating settlements 
around urban centres.

<F P=106> [Report by Nick Bezuidenhout] </F>
  [Text] Mercenaries serving in the controversial company 
Executive Outcomes have reportedly been threatened with death 
should they "speak out" about the war they are conducting with 
the Angolan MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] 
government against the rebel group, UNITA [National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola]. The men, mostly former 
soldiers of the South African Defense Force or former members of 
Koevoet [Crowbar; Namibia police counterinsurgency unit], 
returned to South Africa at the beginning of this year when they 
found they were not only supposed to train Angolan soldiers, but 
also fight against UNITA. The operation in Angola is believed to 
be under the command of former members of the Civil Cooperation 
Bureau [CCB]. 
  Executive Outcomes is alleged to be hiring former South 
African soldiers under the pretext of training soldiers in 
Angola and guarding the oil refineries. They receive salaries 
of between 7,300 and 14,000 rands, paid in U.S. dollars. 
  Eben Barlow, Nico Palm, and Lafras Luitingh are among the 
people running Executive Outcomes. Mr. Barlow is the director, 
and Mr. Palm is the financial manager. Mr. Luitingh, former CCB 
member, was the "handler" of Mr. Ferdi Barnard, a former CCB 
member accused of having killed human rights activist, David 
Webster. 
  Reliable sources have disclosed to BEELD that the men 
employed by Executive Outcomes heard at the beginning of January 
that they had to fight against UNITA as well. A group of about 
20 refused to carry out the instruction and were sent back to 
South Africa. Another group was also sent back about three weeks 
later because they had also refused. 
  It is also alleged they were told that they would be 
"eliminated in a natural manner" should they talk about what is 
going on in Angola. 
  A Namibian newspaper reports that UNITA itself had said that 
it had shot dead 12 South African mercenaries. One of them was 
Lieutenant Steyn Marais, who had grown up in Namibia and served 
five years in the South African Defense Force's reconnaissance 
commando.

  [Text] A South African security company says it has 
identified one of its employees in a photograph of three men 
apparently shot dead in Angola by UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] soldiers. 
  The manager of the company, Mr. (Levras Laiting) said in an 
interview with the radio program "Monitor," that he'd recognized 
the man in a photograph which had appeared in the BEELD 
newspaper. The photograph's caption referred to mercenaries. 
Mr. (Laiting) denied that his employees were mercenaries.

<F P=106> [From the "Newswrap" program] </F>
  [Text] The government has strongly condemned the 
involvement of South Africans in the Angolan civil war. Foreign 
Minister Pik Botha told Lillian Straubach that the situation 
could endanger the country's international relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Botha] The government is in principle 
against the recruitment of South Africans for participation in 
war or conflict in other countries. There is no way that the 
citizens of a country will not be associated with that country, 
and very often with the government. That means that, without 
the government having had the opportunity to decide what is in 
its interests, in the country's interests, citizens are 
recruited, and those citizens then participate in a conflict 
within another country, between parties in that country, which 
is that country's problem, and it naturally endangers relations. 
  [Straubach] Now is the government doing anything about this? 
Can the government do anything about the situation? 
  [Botha] Yes, we issued, regularly, statements. I remember 
quite a number of statements last year, and even the year 
before, when we were accused of either, you know, acquiescing in 
secret flights, supplying UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Ango?a] with equipment and fuel. I remmember 
what a lot of headaches we had to endure as a result of 
suspicion that we were continuing to supply UNITA with arms and 
equipment, fuel and ammunition. The matter was raised, at one 
stage, by the Angolan representative to the United Nations, and 
I had to do a lot of explaining, and my department called 
together all the private sector aircraft companies in this 
country, and instructed them and requested them not to engage in 
any activity of that natu?e. 
  [Straubach] Now this bunch seems to be supporting the MPLA 
[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]. 
  [Botha] Yes. We are even-handed. We are against 
participation by South African citizens, or we are against the 
use of South African territory for launching any activity in any 
of the states surrounding us or, for that mattter, any other 
state in the world with whom we have relations. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  `Other Means' Needed To Secure kwaZulu Election Cooperation 
-- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 April in a page-10 
editorial says the summit at Skukuza between State President de 
Klerk, ANC President Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, and 
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on 8 
April "was a total failure." Zwelithini and Buthelezi "were at 
least consistent: they reissued direct challenges to the 
electoral process." Nelson Mandela "was clearly angry, but he 
stopped short of spelling out what should be done to ensure that 
those in the kwaZulu region who wish to vote are able to do so, 
and those who wish to stay away are afforded the same freedom of 
individual choice. That, after all, is what the dispute is 
about (it is not about the IFP's participation, which is its own 
business), and President de Klerk's attempt to claim progress 
where there was non merely heightened the danger." Attempts to 
"woo" King Zwelithini "away from the IFP's hard-line stance 
finally failed, and other means to secure co-operation must now 
be sought. Either Buthelezi must give a genuine assurance that 
his administration will co-operate with the Independent 
Electoral Commission, or the Government and Transitional 
Executive Council will have to consider the grave option of 
taking responsibility for an area which is, after all, part and 
parcel of South Africa." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  ANC, IFP Not Serious About Political Solution -- 
Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 April in its page-6 editorial says 
the four-leader summit at Skukuza on 8 April "did nothing to 
affirm that either the ANC or the Inkatha Freedom Party may 
seriously be seeking a political solution before the conflict 
settles into a brutal test of strength even uglier than that 
which has cost 20,000 lives over the past 10 years." The ANC 
made a "seemingly generous offer" to King Zwelithini regarding 
his status and powers. The proposal offers to Zulu royalty "an 
esteem and traditional powers compatible with the status of 
royalty in any modern democracy." However the ANC proposal is 
"marred" by the fact that it is "obviously a final, shallow and 
cynical attempt to divide the king and Buthelezi." BUSINESS DAY 
is "bemused" by the ANC's reluctance to make concessions. 
"After all, if Inkatha is so weak in terms of popular support 
that it can be `crushed', as most ANC strategists seem to 
believe, then the ANC would presumably win a regional poll." 
However, the election "must, and will go ahead," even if it 
"will not, of course, resolve the conflict." "At the same time, 
the election may clear the air a little. Inkatha's demand that 
the poll be postponed will no longer be an obstacle. And when 
he is stripped of the formal trappings of office, this may bring 
home to Buthelezi at last the futility of his boycott of the 
negotiating process." The election "is going ahead," and 
Buthelezi "warns that his supporters are more angry than ever 
before; he can probably expect the detention of the more 
militant of those supporters as security forces seek to protect 
lives and property." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Failed Leaders' Summit Makes Bloodshed Unavoidable -- 
Referring to the "failed summit" in Skukuza on 8 April 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 April says: "State 
President F. W. de Klerk, ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela, IFP 
President Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini have left to a technical committee what they failed 
to do -- reach an accord on the future of the Zulu monarchy, 
free and fair elections in kwaZulu-Natal and an end to the 
bloodshed in the province." SOWETAN believes the IFP's 
"short-term tactic is to make the poll impossible in kwaZulu and 
the rest of Natal and in the long term use the Zulu royal house 
as leverage. Against this backdrop, more bloodshed is 
unavoidable and the options are limited. More troops will have 
to be poured into Natal to at least contain the violence. A 
possible revolt within the Ulundi laager by dissident IFP 
members and kwaZulu civil servants is the only factor likely to 
influence events before the elections. In the meantime, the 
country must brace itself for the worst."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 11 April in its 
page-6 
editorial urges the four summit leaders, President de Klerk, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Zwelithini, and Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi respectively, to 
"rethink" their positions on kwaZulu/Natal "with greater 
urgency." "Mr Mandela wants a further meeting with the king, 
but he will have to offer more than he has suggested so far. As 
for Chief Buthelezi, he should know that an ANC-dominated 
government intends to finish him off after the election when 
kwaZulu will no longer exist as an entity." Buthelezi should 
"rather take part, even at this 11th hour, in the poll than have 
to fight a post-election battle from a weakened position. The 
situation is a mess -- a bloody mess -- and nobody has the 
ability or determination to rescue kwaZulu/Natal from it." 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  TEC Increase of Police Allowances Prudent -- "The 
anticipated 
decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to nearly 
treble the daily allowance paid to policemen during the election 
period is prudent rather than profligate," notes a page-12 
editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 12 April. 
"Policemen, frequently abused as 'oppressors' by radicals, are 
if anything exposed to greater dangers than members of the 
Defence Force and Peacekeeping Force. Glaring disparities in 
salaries cannot be justified." THE STAR also notes that Nelson 
Mandela has "begun to urge the public to co-operate with the 
SADF [South African Defense Force] and the SAP [South African 
Police]. He includes the SAP when he praises the security 
forces." THE STAR believes that rogue policemen should be 
removed, but that "the SAP as a whole deserves more than abuse 
and inadequate pay-cheques." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  ANC `Indifferent' to Flight of Investment Capital -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY warns in a page-10 editorial on 12 
April that the collapse of the financial and commercial rands 
"was not a temporary occurrence that can safely be ignored." 
"Television images of tanks rumbling into Natal's kraals and of 
Zulu royalists being shot dead outside Shell House help 
underscore the world's belief that we are drifting towards civil 
war. While that impression remains, the outward flight of 
foreign and South African investment capital will not abate." 
Meanwhile, "the ANC, our next ruling party, is distracted by 
its drive to annihilate its political opponents and is 
apparently indifferent to the likely effects of its current 
actions and promises on South Africa's long-term economic 
health. Vague affirmations of economic rectitude are no longer 
adequate. If the past weeks' damage to investor confidence is 
to be repaired, unequivocal commitments are needed to economic 
and political policies that investors find comfortable."

  [Text] The deputy commander general of the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] 2d Brigade, General Patrick Walker, 
says the Liberia Peace Council [LPC] is planning an attack on 
NPFL positions in Grand Bassa County. Speaking to reporters 
recently, Gen. Walker said more than 60 LPC fighters were 
discovered in the Firestone area planning to attack NPFL 
positions in Harbel District in Grand Bassa. He said AFL [Armed 
Forces of Liberia] personnel at Firestone are masterminding the 
planned attack. General Walker is, meanwhile, urging civilians 
in the area not to panic as the situation is under control. At 
the same time, the Liberia Peace Council has been accused of 
killing relief personnel in southeast Liberia. The 
International Action Against Hunger based in Monrovia says the 
LPC killed two MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] personnel recently 
in the southeast. It says the killing of the relief personnel 
by the LPC poses danger to relief organizations operating in the 
area. A spokesman for the group says the killing of the relief 
personnel has tampered with delivery of humanitarian assistance 
to thousands of people in that region.

  [Text] Libreville, 8 Apr (AFP) -- The state of alert and 
the curfew that has been in force almost constantly for four 
months in Gabon were lifted this evening, government spokesman 
Paulette Missambo announced after a meeting of the Council of 
Ministers. 
  "After a report by Defense Minister General Idriss Ngari to 
the Council of Ministers on the calm prevailing in the country, 
the council decided to lift this emergency regulation as of 
today," Mrs. Missambo added in a statement to the media at the 
end of the first session of the new Gabonese Government formed 
on 25 March. 
  The state of alert, "an emergency decree restricting public 
liberties" that bans demonstrations and provides for the 
imposition of a curfew, was decreed on 9 December 1993 following 
disturbances in Libreville after the reelection of President 
Omar Bongo was announced. 
  The head of state's victory in the first round of the 
country's first multiparty presidential election was challenged 
by the opposition, which claimed it had been won by one of their 
leaders, Father Paul Mba Abessole, chairman of the National 
Lumberjacks Rally [RNB]. 
  Lifted on 13 February, the state of alert was reimposed a 
week later as a general strike called for by a confederation of 
labor unions close to the opposition resulted in fresh violence 
in Libreville. Many densely populated districts of the capital 
were affected by the disturbances, which lasted four days. 
According to official figures, nine people, including two 
soldiers, were killed in the violence. 
  The government blamed Father Mba Abessole and his party for 
the unrest, but the charges were rejected by the opposition. 
The RNB's radio in Libreville was destroyed "in retaliation," 
according to the authorities, by the security forces who also 
attacked the opposition leader's residence. 
  In response to the violence, the main opposition leaders, 
grouped within the High Council of Resistance, called for the 
opening of "true talks" with the government, while laying down a 
series of conditions, including the lifting of the state of 
alert.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Christophe </F>
Boisbouvier in Kigali by Donaig Ledu in Paris--live] 
  [Text] [Ledu] What is the situation like this morning as 
far as the military side of things is concerned? 
  [Boisbouvier] There is still no cease-fire in the country. 
General Dallaire, the Canadian officer in charge of the UN 
forces in Rwanda, is doing his best. He moves to and fro 
between the Kigali government and the rebels in their Mulindi 
headquarters, in the north of the country. 
  For the time being, the two sides have been unable to reach 
any agreement. On one side, the government is demanding a 
cease-fire throughout the country. On the other, the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] only wants a cease-fire in the 
capital, Kigali. As a result, fighting is continuing. I can 
hear it, everyone can hear it in Kigali. For instance, around 
noon, still in that famous zone between the town and the airport 
where 600 RPF rebels have been surrounded for several days, they 
seem to be trying to gain some ground and thus be able to try 
and make a sortie. This is why we had fighting last night in an 
area close to their previous headquarters. Less than one hour 
ago, there was more violent fighting close to the building of 
the former parliament. A lot of smoke came up, probably from a 
petrol tank hit by a shell. There is shooting with light 
armored cars and mortars. This is serious fighting as you can 
see. 
  As for the north of the country, it is very difficult to 
know 
what is happening there because there are few eye-witnesses. We 
do not know whether the rebels are still marching. What we know 
is that they are not close to the capital. The interim 
government said that the progress of the rebels has been stopped 
on the three northern fronts, that is to say in front of 
Ruhengeri, Byumba, and in the Moutara region. Independent 
sources, including colleagues who were on the scene 48 hours 
ago, have confirmed that on Saturday [9 April] the rebels were 
surprised by the regular army's ability to resist thanks to its 
artillery. They were believed to be disorganized and, as a 
result, unable to take Byumba. May I remind you that this took 
place the day before yesterday; things may now have changed. 
Everything is happening very quickly. The country is small, 
Byumba is only 80 km from the capital. 
  [Ledu] Christophe, you were out in the streets of Kigali 
this 
morning. What did you see? 
  [Boisbouvier] There are no vehicles except those of the 
French and UN soldiers and a few diplomatic cars. People are 
still hiding inside their homes. There are still some corpses 
in the streets, including in the working-class districts. Every 
now and then, you pass small groups of machete-toting people who 
look quite nervous.

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] says it is 
determined to march on Kigali to save Rwandans, who according to 
it, are victims of the Army. This course of action has been 
condemned by the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], the main 
opposition party. Its West Africa representative, Leon 
Kaberuka, spoke to Raphael Mbadinga. 
  [Begin Kaberuka recording] The origin of the present 
crisis....[pauses] It is true that the country is facing 
problems, considering the fact that changing over from a 
one-party system of government to a multiparty democracy is a 
sufficiently arduous task. It was at the delicate stage of the 
changeover that the RPF unleashed war from Ugandan territory in 
the belief that it is better to resort to the use of arms than 
to engage in political dialogue. The origin of the crisis is 
that the RPF believed that the solution to the country's 
problems -- that is the refugee, economic, and political 
problems -- could be solved by the use of force. Things cannot 
work out that way. No other party has so far adopted that 
philosophy, otherwise the other parties would also have taken up 
arms against Habyarimana. That is very easy to do, and should 
that have happened, the country would have immediately been 
turned into Somalia, Liberia, or Angola which is what the 
Rwandan people do not want. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Issaias Afewerki by </F>
Ahmad Hasan Dahli in Asmara; date not given: "We Will Enact the 
Press Law, Submit a Draft Constitution, and Open the Door to 
Party Pluralism" -- first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH 
introduction ] 
  [Text] The Eritrean People's Liberation Front held its 
third organizational conference on the 10th of last month in the 
city of Nakfa, at a time when the country is passing through a 
highly sensitive political period, now that independence has 
been proclaimed and voted upon. Following the conference, 
AL-HAYAH conducted a wide-ranging interview with Eritrean 
President Issaias Afewerki, in which he addressed the difficult 
economic conditions, political pluralism, the border crisis with 
Sudan, Eritrea's relations with the countries of the Horn of 
Africa, the Red Sea, and Israel, and, finally, the reasons that 
Western countries failed to keep their economic promises to 
Eritrea on the eve of its independence. 
  The text of the interview follows: 
  [Dahli] What are the broad political features you have drawn 
up for the coming years in your recent conference? 
  [Issaias] The country is now passing through a delicate 
transitional period, and so broad political lines were drawn. 
They will take shape in action within two years, starting now, 
and until the establishment of a constitutional government that 
will effectively end the transitional period and start a new 
phase in which the features of the modern Eritrean state will 
become clear at every political, economic, cultural, and social 
level. 
  [Dahli] What, then, are the broad lines of the transitional 
period? 
  [Issaias] The Eritrean Government will try, untiringly, 
throughout this transition period, to relieve the troubles of 
daily life and to plan a comprehensive economic policy that will 
move the country onto a constitutional path to govern and 
control political activity in the country. 
  [Dahli] What is the role of the People's Front in the 
transitional phase? 
  [Issaias] This is the big question, which the conference did 
not answer satisfactorily or comprehensively. 
  [Dahli] What about the nature of the relations between the 
Front and the government? 
  [Issaias] We will create a practical and not only a 
theoretical divide between the two sides, so that we do not fall 
into the problem of duplication in bearing responsibility, and 
also so that there will be no interference between Front matters 
and government issues. Of course, it is hard to speak of a 
definitive divide between the programs of the Front and the 
government, because of the mutual assistance and integration 
between the two entities. 
  [Dahli] Will you give us some idea of the economic policy 
the 
Eritrean government has enacted? 
  [Issaias] We have no magic formula ready that can lift 
Eritrea out of its bad economic conditions to the level of the 
developed countries. So we have decided to submit an economic 
working paper for discussion before the end of the first half of 
this year. We will submit it for inspection and revision before 
adopting it offficially. I don't think I need to point out that 
the 30-year war caused widespread destruction. Today we are 
trying to follow a path for the country's economic development 
in a local, regional, and international climate, and to say the 
least, things are not encouraging. 
  [Dahli] Conference members elected no more than three former 
members of the politburo of the People's Front to the executive 
office (the highest authority) 16 commanders of the upper 
echelons. How do you explain this? 
  [Issaias] The old leadership should never sit in the seats 
of 
the presidency. It is in their interest, and the interest of the 
organization as well, to open the way for new leadership. All 
there is to it, is that there must be careful renewal to prevent 
any upset in the balance of the organization that could have 
disastrous consequences. The positive thing as that everyone 
wanted to avoid violent shocks, so that all agencies could carry 
out their role normally, and in the context of sovereignty, of a 
wave of principled and permanent renewal for the leadership. 
This would be a fixed principle, limiting the candidacy of any 
commander of one center to a single time. 
  [Dahli] What is the purpose of that? 
  [Issaias] This decision, which appears to be mandatory, is 
intended to open the field for rising generations, so that they 
may in turn take up leadership positions. True, there were those 
who objected to this, saying, "How can we do without people who 
have long experience and great expertise and depend on youths 
who lack expertise and experience?" 
  [Dahli] So what is the solution? 
  [Issaias] The solution lies in not burning bridges and then 
jumping through the air. We do not want to find ourselves face 
to face with an unknown fate. The wisest thing is a compromise 
that provides for continuity without tampering with the spirit 
of the principle of specifying the leadership in all 
institutions, being on guard against falling into deadlock, 
bankruptcy, and an inability to understand events, to say 
nothing of the spirit of the age. 
<H5>  Ramadan's Position Ideal </H5>
  [Dahli] In the context of the process of renewing the 
leadership to which I alluded, what is your view of (Politburo 
member and former minister in the local government) Ramadan 
Muhammad Nur's position in the conference, and his demand to be 
dismissed from any leadership position in the organization? 
  [Issaias] People's selfishness often prevents them from 
adopting the ideal position that our brother has taken. This 
ideal position should not be confined to a specific individual. 
We must establish it as a means of action in this organization 
to maintain the vitality and dynamism of the body and soul of 
the People's Front. 
  I am not sure that all the people understand the 
significance 
of what our brother Ramadan Muhammad Nur meant to proclaim to 
the Eritrean people and all the members of the conference. 
  [Dahli] What was the significance of that message? 
  [Issaias] Renewal is the norm in life, applied equally to 
him 
and to others. Brother Ramadan's courageous step will benefit 
many, including me. One distinctive thing is that one notes the 
unhappiness of some individuals of lower rank than Ramadan 
because no one nominated them, or because they did not win any 
leadership position. What a difference between the two 
positions! 
  [Dahli] What is the meaning of the opening of the People's 
Front conference to the participation of most of the factions of 
the former Eritrean revolution, of whom we may name Muhammad 
Sa'id Nawid (President of the Executive Committee of the 
Eritrean Liberation Front-Unified Organization), Hiruy Tedla 
Bairu (President of the Eritrean People's Democratic Movement), 
Idris Galaydos, Taha Nur (member of the Supreme Council of the 
Eritrean Liberation Front [ELF], Muhammad Nur Ahmad (responsible 
for foreign relations in the Eritrean Liberation 
Front-Revolutionary Council), and others? 
  [Issaias] We tried as much as possible to broaden 
participation. It is very unfortunate that the result did not 
come up to our aspirations and expectations. 
  [Dahli] Why? 
  [Issaias] I do not want to lay the blame on one particular 
side. I hope that those who did not heed our call the last time 
will do so the next time. The door of participation is open to 
whomever wishes to take part in the battle to rebuild the 
country. 
  [Dahli] What will your position be towards those who differ 
with you fundamentally? 
  [Issaias] From now on there must be no disputes left over 
from the residue of the war of liberation phase. The reopening 
of old disputes can only be a waste of time and effort. But if 
there is a difference over the method of hastening the process 
of rebuilding the country, or over the manner of establishing 
national unity, then this by any standards would be considered a 
kindness, because it benefits the country and its citizens. 
  [Dahli] So that we can be clearer--is the participation you 
are talking about confined to the People's Front and the 
Eritrean Government, or does it extend outside them? I mean, to 
form opposition parties? 
  [Issaias] We have a great desire to expand the scope of 
participation in the context of the Front, and outside it. We do 
acknowledge the right to establish political parties, subject to 
certain conditions, so that parties will not be founded without 
objective justifications. When I say this, I am not speaking 
from ignorance, but from experience, the experience of several 
neighboring countries and other Third World countries I am 
thinking of. 
  [Dahli] In past years, the People's Front vehemently denied 
the existence of a secret Marxist party within it. In this 
conference, you revealed the existence of this party. My 
question is: When was this party founded, and why was it 
disbanded at the end of 1989, as you said? 
  [Issaias] The party had deep roots, going back to 1966, the 
year I traveled to China for a training course with Brother 
Ramadan Muhammad Nur. 
  [Dahli] What was the identity of this party? 
  [Issaias] The goal of the party was to spread progressive 
ideas in Eritrea, which was plagued by traditional, worn-out 
political ideas, which hindered the process of launching the 
Eritrean revolution, and prolonged the suffering of the people 
during the war of liberation. 
  Attempts to establish the party were met with conditions of 
prolonged sacrifice after our return to Eritrea before it took 
on its official stamp in 1970, in the city of Aden in what was 
then South Yemen. That event coincided, as is well known, with 
the appearance of the popular liberation forces, which held 
their organizational conference in the area of Sedduha'ila [name 
as transliterated] in the Dankalia region, in the extreme south 
of the country. 
  [Dahli] What reasons led you to disband the party at the end 
of 1989? 
  [Issaias] When we reached the firm conclusion that there 
were 
no fundamental differences dividing the members of the People's 
Front and those of that party, we decided to disband it, to 
avoid getting into the predicament of duplication, and to 
prevent party members and the rest of the base of the Front 
creating problems from nothing. 
  [Dahli] What standards were used in choosing party members? 
  [Issaias] We had secret cells studying the readiness of this 
or that person to enlist under the party's banner. 
  [Dahli] What were your relations with the leadership of the 
secret Marxist Labor Party that existed inside the ELF? 
  [Issaias] There were several secret meetings between the 
leaders of the two parties with the objective of uniting them as 
a prelude to the uniting of the two fronts, the ELF and the 
People's Front. It became clear in our meetings that there were 
no essential conflicts in our general proposals. 
  [Dahli] In spite of that, no unity was effected between the 
parties. To the contrary, Eritrea was the scene of ruinous civil 
wars. Why did that happen? 
  [Issaias] In my view, the leadership of the Labor Party in 
the ELF was dealing with Marxism on the basis of opportunism, 
totally unrelated to the ideology as an ideology. 
  [Dahli] Did the dissolution of the party coincide with the 
fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union by coincidence, or was there a cause-and-effect relation 
between the two events? 
  [Issaias] There was no cause-and-effect relation between the 
two issues. We reviewed events, and our ideological positions 
with the end of 1978, when the Soviet Union, former South Yemen, 
and the progressive forces in the Palestinian revolutionary 
factions aligned themselves with the enemies of our revolution. 
We had considered them strategic allies, and included them in 
our ranks in our political party schools. 
  [Dahli] Did your ideological position change with the Soviet 
Union's change of policy vis-a-vis your revolution? 
  [Issaias] No. It was not that easy or that simple. Without 
going into too much detail, we may say that starting that day we 
freed ourselves from rigid and sterile ideological positions, 
and adopted a realistic, pragmatic policy in our dealing both 
with the situation in Eritrea and with the outside world. 
  [Dahli] Now that so many historical changes have taken 
place, 
what remains of your progressive ideas, not to say your Marxist 
ideas? 
  [Issaias] I say without any hesitation: social justice. 
Because the liberation of territory, raising the national flag, 
and saluting the national anthem, despite their significance, 
mean nothing to ordinary Eritreans without social justice, which 
fills in the gap between the narrow stratum of the rich, and the 
broad sector of the poor. 
  [Dahli] In the closing session of the conference, you said, 
"after the liberation of our nation, and still now, we notice a 
deficiency in the balance of members of the People's Front, 
prevailing doubts about them, and their loss of confidence in 
themselves. They stumble around at random. The People's Army, 
the backbone of the People's Front, still has doubts about its 
future and has become prey to many uncertainties and bewildered 
doubts. This is because it no longer has any clear vision amid 
the vague positions in all its movements." How did things come 
to this dangerous pass? 
  [Issaias] It is a very thorny issue, and it requires study 
in 
depth by sociologists and psychologists. A 30-year war cannot 
pass without leaving profound effects on the individuals who 
emerged 100-percent safe from decades of war with all their 
tears, blood, and psychological wounds. Yesterday all the people 
were in one trench with the enemy before them and the drone of 
airplanes above them, with no options other than life or 
martyrdom. Today the situation is different, there are more 
things to worry about. There is a great vacuum. There are family 
problems: the fighters' families and the martyrs' families. The 
government has found itself faced with problems with no 
beginning or end, and has no money, because the colonialist 
Ethiopian regimes that had seized Eritrea destroyed not only its 
economy, but sucked out all the benefits this people might have 
enjoyed. This people has lost everything, and won peace at the 
end of it all. Peace makes excellent capital, beyond price, and 
needs time to bear its fruit. 
<H5>  Demobilization of the Army </H5>
  [Dahli] Last year you demobilized the first batch of the 
Eritrean Army, estimated at about 100,000 men. Are the problems 
of the discharged men easier to bear than those of the remainder 
still serving in the military? 
  [Issaias] I have no definitive answer to this question, 
because it goes back to the difference in problems that affected 
the demobilized men and the others. The ones demobilized from 
the army were the most recently conscripted into military 
service--about three years. This eased the process of their 
return to civilian life, compared with people who had spent long 
decades in the army. 
  In addition, the great majority of those demobilized were 
peasants, and their problem now is that they do not want to go 
back to the land and resume their old trades. 
  One may note that one cannot change his way of life without 
taking on something new. What made this more difficult is that 
the small minority of the demobilized who went back to their 
farms--and we provided them with modern equipment--endured 
profound psychological frustration when faced with the drought 
that swept Eritrea in the last growing season and threatened 
people with starvation. Despite that, the decision to demobilize 
them is seen as a positive one in the final analysis, not 
because they reduced the army's burden, but because they are no 
longer dependants, but are relying on themselves in overcoming 
life's difficulties. 
  [Dahli] The question of land took up much of the heated 
discussions inside the conference before the resolution was made 
that "the land is the property of the state." My question is, 
aren't you afraid that this resolution will lead to trouble? 
  [Issaias] That resolution was moral more than practical. 
  [Dahli] So, what will happen practically? 
  [Issaias] We want to review the method for distributing land 
in Eritrea, not with the aim of enacting superficial 
resolutions, but to exploit arable lands in a sensible and 
practical manner. The manner that people are used to gives no 
thought to the scope of a region's needs, or a district's, and 
sometimes is limited to the family. Add to that the fact that 
cultivation is arbitrary, passed down from father to son, 
primitive, and barely remunerative. So all we want to do is put 
the land in the service of society, after preparing an accurate 
scientific study, and providing modern equipment and all kinds 
of fertilizers, so that the Eritrean peasantry may supply his 
own needs as well as those of the Eritrean markets. Then we may 
think about what surplus produce may be exported abroad. Here I 
may point out that four decades ago Eritrea exported all kinds 
of fruits and vegetables as well as meat to several Middle 
Eastern countries and Europe. We can do so again, to some 
extent, in a short time, if we pool our efforts and get 
technical and other assistance from friendly countries. 
<H5>  Merchants' Complaints </H5>
  [Dahli] Every single Eritrean merchant is today complaining 
of the tax burden imposed on him by the government, to the 
degree that some say their slim profits are used to pay the 
government tax bill. What is your respnse? 
  [Issaias] This isn't just in Eritrea. In every country in 
the 
world merchants cry and complain about the terrible tax burden. 
In Eritrea's case, I firmly believe that there is a certain 
exaggeration in the volume of merchant complaints. I have heard 
the merchants' complaints because their voices are loud, and 
that is because they control the markets. The simple consumers, 
on the other hand, complain of price-gouging and hardly anyone 
hears them. 
  [Dahli] A merchant might say that he is compelled to raise 
prices to match the increased taxes imposed on him by the 
government. 
  [Issaias] I don't think so. Taxes are not imposed 
arbitrarily. They are calculated after a field study. 
  [Dahli] Some merchants think taxes have hurt the country's 
one source of income, since there are no other sources. 
  [Issaias] No. That is inaccurate, since taxes make up only 
15 
percent of the state budget. 
  We are now in the process of considering eliminating taxes 
on 
basic commodities and raising them on nonessential goods such as 
cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. These ideas may help people, 
but will not solve their root problems. 
  [Dahli] Why? 
  [Issaias] Because Eritrea is still relying on old factories, 
using imported fuels, and using a great deal of electricity. 
This means high prices for our local products, which we cannot 
impose on domestic markets over imported goods. This is a very 
hard dilemma that cannot be solved overnight. 
  [Dahli] Where have the raw materials disappeared to--the 
gold, oil, natural gas, uranium, and other things that the 
Eritrean Front's pamphlets spoke of before independence? 
  [Issaias] I am extremely cautious about what is said about 
the existence of minerals in commercial quantities in Eritrea. 
  [Dahli] Why? 
  [Issaias] We don't want to give people ideas about things we 
aren't sure exist. 
  [Dahli] But there are civil studies conducted by Italian 
experts between the world wars. And the Ethiopian Government 
gave oil concessions to foreign countries--etc. 
  [Issaias] True, some foreign companies did surveying and 
exploring in the era of the Derg, which proved the existence of 
natural gas in substantial quantities. But with oil, no one 
knows now whether it's there in commercial quantities, or very 
limited quantities. 
  [Dahli] Have you signed agreements with foreign companies to 
explore for oil? 
  [Issaias] We are in the process now. The surveying process, 
then exploitation, will take some time. The trouble is that 
people are in a hurry. 
  In addition, we are currently reviewing the contracts the 
colonial Ethiopian authorities signed with international 
commercial establishments, which are trying to monopolize the 
Eritrean market at the expense of other companies. It is in our 
interest to open the door to global competition among all 
companies before giving concession rights to this one instead of 
that one. 
  The important thing, in my view, is that Eritrea possesses 
considerable agricultural possibilities and priceless marine 
resources, but, unfortunately Third World countries have a 
tendency to dream about oil wells as the solution to their 
problems. 
  [Dahli] There appear to be many obstacles preventing foreign 
companies from working directly in Eritrea. 
  [Issaias] As you can see for yourself, we don't have paved 
roads, or modern rapid communications, nor even electrical 
power--etc. All these affect the start-up of large projects. 
<H5>  The Press and Opposition Parties </H5>
  [Dahli] The question of economic development is linked to 
political stability. Do you have a specific timetable for the 
implementation of political pluralism, which can open the way to 
broad participation in all fields? 
  [Issaias] The important thing, the central thing, in my 
view, 
is that the conference members confirmed the principle of 
political pluralism. Translating it into reality requires 
objective terms. Thus it is difficult to specify a timetable for 
the formation of opposition parties. 
  [Dahli] There are Eritrean leaders abroad expressing their 
desire to establish parties. Where do you stand on this? 
  [Issaias] So far there is no desire to form parties with the 
people who are active in some Arab and Western countries. The 
whole has to do with some elements who still have mentalities of 
the past, stuck to the legacy of the ELF. 
  [Dahli] What do you mean by the legacy of the ELF? 
  [Issaias] I mean this or that group or so-and-so's group. 
These issues have been outrun by the historical events of the 
Eritrean revolution, which has changed the traditional structure 
of Eritrean society, which had been dominated by tribal, 
regional, and sectarian logic. Now it has reached a progressive 
phase after three whole decades of warfare. 
  [Dahli] What would your conditions be for any party to 
pursue 
its political activity officially? 
  [Issaias] I do not want to get ahead of events, but in 
general, and in order to safeguard Eritrea's national unity and 
Eritrean political independence, we believe it is essential for 
parties to be independent of direct and indirect outside 
influence. Nor should they be founded on religious, ethnic, 
regional, or tribal bases. 
  These are the redlines that must be respected. It does not 
mean that there can be no discussion of this very sensitive 
issue. On the contrary, discussion will be initiated, so that 
Eritreans can give their views on every single issue. 
  [Dahli] How can that happen, when the very few media in the 
country are under government control? 
  [Issaias] MODERN ERITREA, the only official newspaper 
published in Arabic and Tigrinya, has worked hard from the 
beginning to open its columns to Eritrean writers in a limited 
fashion. Thus the dialogue that is underway, I think, cannot 
continue without a law for the freedom of the press, which will 
be introduced in the next few days. Only then can the provisions 
of the Constitution, the laws, and party rules be discussed. It 
will be up to the Eritreans to draw the broad lines of the 
modern state. 
  [Dahli] Will there be laws regulating the freedom of the 
press? 
  [Issaias] One cannot allow things to take a rambling course. 
There have to be rules. 
  [Dahli] Such as? 
  [Issaias] Not tampering with national unity; the avoidance 
of 
cursing; and avoiding vituperative and litigious methods, to the 
greatest extent possible. In return, we will reconsider 
erroneous decisions, expose negative stands, and bring citizens' 
complaints and expectations into the open. And, in line with 
neighboring countries' experiences with press freedom, we will 
permit no foreign funding for our local newspapers, to eliminate 
foreign disruptions. 
  [Dahli] Does that mean that the government will provide 
material support to the independent newspapers? 
  [Issaias] We are working on providing the needed technical 
equipment. The mere implementation of the law on the freedom of 
the press is not enough for a press free of foreign influence. 
Rules must be provided for their independence, to protect the 
role of the press, to guarantee its freedom in the service of 
the Eritrean people, which for long decades has been deprived of 
its most basic rights for an honorable life. Add to that the 
fact that we in Eritrea, even until now, do not have a single 
daily newspaper. MODERN ERITREA, as you can see, is published 
biweekly, on Wednesday and Saturday. How would it be when the 
multiparty law is enacted, with every party trying to publish 
its own newspapers and magazines? 
<H5>  The"Jihad" and Sudan </H5>
  [Dahli] Why have the fraternal relations between Eritrea and 
Sudan deteriorated so badly? Why were diplomatic methods not 
used, to avoid the glare of the media? 
  [Issaias] To start with, I would like to reconfirm that the 
stand of the National Islamic Front [NIF] led by Dr. Hasan 
al-Turabi, which supports the right to self-determination of the 
Eritrean people, and its right to armed struggle, has been 
clear. There is no doubt about it, compared with the positions 
of the rest of Sudan's vacillating parties. What is also certain 
is that the growth and development of the Eritrean [Islamic] 
Jihad Movement was thanks to the NIF, for its own mistaken 
sectarian calculations. 
  [Dahli] That has not stopped you from establishing relations 
with the NIF. 
  [Issaias] We had an ongoing dialogue with the NIF 
leadership, 
and we did all we could to persuade them of the futility of 
supporting an Islamic jihad movement in a society like 
Eritrea's, made up of equal numbers of Muslims and Christians. 
Regrettably, we got no compliance from our Sudanese brothers in 
this regard. 
  [Dahli] To what do you attribute that? 
  [Issaias] In my opinion, there are hardline factions within 
the NIF, which think they can use the "Islamic movement" to 
pressure not only Eritrea, but Uganda as well, and Kenya, 
Ethiopia, and Yemen. 
  And it is not just a question of just the NIF. There are 
also 
the Ansar al-Sunnah [Supporters of the Tradition], supported by 
other Arabs, who are trying to use Islam for political aims here 
and there. To answer the second part of your question, I state 
that we in the Eritrean Government have provided our Sudanese 
brothers, whether in the government or the NIF, with the 
locations and names of the Jihad elements on Sudanese soil, so 
that appropriate measures can be taken, but to no avail. In the 
end, this only put a cloud over relations between the two 
countries. 
  [Dahli] What was the Sudanese response to your memorandums? 
  [Issaias] There were short-lived promises, with which we 
could not be patient forever, especially after the incident of 
16 December, when Eritrean and foreign elements infiltrated 
western Eritrea from camps located inside Sudan, and fought with 
our forces, which wiped out every single one of them. The 
Sudanese regime knows better than anyone that we have held our 
peace over several things, and looked the other way in many 
instances, and at a time when the world was accusing it of 
supporting global fundamentalist terrorist movements. 
  [Dahli] Do I understand from what you are saying that the 
Eritrean Government has lost all hope of restoring fraternal 
relations with Sudan to their natural state? 
  [Issaias] Being eager not to blow this up, or get things to 
a 
point that would have bad consequences for the two countries, we 
brought up the subject of Sudan's interference in Eritrea's 
internal affairs at the United Nations, without bringing things 
to a head with the ruling regime in Khartoum. We hope that 
Sudan's rulers will come to their senses and stop playing with 
fire. 
  [Dahli] Are you optimistic about this? 
  [Issaias] Regrettably, no. 
  [Dahli] Why? 
  [Issaias] Because a few hours ago, I learned that one of our 
officials at our consulate in Kassala was perfidiously 
assassinated. 
  [Dahli] What is the meaning of that incident? 
  [Issaias] It is part of a plan aimed at escalating the 
crisis. 
  [Dahli] What is the Sudanese regime's interest in that? 
  [Issaias] Sudan has no interest in it. The problem is that 
the Sudanese power in Khartoum has lost its balance and lost its 
credibility in dealing with friends. It is acting irresponsibly, 
and this lowers our morale, because we were hoping to build a 
unified economic market including Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, 
to expand to the rest of the IGAD [Inter-Government Authority on 
Drought] countries: Uganda, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. It 
would then bring in all the Red Sea basin countries, most 
importantly Yemen. 
<H5>  Yemeni Participation </H5>
  [Dahli] A few days ago, you visited Sanaa and Aden, and 
talked to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They, for their part, visited 
Asmara after signing a "pledge and accord" document last month. 
What is your assessment of Eritrean-Yemeni relations in light of 
all this? 
  [Issaias] Relations between the Yemeni and Eritrean peoples 
are nothing new. They have deep roots in ancient history. The 
Red Sea, which separates the shores of the two countries by 14 
miles, was and still is a bridge and contact point between the 
people of both countries. We are striving with all our power to 
strengthen the ties between our two peoples to serve our mutual 
interests. 
  [Dahli] What is your view of the current crisis threatening 
to destroy the union from within? 
  [Issaias] The union between the two parts of Yemen is a 
popular demand that cannot be neglected. But our brothers became 
swept up for emotional reasons and without serious study 
established a merged union, and the result was a formal, 
superficial unity, without the merger of the military, security, 
or media institutions. Etc. Now the people are enduring 
hardships caused by unrealistic steps. There is no shame in 
that, if the situation is understood before it is too late, but 
the unfortunate thing is that there are political forces here 
and there trying to incite discord to strike at the union and 
prevent the emergence of a strong, unified Yemeni state to play 
a prominent role in shaping events in the southern Red Sea, the 
southern Arabian peninsula, and the northwest Indian Ocean. 
  I have great hope that our brothers in Yemen will implement 
what they agreed on in Oman, to emerge from the current crisis, 
and block the way of the enemies of unity and the Yemeni people. 
<H5>  Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia </H5>
  [Dahli] Djibouti, your neighbor for three years, is 
currently 
going through political and military crises. How do you view the 
situation there after your visit, and your talks with President 
Hassan Gouled Aptidon? 
  [Issaias] Djibouti's old and new problems stem from the lack 
of a development plan that takes into consideration the rights 
and interests of the Issa, Afar, Arab, and Somali communities, 
and that allows them to participate in the government and the 
revolution on an equal footing with the country's other 
citizens. 
  [Dahli] What about Ethiopia? 
  [Issaias] Throughout the colonial era, Eritrea was 
organically linked to the Ethiopian economy, and, as we see, the 
Eritrean Government is still using the Ethiopian currency, the 
birr. 
  Our policy toward Ethiopia is the same as that toward all 
the 
countries of the Horn of Africa. This is due to our conviction 
that the liberation of all the peoples of this region must be 
total, or it will not be at all. 
  [Dahli] At the beginning of this month, General Mohamed 
Farah 
Aidid visited Asmara, and at the end of this same month the 
American forces will leave Somalia. How do you view the future 
of this Arab-African country? 
  [Issaias] To start with, I want to point out and emphasize 
Somalia's role in the course of the Eritrean revolution, from 
its beginnings up until its triumph. Somalia is the only country 
that offered us all it had and never wavered one inch in its 
position supporting our struggle, not over long years, not when 
there was bloodshed. It should come as no surprise that we have 
tried, to the best of our ability, to relieve the sufferings of 
our Somali brothers. 
  Going back to your question, I may say that the Somalis have 
learned a great deal from their destructive wars, nor do I think 
they wish to bring the former nightmare scenario back to this 
poor country. The withdrawal of the UN forces will leave a 
vacuum at first, and that might give rise to some small 
incidents, but those forces must leave Somalia for good. They 
led to the creation of problems that had no beginning and will 
have no end, compared with the problems they solved, or that 
they originally came to solve. 
  [Dahli] The role of the UN forces in Somalia was, then, in 
your view, a negative one? 
  [Issaias] It was not only negative, it actually hampered the 
forging of a national accord among the Somalis. 
  [Dahli] Some Somali factions accuse the Eritrean Government 
of aligning with General Aidid. What is your response? 
  [Issaias] If there is any Somali authority we align 
ourselves 
with, it is Somalia itself, and the Somali people--that is all. 
  [Dahli] You have spoken of the problems of all the states in 
the Horn of Africa. Does that mean that the future of this 
region is murky? 
  [Issaias] In spite of all the problems that each of the 
countries of the Horn of Africa has experienced, and is still 
experiencing, the eyes, hearts, and minds of their peoples are 
on the day when everyone will work side by side to build a 
bright future for future generations. This is the thing that 
never ceases to nurture hope in their hearts. 
  [Dahli] Where do Eritrean-Saudi relations stand? 
  [Issaias] In light of the historic relations between the 
Eritrean and Saudi peoples, bilateral relations between Asmara 
and Riyadh are developing in a very positive fashion. Saudi 
Arabia has great influence and a distinctive role among the 
peoples of the Red Sea basin. 
  [Dahli] What are the dimensions of your relations with 
Israel? 
  [Issaias] Ordinary relations between one country and another 
located in the same region and the same sea. I believe that 
after the solution of the Palestinian question, all the problems 
about dealing with the Jewish state will disappear. The 
political map of the Middle East region will see a radical 
change when there are routine diplomatic relations between 
Israel and Syria, and the rest of the countries of the region. 
  [Dahli] We have heard about promises of Western aid, but 
have 
seen no actual projects. What happened? 
  [Issaias] The Gulf states, especially the United Arab 
Emirates and Kuwait, and the countries of the European Common 
Market, are studying practical projects whose implementation 
will begin very soon. 
  [Dahli] What about the United States? 
  [Issaias] Washington has offered us food aid, but for 
reasons 
having to do with their own policies, they are not, so far, 
taking part in any construction or developmental project.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The government was joining 
the international mediation process intended to resolve the 
country's constitutional deadlock, African National Congress 
Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the mediation was originally intended to 
involve only the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]. 
However, negotiators had decided at Friday's Skukuza summit that 
the government should become a party to the mediation. The 
government has, until now, been lukewarm about the mediation 
process, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled 
constitutional issues. 
  Mr Ramaphosa, who was providing the TEC with a summary of 
the 
negotiations to date, said a task force met on Monday to draw up 
a new proposal for consideration by Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. The task force comprises representatives of the ANC, 
the IFP, the South African Government and the Zulu monarchy. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said "considerable progress was made" by the 
task force, which was due to meet again on Tuesday afternoon to 
hear the response of the king and kwaZulu chief minister and IFP 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to the new proposal. He said the 
terms of reference for the mediation process would also be 
determined on Tuesday. However, he warned against IFP 
expectations that the elections might be postponed. 
  "The IFP seems to be getting into the mediation process in 
the hope that the process will result in the date of elections 
being postponed. The election date is sacrosanct, not even the 
mediation process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa said. He 
expressed disappointment about the outcome of the Skukuza summit 
and the fact that it did not yield a more positive result. He 
said the outcome of the task force's deliberations depended on 
the king and kwaZulu's response. 
  Speaking on the same issue, South African Communist Party 
Chairman Joe Slovo repeated that the elections would not be 
postponed.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela says he is confident 
international mediation can resolve the deadlock over the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the election as 
well as the role of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini under a new 
constitution. Speaking in Johannesburg on Tuesday [12 April] 
ahead of a meeting with Bophuthatswana traditional leaders, Mr 
Mandela said he would meet later in the day with the group of 
international mediators who arrive in South Africa on Tuesday. 
The ANC leader said he would make "detailed recommendations" to 
the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be 
successful". 
  Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington arrived at 
Jan Smuts Airport on Tuesday morning and ex-US Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger was due later in the day. Lord Carrington 
and Mr Kissinger are among seven foreign mediators who will try 
to narrow differences between the ANC and the IFP.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Seven prominent 
international mediators are due to arrive in South Africa on 
Tuesday [12 April] and mediation between the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] and the African National Congress will begin on 
Wednesday, according to the Consultative Business Movement [CBM]. 
  In a statement on Monday, the CBM said all outstanding 
matters regarding international mediation had been successfully 
resolved at an IFP/ANC joint working group meeting on Sunday. 
"It is possible therefore now to announce and confirm that 
seven prominent... international mediators will arrive in South 
Africa tomorrow Tuesday 12 April to mediate between the African 
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party on outstanding 
constitutional matters," it said. 
  The venue for the mediation was not disclosed. The 
mediation team is: 

  -  Mr Justice H. K. Bhagwati, India; 
  -  Lord David Carrington, United Kingdom; 
  -  Mr Justice A. Leon Higginbotham, United States of America; 
  -  Prof Paul Kevenhorster, Germany; 
  -  Dr Henry Kissinger, U.S.; 
  -  Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola, Italy; and, 
  -  Prof Jean Antonie Laponce, Canada. 

    Three special advisors to the mediators and two 
constitutional advisors to both parties will also be present, 
said the CBM, which has been appointed secretariat to the 
mediation. 
  Some analysts have said that before the mediation gets to 
"outstanding constitutional matters" the mediation will first 
have to address the deadlock between the two parties on the 
election date. The ANC has said the April 27 deadline is 
"sacrosanct"; the IFP has said constitutional compromises mean 
little if it has no time to prepare itself for an election 
focused on those compromises.

<F P=106> [Report by E. Waugh and H. Grange] </F>
  [Text] If all goes according to plan, South Africa's new 
government will be in office by mid-May. The dramatic moment 
will follow the May 6 election of a new president by the 
National Assembly and the formation of a multiparty Cabinet of 
national unity. It will be preceded by a series of important 
steps, triggered by the election. 
  Below are the major stepping stones on the path to the 
future, gleaned by THE STAR from negotiating documents, the 
various agencies involved and political parties. 
  -- On April 26 special voting will be held for people who 
are 
pregnant, aged, disabled or sick. South Africans overseas will 
vote on the same day. 
  -- On April 27 and 28 ordinary voting will take place. April 
27 will be a public holiday, and schools will remain closed on 
April 28. Voting hours will be from 7 AM to 7 PM over the three 
days. 
  -- The votes will be counted at 1,200 counting stations 
around the country by electoral enumerators. 
  -- It is expected that the counting should be completed 
within two days. In terms of electoral legislation, the results 
will not be announced earlier than 48 hours after the polls 
close -- and not more than 10 days later, by May 8. 
  -- The national and provincial results are likely to be 
announced simultaneously by Independent Electoral Commission 
chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler in Midrand. The names of 
the candidates who will go to the national parliament and the 
provincial legislatures will also be made public at that time. 
  -- The country will then enter the so-called "interregnum", 
where the current government will act as a caretaker until the 
new government takes power. 
  -- The nine provincial legislatures will convene for the 
first time on May 5, while the National Assembly will be 
convened by the Chief Justice in Cape Town on May 6. The 
president will be elected by the National Assembly, and the 
provincial assemblies will elect their premier. 
  -- Barring any delay in counting, the current Government 
will 
formally leave office on May 6. This will follow the convening 
by the new president, in conjunction with leaders of other 
parties with more than 5 percent of support, of a Cabinet of 
national unity. 
  -- It is understood that the new parliament will continue 
sitting until May 10. At this point the new president will be 
inaugurated at a high-profile ceremony, due to be held in 
Pretoria.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 7 Apr (AFP) -- This week, a mediation 
force deployed in the southern districts of the city began 
collecting illegal arms from opposition and presidential group 
activists, its deputy commander announced today. 
  "We have already retrieved a quantity of arms, some of which 
do not exist in the regular Army's arsenal, which were found in 
the possession of opposition activists," Colonel Jean-Marie 
Guembo told the press, without however specifying the number or 
type of weapons retrieved. "Our task is progressing 
satisfactorily," he stated, stressing that the role of the 
mediation force is "to occupy the frontlines in order to 
definitively stop the violence." According to the officer, 
peace" has gradually become a reality in the capital since 
political leaders, who are mostly responsible for the violence, 
pledged to stop supporting the fighters politically and 
militarily." 
  Established on 30 January after a cease-fire agreement 
between deputies of the presidential group and the opposition, 
the mediation force, which is 400-strong, was deployed on 18 
February in Brazzaville's southern districts, which have 
suffered most from the fighting between the two opposing 
militias that left several hundreds dead between June 1993 and 
last January. These soldiers are also charged with preparing 
the necessary security conditions for the return of tens of 
thousands of people who fled the southern districts during the 
fighting.

  [Text] The country, Rwanda, as you know, is going through 
the most difficult time in its history, ever since last week's 
events which followed the tragic death of the late president 
Juvenal Habyarimana. He was killed with his Burundian 
counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira, in an attempt against the 
presidential plane which was hit by a rocket while approaching 
Kigali airport. It is known what followed: an instant wave of 
violence, first in Kigali, then in other regions of the country. 
  However, high-ranking cadres of the Army and the Gendarmerie 
very quickly carried out their responsibilities, since civilian 
power had been curtailed with the death of the head of state 
followed by that of the prime minister and other high-ranking 
personalities of the country who died as a result of events. 
[Words indistinct] officials of political parties who took part 
in the previous transitional government met and formed another 
government. This was done on 8 April. Since then, the 
president of the National Development Council, Dr. Theodore 
Sindikubgabo, in accordance with the relevant article of the 
Constitution of 10 June 1991, has assumed the interim presidency 
of the Republic. From the moment of the swearing-in ceremony on 
9 April, the new government headed by Prime Minister Jean 
Kambanda has consistently called for peace and the situation 
clearly improved. 
  However, following the threat of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] to march on Kigali, tension increased. That is why the 
government decided, among other objectives, to pursue a dialogue 
with the armed opposition so as to set up a broad-based 
transitional government. It called upon the RPF to favor peace, 
instead of plunging the country once again into misery. For the 
time being, the RPF declares that it does not recognize the new 
Rwandan Government and seems unwilling to reject the resumption 
of war. The Rwandan Armed Forces, however, are confident that 
the punitive [word indistinct] of the RPF will not be a walkover. 
  This brings us to the military situation in the country. 
Last night Kigali was relatively peaceful in most suburbs. 
However, there was an exception. There was heavy shelling 
around the Parliament Palace where the RPF battalion of 600 men, 
who arrived in Kigali at the end of December to protect 
political officials of the rebel movement, is stationed. 
  This morning, there was also relative peace in most parts of 
Kigali, however shots were heard below (Rebero) District towards 
(Butamwa) District. We learn from informed sources that the 
Rwandan Armed Forces are chasing elements of the RPF battalion 
which did not return to its camp after leaving it to attack the 
Presidential Guard camp. On the northern and northeastern 
fronts, the Rwandan Armed Forces have the upper hand, according 
to the same sources. 
  However, the people must redouble their awareness since RPF 
units are attempting to infiltrate Kigali in small groups. On 
the humanitarian level, the situation will very quickly become 
catastrophic. It may already be catastrophic, since all 
officials and personnel working in humanitarian assistance 
organizations have left the country. The camps of war-displaced 
and Burundi refugees have been left to fend for themselves, and 
the next few days will be chaotic. 
  In short, that is the situation prevailing in the country 
today. Militarily, the Rwandan Armed Forces are in control of 
the situation but on the humanitarian level, one should soon 
fear the worst. In order to ensure that supplies reach the town 
of Kigali, Trade and Industry Minister Justin Mugenzi yesterday 
asked the prefects meeting here in Kigali to facilitate the 
arrival of supplies with the assistance of security service 
officials.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The north and northeast are 
under the total control of the Rwandan Armed Forces. The 
relevant services of Army headquarters say nothing significant 
is happening in the Gisenyi operational sector except cases of 
interethnic strife which were also reported in the region last 
week. 
  In the Ruhengeri operational sector, the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] tried to cross the neutral zone in the area of the 
Kinigi and Vumba communes, but the Rwandan Armed Forces easily 
repulsed the attack. The entire zone is now under the control 
of the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
  In the Rulindo operational sector, the Rwandan Armed Forces 
are in control of the Tumba and Kabuye Heights near (Gakenke) in 
the Ruhengeri Prefecture. Thus, the Kigali-Ruhengeri route is 
entirely open and under control. 
  In Byumba, RPF combatants tried to penetrate through the 
(Kisaro) and Rutare communes, but clashed with the Armed Forces 
in the process. 
  The Rwandan Armed Forces are also fighting with RPF forward 
units in the Mukarange Commune in Mutara Region. 
  In Kigali town, as I have said, everything is peaceful at 
this moment, but firing has been heard in the Gikondo sector 
below (Rebero). Now we can no longer hear anything. Military 
officials point out that the RPF is using guerrilla tactics by 
which it is sending small groups of armed men into a sector to 
divert and dislocate important units of the Rwandan Armed 
Forces, but all that is well known to the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
  The people should not panic, but tell the security forces 
where the enemy is hiding. This happened in the Gikondo sector 
yesterday when the attention of a patrol of the national 
Gendarmerie was drawn to the presence of seven RPF combatants 
hiding in a house. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf has asked France to help Senegal repatriate the Senegalese 
troops of the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda. The Belgian 
prime minister says Belgian troops must come home as soon as 
possible. One needs to know, therefore, if France will be the 
only country to keep its troops in Rwanda. The French defence 
minister said recently that even if they remained in the country 
they would not fight. No one can understand why they should 
remain. It is worth recalling that the Rwanda Patriotic Front 
spokesman in Kampala recently said that if the French troops got 
in the way of the RPF they would certainly be fired at. They 
bleed just like anyone else. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Boudewijn Van </F>
Spilbeeck in Kigali by anchorman Nadine Desloovere in 
Brussels--live] 
  [Text] [Desloovere] At this moment we have Boudewijn Van 
Spilbeeck on the telephone directly from Kigali. Boudewijn, you 
have moved into the city. What have you seen and what have you 
been doing there? 
  [Van Spilbeeck] Well, Nadine, this morning we moved into the 
city with a convoy of Belgian and French paratroopers to pick up 
the last Western refugees from the French School. This means 
that the evacuation for Kigali, from the capital, has been 
completed. All the refugees came with us. We had all kinds of 
vehicles at our disposal from various aid organizations as well 
as from UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] and from the Belgians and 
the French, and everybody has boarded these vehicles. It was a 
difficult journey, a long journey, as a part of the city is off 
limits because of the fighting there. So, quite a detour had to 
made. During the trip, the convoy came under fire. Rwandan 
troops on an Army truck driving behind us returned the fire. A 
couple of French paratroopers also shot a few rounds. It was 
quite a journey. But the evacuation is finished now. 
  This morning, and this may be good news for those people 
that 
have family in the Rwandan interior, a Belgian convoy with 
armored personnel carriers has moved southward to pick up some 
20 people. If this turns out to be successful, it may be 
repeated toward the north in the coming days. 
  [Desloovere] Boudewijn, the situation apparently is 
worsening. The rebels reportedly are involved in heavy fighting 
with the Army. What actually is going on? 
  [Van Spilbeeck] Indeed. Yesterday, upon our arrival, there 
was heavy artillery fire. I already told you that yesterday. 
It calmed down during the night. But this morning there has 
been extremely heavy shelling and machine gun fire in the 
northeast of the city in the neighborhood of the Amaholo where 
the UNAMIR peacekeeping forces have their headquarters, and the 
neighborhood of the parliament, obviously, where those 600 or 
possibly already 800 rebels have dug in. Those rebels 
apparently are advancing. There is very heavy fighting and 
everybody here is afraid that, once all the Westerners have 
left, it really will deteriorate and may become kind of a 
Somalia or Liberia. 
  [Desloovere] The government, the interim government, 
reportedly has fled Kigali. Do you know anything about that? 
  [Van Spilbeeck] I have also heard that, but I could not 
confirm this rumor. Indeed, those people should also be on the 
run. That government did not represent many parties. It was 
comprised mainly of people from the entourage of the dead 
president, and it could be expected that they would not be able 
to hold out. 
  [Desloovere] Thank you, Boudewijn.

  [Text] Reports reaching us say that heavy fighting took 
place yesterday in the areas of Mutara, Byumba, and Ruhengeri. 
  In the Mutara Zone, our forces inflicted heavy casualties on 
government forces. Some of the government soldiers surrended to 
our forces voluntarily. Many were taken as prisoners of war, 
while others went into disarray. And in Kigali, Presidential 
Guards fired heavy rockets at King Faysal Hospital killing 29 
people and wounding 70 others. This took place on 10 April 
1994, just two days ago.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Members of Rwanda's interim government, formed 
less than a week ago, are reported to have moved out of the 
capital today, where there has been heavy shelling for the sixth 
day running. [passage omitted] 
  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] military spokesman, Dr. 
Emmanuel Ndahiro, is at their headquarters in Mulindi in 
northern Rwanda. Robin White asked him how much progress they 
were claiming to have made. 
  [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Part of our force that has been 
heading toward Kigali is within and around Kigali. We are 
holding about four positions within and around Kigali. 
  [White] And when did you capture these positions? 
  [Ndahiro] We started fighting (?there) in the morning and 
just before midday, we had already taken those positions. 
  [White] And what is your objective? Are you trying to 
capture Kigali at the moment or what? 
  [Ndahiro] We still feel Kigali is still in chaos; there is 
no 
order and the priority objective is to reestablish law and order 
in that capital, and then we can think about what to do next. 
  [White] So, you are trying to capture Kigali? 
  [Ndahiro] We are being very cautious but ultimately, we are 
moving into Kigali. 
  [White] Do you not think that that is likely to cause even 
more bloodshed? 
  [Ndahiro] Inevitably, there will be bloodshed, but we shall 
have at least stopped the force that is busy killing our people 
and mainly killing the innocent civilians who are not armed. 
So, if we can neutralize that force, the government force, that 
is killing the people, we shall certainly stop fighting. 
  [White] You said this particular force. Which force do you 
mean? 
  [Ndahiro] Specifically the (?first) force that is busy 
liquidating the people is the Presidential Guard and certain 
elements in the Gendarmerie. So until we achieve that primary 
objective of making this force incapable of operating, we shall 
not stop fighting. 
  [White] Have any people from the national Army defected to 
your side? 
  [Ndahiro] We have had some who have been captured, not 
necessarily defected, but in certain quarters we are told that 
some forces are not ready to fight and they are only being 
forced to fight. So, we feel that that is a potential force 
that can come on to our side. 
  [White] You have been talking about Kigali, is there 
fighting 
going on any where else? 
  [Ndahiro] Yeah, fighting is going on in the northern part of 
the country. We have so far, I would say, liberated most of 
Mutara that is the eastern part of the country in the north. We 
have gone far as Gabiro. Gabiro has fallen, it is in our hands 
now. We had earlier seized [words indistinct] Nyumba, we are 
shelling it. We hope to thrash other forces out, but the UN 
monitoring force that is in Nyumba requested us to hold our fire 
so that they could be able to evacuate their forces there, and 
we complied for as long as they are evacuating their own. 
  [White] Do you really believe that you can win a military 
victory? 
  [Ndahiro] I told you earlier that our intention is not a 
military victory. We want to stop the senseless killing that is 
going on in Kigali. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francois Rijkmans in Kigali] </F>
  [Text] The situation has suddenly become more tense in 
Kigali. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], dominated by Tutsis, 
has taken up firm positions between the airport and the town 
center. According to some reports, a group of RPF fighters -- 
perhaps a few dozen soldiers -- has infiltrated to the south of 
the town and established itself at the top of a hill. To the 
north, the Front took up positions about 20 km from the capital 
several days ago. Add to that the battalion of 600 Front 
soldiers which has been in Kigali for several months as a result 
of the peace agreements. 
  It seems this evening that the three groups have started to 
join up. We are getting contradictory reports on the way in 
which the regular troops are resisting the Front's advance. 
  One hundred and fifty French legionnaires have started for 
home, leaving 350 French troops on the ground. 
  All the Belgians from the interior of the country have 
already left. There are about 50 Europeans still in Kigali, 
including five Belgians. Canadian and Italian planes have been 
announced as coming to speed up the departures. The end of the 
evacuations and the departure of French and Belgian troops could 
be the signal for battle in Kigali. 
  The Belgian Embassy in Rwanda is closed this evening. The 
ambassador is at the airport. All the Belgian UN peacekeeping 
troops are concentrated at the airport. They will be given the 
task of taking over from the French in protecting the airport.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, April 12 (AFP) -- Ethnic Tutsi rebels 
fought their way into the Rwandan capital Tuesday [12 April], 
sending the government, foreigners and thousands of residents 
fleeing in fear of a new wave of tribal bloodletting. 
  As intense fighting rocked several parts of the city, the 
Hutu-dominated interim government fled its headquarters in the 
Hotel des Diplomates in downtown Kigali "for a more secure 
place," a Rwandan soldier in the hotel said. Unconfirmed 
reports said the week-old government had moved to the town of 
Gitarama, southwest of the city. 
  The last foreign residents seeking to leave the city were 
meanwhile escorted to the airport by French and Belgian 
paratroopers. France, Russia, Germany and the United States 
said they had evacuated virtually all their nationals from the 
city. 
  In Kampala, Christine Umutoni, spokeswoman for the 
Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), said its forces 
had entered Kigali and were about to join a batallion of 600 
fellow rebels camped outside the city under a UN-sponsored peace 
plan approved by the two sides in August. She said RPF forces 
were awaiting instructions from their headquarters to seize the 
capital, where she said "government forces had dispersed, many 
of them surrendering with their arms to the RPF." The entry of 
the RPF rebels into the city was later confirmed by UN 
headquarters in New York. 
  The RPF totals around 20,000 rebels, as against an estimated 
30,000 government troops. [passage omitted] 
  The latest fighting erupted after the country's long-ruling 
Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was killed when his plane 
crashed here April 6, reportedly after being hit by a rocket. 
  His death sparked an orgy of killing, mostly of minority 
Tutsis by the majority Hutus. More than 10,000 people were 
killed in the capital alone, according to foreign relief workers. 
  The RPF has said for several days that it was sending troops 
into the capital to "restore order" and has rejected the interim 
government set up after Habyarimana's death, saying it was 
hostile to the Tutsis' goal of sharing power. As the rebels 
closed in on the capital and the government fled, residents 
emerged from hiding in their homes, hotels and foreign missions 
and tried to escape an expected wave of revenge killings by the 
Tutsi forces. 
  "It's going to be carnage," predicted a Nairobi-based 
Rwandan 
diplomat. [passage omitted] 
  Throughout the day, troops with the UN peacekeeping force 
here negotiated brief halts in the fighting around the capital 
so that the last convoys of foreign nations could get to the 
airport. But about 25 foreigners working for the International 
Red Cross remained behind to take care of the hundreds of 
wounded suffering in the city's hospitals. The Red Cross 
workers said a surgical team was due to arrive Wednesday despite 
the fighting and another group from the organisation Doctors 
Without Borders was at the airport waiting for an opportunity to 
enter the city. 
  Meanwhile the tribal killings continued and more bodies 
could 
be seen strewn around the city's streets. 
  Umutoni, the RPF spokeswoman, said the rebels planned to 
form 
a broad-based administration as called for under the peace 
accord signed last August aimed at reconciling the Hutu majority 
and Tutsi minority communities prior to free elections by 1995. 
"We shall put in place a framework where everybody can act 
together in the spirit of" the Arusha peace agreement," Umutoni 
said. But she stressed that the RPF would not cooperate with 
what she called "the illegitimate (interim) government of 
assassins." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with correspondent Philippe Boisserie in Kigali </F>
by announcer Bruno Masure in Paris--live] 
  [Text] [Masure] Philippe, first, can you confirm the news 
from the United Nations that the troops of the Patriotic Front 
really have entered the capital? 
  [Boisserie] Absolutely, Bruno. And the Rwandan Armed Forces 
themselves have said that the soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, those who were in the center of the town and those who 
this morning were on all the hills round the town, have met up. 
  Nevertheless, the battalions of the Rwandan Armed Forces are 
still there, and they are fighting bravely back. There was very 
intense fighting here late this afternoon. 
  [Masurer] Philippe, a certain number of French soldiers are 
still in Rwanda: what exactly will their mission be? 
  [Boisserie] For the moment nothing has been decided about 
the 
350 men still here. But this evening the United Nations has 
deployed a unit on the airport car park which implies that it 
will replace the foreign troops who are occupying the airport 
for the moment. So it will be the United Nations that takes 
over from the troops. However, so far nothing has been decided. 
  Anyway, the Rwandan Patriotic Front has made things quite 
clear: It has set a time limit of 60 hours from this morning, 
the United Nations says. So by Thursday [14 April] evening they 
are saying clearly that there must not be a single foreign 
soldier left on Rwandan soil.

  [Text] The government, which illegally took over in Kigali 
on 8 April, is said to have started deserting the capital. 
Panicked by the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Army is getting 
closer to the capital, the government members reportedly headed 
in unknown directions. According to reports broadcast by Radio 
France International, the government clique headed for the south 
of the country. 
  The government army's side is in flight. Some senior 
officers of the death squads have already cleared off, 
abandoning their men on the ground. They are Lieutenant Colonel 
Bahofitse of Byumba military region, and Major (Jombye), 
commander of (Ngawiro) camp in Mutara, known for having given 
military training to Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development (?armed) militias to commit the atrocities which 
have just hit the country, especially in Kigali, the capital. 
The fact that commanders have deserted gives a clear idea of 
the nature of the fighting.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Rwanda, extremely violent 
fighting went on in Kigali throughout the day between government 
forces and the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF. 
Let us take stock of the military situation as described less 
than half an hour ago by one of our special correspondents in 
Kigali, Christophe Boisbouvier: 
  [Begin Boisbouvier recording] At nightfall this evening, the 
Rwandan Armed Forces were still resisting in the basin of 
Kigali. They are under fire from the rebels who are attacking on 
two fronts, in the north and in the south. In the south, they 
are attacking from a hill that overlooks the district of 
Gikondo. Their aim is to join up with the RPF pocket, which, as 
you know, has been holding out for six days in the area between 
the town and the airport. According to the latest information 
here, it seems that the rebels coming from the north have 
managed to link up with those in the pocket, but this is not 
certain. 
  This evening, for the first time we heard firing from rocket 
launchers. This is proof of the violence of the fighting and, 
again, of the resistance of the Rwandan Armed Forces -- or at 
least those of its battalions which have not yet decided to 
surrender. 
  As far as Westerners are concerned, there has not been a 
single French soldier in town since the evacuation of the 
embassy this morning. Some Belgian units are still in two or 
three positions while they evacuate the last foreigners. There 
is also the airport where 500 Belgians and 350 French soldiers 
are deployed. The RPF has just told them via the United Nations 
that they have another three days to complete evacuating and 
leave. 
  [Announcer] Christophe Boisbouvier, this was truly a mad day 
in Kigali, right? 
  [Boisbouvier] Absolutely, a mad day indeed, where events 
moved very quickly. At 0600 to 0630 this morning, the rebels 
were arriving from the south of the town, where they were not at 
all expected to be. It seems that last night they managed to go 
round the capital through the wooded hills around the town. 
This is reminiscent of Vietcong tactics, somewhere else, in 
Asia. They surprised everybody indeed when they attacked above 
Gikondo. This is partly why the French Embassy had to be 
evacuated. [passage omitted] 
  In the afternoon, since the evacuation road between the town 
and the airport was cut, the rebels continued to progress from 
the south and the north, and, as I was saying, they may be 
joining up with the pocket which is between the town and the 
airport. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Christophe Boisbouvier, one of our 
special correspondents in Kigali. He spoke to us on the 
telephone less than half an hour ago.

  [Excerpt] The battle for power is on in Kigali. Last 
night, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF, said their fighters 
had reached the Rwandan capital to restore law and order and 
install a new administration. They said they had a total of 
3,000 men in Kigali. Peace, they said, was going to be restored 
quickly. However, after a quiet and uneventful night, a fierce 
gun battle began at 0430 GMT this morning with heavy artillery.

  [Excerpts] Fighting is taking place in Kigali itself. 
[passage omitted] The Rwandan Government is accusing the UN 
forces, the UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] of giving technical 
help to the rebels, and the Belgian soldiers of facilitating the 
evacuation of Rwanda Patriotic Front members from Kigali. 
  About 40 Belgians remained to be evacuated this morning -- a 
dozen in Kigali and 20 to 30 inside the country. This is what 
we have heard from military sources in Brussels. The Belgian 
nationals have been located precisely and Belgian troops are 
going to try to go and collect them today. 
  Late this morning 338 expatriates arrived at Brussels 
airport. The Belgian ambassador in Rwanda was on the passenger 
list. Princess Astrid went to welcome them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with James Ruego, RPF representative in Brussels, </F>
by correspondent Linda Dewin in Brussels -- recorded, in French 
with superimposed translation into Dutch] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dewin] What are the intentions 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]? A coup d'etat? 
  [Ruego] Our primary goal is to restore order, to restablish 
the constitutional state, security for everyone. After that we 
will adhere to the principles of the Arusha Accords. We do not 
wish to seize power just for its own sake. 
  [Dewin] But is this possible after everything that 
happened?" 
  [Ruego] It is always possible. 
  [Dewin] After all the massacres between the Hutus and 
Tutsis? 
  [Ruego] Yes, even after the massacres we are ready to apply 
the greater principles, such as national unity, and a government 
on a broad basis, etc. But, of course there will be, I think, 
some changes. 
  [Dewin] The question remains of who was behind the attack on 
the presidents? Was the RPF involved in that? 
  [Ruego] Not at all. We applied to the letter everything we 
were asked to do. 
  [Dewin] Nevertheless, it will be very difficult. 
  [Ruego] As a matter of fact, we do not have the intention to 
talk to these commanders of massacres. It is not to them that 
we will talk, but to the political parties with whom we had 
already started negotiating.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Christian Democratic Party; place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] The president of the Christian Democratic Party 
[PDC], Jean-Nepomucene Nayinzira, informs members of the PDC, 
all Rwandans, and the international community of the following: 
All reasonable people are saddened by the accident which led to 
the loss of lives of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi and 
their travelling companions. When Rwandans learned about the 
sad death of President Habyarimana, professional killers started 
executing the plan that they had been drawing up for a long 
time, which was to assassinate all the politicians who fought 
for democracy and who were in favor of the implementation of the 
Arusha peace agreement. They killed Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, some members of her government, heads of 
opposition parties, nuns and priests, members of opposition 
political parties, and foreigners who are opposed to the acts of 
violence. 
  The PDC emphatically denounces [words indistinct] set up on 
8 
April 1994 by claiming that it was made up of all the concerned 
parties in opposition with the former government which has been 
legalized by Article 8 of the Arusha peace agreement. It is 
also sad and shameful to see the president of the National 
Development Council, Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, calling himself 
the president of the Republic, basing this on Article 42 of the 
Constitution. He is among those who abrogated it by decree 
18/94 of 3 August 1993, concerning the revision of the 
Constitution as mentioned in the Arusha agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  The PDC calls upon government troops, the RPF, all Rwandans 
and friends of Rwanda to join together to fight the clique which 
is devastating the country.

  [Text] The Government of Tanzania is exploring the 
possibility of evacuating the remaining Tanzanians from Rwanda 
by road to Rusumo. A statement issued today by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said a vessel 
owned by the Tanzania Railway Corporation, MV Mongozo, is on 
standby at Bujumbura port to take the affected evacuees who are 
now in Bujumbura. The statement said a group of Tanzanian 
nationals who have been evacuated from Kigali arrived in 
Bujumbura last Sunday [10 April]. It said those evacuated 
include the families of our embassy staff and Tanzanians working 
with the Kagera Basin Organization, KBO. 
  The statement further reiterated Tanzania's readiness to 
continue with the role of the facilitator to the Rwanda conflict 
and urges all parties concerned to abide by the Arusha peace 
agreement which was signed by the parties to the conflict. 
  Meanwhile, Tanzania's ambassador to Rwanda, Saleh Boi 
Tambwe, 
has left Dar es Salaam for Bujumbura to supervise the evacuation 
of the Tanzanian nationals.

<F P=106> [Interview with HCR President Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo by </F>
Didier Grogna in Brussels; date not given: "Monsengwo Still 
Believes in Political Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Last week, at the end of fierce debates, the High 
Council of the Republic [HCR]-Zairian Transitional Parliament 
[PT] finally adopted the constitutional law, the veritable 
reference for the transition to democracy. On Saturday [9 
April], the law was promulgated. In particular, it offers the 
opposition a 10-day period in which to present a consensus prime 
minister accepted by presidential circles. Etienne Tshisekedi, 
the prime minister elected by the National Conference, will not 
necessarily be reelected to his post because the text adopted 
does not refer to that National Conference. However, the latter 
considered that the prime minister is an institution on the same 
basis as the president of the Republic, the president of the 
HCR, the courts and tribunals. For Tshisekedi's supporters, the 
adopted text betrays the spirit of the former CNS [Sovereign 
National Conference] and gives too prominent a role to 
presidential circles and hence to Mobutu himself. According to 
these people, the responsibility for this betrayal rests mainly 
with HCR President Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo. On his way to 
Rome, where he will spend a month taking part in the first synod 
of African bishops, he made a brief stopover in Brussels. This 
provided an opportunity to ask him for some clarifications on 
the latest political developments in Zaire. 
  [Grogna] The HCR-PT has just ended its work and the text has 
been promulgated. Has the best solution been found? 
  [Monsengwo] We needed a transitional constitution that 
satisfied the whole political class. The first constitution, 
stemming from the CNS and adopted by the whole political class, 
experienced some difficulties. That led to consultations. The 
agreement reached in the past few days on a constitutional law 
based on the same fundamental principles and the same 
institutional order as the CNS is a very important event. This 
document, accepted by all, will make it possible to put the 
country back on track. 
  [Grogna] You say "accepted by all." However a section of the 
opposition does not seem to support it.... 
  [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the document has been adopted 
in an entirely valid way from the legal viewpoint and according 
to the parliamentary customs. The famous Article 76 with the 
formula that gives the opposition the initiative in choosing the 
prime minister and requires it to inform presidential circles of 
this, was voted on in the normal way. That left a minor point 
of disagreement on the fact that the HCR takes control of the 
issue if there is disagreement within the political class; it 
has been removed because we found a compromise wording which 
satisfied the concerns of all sides. The disputed phrase has 
become: "Once this period is over (10 days -- L'ECHO editor's 
note), the HCR takes control of the issue." 
  This document has therefore been adopted in an absolutely 
proper way. I think that there is not the slightest doubt and 
that the document will not be resubmitted to the plenary session 
because the latter has given full powers to the office to verify 
that the text is in order. That has been done. 
  The document has therefore been adopted by everybody and 
even 
the USORAS [Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition], which left 
during the vote, came back for the closing ceremony. 
  [Grogna] You spoke of difficulties encountered by the 
transitional document adopted by the CNS. Some importants 
points from that document seem to have been excluded, like the 
one making provision for the prime minister to be one of the 
transitional institutions.... 
  [Monsengwo] Certain points were not excluded. We simply left 
it to those who refer to the CNS institutional order to act 
accordingly. It is for them to say what they believe. 
  [Grogna] Knowing very well that, if they continue to support 
Tshisekedi, there will be deadlock.... 
  [Monsengwo] I do not see why there should be deadlock. The 
question is why some people express reservations about 
Tshisekedi. They must have a motive and the opposition can try 
to find a solution to this problem. The opposition should 
respond to the reasoned views of the various sides to reassure 
them. 
  Dialogue is vital. We aim to create a government of national 
unity. It cannot be formed without consultation and dialogue. 
This dialogue must start at the level of the appointment of the 
prime minister in order to encourage the formation of the 
government. It is not enough to impose a prime minister, those 
who are appointed to work with him must agree to join his 
government. The problems connected with the formation of such a 
government can be cleared up during discussions relating to the 
prime minister. We must succeed in reassuring each other. 
  I do not see things in terms of deadlock but in terms of 
consultation during which each expresses his viewpoint and 
reassures the others. Zaire's real problem is a problem of 
mutual guarantee. It serves no purpose to try to impose things. 
  [Grogna] The scenario therefore makes provision for the 
opposition to present a candidate accepted by presidential 
circles. Does that rule out Etienne Tshisekedi? 
  [Monsengwo] It does not automatically rule him out. But it 
is important to understand what has happened. We were faced 
with two camps which were based on a different institutional 
order. For some, there was a power vacuum at the top and it was 
therefore necessary to elect a prime minister; for the others, 
there was no vacuum. We wanted to prevent this problem of the 
power vacuum handicapping the work of the HCR. Indeed, the 
power vacuum is a constitutional problem which falls within the 
scope of the Supreme Court of Justice. Resorting to it would 
have taken time because of the legal procedures. That is why we 
asked each side to withdraw its demands. 
  Some were asked to stop talking about electing the prime 
minister; others to stop referring to election during the CNS 
which was no longer vital. The constitutional problem of the 
power vacuum was therefore left to one side and it was left to 
the opposition, which invokes the CNS' institutional order, to 
act accordingly and appoint the prime minister. This order 
makes provision for the prime minister to be able to leave his 
office. This means in general that the opposition can confirm 
him or change him according to the situation. 
  [Grogna] Has the president given you guarantees? This is not 
the first time that he has announced his involvement but has 
done nothing. 
  [Monsengwo] The president is an institution on the same 
basis 
as the HCR-PT, the government, the courts and tribunals. Each 
of us must shoulder his responsibilities, in accordance with the 
constitutional text which governs us. The head of state is a 
participant in the dialogue. He has no special guarantee to 
give, other than those stemming from the constitutional text. 
  [Grogna] Do you have assurances that he will adhere to that 
text? 
  [Monsengwo] I do not see why he should not. He has followed 
the discussions relating to this text and the principles which 
underlie the texts have been accepted by his political family. 
  [Grogna] This would not be the first time that he had failed 
to follow the recommendations of his political family. There 
have been precedents in recent years and especially during the 
CNS.... 
  [Monsengwo] I do not think there have been precedents aside 
from the institutional order which has not been accepted because 
presidential circles had left the CNS debating hall. It is 
important to know whether or not it left at the president's 
behest. 
  [Grogna] Your theme has always been "no winners or losers." 
Have you succeeded in ensuring that? 
  [Monsengwo] Yes, I think so. We have arrived at a series of 
points of agreement which have been drawn up into an 
institutional system accepted by everybody, because even those 
who left the hall returned. 
  We hope that the appointment of the prime minister will take 
place in the same spirit of cooperation with a great degree of 
concessions on all sides. 
  [Grogna] Do you think that the political class will succeed 
in appointing a prime minister in 10 days? 
  [Monsengwo] I do not see why it should not succeed. If it is 
not possible, we will assess the situation in the HCR and ask 
the question of how a solution can be found. 
  [Grogna] If Etienne Tshisekedi is not the opposition's 
candidate, who is now likely to resist the president's pressures? 
  [Monsengwo] I do not want to concern myself with this 
question of candidates. I am dealing with principles, not 
individuals. I have never had anybody in mind. 
  [Grogna] The press is accusing you of betrayal.... 
  [Monsengwo] There are two possibilities. Either these people 
who are saying that do not understand the subtlety of the 
approaches or they are insincere. Or perhaps they have never 
read the mechanisms of the institutional system which we have 
just set up. Anybody who knows these texts cannot claim that the 
CNS' institutional system has been betrayed. 
  [Grogna] You are going to spend one month in Rome; Joseph 
Ileo, the HCR first vice president is very ill and is receiving 
treatment in Belgium. This therefore means that the HCR will be 
chaired by the second vice president who is a member of 
presidential circles.... 
  [Monsengwo] First, I think that the HCR settlement is fairly 
clear. I do not have to be there for the prime minister's 
appointment. The office is organized in such a way that my 
absence does not present any problem. With regard to the second 
vice president acting as chairman, I think that everybody must 
realize that the HCR office is everybody's office and not just a 
bipolar body. 
  [Grogna] What are your thoughts on the events in Rwanda? 
  [Monsengwo] These are very painful events. I hope that the 
situation can return to normal as quickly as possible in the 
framework of a democratic system. 
  [Grogna] Could the Rwandan lesson benefit the Zairians? 
  [Monsengwo] I think that we have always avoided violence. I 
hope that the Zairians will continue to rely on nonviolence for 
the solution to the problems facing us because our country must 
get back to work.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It will appear that the Zairian opposition Sacred 
Union is not as rock solid as it used to be. One of the parties 
in the coalition has been kicked out and it is partly over the 
leadership of Etienne Tshisekedi who is locked in a struggle 
with President Mobutu over who should be Zaire's prime minister. 
From Kinshasa, (Makele Urung) telexed this report: 
  After a meeting that stretched late into the night, the 
Sacred Union general assembly delivered its chilling verdict. 
The centrist Union of Independent Democrats, UDI, supported 
largely by businessmen and technocrats, was no longer part of 
the opposition coalition. The party was accused of betraying 
the spirit of the national conference and of violating the 
principles of the Sacred Union alliance. 
  The expulsion was clearly an attempt by hardliners within 
the 
alliance to discipline the troops for daring to challenge the 
claim of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi to the post of 
prime minister. In this regard the UDI is accused of having 
made two mistakes. First, it did not join a mass opposition 
walkout in Parliament last week in protest against the adoption 
of a constitutional article which allowed candidates other than 
Etienne Tshisekedi to stand for the premiership. The UDI then 
added insult to injury by helping to launch the URD [Union for 
the Republic and Democracy], which is an opposition subplatform 
widely seen as a challenge to Tshisekedi's authority. 
  Tshisekedi supporters have other strong reasons to suspect 
the UDI. The party's leading light, Kengo wa Dondo, is being 
tipped as a potential prime minister if in the end Tshisekedi 
agrees to step down. Already the opposition press has launched 
a bitter campaign against Kengo who is the son of a Polish 
father and a Rwandan mother. The press says he is not a true 
Zairian and therefore he's not suitable for the post of prime 
minister.

  [Text] The Constitution Commission has said it would submit 
the draft constitution to the Council of Representatives early 
next week. The draft document, which the chairman of the 
commission, Mr. Kifle Wedajo, said at a press conference was an 
outcome of a great deal [word indistinct] and compromises, 
guarantees basic human, democratic, and political rights. Mr. 
Kifle said the document stipulates the formation of 
parliamentary system of government, with the prime minister 
fully responsible for the parliament, and a nominal head of 
state. It also provides for a federal system of governance, 
whereby the federal units will have very [words indistinct] of 
internal governance as well as very strong participation in the 
central government. 
  The chairman said the proposed parliament will have two 
chambers: the upper house, House of the Council of Federation, 
and the lower house, where the public are represented through 
delegates elected by them. According to Mr. Kifle, members of 
the commission agreed on the ownership of land and the right to 
self-determination up to secession. He said the majority of 
members of the commission supported the view of government land 
ownership, while the minority opted for mixed planned ownership. 
Mr. Kifle said federal regional governments will be drawn along 
the ethnic boundary demarcation which is now in force.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] An assistant minister in the 
office of the president, Julius Ole Sunkuli, today informed the 
House that 18 people have died and scores of others injured in 
ethnic fighting between Kalenjins and Kikuyus in the Burnt 
Forest area of Uasin Gishu district. In a ministerial statement 
regarding the situation in the area, Mr. Sunkuli further told 
the House that so far 28 people have been arrested in connection 
with fighting. [passage omitted] 
  He gave the breakdown of those killed as 12 Kikuyus, five 
Kalenjins, and one person of unknown origin. Those arested 
include 18 Kalenjins, seven Kikuyus, and three Luhyas. Those 
arrested have been charged with being in possession of dangerous 
weapons and being in possession of firearms, Mr. Sunkuli said. 
  Responding to the assistant minister's statement, the 
official leader of the opposition, Wamalwa Kijana, said the 
government must be firm and resolve to end the tribal clashes. 
Mr. Wamalwa charged that the government seemed to pay lip 
service to the recurrent tribal clashes and called for a 
permanent solution to the issue. He warned that if the clashes 
went unchecked there was a danger of an outbreak of civil war in 
the country. The leader of the opposition wondered why not a 
single member of the opposition had been arraigned in a court of 
law for being involved in the clashes, as alleged by the 
government. 
  Mr. Mwai Kibaki, member for Othaya, DP [Democratic Party], 
who on Thursday [31 March] last week sought a ministerial 
statement regarding the tribal clashes in Burnt Forest, 
responding to the assistant minister's statement, charged that 
the people burning houses and committing atrocities in the area 
seemed properly equipped and were well organized. The member 
asserted that the curfew imposed in the area was bound to serve 
no purpose since houses had already been burnt. He wondered 
which houses they were supposed to go to since theirs have been 
burnt. Mr. Kibaki said the country had enough security 
personnel capable of maintaining law and order in a single 
division. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Uasin Gishu district commissioner [DC], Mr.

possible to assist those who had been affected by clashes which 
flared up some time back in the Burnt Forest area, adding that 
calm had been restored. 
  The DC, speaking when he chaired a leaders' meeting called 
to 
discuss the security in the region, said the government had 
donated 3,000 bags of maize to the people who had fled the area 
and had now gone back to their farms, and warned the press

  [Text] Kampala, 12 Apr (KNA) -- Ugandan border villages in 
Ntungamo and Kabale districts came under attack from Rwandan 
troops on Sunday [10 April], the independent MONITOR newspaper 
reported Tuesday. Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, works, transport and 
communications minister and National Resistance Council (NRC) 
(Parliament) member for Kabale Municipality, on Tuesday 
confirmed the shelling, but said he lacked details. "We don't 
have any specific details of the incident," he said. 
  The state-owned NEW VISION newspaper said four artillery 
shells form the Rwandan hill of Muriha landed in Kamwezi in 
Kabale District on Sunday near the UN Military Observers' team 
[UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda -- UNOMUR] station. 
The shells from Rwandan Government troops currently engaged in 
a shoot out with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) hit 
Kamwezi at midday, but caused no injury or damage to property. 
  Increased fighting between the Armed Forces and the RPA has 
been reported since the death of Rwandan President Major General 
Juvenal Habyarimana in a plane crash on Wednesday. 
  The situation along the Uganda-Rwanda border areas is, 
however, said to be calm, although World Food Program (WFP) 
relief supplies for Rwanda have been stuck in Uganda's border 
town of Kabale. The trucks were headed for Kigali and other 
turmoil-hit areas in the north of the country before the 
outbreak of the chaos in Rwanda. UNOMUR is meanwhile reported to 
have increased the frequency of its patrols across the border. 
  When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invaded Rwanda from 
Uganda in 1990, Rwanda Government troops retaliated with 
artillery attacks. Rwanda has accused Uganda of active support 
for the RPF rebels. 
  Meanwhile, hundreds of Rwandan civilians from the Ruhengeri 
region have continued to enter Uganda and Zaire as they flee the 
fighting between the RPF and government troops, THE NEW VISION 
reported. 
  Reports from the border adjoining the three countries said 
civilians had not been directly affected by the fresh clashes 
between the two sides, but had been scared away by the sound of 
gunfire, which could be heard from a close range. 
  In spite the growing chaos in the troubled state, a number 
of 
Rwandan refugees have continued to enter Rwanda through safe 
areas under the RPA after leaving camps in Uganda. A lorry full 
of refugees was reportedly seen crossing into Rwanda through an 
unofficial entry point on Sunday.

  [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has congratulated all NRC 
[National Resistance Council] members who participated in the 
peaceful, free, and fair Constituent Assembly elections which 
were held in the country about two weeks ago. The president, 
who was addressing a special session of the NRC in Kampala 
today, told both winners and losers that the overall winner of 
the elections is the country, because of the peaceful and open 
manner in which they were held. He advised those who support 
the continuation of the Movement type of government not to shut 
out support, but to accommodate any Ugandan who says he is for 
the Movement system, regardless of his past and present 
performance or connections. He also advised those who support 
the reintroduction of the multiparty system now to ensure what 
they say is responsible and appealed to them not to incite 
hatred among the people. 
  Earlier, the president called for a minute's silence in 
memory of Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, who died in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April] 
night. He described their death as a tragic event. Commenting 
on the problems in Rwanda and Burundi, Mr. Museveni lamented the 
overinternationalization of African problems, which tends to 
make people concentrate on winning the ear of the outsiders 
instead of listening to their compatriots. Citing Uganda as an 
example, he said the people must be left alone to solve their 
problems themselves, adding that he advocates African solutions 
to African problems, regional solutions to regional issues, and 
national solutions to national problems.

  [Text] Head of Government Roch Marc Christian Kabore on 9 
April publicly announced the counter proposals made by the labor 
unions in response to the government's 5 April proposals. The 
issue that has set a lot of tongues wagging is certainly that of 
salary increase, heightened by rumors of a hypothetical 
15-percent increase said to have been authorized by the World 
Bank and the IMF. This has once again sparked off the debate 
over whether or not to believe the government, which has been 
telling the whole world that budgetary constraints resulting 
from the structural adjustment program do not enable it to 
significantly increase salaries. Prime Minister Kabore refutes 
these rumors and also gives some facts on the sales tax the 
government is levying on fuel. 
  [Begin Kabore recording] We have been hearing here and there 
that the World Bank and the IMF have authorized the government 
to increase salaries by 15 percent and that it is refusing to do 
so, in the hope that by bullying workers it could get them to 
accept its proposals. I would like to dispel any doubts on the 
matter, which I believe was reported by JEUNE AFRIQUE news 
magazine which I would say is not a negotiator between these 
institutions and our country. I would also like to reaffirm 
that at no time was Burkina Faso authorized, under the current 
program, to effect a 15-percent salary increase. It is 
therefore important for us to dispel such doubts since the 
rumors being circulated could cause some confusion among workers 
and Burkinabe in general. We need to remove all such doubts on 
the matter. 
  The other problem is that when people look at the price 
structure they accuse the government of levying too many taxes, 
especially in regard to fuel and a certain number of items. I 
would simply like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that 
the basic revenue -- the 6 billion we have been talking about -- 
constitutes earnings generated from taxes levied on various 
products. Thus, logically speaking, if we (?invest) 126 
billion, in light of the taxes we are collecting today, it is 
obvious that if we reduce the value of these taxes, we would 
actually be reducing the state's revenue and it would therefore 
be unreasonable to demand salary increases. [end recording]

  [Text] A new association of political parties has just 
been formed. It is called the Grouping for Solidarity 
[Groupement pour la Solidarite -- GPS], with Mr. Achi Koman as 
its president. Mr. Achi Koman tells our correspondent David 
Mobio everything about the GPS. 
  [Begin Koman recording] There are 19 political parties that 
formally signed the charter of the GPS on Thursday, 31 March 
1994 at the city mayor's office. This newly constituted GPS 
professes to be a centrist party. What does that mean? On the 
political scene there is a very strong party, which is the 
ruling party, on the right; there is another party on the left, 
which is relatively strong, which is trying to impose its 
hegemony there. We believe that politically there is a third 
place in Cote d'Ivoire to be filled, and that is the center, and 
this is what the GPS has done. All political parties which 
reject unrestricted capitalism or communism should be able to 
join the GPS, that is, locate themselves in the center in order 
to be able to practice what we call economic pragmatism. Since 
ideologies do not work anymore, all political regimes are 
converging toward the center, and are today practicing economic 
pragmatism. This is the economic basis of our union. 
  We stayed out of all the groupings that had taken place 
before, because from our experience we know that when unions are 
formed, in the beginning things are rushed and they lead to a 
lot of misunderstandings. Mistakes and bitterness follow. 
There have been unions before -- there was the Coordinating 
Committee, the Convention -- which broke up -- the Collective of 
Eight, the Union of Democratic Forces, the Ivorian Democratic 
Conference, the Federation of Democratic Forces, there were a 
lot of unions -- and all these unions failed. So when we met on 
12 February, we set up a working committee, which comprised 
representatives from all these various unions which had failed. 
Each representative brought what he experienced in each of 
these unions. Why did these unions fail? The answer to the whys 
of the failure of these unions enabled us to draw up the 
constituent charter for the GPS, which is helping us to avoid 
all the things that caused the failure of the other unions. We 
believe we have been able to outline the framework of this union 
so as to enable it really to achieve the objectives assigned to 
it. In actual fact, the other unions which were formed had never 
outlined any major political objectives such as we have -- that 
is the first thing; second, the unions which were formed 
previously never had as their objective the formation of a 
strong union through the encouragement of the various member 
political parties in weaving a network of solidarity within that 
union. People just meet and agree on who will be the leader and 
then say there will be leadership by turns. Such leadership by 
turns does not allow leaders to actually manage the union, but 
rather try to draw benefits from the union for themselves. 
These are some of the factors that caused the failure of these 
unions. 
  We have placed in the forefront-- and this is what is 
important -- the major objectives of the GPS, which are national 
solidarity, the unification of Africa, and the assertion of an 
African cultural identity. Consequently, we came together 
around an objective, not around party interests. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] At their plenary session today, the deputies 
adopted the bills for the 1994 budget. Toure Carlos Yerekpin 
reports: 
  [Yerekpin] The bills adopted after being studied by the 
deputies should enable the government to adequately control 
personnel spending through a more rigorous management of the 
civil service, the departure of workers who have reached the age 
of mandatory retirement, and the acceleration of voluntary 
retirement. A total of 4.9 billion CFA francs was provided for 
this. A bill to streamline the recovery of state revenue 
through the decentralization of the tax department and another 
to readjust operating expenses to take into account the tasks of 
the various ministries and the new conditions were also adopted 
at the session. 
  The new allocations greatly favor ministries involved in 
human resources development such as health, social affairs, 
national education, higher education, and scientific research. 
The general operating budget bill also provides for the gradual 
divestiture of state ownership through accelerating the 
privatization program for 54 companies and the strengthening of 
primary health care. The bills adopted also provide for 
creating jobs by estabilishing a more flexible and appropriate 
institution -- the Research and Promotion Agency -- to replace 
the Ivorian Labor Office; the continuation of the training 
policy by maintaining and stepping up grants -- an amount of 
10.3 billion CFA francs was allocated, representing an increase 
of 25.6 percent while subsidies amounting to 11.1 billion were 
allocated to private schools, representing an increase of 26.1 
percent; and the continuation of domestic debt repayments 
through the part payment of liabilities to the tune of 3.591 
billion CFA francs. 
  The special capital budget for the 1994 fiscal year, which 
was presented to our deputies, was balanced at 220.728 billion 
CFA francs, an increase of 56.24 percent over last year's. To 
stimulate activities in rural areas and promote local 
agricultural production, four special budget items were created: 
an agricultural diversification and exports promotion fund with 
1.25 billion CFA francs; an animal production promotion fund 
with 450 million CFA francs; an agricultural guarantee fund with 
1 billion CFA francs; and a mechanized farming support fund with 
1.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted] 
  In light of the extensive program launched to provide 
television and radio coverage nationwide, the allocation for 
this department amounted to 25.543 billion, seven times the 
usual amount. The problem of license fees for the special 
parastatal, Cote d'Ivoire Radio and Television, was permanently 
resolved by our deputies. 
  The rural electrification sector and the roads program were 
also given special attention at the National Assembly. The 
creditors of the former National Agricultural Development Bank 
could soon have the smiles back on their faces with the adoption 
of the repayment plan. Studies are under way on the high cost 
of the new national identity card, as well as on penalties for 
late payment of bills from the Ivorian Electricity Company, Cote 
d'Ivoire Telecommunications, and the Cote d'Ivoire Water Supply 
Company. The deputies would like to see the penalties removed.

<F P=106> [Article by Arsene Bonga Koudou] </F>
  [Text] With the approach of the 1995 elections, the 
Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI] wants foreigners to 
vote officially. For this reason, Interior Minister Bombet is 
getting ready to present a custom-made electoral law to 
Parliament. Article 3 of this law stipulates: 
  Those eligible to vote are: 
  Ivorian nationals of both sexes aged 21 before the closure 
of 
the voters' register, who enjoy full civil and political rights, 
and who are not disqualified to vote by law. 
  Foreigners from the Economic Community of West African 
States 
[ECOWAS] member countries, in accordance with the community's 
protocol on citizenship, whose names are in the voters' register. 
  That is the PDCI's detonator. Obviously, the old party is 
demonstrating its desire to pitch the Ivorian people against 
foreigners because it knows that Ivorians have not yet forgotten 
the 1990 elections. The late Houphouet-Boigny stole their 
victory from the people by allowing these foreigners from 
neighboring countries to vote. How frustrating! However, if 
the people accepted their pain stoically, it was because it was 
caused by Houphouet-Boigny. This time, however, they do not know 
who their provoker is. 
  Who says Ivorians are nonviolent. Beware! If the PDCI does 
not want foreigners in Cote d'Ivoire, it should drive them away 
itself. It must not use the hands of the freedom- and 
justice-loving people to do that. Frustrations at the elections 
have transformed peaceful Algerians into indomitable terrorists. 
As they see their hopes evaporate because the West has imposed 
freedom-stifling regimes on them, all they can do is to choose 
the path of violence. At least, that is what they believe so in 
Algeria no day passes by without the murder of at least two or 
three Westerners. Is that not driving foreigners away? 
  The Ivorian people know that it is foreigners who imposed 
the 
PDCI on them in 1990 otherwise, this party, which has refused to 
organize fair elections, just has a few Ivorians within its 
ranks. 
  Today, Eburneans [Ivorians] have decided to finish with 
their 
governors who have nothing to propose to them. They need 
change: new men and a new program. They should not be invited 
to the field of violence. The PDCI must be careful. The 
deputies who will be called upon to pass this fatal law must 
show a sense of moderation because no Army in the world, no 
matter its training, can thwart the legitimate aspirations of 
the people, especially when the people are provoked 
indefinitely. Let us look around us.

  [Text] The National Assembly continued its plenary session 
this morning. The parliamentarians examined the document 
submitted by the parliamentary opposition group accusing the 
president of the Republic of violating the Constitution. For 
the parliamentarians of the parliamentary majority, the action 
introduced by the parliamentary opposition falls outside the 
realm of constitutionality. Here is an excerpt of the statement 
issued this morning by the National Assembly. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In accordance with 
Article 6 of the Constitution, only the people have the right to 
embark on civil disobedience against an oppressive regime or one 
that comes into being through a coup d'etat. No one can 
represent the interest of a section of the people while claiming 
to be legitimately acting on behalf of the entire people. 
  At any rate, the functions of the present institutions are 
in 
tune with the provisions of the Constitution as voted by the 
Niger people. The president of the Republic, elected through 
direct universal suffrage, duly selected a cabinet based on the 
actual majority in the National Assembly. Such institutions 
cannot be reasonably suspected of wanting to go against a 
constitution which forms the very foundation of their own 
stability. 
  From the foregoing, it behooves the executive branch of 
government, which is responsible for maintaining law and order, 
peace, and public safety, to guarantee the normal functioning of 
republican institutions. In this regard, any parliamentarian 
who, departing from the exigencies of his mission, indulges in 
acts that jeopardize government operations, must, like any other 
citizen, bear the full consequences of his commissions and 
omissions with regard to the laws as well as rules and 
regulations in force. [end recording]

  [Text] The three-day workers' strike called by the 
Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] began today. The 
USTN is demanding the annulment of the Right To Strike Act 
passed on 17 March by parliament and a 30-50 percent salary 
increase. Government Spokesman Moctar Diallo yesterday evening 
reiterated the government's determination to enforce the act 
rigorously. He also pointed out that the government is prepared 
to raise salaries by 5 to 12 percent. It should also be noted 
that deductions for up to five days of strike will be made from 
the salaries of striking workers. 
  This morning, the USTN held a rally at the Place des 
Concertations. On this occasion, the USTN secretary general 
stressed the legal character of the strike. He urged members to 
be more vigilant to ensure greater cohesion within the labor 
federation. Finally, it should be noted that similar rallies 
were held in the hinterland. 
  [Paris AFP in French at 1115 GMT on 12 April, in a 
Niamey-datelined item, adds the following: "This morning, 
Niamey Airport was closed to traffic. Similarly, banks, 
insurance firms, and supermarkets in the capital were shut. 
Skeleton staffing was maintained in the public service while 
the presidential palace -- the seat of government -- the 
ministries, and offices of the state media were deprived of 
electricity. In solidarity with the strikers, taxi drivers have 
also decided not to work for 24 hours."]

  [Text] The Plateau State Government has imposed a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Jos metropolis. The curfew which comes 
into immediate effect begins from 7:00 in the evening to 6:00 in 
the morning. In a broadcast to the people of the state this 
evening, the state administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed 
Mana, said the order is to forestall the acts of vandalism and 
lawlessness by some misguided elements over the composition of 
the caretaker committee of Jos north local government area. The 
administrator expressed surprise at the development because the 
state government had publicly stated that the matter is being 
looked into by the appropriate quarters. He assured all 
law-abiding citizens in the state of their safety. A section of 
the Jos main market was set ablaze during the demonstration.

Ibrahim) explained that due to the absence of such legal 
instruments, the Authority had to rely on other government

  [Text] The Federal Government has expressed satisfaction 
with the present security arrangements at Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport, Lagos. The minister of transport and 
aviation, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, stated this in Lagos today 
when an official of the United States Federal Aviation 
Administration, Mr. Walker Park, paid him a courtesy visit. 
  Chief Babatope explained that a lot had been done to raise 
the level of security at the airport and expressed the hope that 
the United States would soon lift the embargo imposed on the 
airport. He said the Federal Government appreciated the 
cooperation and understanding of the American Embassy. Chief 
Babatope and the minister of state for transport and aviation, 
Alhaji Aremu Yahaya, had earlier met with the American official 
behind closed doors. The team is in the country to inspect 
facilities at the airport. 
  The American Government severed air links with Nigeria in 
August last year because of what it called inadequate security 
arrangements at the airport. Meanwhile, the minister of 
transport and aviation and its counterpart in the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs will on Monday [18 April] next week carry out a 
joint inspection of the airport.

could make such a call in consultation with the Council ulemas. 
He said jihad could only be prosecuted within the framework 
provided by Islam, and records have shown that even Prophet 
Mohammed fought the Holy War due to severe persecution he and 
his followers suffered at the beginning. (Malam Mohammed) noted 
that Muslims in the country have been enjoying freedom of

  [Text] Lagos, April 10 (AFP) -- Chief Moshood Abiola, the 
self- proclaimed winner of presidential elections last June, 
called Sunday [10 April] for an immediate return to democratic 
rule in Nigeria. 
  In a statement published Sunday by his newspaper Concord, 
Abiola said that the return should begin with the reinstatement 
of all elected officials of all democratic structures disbanded 
last November in the aftermath of General Sani Abacha's 
take-over of government. The remaining results of the 
presidential election held June 12 last year should also be 
declared, he said in the statement. 
  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) had published only 
results from 14 of the 30 states of the federation when the 
exercise was stopped in compliance with a court order. Later, 
on June 23, the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida annuled the 
entire result for alleged irregularities. 
  "With democracy will come openness and transparency. All our 
national problems can then be brought into the open and 
solutions found with all participating", Abiola said in the text. 
  Since that election was cancelled, Abiola has campaigned for 
upholding of the "sacred mandate" that he claimed was given to 
him by the people in the election. 
  He said that the military, which has ruled for 34 years 
since 
the nation became independent from Britain in 1960, has been 
unable to find solutions to the nation's problems.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There has been a major shake up in the top ranks of 
the Sierra Leonean Army. Among the 14 senior officers who have 
been sacked is the head of the Army, and it comes at a time when 
the military is finding itself stretched in its drive against 
the RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels. This month, the 
RUF has staged attacks in northern Sierra Leone for the first 
time in their three-year-old rebellion. From Freetown, Victor 
Sylver telexed this report. 
  The Defense Department in Freetown has sent the head of the 
Army, Major General Jusu Gottoh, and 13 top military officers on 
compulsory retirement. A spokesman from the Defense Department 
said the decision had been taken in the best interest of the 
Army and the country. He did not elaborate further. Apart from 
Gen. Gottoh, Brigadier (Modibo Lyman), and Brigadier Joy Toure, 
a former brigade commander and current head of the Army's 
training center, have also been retired. Four colonels and five 
lieutenant colonels, including the commanding officer of the 2d 
Battalion based in Makeni, as well as a major and a captain are 
also on the list. 
  Although the official reason given for the move is that it 
is 
in the best interests of the Army and state, speculation is rife 
that the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] Government 
is impatient with the pace of the war and with the apparent 
success of the rebels. Ordinary Sierra Leoneans are sometimes 
taken by surprise to note an escalation in rebel activities just 
when they were beginning to be optimistic that the war would 
soon come to an end. It would seem that recent action taken by 
the rebels to hold a section of the Bo-Kenema Highway, and moves 
to do the same on the Masingbe Matotaka-Kono Highway has finally 
sapped the government's patience. 
  The first promise made by the men of the 29 April Revolution 
when they came to power two years ago was to bring the rebel war 
to a speedy conclusion. The man now charged with this 
responsibility is Colonel (Kelly Conte), who is the new head of 
the Army. Sierra Leoneans are eagerly watching to see if he can 
perform the long-awaited miracle.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Action Committee for Renewal and </F>
Togolese Union for Democracy in Lome on 12 April] 
  [Text] After learning with surprise on 11 April that by a 
presidential decree signed on 6 April the government has decided 
to organize by-elections in the constituencies of Loti 1, Wawa 
1, and Wawa 2, the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and 
Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] state the following: 
  1. The two parties wish to stress that Article 155 of the 
Togolese electoral laws provides for by-elections, quote, only 
in case of vacancy as a result of death, resignation, or 
appointment of a candidate's alternate to any other post 
incompatible with his status, unquote. Therefore, the three 
challenged constituencies cannot be a pretext for the government 
to organize by-elections in the these constituencies in order to 
(?accept) new candidates. Annulling a poll can only lead to 
fresh elections for candidates who previously stood for the same 
elections. It is, therefore, surprising that the 
above-mentioned decree makes people believe that there could be 
two rounds of election in the constituencies, where the second 
round of the previous elections was challenged by the Supreme 
Court's constitutional chamber. 
  2. The CAR and UTD also consider that only a government duly 
formed after the 6 and 20 February elections, in accordance with 
the Togolese Constitution, can organize any by-elections or 
fresh elections, but not the outgoing government. 
  3. The CAR and UTD are surprised that the outgoing 
government 
published a decree organizing elections in the three 
constituencies in question at a time when the head of state is 
trying, along with the leaders of the parliamentary majority, to 
find ways of resolving the institutional crisis that resulted 
from the rejection of these three invalid constituency results. 
  4. The CAR and UTD regret that after attempts to withhold 
the 
results of five constituencies, the outgoing government is doing 
everything to overthrow the parliamentary majority obtained by 
the opposition and to deprive the people of their victory. 
Despite the negative maneuvers of certain troublemakers, who 
have been identified and who should have been brought before a 
court, the elections were described as satisfactory by all the 
international observers. 
  5. The CAR and UTD, considering all the above, denounce the 
organization of so-called by-elections by the outgoing 
government on the basis of the 6 April decree. 
  6. The CAR and UTD urge the head of state to continue to 
seek 
a political solution with the leaders of the parliamentary 
majority in order to put an end to the suffering of the people. 
  Signed by attorney Yaovi Agboyibor for the CAR and Edem 
Kodjo 
for the UTD.

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks could resume today, after a 
break of slightly more than one week caused by UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's trip to Geneva to hold 
talks with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. In fact, 
some people believe that the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] will adopt a more flexible stand 
to facilitate the proceedings. Alves Antonio, our correspondent 
in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] The Lusaka peace talks could 
resume 
today. This could be a decisive day for the resumption of 
government-UNITA talks in the Zambian capital. Reliable and 
generally well-placed sources have also admitted the possibility 
that a plenary meeting attended by the troika of observers and 
the negotiators will take place today. Some points still need 
to be discussed, notably national reconciliation and the 
conclusion of the second round of presidential elections. 
  The UNITA team remains reluctant about certain points, but 
it 
has continued to come under pressure and it seems likely to show 
some flexibility because it will have to accept its standing as 
a political party that lost the 1992 elections. The Angolan 
peace talks continue to attract much attention and something new 
could happen today. May it be for the good of the Angolan 
people, who need peace so they can work to ensure progress and 
development for their country. [end recording]

  [Text] Alioune Beye believes that peace is closer for 
Angola. Speaking in Luanda today at the end of a meeting with 
the chairman of the National Assembly, the UN secretary 
general's representative said it is necessary, now more than 
ever before, to be more cautions because the enemies of peace 
may hinder the Lusaka peace talks. He did not elaborate. 
  The meeting, which lasted for more than an hour, was held 
behind closed doors at the Palace of Congresses. Afterwards, 
Beye told journalists that the news blackout [preceding word in 
English] imposed on the Lusaka talks will continue because 
secrecy is the name of the game. The UN envoy declined to 
elaborate on the meetings he held with the UN secretary general 
and the president of the republic. Beye criticized several 
Angola and foreign news media organs for disseminating gossip, 
thereby hindering the pace of the negotiations. Beye, however, 
could not hide one of his trump cards -- peace is closer. As in 
the past, (?Beye preferred not to elaborate). 
  [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into Portuguese 
translation] The Angolan people know very well that we are still 
in Lusaka because there is still hope. 
  [Unidentifed correspondent] Do you confirm that yesterday 
you 
spoke on the phone with Dr. Jonas Savimbi. 
  [Beye] I can neither confirm nor deny it. I want to work for 
peace. I also know that Angolans want peace. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be a limit for the duration of 
the 
Lusaka talks? 
  [Beye] I have already said it would be showing lack of 
seriousness to set a limit on an exercise like the Lusaka talks. 
  [Correspondent] Will it be possible to tell Angolans that 
peace is still a distant dream or will we have pleasant news 
over the next few days? 
  [Beye] I know very well that Angolans feel desperate and do 
not want war. It is for that reason that we are in Lusaka. We 
have scored successes because we have not negotiated in public. 
  [Correspondent] Do you not think that by giving more details 
to the news media you would scale down the desperation of 
Angolans? 
  [Beye] I do not think Angolans are completely desperate. We 
have seen that in disputes as severe as the one in the Middle 
East, the Oslo secret talks were successful. So, we would like 
to adopt the same method in the Lusaka peace talks. I would 
like to add that there are enemies of peace in Angola and 
elsewhere. If the news media undermines the hope and morale of 
the people, it would be serving the interests of the enemies of 
peace. Now that we are closer to peace, the enemies of peace 
are getting restless. They want to prevent us from achieving 
peace. But we will achieve peace. 
  [Correspondent] You have said that because peace is closer, 
the enemies of peace are at work. So, you are saying that peace 
is closer. 
  [Beye] Precisely. We are closer to peace and for that reason 
we are still in Lusaka. It is not very pleasant to stay in a 
hotel for five months and the international community would not 
have gone along with it if we had not scored results. [end 
recording] 
  The news blackout [preceding word in English] imposed on the 
Lusaka talks is now stricter than ever. There have been 
suggestions that the Lusaka talks could enter a decisive stage. 
It has been over three months now since the talks started. The 
meetings Beye had with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in 
Geneva and with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda on 
10 April, as well as the telephone conversation with Dr. Jonas 
Savimbi on 11 April, have made many observers predict 
developments in Lusaka. We will have to wait and see.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
returned to the Zambian capital yesterday after a stopover in 
Luanda, following his return from Geneva, where he had held 
talks with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. As always, 
the UN special representative did not hazard any guesses, though 
he believes in a favorable outcome to the Lusaka peace talks. 
  [Begin Beye recording, in French with passage-by-passage 
translation into Portuguese] If someone could come up with a way 
for us to achieve peace, I would immediately seek and consult 
with that person. [end recording] 
  While in Luanda, the UN special representative was received 
by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos and 
National Assembly Chairman Fernando Franca van Dunem. Blondin 
Beye was not willing to reveal the nature of his talks with the 
Angolan head of state or with the National Assembly chairman, 
saying it would be discourteous to do so. 
  [Begin Beye recording in French, fading into Portuguese 
translation] It would be irresponsible on my part to leave the 
president of the Republic's office and promptly tell you: Here, 
this is what he has just told me. I do not intend to be 
disrespectful toward the Angolan people. I cannot do that. I 
want to work for peace, so I cannot disclose (?things like 
that). [end recording

  [Text] A group of intellectuals in Benguela Province has 
told the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, 
correspondent in that province that all bilateral accords which 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, government may sign with other countries are bound to 
fail completely because of the war in this country. Those 
Angolan cadres, who have an in-depth knowledge of the country's 
political, military, economic, and social situation, were 
reacting to the most recent announcement by the MPLA-PT's 
embassy in Washington saying that the Luanda government's 
council of ministers had approved an accord to facilitate 
private U.S. investment in this country. 
  Those Angolans warned the government and all U.S. 
entrepreneurs not to be fooled by the easy conditions the 
MPLA-PT government is offering at this stage when the country is 
beset by war. To invest when a war is on is tantamount to 
throwing money away. Those Angolans believe that Americans 
should first become constructively involved in the search for a 
peaceful settlement to the Angolan conflict by persuading the 
MPLA-PT to be flexible at the Lusaka peace talks and by making 
it stop the war that it has been waging on the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, throughout Angolan 
territory. 
  Those intellectuals in Benguela concluded by saying that 
once 
those conditions have been met, all U.S. private investment will 
be welcome in Angola.

  [Text] Jardo Muecalia, National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] representative in Washington, 
said in the U.S. capital yesterday that the presence of South 
African mercenaries in the Angolan civil war is contrary to the 
spirit of the UN-mediated Lusaka peace talks. 
  Ambassador Jardo Muecalia added that the international 
community should not allow South African or any other 
mercenaries to place under threat whatever successes may already 
have been scored in the Zambian capital. That UNITA official's 
statement comes in the wake of an announcement by an African 
National Congress, ANC, official confirming the involvement of 
South African Defense Force soldiers in the Angolan civil war. 
That ANC official also voiced concern about that problem.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The atmosphere at the Angolan peace talks is hardly 
likely to have been improved by reports of fighting today in a 
strategic region of the northeast. The talks have dragged on 
for nearly five months now, but they have got bogged down in 
disputes over power-sharing between the MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] government and the UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels. Now the two 
armies are battling for control of Cafunfo, a diamond rich town, 
300 hundred miles east of the capital. Nicholas Jackson of 
REUTER news agency telexed this report from Luanda: 
  State media and independent observers said today that 
fighting was intensifying around the rebel-held town of Cafunfo, 
which is at the heart of the Cuango valley diamond region. A 
diplomat in Luanda said that both sides were engaged in military 
actions and that government artillery was within range of 
Cafunfo, which was captured by UNITA early last year. The state 
daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, also reported that UNITA was 
stepping up its activity. The town would be a major prize for 
the government in the war against UNITA. Since the rebels 
captured the town, industry sources say as much as $200 million 
worth of diamonds have leaked out, providing the rebels with 
their main sources of funds. 
  Diplomats said action on the ground seems to be taking 
precedence over UN-brokered peace talks in the Zambian capital 
Lusaka. One diplomat said that the talks were reaching a 
turning point. If there was no progress, the United Nations 
would have to suspend the process, letting the fighting take its 
course. The Lusaka talks have yielded agreements on military, 
legal and political issues, but the sides became bogged down on 
national reconciliation, in particular on power sharing between 
the government and UNITA and a role for UNITA leader, Jonas 
Savimbi.

  [Text] Maseru April 8 SAPA -- There is no guarantee a 
crisis will not erupt again in the Lesotho Army unless the 
causes are addressed, according to a report by the presidents of 
Zimbabwe and Botswana on their peacekeeping mission to Lesotho 
in February. Mr Robert Mugabe and Sir Ketumile Masire visited 
Lesotho at the request of Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief 
Emeka Anyaoku after a Lesotho Army mutiny in January. 
  Their report said that after the government's initial 
unsuccessful efforts in 1993 at reconciling its differences with 
the army, the main opposition Basotho National Party [BNP] and 
other political parties, it appeared to have taken no further 
action. 
  At the end of 1993 there had been little or no dialogue 
between the government and other political groups, said the 
report. 
  The Basotholand Congress Party, which won elections in April 
last year, found itself in contradiction with a civil service 
and an army that had been recruited and trained to serve a BNP 
government. Personnel of the two institutions were partisan and 
ill prepared to serve a BCP government. 
  The army mutiny arose from a demand for a 100 per cent 
salary 
increase, which the government felt was a "smoke-screen hiding 
the real intention of overthrowing the government of Prime 
Minister Ntsu Mokhehle". 
  The report said the government should have taken 
counter-measures against the mutiny earlier. It said there had 
been signs in November of an impending mutiny, when young 
officers began disobeying their commanders and senior officers. 
  The Mugabe-Masire report said the monarchy in Lesotho should 
reign rather than rule. There was much uncertainty and a marked 
degree of unhappiness and suspicion on the part of the Basotho 
people with regard to the monarchy, the report said. It 
suggested amendments to the constitution.

  [Text] The chairman of the Disarmament Committee, 
Lieutenant General Manken Kigawa, has expressed concern that 
some members of the (?disbanded) Malawi Young Pioneers movement, 
MYP, and a substantial amount of arms and ammunition still 
remain unaccounted for. 
  Lt. Gen. Kigawa expressed this concern at the Army 
headquarters in Lilongwe when he briefed the press and diplomats 
on the progress so far made in disarming the MYP. He said it 
was sad that after receiving the MYP [word indistinct] and 
government efforts to find ways and means of absorbing some key 
members of the MYP, the question of repatriation of over 2,000 
former MYP believed to be in Mozambique, was still unresolved. 
  He said the Army was doing its best to ensure that the 
matter 
is resolved as soon as possible. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army 
will remain vigilant and will not tolerate any groups or 
individuals who may want to support violence in the country. He 
therefore advised the general public not to possess unlicensed 
arms. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army will ensure that the 
forthcoming presidential and parliamentary general elections are 
free and fair. 
  Also speaking at the press conference, the secretary for 
youth, sports and culture, Mr. (Michael Timotu) appealed to 
those who are in the MYP movement to identify themselves to the 
police for their assistance saying if they were caught with arms 
they would be prosecuted.

its special congress in Maringue yesterday. That congress will 
draw up Renamo's electoral strategy, including the electoral 
campaign and choice of candidates in the presidential and 
legislative elections scheduled to be held in October of this 
year. 
  Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has disclosed that the 
delegates to the congress will also discuss Renamo's 
transformation from a political and military movement to a 
political party. In his opening speech, Dhlakama warned 
Renamo's members to be ready to face alleged provocative 
behavior by the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo. 
Elaborating on such alleged provocative behavior, Dhlakama said 
that Renamo supporters have had their membership cards forcibly 
removed and children of Renamo members have been expelled from 
schools.

President Afonso Dhlakama proposed, for the first time at 
national level, what he has been saying privately for a long 
time. He proposed a Government of National Unity [GNU], as we 
revealed in our edition last week. We would like to begin our 
round table asking the secretary general to give us more

  [Ululu] The proposal made by President Dhlakama is aimed at 
obtaining national reconciliation. We want Mozambique to belong 
to all Mozambicans. We want unity, reconciliation, and the 
participation of all Mozambicans... 
  [Mabunda] Those are the objectives that you have in mind. 
What I would like you to do is to explain what Renamo means by 
a Government of National Unity? 
  [Ululu] I am getting there. The idea is to prevent one party 
from doing everything alone. We want a Government of National 
Unity where everyone will have a role to play. 
  [Mabunda] In our edition last week we presented three 
possibilities for a GUN. One, where the majority party, Renamo 
or Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], would be represented; 
two, a government involving all parties; and three, a government 
involving people from all ethnic groups in the country. To 
which of these three does Renamo subscribe? 
  [Ululu] Well, our view is that there should be a GNU that 
brings together all Mozambicans, regardless of their religious 
beliefs or political ideologies. By doing this, we shall be 
eliminating the old thinking that this country only belongs to 
one party and cannot be governed by any other force. With the 
establishment of democracy in the country and for national 
reconciliation, we feel we should have a government of national 
unity. There are people who talk of federalism and so on. 
This means that there is an imbalance; others say that this or 
that group has no participation in the government. These 
gossips cause tensions and can bring about conflicts. 
  [Mabunda] We still do not understand each other. Mr. 
Secretary General, give me a direct answer: for you, a 
government of national unity is one which brings together 
members of all parties or members of different ethnic groups? 
  [Ululu] The proposal is the following: We shall have 
elections and the party that wins must not think that it won 
alone. It should not only appoint individuals from that party, 
but should also appoint other competent individuals from other 
parties. 
<H5>  Monamo's Views </H5>
  [Mabunda] What does Monamo [Mozambique Nationalist Movement] 
understand by a government of national unity? 
  [Dias] Monamo has a track record on the GNU or national 
reconciliation or the union of the Mozambican family. This 
record can therefore serve as a basis to explain this view. As 
early as 1986 Monamo, in its work entitled "Immediate Peace," 
and in the letters it wrote to the president of the republic 
and the president of Renamo, called for the establishment of 
multiparty democracy, immediate peace, the establishment of a 
transitional government for a minimum period of three or five 
years, but not longer, in order to prepare free and fair 
multiparty elections. Answering your question, this government 
would be made up mainly of Mozambique Liberation Front and 
Renamo elements; mainly Frelimo and Renamo elements because we 
were at war. This government would then be completed with the 
participation of other individuals with national prestige. 
Thus, a government which would have brought about peace between 
Frelimo and Renamo would make use of individuals with national 
prestige to establish a strong, nonauthoritarian government. 
This proposal was made in 1986 and it was a condition for 
immediate peace. 
  During the protracted peace talks in Rome, Monamo once again 
insisted on the establishment of a transitional administration 
to organize the elections. This would eliminate mistrust and 
subsequent accusations of electoral fraud. The government and 
Renamo did not show any interest. Renamo preferred the system 
of two administrations: one belonging to the government and the 
other to Renamo in areas it controls militarily. Monamo held 
various contacts at political, economic, and social levels at 
both national and provincial levels. At a conference held at 
Rovuma Hotel in 1991, we came to the following conclusion: 
There is no party, neither Renamo that we knew reasonably well 
nor Frelimo, that we knew well and the entire people know well, 
that would be able to govern well. That included Monamo and 
other political parties. What would be the solution? After the 
signing of the General Peace Accord, after the holding of 
elections, it would not be possible for a single political force 
to present a good government and carry out a good public 
administration. Thus, we conveyed our views to various 
religious denominations, particularly the Catholic Church -- 
because even last Sunday during a mass, Cardinal Don Alexandre 
said "it is necessary that we choose a strong government, a 
government that gives orders and knows how to give orders." It 
will not be the elections that will bring about a strong 
government. Our people are not in a condition to choose a party 
that would offer better conditions. Our people are more 
concerned with their daily famine, they are not even interested 
in politics.... 
<H5>  Now We Hear Voices Calling For GNU's Establishment </H5>
  [Mabunda] In brief, does Monamo favor establishing GNU? 
  [Dias] Absolutely, but let me finish...what kind of GNU, 
that 
is the question you posed. As far as we are concerned, the 
country is almost ungovernable. The economy is out of state 
control, corruption has become increasingly more generalized. 
All this means that there is a need for establishing a GNU. 
The country is experiencing very serious difficulties, the 
number of individuals who are both competent and honest is very 
low, because of corruption. To establish a strong but 
nonauthoritarian government, there is a need to form a GNU that 
would make use of the available and effective political, 
economic, and social forces. Unfortunately, it is only now that 
we begin to hear authorized national and international forces 
advising establishing a GNU. It is better late than never. 
  [Mabunda] I think we are still finding it difficult to 
define 
GNU. What does it mean for Monamo? 
  [Dias] It means to obtain what is good and useful in 
Frelimo; 
what is good and useful in Renamo; and what is good and useful 
in other parties, representatives of social forces. There are 
people in trade unions, churches, students organizations, and 
company sectors that can be well utilized. Thus, we can form a 
government of consensus that would be free from destructive 
criticism, a government that would be supported by all. Not 
even Renamo would raise a finger. Let us suppose that Frelimo 
wins the elections, as it is claiming, and Renamo, Monamo, PCN 
[National Convention Party], other parties, and so on... we 
shall only try to find fault. If we participate in the 
government, however, we shall be equally blamed for its 
failures. We shall combine all our efforts. When there is no 
one who is strong, capable... you cannot tell me that Frelimo is 
capable because it has already proved that it is unable to 
govern. Likewise, you cannot tell me that Renamo is capable, 
because it is not.... 
  [Mabunda] If I understand you correctly, Monamo favors 
establishing a GNU more than holding elections? 
  [Dias] No, no. The transitional period has already passed. 
I do not think that the Renamo president wanted to postpone the 
elections. The Renamo representative is here.... 
<H5>  To Realize People's Wishes </H5>
  [Mabunda] Mr. Ululu, a GNU before or after elections? 
  [Ululu] What Dr. Maximo Dias is saying is very clear. We are 
about to hold elections. Elections are most important for 
people to have their choice. What we are saying, however, that 
a GNU is a government of harmony, where every Mozambican will be 
able to make his or her contribution to the country's 
reconstruction. There are two things that we need to see: 
There are party views, that is party ideologies, and party 
programs. When it comes to establishing a government, it is 
something else...those who take part in the government need not 
necessarily be party members, the government has to be formed by 
responsiblle and competent people to realize people's wishes. 
  [Mabunda] Does the National Convention Party [PCN] want to 
speak before Frelimo? 
  [Chire] Let Frelimo speak.... 
<H5>  Elections Must be the Point of Departure </H5>
  [Ngwenha] For Frelimo, it is natural that people should try 
to find and study various ways of guaranteeing the success of 
the Mozambican peace process, which is so difficult and complex. 
Our first aim is to guarantee the consolidation of peace. We 
think that the fundamental instrument of this process is the 
General Peace Accord. Our main concern, therefore, is to 
guarantee that this accord is implemented. This does not 
necessarily mean that we are dogmatically refusing to hear views 
that could be useful for our country's future. The elections, 
the acceptance of democratic rules of the game, are in our view 
extremely important. That is why we could put the question this 
way: GNU before or after elections? 
  The establishmentof a GNU would first of all naturally 
signify discouraging the peace process; it would signify 
renegotiating the General Peace Accord and we think that this 
would be the beginning of a lot of problems. We, therefore, 
think that the point of departure should be elections, despite 
all the difficulties, all the shortcomings that may ensue. 
Elections should be the point of departure -- the government 
that will be elected, the program that will be voted for. In 
Frelimo we make efforts to overcome our difficulties. We have 
always said that we examine our form of governing. We have 
experience, we know our mistakes, and perhaps it is because of 
this that we are at an advantageous position. Who makes 
mistakes must have be able to do better by learning from those 
mistakes, but the person who has not made a mistake, he still 
needs to learn. If you read the Frelimo Party sixth congress 
report, you will see what Frelimo says about the whole process. 
Thus, we guarantee that the program that we shall present to 
the electorate will be a program that will ensure peace, 
stability, and the normalization of the Mozambican people's 
life. This being the case, the issue of the formation of a 
national or coalition government depends mainly on the results 
of the elections. This issue cannot be viewed before the 
elections. We need to know the position of each party. 
  We, the parties, cannot be the ones to decide on this issue. 
This would be dictatorship. What is the difference between this 
and dictatorship? We shall have to submit our legitimacy to the 
electorate. We must hold elections so that we can know who is 
who and the elected party will have the responsibility to 
maintain a machinery that guarantees peace, stability, and the 
government operations. 
  In conclusion, I would like to ask those who defend a GNU 
the 
following question: Where in the world has GNU been successful? 
What is its justification? Dr. Maximo Dias said Frelimo cannot 
govern... it is not a permanent position... I even look at 
myself and say: What do I have to do with that? I think that 
we cannot see things that way, in the negative way. If we want 
to obtain positive justifications for establishing a GNU, it 
would be more advisable to see what is positive in parties, that 
can unite us.... 
<H5>  GNU After Elections </H5>
  [Mabunda] Is the PCN in favor or against a GNU? 
  [Chire] It is obvious that the PCN favors a GNU. From the 
understanding that we have of the country, we think it would be 
extremely dangerous for the country if we failed to establish a 
GNU. It should be clear that we support a GNU after the 
elections. All the same, we think this issue can be discussed 
now, despite the Frelimo representative's feelings that the most 
important thing is to guarantee the implementation of the 
General Peace Accord [AGP]. We cannot postpone the discussion of 
important issues because we are apparently going against the 
AGP. In any case, the accord is not being fully implemented. 
It is being constantly violated by the parties. The first 
timetable was not implemented and the second one is not being 
fully implemented. We should therefore be more moderate and 
reflective when we speak of the AGP's implementation. 
  The Frelimo representative said that in the coming 
elections, 
the people will vote for a program. I do not think it is true 
that the people will vote for programs, because they have not 
even been able to digest the meaning of a multiparty system. 
Most of our people are not even aware that there is a 
multiparty system in the country. They do not know the meaning 
of a political party, party program, or voting. The people will 
vote into power the party with most resources, the party that 
will be able to reach the most areas, the party that will be 
able to maintain control over a specific part of the population. 
  The Frelimo Government will try to maintain control over 
areas that have always been under its control, and Renamo will 
do the same. Let us not speak of programs. We are in a country 
where most of our people are peasants and are not in a position 
to know the meaning of party programs. That is why, we propose 
a government.... We should convene a meeting on this issue. 
This meeting should be attended by parties, churches, and 
organizations. We would obtain different ideas and proposals and 
come up with an agreement. We are now defining the meaning of 
GNU. Is that necessary or not? The thing is that even if the 
parties reach an agreement on the issue, the final decision lies 
with the ruling party. If it decides that there should be no 
debate on the issue, then there will be no debate. We are not 
respecting the rules of the democratic game, which always try to 
seek a constant consensus. No matter how right we may think we 
are, we must always seek a consensus. 
  There are countries which have adopted the system of a 
minimum percentage. Let us say, for example, that the minimum 
percentage is set at 25 percent, the party that obtains over 25 
percent should be able to have a vice president in the 
government. A party that obtains over 15 percent should be able 
to have a minister. These are just examples. Everything could 
be defined accordingly.... 
  [Mabunda] As is the case in South Africa.... 
  [Chire] Exactly. 
  [Mabunda] It seems there is an agreement.... 
  [Ngwenha] There is no agreement.... 
  [Mabunda] For those who support a GNU there is an agreement 
that this is only possible after elections.... 
<H5>  The Opposition Does Not Always Understand What We Are Saying </H5>
  [Ngwenha] Yes, there is an issue that I would like to 
stress. 
It is sometimes difficult to work with the opposition. There is 
a tendency not to understand what is being said and this will 
not help matters. It is not true that I said we should postpone 
the discussion of important problems facing the country. It 
would be unbelievable for a ruling party like ours, with its 
responsibilities, to say that we must postpone the discussion of 
important matters. 
  I would like to point out in clear terms: We accept the 
discussion of important problems facing the country. It must 
not be said that Frelimo refuses to discuss important problems 
facing our country. It is normal for one to speculate and say 
that one does not believe in this or that, but we must have more 
objective criteria. It is not just enough to form a party and 
claim to speak in the name of the people. Simply doing that 
does not mean that a party is truly legitimate and represents 
the people. There is a need for more objective, more acceptable 
criteria. I think that is the advantage of democracy, which is 
mankind's major achievement. 
  It is only through elections that matters can be defined. 
The elected government has the responsibility to guarantee 
peace, stability, and a national balance -- which could include 
reconciliation and a broader government concept, provided it 
works. For this, it is necessary that the parties discuss their 
programs, find how their views coincide and differ, try to bring 
their positions closer. 
  [Chire] I would like to clarify to Dr. Ngwenha that I did 
not 
say that he said that we should postpone the discussion of the 
issue. I said that in my view, while it is important to see 
that the AGP is implemented, we should not postpone the 
discussion of important issues. 
<H5>  Why Only Now? </H5>
  [Mabunda] There is an issue that was raised by the Frelimo 
representative. Dr. Ngwenha said the important thing is to 
implement the AGP. On the basis of this, I would like to ask a 
different question: Why is Renamo only now coming up with the 
establishment of a GNU, Mr. Vicente Ululu? 
  [Ululu] What is taking place in Mozambique now is the 
process 
of evolution. When we discussed the AGP in Rome, we did not 
reach agreement on every issue. If we were to discuss 
everything in detail, we would have spent years and years, and 
bloodsuckers -- forgive my expression -- would have benefited 
from the situation. When we raised certain questions about the 
Constitution, people began to say we did not want peace. They 
said the Constitution cannot be discussed, but it is fundamental 
for the Mozambican people. Thus, it was not discussed, but 
there are many things in the Constitution that can be 
questioned, as Dr. Maximo Dias has pointed out. The parties 
agreed that there were two administrations in the country. To 
answer your question, the issue is being raised now because of 
the process of evolution in the country... 
<H5>  Answering the Evolution </H5>
  [Mabunda] What developed exactly between the signing of the 
AGP and now? 
  [Ululu] I think many things coincided. When the issue of 
state administration came up, the president of the Republic and 
President Dhlakama met and agreed on the way elections should be 
conducted. 
  There were undoubtedly two zones controlled by the rival 
parties. As part of the implementation of the accord, the 
parties agreed that those zones should be integrated. This was 
a development, because two administrations were recognized in 
Rome. Today we speak of GNU because we think that Mozambicans 
can live together. 
  [Mabunda] Let us assume the PCN won elections in Mozambique. 
Would it not like to rule alone? 
  [Chire] Not during this phase. We believe that the 
resolution of the problems facing the country entail the 
participation of many more people than those who are in the PCN. 
  [Mabunda] In any case, the PCN would have a program in 
different fields. Would it appoint a Renamo minister to 
implement the PCN program? How would this function? 
  [Chire] Mozambique would not be the first country in the 
world with ministers from different parties. I know the 
difficulty that exists in understanding certain things, because 
we lack democratic experience. We have to understand things in 
a different way because in democracy, it is normal to find 
elements from other parties in the government. The PCN has a 
program, but it would invite in members from other parties. It 
would negotiate its program with other parties, in the country's 
interest. If we establish a GNU, I believe the government will 
have greater trust from the international community. 
  [Mabunda] What does Monamo have to say about this? 
  [Dias] Normally, when people speak of a GNU, it is because 
there is a very serious social, economic, and political crisis 
in the country. It is because the country has become 
ungovernable, in a multiparty system. This is the reason, I 
believe, why the Renamo president (he now understands the 
country's reality) thought a GNU was fundamental for the country. 
  To speak of a GNU in terms of power sharing is completely 
wrong. It will not work. In the present chaotic conditions of 
the country, a GNU can work. When there is a public 
administration crisis, the government does not govern, 
politicians do not assume their responsibilities, our police do 
not work, nothing works. It is not the fault of the party in 
power, but it is because of the total chaotic situation in the 
country. 
  That is why those who support a GNU say that we have to 
sacrifice our party ambitions in the supreme interest of the 
nation. To participate in a GNU means to sacrifice one's 
political program. It means to sacrifice one's strategy for 
power. Thus, if we are selfish, we shall say let Frelimo or 
Renamo govern alone. We know however that no one would be able 
to govern alone and it will be our people who will suffer. 
  We have had enough of experiments, and that is why even 
Renamo supports a GNU. I do not believe that those who support 
a GNU do so in order to share power. Monamo supports a GNU, but 
the aim is not to share power. 
  It was agreed here that when we speak of a GNU, we mean 
after 
elections. The PCN proposed here that all parties, regardless 
of their party programs, should hold a meeting to come up with a 
consensus on the establishment of a GNU. 
  To sum up, there are two reasons that lead us to support a 
GNU: In a serious economic situation, in a serious social 
situation... it is not enough for Renamo President to say that 
he will not return to the bush. Savimbi also said that. It is 
not enough for Joaquim Chissano to say there will not be another 
war. Wars are not avoided just because people say there will be 
no war. The war results from circumstances on the 
ground....There could be a madman in Renamo, a madman in 
Frelimo, a soldier who will say: We have not lost the elections, 
let us fight -- and shots could begin and never stop again. 
This can be avoided if there is a agreement before the 
elections that whether Frelimo wins or Renamo wins, there will 
be no problems. We shall have a government in which everyone 
participates, because of the serious economic situation in the 
country. This government can be established on the basis of 
different criteria: percentages, as was pointed out here by the 
PCN president [as published], but for me, percentages are not 
very significant. The elections are not 100 percent 
democratic, because our people are not fully politically aware 
and do not know all the parties existing in the country. We 
should not forget that 80 percent of our population is 
illiterate and has no access to radio. Thus, when we argue for a 
GNU, it is because the situation is serious.... 
  [Mabunda] Would the representative of the Frelimo Party 
care to comment? 
  [Ngwenha] My comment is as follows: I cannot stress enough 
that it is fundamental that the principal points in the accord 
be complied with. I believe that such compliance must arise 
from the political will of the various sides. We are still 
faced with the problems of demobilization, administration of 
certain areas, and the implementation of all other measures 
which can guarantee a small margin for errors during the 
elections. Important though it may be, that matter of striving 
for a government that is effective and that can settle the 
serious problems facing our country is no justification for 
entering into compromises before the time: that could be a 
strategy for each party to follow. For instance, should it win 
the upcoming elections, Monamo's strategy will be to form a 
government of national unity. That is Monamo's strategy. 
Should Renamo think along the same lines, that will be Renamo's 
strategy, but it is our belief that there is the need to respect 
the electorate's wishes. There are people who will vote for 
Renamo so that Frelimo is removed from power. We cannot tell 
our electorate: vote for whom you please, but be sure to know 
that such and such people will be in power, irrespective of the 
result. It is important that we accept the rules of democracy 
from the beginning and that we stop humiliating our people, 
saying they know about this but not about something else. Such 
humiliation I can accept when it comes from outside, but when it 
comes from Mozambican people...such exaggerations can reflect a 
certain ignorance about our people's abilities. We are going to 
do things, and the people will show what they want when 
elections come up and prove whether they can or cannot vote. I 
would also like to say the following: we have often heard 
people say that Angola's events must not be repeated here. I do 
not know what was repeated or what should not be repeated in 
Angola. What is happening in that country is that the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, is not 
abiding by the rules of the game. Now, in Mozammbique, who is 
it that does not want to accept the outcome of elections? Is 
there a political will to accept elections? This has to be the 
starting point and the rest is compromise. The type of 
government that we will have in the future must reflect the 
people's wishes. Then, we can enter into compromises. Frelimo 
will be entering into compromises with Monamo and the PCN 
depending, of course, on the outcome of elections... 
  [Ululu] Pardon me, but there are some things...namely, who 
is 
going to participate in the government after elections have been 
held. Dr. Ngwenha has said that the people may feel humiliated 
if they see a Frelimo official participating in a government run 
by some other party...now, here we are talking about seriousness 
and complete respect for the government of this country. As Mr. 
Maximo Dias has indicated, the country is staring bankruptcy in 
the face, experiencing an economic crisis, there is social 
instability, and the police are incompetent...I have been very 
clear in saying that when we go to elections, it is not the 
party but the person who wants harmony in the country who should 
participate. It makes no sense that Mr. Ngwenha should feel 
humiliated if Renamo wins the elections and appoints him as head 
of some department. This is a matter of rescuing the country 
from its misery.... 
  [Mabunda] There is one problem here and I am going to touch 
on it again because I feel that it needs to be clarified. Let 
us suppose that Renamo wins the upcoming elections and that it 
invites Dr. Ngwenha, of the Frelimo Party, to implement Renamo's 
program in the area of education. What if Dr. Ngwenha fails to 
agree with that program? 
  [Ululu] There are other Mozambican people, there are many 
other Mozambicans.... 
  [Ngwenha] I would like to ask: This man Ngwenha has had no 
votes, is on the sidelines, but Renamo selects him. Ngwenha 
competed but received no votes.... 
  [Ululu] He can be selected.... 
  [Ngwenha] But, by doing so, you would be violating some 
rules.... 
  [Ululu] In this particular context, such a thing would be no 
violation in a democracy. Dr. Ngwenha has just said that there 
is some difficulty in working with the opposition. That is why 
it is called democracy: it is indeed very difficult to work 
with the opposition because it will oppose those government 
plans that it deems to be incorrect.... 
  [Chire] Naturally, I understand Frelimo's position. It is 
the ruling party, it makes an apparent change for transition and 
for democracy, and it creates a situation in which it continues 
to control everything and it believes it can win the upcoming 
elections. I think it is understandable that the Frelimo Party 
should think it will win the elections. Dr. Ngwenha has talked 
about political will, but Frelimo neither has now nor has ever 
had the political will to change. We have not seen Frelimo show 
any willingness to change, or any tendency to change.... 
  [Ngwenha] But what is the direction of change? 
  [Chire] I shall answer that right now. I think that Dr. 
Ngwenha, as a politican, knows that there is a set of 
prerequisites that have not been met in Mozambique.... 
  [Ngwenha] In concrete terms, what prerequisites are those? 
  [Chire] Now, you are becoming a journalist.... 
  [Ngwenha] No, I would just like to know!.... 
  [Chire] Let me tell you...because like this you are breaking 
down my reasoning. I get very confused and we will end up 
without dialogue...I do not believe that conditions have been 
created in this country for a transition to a democratic 
society. This is what happened: a cease-fire accord was 
signed, it was written in the Constitution that there is 
democracy as of today, a number of laws were approved and they 
will apparently be good for a democratic society, but those laws 
have not been implemented. The government has done nothing to 
prepare society for that transition but you, the Frelimo Party 
representative, are here telling us that the people know whom 
they are going to elect. The people do not know what is 
happening and are poorly informed. Those people who have said 
for many years that they were the only ones, and that they were 
the best, continue to say so today. That is not democratic 
behavior. Democratic behavior is to say that there are a number 
of parties, that each party has its own program, that our 
program is as follows, and to give others the opportunity to 
present their plans. To this day, all one hears is about 
Frelimo and Renamo...now, what programs will the people choose? 
Conditions are not in place yet for a democracy....

  [Text] A document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent 
to our news desk 6 April states that Mozambique and Lithuania 
have decided to establish diplomatic relations at ambassadorial 
level as of 30 March. 
  The document says the decision was made due to the two 
countries desire to develop relations of friendship and 
cooperation in the political, trade and economic fields, based 
on the 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. 
  Relations between the two countries will be based on 
principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, self 
determination, independence, territorial integrity, 
noninterference in the internal affairs of each country, as 
provided for in the UN Charter. 
  The document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also says 
that the two countries are convinced that establishing 
diplomatic relations between them corresponds to the interests 
of both states and will strengthen peace and international 
security. 
  The agreement formalizing this decision was signed by Pedro 
Comissario, Mozambican ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to the United Nations, and Ambassador Anicetas 
Simutis, Lithuania's permanent representative in the United 
Nations.

  [Text] Harare April 11 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's President Robert 
Mugabe has ordered an inquiry into circumstances surrounding 
controversial farm lease agreements made under the tenant 
resettlement scheme, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said 
in Harare on Monday [11 April]. Mr Dabengwa, who was responding 
to questions at a sub-regional seminar on human rights, said as 
far as he knew Mr Mugabe was "unaware of what was happening" and 
had ordered an inquiry into the leasing of land, ZIANA news 
agency reported. 
  So far 98 farms have been given to mostly senior government 
officials and civil servants under the scheme. 
  The inquiry comes at a time when the ruling ZANU (PF) 
[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] is reported as 
having called upon the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water 
Development to cancel the farm lease agreements and distribute 
the land under the resettlement scheme. 
  Party secretary Moven Mahachi was quoted as having told the 
party's official news organ, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that: "The 
position of the party is that the land belongs to the people and 
not to a few individuals"; and, "the Ministry of Lands should 
cancel all these leases and continue with the resettlement 
exercise. State farms should not be allocated to a few black 
elite. The party should make sure that position is maintained." 
  Mr Mahachi was quoted as saying while the party was not 
against individuals acquiring their own farms, he did not 
subscribe to the idea of a few black elite benefiting from land 
bought by the state at the expense of the majority.

  [Text] Gweru April 10 SAPA -- Voter registration for 
Zimbabwe's 1995 election got of to a slow start, a ZANU (PF) 
[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] provincial 
coordinating committee concluded on Sunday [10 April] after a 
two day meeting, ZIANA national news agency reports. Only 
113,115 voters were registered during the first two weeks of a 
national registration campaign. 
  ZANU (PF) Midlands Provincial Chairman Frederick Shava said 
the party had not yet told its members about the importance of 
taking part in the elections. "Registration kicked off on a 
very low note because people had not been mobilised fully and 
they were apprehensive," he said. 
  Mr Shava said he hoped voter registration would pick up when 
people at cell, ward, district and provincial levels were 
mobilised. 
  Mr Shava said the party was in full swing of consolidating 
itself and had sold 50,000 party membership cards in the 
Midlands region during the last three months. 
  All Central Committee members, parliamentarians, chiefs and 
local party officials would be involved in the regional 
mobilisation drive starting on April 19, Mr Shava said. "We are 
satisfied that the restructuring exercise of the party is going 
into the correct phase and we shall have finished the exercise 
before the main congress begins," he said. 
  The position of provincial women's league economic affairs 
secretary and legal affairs and human rights secretary still 
needed to be filled, he added.

  [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk has confirmed that his 
government is to be a party to the international mediation 
process between the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the ANC. 
  Addressing the media after meeting international mediators 
Henry Kissinger of the United States and Lord Carrington of 
Britain at his official residence in Pretoria last night, Mr. de 
Klerk said he was optimistic that another summit meeting of the 
key political players could take place by next week, but he said 
logistical problems virtually ruled out participation in the 
election by the Inkatha Freedom Party. Mr. de Klerk gave his 
approval for a document he had been given containing the terms 
of reference and time frames thrashed out by the working groups 
of the ANC, the IFP and the government. He said it was now up 
to the ANC, IFP and kwaZulu government to give their approval. 
  [Begin de Klerk recording] What now remains -- if I may 
focus 
on the mediation process -- is finalization of the terms of 
reference in the procedures. I have been given a document which 
I regard as a relatively good document which is the result of 
representatives from the three, four main parties having met 
during today. This document is now being put before the 
principals from all sides, and if agreement is reached, the 
mediation can start almost immediately. I would not rule out 
another summit. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Former U.S. Secretary 
of State Henry Kissinger and former British Foreign Secretary 
Lord Carrington would not mediate if the date of elections was 
included in the mediators' terms of reference, Mr Kissinger said 
on Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Speaking briefly outside a private Houghton home where the 
two mediators met African National Congress President Nelson 
Mandela, Mr Kissinger said the election date had not been 
included in the terms of reference the seven mediators received 
on Sunday. 
  The mediators are in South Africa to help mediate in the 
election impasse between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP]. Mediation is expected to begin on Wednesday (today). 
  Mr Kissinger said the election date, or what Mr Mandela 
called the "date of freedom for South Africa", was clearly not a 
subject of mediation. He said the mediators were prepared only 
to mediate on constitutional issues, the implementation of which 
would be left to South Africans. His statement is likely to 
cause concern in the IFP camp, which insists that the mediators 
also consider changing the election to a later date to allow the 
IFP a fair chance to campaign in the event the party decides to 
participate. 
  Mr Mandela said he welcomed the government taking part in 
mediation. An agreement could not be effective without the 
involvemement of the government. The amended terms of reference 
were reasonable, he said. 
  Mr Mandela also said the election date was not on the 
agenda for mediation. The ANC, IFP and government would meet at 
2 PM on Wednesday to come to a final agreement on the terms of 
reference, he said. 
  The draft was a good document and a basis from which to move 
on the question of mediation. "My own attitude is positive," Mr 
Mandela said. 
  Lord Carrington said the mediators had come to South Africa 
"to do what we can to help", but it would be up to South 
Africans to find their own solutions. "There has been a 
positive attitude on behalf of those we have seen," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- The international 
mediation process ground to an abrupt halt on Wednesday [13 
April] morning when kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
accused the government and the African National Congress of 
unilaterally changing the terms of reference. Mr Buthelezi 
accused the ANC and the government of colluding to keep the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] out of the election by not allowing 
the mediators to consider a change in the election dates. 
  An irate Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the ANC of 
reneging on the terms of reference agreed to between the ANC and 
the IFP at the weekend. The international mediators, including 
Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington were holed up in a 
Johannesburg hotel room for discussions while Mr Buthelezi and 
his team waited in the lobby. They were due to have departed to 
a secret location to begin the mediation intended to resolve 
outstanding constitutional issues. 
  Dr Kissinger, after a meeting with ANC President Nelson 
Mandela on Wednesday morning, said the mediators did not 
consider the election date to be part of the terms of reference. 
The initial terms of reference agreed to by a joint IFP/ANC 
working group on Sunday made no mention of the election dates. 
However, the IFP has consistently maintained that the 
resolution of constitutional differences that have so far kept 
it out of the elections would inevitably reopen the debate on 
the election dates. 
  At the Skukuza summit last Friday, it was agreed that the 
government would join the mediation process as a full 
participant. Following this, new terms of reference had been 
drafted that specifically entrench April 26-28 as the election 
dates. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he received the new draft on Tuesday night 
and that he objected to it. On Tuesday, ANC Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional Executive Council he 
wanted to make it clear that a postponement of the election was 
not up for negotiation. In a reference to the IFP, Mr Ramaphosa 
said there were parties who still hoped the elections could be 
postponed. He was later involved with Deputy Constitutional 
Development Minister Fanus Schoeman in drawing up the new terms 
of reference. 
  Mr Buthelezi said his negotiators would meet the ANC on 
Wednesday afternoon to try iron out their differences on the 
terms of reference. "The new draft (of the terms of reference) 
is not acceptable to us. The ANC and the government are trying 
to make sure there is no chance of discussing a new election 
date," he said. 
  He said the ANC and the government had brought the mediators 
to South Africa under false pretences.

<F P=106> [Report by Connien Molusi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Explicit exclusion 
of a change in the election date in the terms of reference for 
international mediation on Wednesday [13 April] grounded efforts 
by Dr Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington to mediate the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP] objection to the interim constitution. 
IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi objected to the new terms of 
reference, drafted with the government's participation on 
Tuesday, which explicitly state the election date is not an 
issue for mediation. [passage omitted] 
  Asked what would take the mediation process forward in the 
light of the IFP's objection, Mr Buthelezi said he was not 
intent on "putting new terms of reference as if I am demanding 
ultimatums". 
  "There is nothing I prescribe as Buthelezi." The IFP had 
already had to climb down on its original demands on mediation. 
  KwaZulu health minister and chief negotiator Dr Ben Ngubane 
said there were a lot of things they had objected to but had 
carried on with negotiations. 
  Mr Buthelezi said any further development in mediation would 
depend on the attitude of the mediators. He had had breakfast 
with former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Kissinger and former 
British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington on Wednesday morning 
and had bid them goodbye. He did not know and would not want to 
speculate on how his supporters would react to the hitches that 
threatened to scupper the mediation efforts, he said 
  In a statement issued later, Dr Kissinger and Lord 
Carrington said they had had "extremely useful" meetings with 
the leaders of the government, ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] subsequent to the opening reception of the international 
mediation forum. 
  They said senior negotiators for the three parties would be 
meeting in Pretoria from 12PM on Wednesday (today) to finalise 
terms of reference for the mediation. The seven mediators and 
their advisors held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss matters 
that arose from the meetings with the three leaders earlier in 
the day. The mediation would commence once agreement on the 
terms of reference had been reached by the parties, the 
statement said.

  [Text] The Afrikaner Freedom Front [AVF] has mixed feelings 
over the international mediators who have just arrived in South 
Africa. The AVF says the presence of British and American 
mediators, Lord David Carrington and Dr. Henry Kissinger, will 
put the Boer-Afrikaners and other whites in South Africa at an 
even greater disadvantage. 
  Similar interference in the old Rhodesia led to the forcing 
of former premier Ian Smith into a settlement, and the action 
held nothing good for the whites of Rhodesia. 
  The AVF trusts that the mediators are in South Africa to 
find 
a solution rather than force the Zulus into surrendering to the 
ANC and communism. According to the AVF, the mediators, with 
the aid of former prime minister John Vorster, forced Mr. Ian 
Smith to surrender. The Lancaster summit saw to it that the 
whites of Rhodesia received nothing, the AVF said. The AVF 
contends that the mediators' first task should be to see to it 
that the National Party-ANC alliance is convinced into 
postponing the election. Thereafter, they could play a more 
meaningful role in negotiations. 
  They should also see to it that the violence in 
kwaZulu/Natal 
comes to an end. The military presence and the state of 
emergency in the region create an intimidating climate. The AVF 
said a settlement in the self-determination of a free Zulu 
nation will not be found in this way.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Schnehage] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Apr 12 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] on Tuesday [12 April] welcomed international 
mediation to solve the constitutional deadlock involving the 
African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Zulu 
monarchy and the government. A PAC statement issued on Tuesday 
suggested mediators consider "dropping" clauses from the interim 
constitution which prejudiced certain parties "and leaving the 
entire matter of the constitutional future to the elected 
constituent assembly to resolve". 
  "This will level the playing field and should open the way 
for participation by all in the elections". 
  The PAC also suggested that all security forces should 
immediately be placed under joint control by the political 
parties, "including the IFP". "This will ensure all-round 
respect for law and order and increase the chances for an 
election which will be free, fair and without intimidation", the 
statement concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Juliette Saunders] </F>
  [Text] Port Elizabeth April 9 SAPA--The United Nations and 
the constitutional court will be asked to underwrite any 
agreement on the Zulu monarchy to hold the African National 
Congress to a firm guarantee, Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday 
[9 April] night. 
  The ANC's chief negotiator said proposals agreed to by the 
king, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], government and his party 
could also be placed before the multi-party negotiations 
council. Mr Ramaphosa said the measures were necessary because 
it was impossible to call for a new session of parliament in the 
coming weeks. 
  "We want to show this is not a gimmick, we are in earnest. 
Any agreement we reach we will take to the international 
community which is represented at the UN and we will ask them to 
acknowledge it, so that the IFP and the king can have the same 
certainty (as if parliament had endorsed the deal). This 
agreement or solemn pact can be forwarded to the constitutional 
court as another form of guarantee." 
  The multi-party forum could also be asked to reconvene to 
discuss the agreement to make the agreement as inclusive as 
possible, Mr Ramaphosa told 100-plus guests in an address to 
business people in Port Elizabeth. "The ANC is determined to 
walk the extra mile for an all-inclusive settlement." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi had 
again suggested a postponement of the election at Friday's 
leaders summit in the Kruger National Park. "We had to say no. 
That would plunge the country into an upheaval which is far 
greater than anything we have ever seen." 
  The ANC was disappointed that its proposals to accommodate 
the Zulu monarch's ceremonial powers were not accepted at the 
summit. "We had a feeling of disappointment in our hearts," Mr 
Ramaphosa said. 
  But during side meetings and private discussions, the Zulu 
monarch's delegation indicated they were pleased with several 
positive aspects in the ANC's proposals. And in fairness, he 
said, the ANC also recognised positive aspects in the 
suggestions by the king and Mr Buthelezi. 
  Earlier on Saturday Mr Ramaphosa said he was hopeful that a 
compromise settlement could be reached by Thursday to 
accommodate the position of King Zwelithini in a new 
dispensation.

Humphrey Ndlovu, says the party will take up arms if the 
election proceeds without it. He told the ZIANA [ZIMBABWE 
INTER-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY] news agency of Zimbabwe that the IFP 
had the capacity to survive a war with the South African Army, 
but he declined to elaborate on what resources were available to 
the IFP. 
  Mr. Ndlovu was commenting on the mediation process aimed at 
solving the constitutional impasse between his party and the 
ANC. Mr. Ndlovu said he was pessimistic about the negotiations, 
and warned of catastrophe if the election went ahead without the 
IFP.

elections in the territory in the face of kwaZulu government and 
Inkatha Freedom Party opposition to the poll. 
  TEC delegate and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo 
introduced a resolution which he said would remove the element 
of discretion from the kwaZulu authorities in deciding on what 
facilities it would make available for the elections. He said 
the kwaZulu government could not be allowed to exercise its 
discretion because it had not displayed goodwill towards the 
elections. 
  The exact nature of the additions to the regulations was 
left 
to the TEC's structures to decide. 
  Mr Slovo said the new regulations would empower the 
Independent Electoral Commission further. 
  TEC Chairman Dawie de Villiers said in a briefing after the 
TEC meeting that the purpose of the new regulations was to 
promote an atmosphere conducive to the elections. 
  The new regulations would be released on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 12 SAPA -- There are divergent views on 
whether free and fair elections can be held under the state of 
emergency in Natal/kwaZulu. On Tuesday [12 April], Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke told 
students at the University of Natal, Durban "it is still 
possible to have free and fair elections under the state of 
emergency which is directed at curbing violence". 
  But, in a recent memorandum to the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC], a host of community organisations called for a 
review of the emergency, claiming it had failed to control 
violence or bring stability to the region. After convening last 
week at a summit organised by the Institute for a Democratic 
Alternative for SA, the organisations said: "Far from 
stabilising the volatile situation in our province, feedback 
from communities indicates the state of emergency has served to 
heighten resistance to the election and political polarisation." 
  They asked the TEC to review the purpose of the emergency to 
ensure it was not geared to creating conditions in which the 
people of kwaZulu/Natal could go to voting stations, but could 
not go to their homes. 
  "There is no way this forthcoming election can be free, 
fair, 
safe or in any way a celebration of the advent of democracy, if 
people can only go to the polls under armed guard." 
  The memo added that the SA Defence Force's role had to be 
defined more clearly. 
  In his address on Tuesday, Mr Moseneke said he had just 
returned from a security meeting where he had been told the 
number of deaths in Natal in the past 48 hours had decreased in 
comparison to the previous two-day period. The lower the levels 
of violence, the easier it would be for people to choose to 
vote, he said, adding that a national security plan was in place 
to ensure voters could go to the polls safely in just over two 
weeks. 
  Although there would be "difficulties" in Natal, "we should 
be able to secure each (polling) station". 
  "The IEC will run elections in Natal as near perfect as it 
could be in any other part of the country," he said. 
  Mr Moseneke said South Africans should not allow fear to 
stand in their way of voting, adding that people convinced they 
should vote could encourage others to do so.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] says it 
may still be possible to reprint the ballot papers for 
kwaZulu-Natal. However, South African printers may not have 
sufficient time for this, and IEC spokesman said the 
organization is going ahead with the planning of elections in 
kwaZulu-Natal because the IEC could not presume that election 
day would be impossible. 
  But in the kwaZulu capital of Ulundi finance minister D. 
Madide said it was too late to enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] to take part in the poll. He said if the mediators 
accepted Inkatha's arguments and ruled that the interim 
constitution was not advisable, the new government should call a 
second election within weeks or months. He said failing 
international mediation, a guerrilla war- like specter, as was 
the case in the Middle east, would loom in the country.

  [Text] The chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission], Mr. Justice Kriegler, says the commission will be 
ready on the 26th this month to take special votes. It will 
also be ready to receive thousands of voters at the 
approximately 9,000 voting stations on the following two days. 
Mr. Justice Kriegler said the location of at least 99 percent 
of the voting stations had already been determined. Mr. 
Kriegler said two plane loads of ballot papers had arrived in 
South Africa from London yesterday and have been taken to places 
of safe-keeping. He called on people, particularly in isolated 
places, to make themselves available to act as monitors at 
voting stations.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] SA's [South Africa] election results will be known 
48 hours after the polls close, with the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] releasing an hourly tally from Friday morning, 
April 29, as it counts the votes. Expressing confidence that 
"the greatest show on earth" will take place on time in all 
regions, IEC officials yesterday detailed its arrangements for 
the election. 
  The commission has decided to increase the number of voting 
stations to substantially more than the 9,000 originally 
planned, opting for more mobile stations. The increase was 
considered necessary primarily because of the poor state of some 
roads. Ballot boxes will be taken from voting stations to 
about 1,000 counting stations countrywide. Each station will be 
responsible for counting more than 30,000 votes. 
  Counting will begin at 6AM on April 29 and will continue 
through the night until it is completed. Officials expect the 
counting to take between 26 and 36 hours. Provisional results 
will be released hourly from each of the voting stations and 
will be transmitted to the IEC's Midrand base, where they will 
be released immediately. Between two and 10 days after the 
election, the commission will make a declaration about whether 
ti was free and fair, giving parties the opportunity to lodge 
complaints. 
  Officials believe it will be impossible to have voting 
stations in three large areas of Natal, but stations will be 
placed close to these areas' borders. Transkei is also 
understood to be creating headaches for the IEC, but officials 
are confident these difficulties will be resolved. Despite the 
difficulties setting up an organisation employing more people 
than Anglo American, officials say planning is falling into 
place and elections could take place in three regions tomorrow. 
  Meanwhile, the IEC has undertaken to reconsider the number 
of 
voting stations in Sandton, after it was pointed out that the 
provisional list showed only two voting stations had been 
planned.

  [Text] Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials 
estimate that the list of party candidates published in the 
Government Gazette a fortnight ago could drop by up to one-third. 
  IEC spokesman Niki Moore said yesterday although political 
parties had handed in their final party lists last month, a 
large number of candidates had decided not to stand. It is 
understood that others dropped off the list after irregularities 
were discovered when details provided by the political parties 
were checked against state records. 
  Following the closing date for the submission of candidates' 
lists, the IEC had barred political parties from adding names to 
their lists, she said. But the commission could not prevent 
parties from withdrawing names from their lists if candidates 
decided they did not intend standing. 
  A total of 12,610 candidates had been put forward by 
political parties and their names were published in the March 31 
Government Gazette. It is understood that few changes will be 
made to the major parties' lists. Some smaller parties 
submitted long lists, which included candidates whose chances of 
being elected are slight. This has raised speculation that some 
parties put forward candidates simply to ensure they had enough 
canvassers.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by ANC Elections Press Center on the SAPA </F>
PR Wire Service; place and date not given: "The Path to Peace 
Without Fear"] 
  [Text] Our country and people are now reaping the violence 
that the National Party [NP] government has sown. 
  We South Africans are reaping an unwelcome harvest of 
violence, and of fear. Its seeds were sown by those who dreamed 
up the notion of apartheid; and when the crop turned out to be 
ever rising resistance from the people, they set out to suppress 
it using force and violence. A decade of suppression was a total 
failure. 
  But it created a new South African culture, in which the 
state wielded arbitrary armed power without constraint of law, 
and in which all opposition and resistance was suppressed with 
violence. The National Party's state spread the new culture in 
the streets: disputes over power are to be settled by force, and 
opponents are to be eliminated by violence. It enshrined the new 
culture in the statute book, with a maze of laws which suppress 
the right to speak or organise or meet or publish, and which 
permit the security forces to banish, imprison, torture or 
assassinate with impunity. 
  Apartheid culture legitimated violence for political ends. 
And now we live with the fall-out in the AWB [Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], the third 
force, and Inkatha. Today, violence is the chosen way of 
politics for all those who seek to preserve their own power by 
preventing the holding of free and fair elections. Their methods 
are political murder and house-burning, terror by assault, and 
by uncontrolled armed impi's. Their threats to the security of 
all the people have not just grown up naturally. They have been 
deliberately incited in an attempt to win through violence and 
fear what they know they will never through the ballot box. 
  This culture of terrorism on one side and fear on the other 
is the culture we inherit from the era of apartheid. It cannot 
be wiped out by a simple announcement that we have now a "new" 
NP. Nor will it be instantly wiped out even by the election of 
the new ANC led government. But the election of a new government 
untainted by the apartheid culture of the past, would be a start. 
  We need that start if we are to build a country at peace and 
a people freed from fear. 
  The ANC does not have to claim that it is "new", and 
therefore disconnected from its own past. We have pride in our 
past. We were the party of resistance and of opposition 
throughout the apartheid era. Our members were the men and women 
who suffered most directly from the oppressive terror in the era 
of apartheid violence. We do not want to paint our organization 
as apartheid and suppression, old in the fight against the 
culture of violence. 
  We have stood firm against the worst terror the apartheid 
state could bring against us. We have come through with our 
ideals intact. Our history is a matter of pride, not to be 
brushed under the carpet. Throughout the years when the culture 
of violence was being created, ours was the organization that 
struggled for the way forward, even though all the force and 
violence of the apartheid state was mustered to turn the country 
back. We pioneered the ideal of a non-racial country. We built 
our party on the unity of white, brown and black members. We 
pioneered the ideal of votes for all, and an all-inclusive 
democracy, while the NP clung to its racist ideas. Our past 
gives the credentials for the carrying out of our promises for 
the future. 
  April 27th can mark the beginning of the end of the culture 
of violence. A massive vote of confidence in the policies of the 
ANC is the starting point for weeding out the culture of 
violence and terror. It will make it possible once and for all, 
after all De Klerk's indecisions and inaction, to strip the 
protective cover the third force and the inciters of violence, 
and from the terrorist campaigns of Inkatha and the AWB. 
  Voting ANC on April 27th means a start to the weeding out of 
fear and violence from our country. We will not repeat the 
failures of the past decade. We will not place reliance on all 
those failed "safety measures" of reliance on more armed guards, 
more police immunity, more fire-power; on "security" behind the 
high walls and razor wire, the guard-dogs and the "armed 
response" teams. 
  The internal stability units and armed police have failed to 
make us safer. But they have made the violent men more ruthless, 
more violent, more desperate, and the security force men more 
reliant on violence alone to counter violence. It is time for a 
new way. 
The ANC proposes 
  To create a new defence force, whose watchwords will be 
`defence of the people', not suppression of opposition. 
  To reorganise the police force by eliminating "political 
policing" as exemplified by the third force and the ISU's 
[Internal Stability Unit], and by encouraging policing for the 
community and in full consultation with local communities. 
  Instituting a new regime of gun control, to end gun 
smuggling 
and minimise the number of firearms held in individual hands. 
  This not an instant cure for the violence which has become 
deeply embedded in our culture, and which has created the 
climate of fear everywhere in the country. But it is the only 
way forward. Curbing the men of violence, empowering the 
community to defend itself, spreading democratic control into 
every aspect of public life is the only ground in which a new 
culture of peace and security can be securely planted in the 
country. 
  This is not a "quick fix." It is a pledge of immediate 
action 
and of long-term reconstruction from the ANC in government. 
  Many of those who vote on April 27th may well be fearful in 
today's South Africa. They should vote to live freed from fear 
in the South Africa of the future.

Congress has committed itself to redistribute land starting 
immediately after the election, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] Commander Mr Joe Modise said, 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reports. During a rally in the Northern Transvaal township near 
Messina, Mr Modise said 87 per cent of South Africa's land had 
been taken away by whites, adding "we want it back." Mr Modise 
promised that the ANC would begin by re-allocating vast tracts 
of land already owned by the South African Government. But he 
said he could not get into the details of how the ANC land 
redistribution plan would work.

  [Text] Bloemfontein April 12 SAPA -- Farmers using their 
land productively should not feel threatened by a future African 
National Congress government in the Orange Free State [OFS], a 
senior ANC official said on Tuesday [12 April]. ANC southern OFS 
chairman Solomon Nthatisi said farmers operating productively 
had a right to continue to do so and anyone wanting to buy land 
would have to show they could put it to good use. 
  However, a future regional government would abide by the 
rulings of a constitutional land claims court and all land 
matters would be dealt with within a strict legal framework. 
Land not currently being utilised, like the vast tracts of rich 
property owned by the state and military, would be provided to 
those who could put it to good use. 
  Mr Nthatisi, who is third on the ANC's regional electoral 
list, said he was currently visiting farmers to reassure them 
their land would not be appropriated by a future government.

  [Text] Cape Town April 9 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress must now say whether Mrs Winnie Mandela will still be 
on its list of candidates because people wanted to know for whom 
they were voting on April 27, Law and Order Minister Hernus 
Kriel said on Saturday [9 April]. 
  Mr Kriel, who is NP [National Party] premier candidate for 
the Western Cape, was referring to an article published in a 
Cape Town newspaper about an ANC commission of inquiry into 
money collected by Mrs Mandela for the social welfare 
department, which has gone astray. "This is the kind of person 
the ANC is asking you to vote for. I want to make an offer to 
the ANC. They should approach the South African Police and they 
will find out who took the money. Any organisation that finds 
funds have gone missing goes straight to the police, they don't 
hold commissions and then say it is a pity details have been 
published. People want to know the truth so they know for whom 
they will be voting on April 27. If money goes missing from the 
organisation even before they are in power, what is going to 
happen if they come to power? The ANC cannot even govern a 
township properly and yet it wants to govern the country."

    [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 
on 10 April on page 18 carries a full-page campaign ad for the 
Democratic Party, DP. The upper two-thirds of the ad contains a 
picture of six DP representatives to the Kempton Park 
negotiations, in business attire, standing in a circle, and 
looking upward. The picture was taken from directly above them. 
The caption of the picture reads: "AT NEGOTIATIONS, THESE 6 
DEMOCRATS WON MORE ISSUES THAN 40 NATS. IMAGINE WHAT 12 WILL 
DO, OR 24, OR 48..." 
  The text below the picture reads: 
  "You're probably surprised. After all, it was the NP 
[National Party] who protected you at negotiations, right? 
Wrong. 
  "F.W. de Klerk and his "new" Nats were so busy looking after 
their own interests, it was left to the DP to look after yours. 
  "In fact, while we were greatly outnumbered, we won 5 times 
more issues than the Nats, and even more than the ANC. (As 
identified in a leading Johannesburg newspaper, 23 November 
1993.) 
  "We stopped the new government from being able to just take 
your home away, or being able to declare a State of Emergency 
whenever they want to. 
  "We made it possible to take the new government to court. 
And whatever the other parties may say about Women's Rights 
policies, it was left to the DP to safely enshrine women's 
rights in the new constitution. 
  "The reasons we had this effect are simple. Our candidates 
understand how to negotiate. And, unlike De Klerk's "new" Nats, 
we believe in what we stand for. That's why we fight harder. 
  "So give your vote to the Democratic Party. 
  "(Remember each 1 percent of the vote will put another 4 DP 
members in Parliament). 
  "By giving us your support, you can have a lot more 
  "DP members representing you. 
  "And just imagine what we will do then." 
  The ad ends with a reproduction of the DP logo, the motto 
"DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER." and 
the enjoinder to "Join the growing number of people moving 
across to the DP. Write to Box 1475 Cape Town 8000 for more 
information."

  [Text] The Freedom Front is to involve international 
observers in all agreements that are entered into before the 
election. Party leader Gen. Constand Viljoen said in Bethlehem 
last night that international involvement was a safeguard that 
would be used to put pressure on a future government to respect 
agreements. Peter Theron filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Theron] The meeting in Bethlehem was the 
beginning of the Freedom Front election campaign in the [Orange] 
Free State. Gen. Viljoen told the large crowd of people in the 
town hall he believed the election should be postponed to ensure 
kwaZulu's participation, and allowed time for unity among the 
right wing. He remained confident that substantial support for 
a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] would be obtained in the 
election. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] I think we will get enough people, 
enough numbers through provincial votes to prove that there is 
sufficient support [for a volkstaat]. [end recording]

  [Text] At least six regional leaders of the Wit Wolwe 
[White Wolves] will apparently support the Freedom Front of 
General Constand Viljoen in the election. Earlier this week 
their leader, Barend Strydom, also indicated his support for the 
Freedom Front. A man claiming to be the leader of the Wit Wolwe 
in the southern [Orange] Free State, Mr. Eddie Visagie, told our 
Bloemfontein staff that he and the Wit Wolwe leaders in the 
northern [Orange] Free State, Eastern and Northern Cape, 
Kalahari, and the Transvaal have all decided to support the 
Freedom Front in the coming election. The Freedom Front said 
earlier that the party welcomed any support; however, it would 
not consider Mr. Strydom as a candidate because of his past.

  [Text] Freedom Front [FF] leader, Constand Viljoen, says he 
is concerned that elements in the country's intelligence service 
are involved in discrediting his party. General Viljoen told a 
public meeting in Pietermaritzburg that he suspected that six 
Wit Wolwe [White Wolves] who had applied to join the Front had 
been planted. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Pieter Theron] The meeting was 
part of the Freedom Front's election campaign in Natal. It was 
attended by a number of English-speaking supporters. Gen. 
Viljoen said organizations were established in many countries to 
discredit political parties. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] I am worried that our intelligence 
services are involved with these organizations, and that they 
are using the Wit Wolwe application as a tactic to discredit the 
Freedom Front. 
  [Theron] In an interview after the meeting, Gen. Viljoen 
said 
he still believed the Zulu nation should follow the same option 
as the Afrikaner, and negotiate for self-determination. [end

  [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- A campaign to recruit 
civil servants for the rightwing "Volksrepublic" [Afrikaner 
people's republic] started on Tuesday [12 April], the 
Volksrepublic's Transitional President Ferdi Hartzenberg 
announced in Pretoria. He said each public servant would 
receive a document enabling them to join the Volksrepublic's 
civil service when it came into being shortly. 
  "Needless to say, such officials (who respond) will enjoy 
preference when it comes to appointments in our civil service," 
Dr Hartzenberg said. It would be assumed public servants who 
did not indicate they wanted to join the Volksrepublic's civil 
service wanted to work for the so-called new South Africa, if 
there were jobs left for them after affirmative action, Dr 
Hartzenberg said. 
  Referring to public servants strikes elsewhere in the 
country, especially in the homelands, he said no-one could blame 
central government civil servants if they also demanded their 
pensions now in order to get back some of their contributions. 
  Referring to the solvency of the central government pension 
fund, he noted it was being further taxed by "MK (Umkhonto we 
Sizwe) [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members who were 
terrorists in the bush who are also suddenly becoming 
pensioners".

  [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Tuesday [12 April] appealed to all civil 
servants not to go on strike in the run-up to the April 
election. The TEC, which has formed a task force to examine the 
grievances of civil servants who are striking in several of the 
homelands and self-governing territories, appealed for a virtual 
moratorium on strike action and said the TEC would hold 
discussions with the trade union federations to urge them to 
refrain from strike action "in the national interests". 
  The TEC noted the importance of civil servants in the 
electoral period, in particular security forces. It noted too 
that concerns had been expressed about job security, pension 
payouts and the rationalisation process. 
  The TEC said a successful election would lead to a stable 
country that could attend to civil servants' grievances. 
  The TEC wanted civil servants to accept its assurances that 
their jobs would be secure after the election.

<F P=106> [By Erna van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The government and the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] had a two-week "final 
deadline" to get police salaries on par with that of the 
National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] or face a boycott of election 
duties, the South African Police Union [SAPU] warned on Tuesday 
[12 April]. 
  Describing the mood at grassroot level as "angry and 
frightening" SAPU National Secretary Pieter-Don Brandt told a 
news conference in Pretoria that the TEC's assurance on Tuesday 
that police members' election period allowances would be trebled 
to be on par with that of the NPKF had averted a SAPU strike 
which would have begun on Wednesday. However, widespread 
dissatisfaction remained about salaries. 
  SAPU grassroot members were bent on striking from Wednesday 
but SAPU would not back any wildcat action, he said. Such 
members faced expulsion from the union. 
  There were however still other "selective pressure 
mechanisms" which would be backed and organised by SAPU during 
the election period should the salary issue not be addressed. 
While strikes were for the moment ruled out there was a plan on 
the table for plackard demonstrations and mass meetings. 
  Other options included American-style "blue flu", where 
people book off sick en mass. National organiser Bereng Kholoane 
said: "The salary discrepancies between the police and the NPKF 
is a slap in our members' faces. "After they (NPKF) had gone on 
a strike they got better salaries. (SAPU) union members' lives 
are in danger on a daily basis, they get killed on duty and they 
don't get half the salaries of the NPKF members." 
  Although memoranda had been submitted to the government and 
the TEC on grievances, the only official response was a 
statement by Law and Order Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze that 
the morale in the police force was not low, Mr Brand said. 
  An issue that would be taken up with the TEC was information 
that police officials that had been striking in self-governing 
territories, notably in kwaNdebele, had been given promotion. 
"This precedent is sending the wrong signal to the force as a 
whole. It seems that strike actions gets you something," said Mr 
Brand. 
  This was especially disturbing as these self-governing 
police 
forces would soon be integrated into one police force, he added.

  [Text] The South African Police Union [SAPU] has called off 
a strike planned for tomorrow, but there are renewed threats of 
disruptions during the election by SAPU, pending the outcome of 
salary negotiations. Anne-Marie Coetzee reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Coetzee] The strike was averted following 
a decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to grant 
policemen on active duty daily allowances of 61 rands 50 cents, 
the same as received by members of the National Peacekeeping 
Force. The question of disparity between the basic salaries of 
the two forces has not been solved as yet. The police union 
says if the TEC does not react positively to their salary 
demands within 2 weeks, they will consider action. 
  [SAPU spokesman Pieter-Don Brandt] One of the disruptive 
actions that are coming from grassroots is to say that we are 
not going to guard election posts. We will keep on addressing 
crime problems in the community, but certain actions around the 
elections, around the election stations, we will disrupt. 
  [Coetzee] In its reaction to the threat the police pointed 
out that SAPU, with its official membership of 7,000, 
constitutes less than 10 percent of the police force. Police 
say any member of the force taking part in a strike can be 
dismissed on the spot. [end recording]

  [Text] India has made contingency plans to airlift its 
nationals from South Africa if the need arose. The step comes 
amid the uncertain political situation in South Africa and the 
recent violence in the black homeland in Bophuthatswana, where 
the houses of three Indian nationals were razed to the ground. 
Indian consular spokesman Thettalil Seetharam appealed to 
Indian nationals residing in South Africa to register with the 
newly-established consulate. Mr. Seetharam said appropriate 
steps would be taken if South African Indians were affected by 
the violence.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- The Consulate General 
of India has dismissed reports that it had contigency plans to 
airlift Indian nationals from South Africa should political 
instability persist. In a statement on Tuesday [11 April] the 
consulate general said there were set procedures which it would 
follow should any evacuation become necessary. 
  The consulate urged India passports holders to register with 
the consulate in Johannesburg to update records. 
  "In the case of South African citizens, they are entirely 
the 
responsibility of the South African Government." 
  The Indian Government would view with concern any 
development 
affecting the SA Indian community adversely because of 
historical and cultural links between people of India and the 
South African Indian community, the statement added. 
  "India has consistently and strongly supported the just 
struggle against apartheid in South Africa and looks forward to 
the coming elections as a positive development in the transition 
to a fully democratic system."

  [Text] Durban April 13 SAPA -- Seven people were massacred 
in battle-scarred Ndwedwe township north of Durban on Tuesday 
[13 April], the Natal security committee said. About 11 people 
were travelling in a minibus and distributing pamphlets in the 
area, when they were stopped by a crowd of people. 
  Two men escaped and alerted the authorities. A subsequent 
police search found seven hacked and burned bodies in the 
Thafamazi area of Ndwedwe. Their vehicle was also set ablaze. 
  By late Tuesday, however, police detained six people under 
emergency regulations. Ndwedwe has been dogged by intense 
political fighting over the past ten years. 
  [Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English at 0500 GMT on 13 
April say the seven people were killed "while handing out 
pamphlets of the Transitional Executive Council in Ndwedwe north 
of Durban." "According to eyewitnesses, the seven who were 
killed were kidnapped by a group of men at a school yesterday. 
They were interrogated by their kidnappers and dragged into a 
bush where they were shot and hacked to death. The police said 
the attackers had perhaps mistakenly connected the group to a 
political party. Four arrests have been made."]

  [Text] A joint administrator of the Ciskei, the Reverend 
Bongani Finca, says the interim council is investigating claims 
that hit squads and heavily armed auxiliary forces are operating 
in the territory. Mr. Finca said, at a special session of the 
council at Bisho, that his administration had put an immediate 
hold on all sales of state land in Ciskei. It was also 
investigating massive land deals over the past few months. The 
investigation would not exclude land sold to the former head of 
state Oupa Gqozo. Mr. Finca said the administration did not 
intend conducting a witch hunt, but all allegations of 
corruption would be thoroughly investigated.

  [Text] Bisho April 8 SAPA -- Ciskei's interim 
administration has begun reclaiming weapons issued to the 
so-called "auxiliary force" in the territory. Speaking in Bisho 
on Friday [9 April], joint administrator the Rev Bongani Finca 
said the search was still on for 103 firearms issued to youths 
in the force. "It's these boys who were taken from the 
villages, trained for two weeks to shoot and kill, and given 
weapons and deployed in the villages." The administration did 
not know who commanded them, but it was aware that they had been 
issued with state ammunition. 
  Mr Finca appealed to community structures to help the 
administration reclaim and account for all the missing weapons. 
The reclamation had to be accompanied by a call on the 
community to ensure there were no attacks or reprisals on 
headmen or political parties. 
  It is understood that one of the aims of the formation of 
the 
auxiliary force was to protect headmen who supported the Gqozo 
government. 
  Mr Finca said all political parties had to be given a chance 
to campaign for the elections and hold meetings.

  [Text] The ANC has released the final document of its 
39-billion-rand Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP]. 
The organization brushed aside criticism that the program is 
too ambitious and said problems of financing would be overcome 
within the current national budget. Jennifer Wilson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Wilson] A cut in the defense budget is 
one 
way the ANC is proposing to raise the 39 billion rands it says 
the implementation of the RDP would cost over the first 5 years. 
  [ANC economic affairs spokesman Trevor Manuel] In the 
current budget defense gets some 10.7 billion, against 1.6 
billion for housing. The defense secret account alone is 
two-and-a-half times larger than the housing budget, at some 
3.83 billion rands. That's a contradiction that we can't 
sustain in our country. If one looks at the combination of the 
secret account for the current budget and the previous budget, 
it adds up to more than 8 billion rands. That's about the figure 
that we're looking for annually for the RDP. 
  [Wilson] Mr. Manuel said he did not foresee having to raise 
tax levels, but would allocate more revenue to collecting taxes. 
The ANC says the document has not changed significantly since 
it was first published. It still promises to provide 1 million 
houses, electrify 2.5 million houses, and provide 2.5 million 
jobs over 5 years. [end recording]

  [Text] A waning of the panic which set in on local currency 
markets yesterday saw the financial rand [finrand] recouping 
part of its heavy losses to close at 5 rands 34 cents to the 
dollar this afternoon. This is a 25-cent improvement on 
yesterday's close. It is reported that one huge finrand sell 
order triggered yesterday morning's selling spree. The 
commercial rand hit yet another new low today, closing at just 
over 3 rands 60 cents to the dollar. The depreciation of the 
rand is in line with a sharp rise in the dollar against the 
German Mark since yesterday.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Fall of Financial Rand -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 
13 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that the "free fall" of 
the financial rand (finrand) on 11 April is "simply a direct 
message of a massive collapse in overseas confidence." However, 
the "finrand's weakening will not affect the economy materially 
in the short term. This market is relatively thin, restricted to 
non-residents, and subject to wide fluctuation. But the fall 
has wider implications: continuing fears about our future could 
kill hopes of massive investment in this country and, without 
this, the hope of massive reconstruction will also die." Only 
the country's leaders have a chance to "pull us back from the 
abyss." 
  `Folly' To Send Peacekeeping Force to East Rand Townships -- 
A second editorial on the same page believes it was "misguided" 
to deploy units of the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in the 
troubled East Rand townships. The record of the NPKF "hardly 
inspires confidence." THE STAR refers to "desertions, 
undisciplined behaviour, fractiousness and racist outburts," and 
"to cap it all: only days before its first graduates were sent 
into the field, its chief of staff was summarily dismissed after 
being charged with drunken driving in an official vehicle." To 
send the NPKF to the East Rand townships seems "the height of 
folly, particularly as the force is seen by pro-IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] hostel residents as the ANC's armed wing in a new 
guise." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  SANCO `Conscience' To Prod New Government Welcome -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 April in a page-12 
editorial states that groups such as the South African National 
Civic Organization (SANCO) "have a useful role in a future South 
Africa." "True, SANCO, or at least many of its most prominent 
leaders like Moses Mayekiso and his advisers, are 
unrehabilitated Marxists wh? have made few allowances to the way 
the world has changed over the past 10 years, and their 
perspectives are, for that reason, often rather flawed." But, 
"whatever SANCO's shortcomings, it will do no harm to have a 
left-wing `conscience' prodding those in the new government who 
may be prone to adopt the fat cat attitudes of their 
predecessors." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Paper `Pessimistic' About International Mediation Outcome -- 
"It is naive to believe the mediation team will be able to solve 
the immediate and practical problems related to the elections 
later this month," declares a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 13 April. "The violence in places like 
Natal has gained a momentum of its own and will feed on itself 
for some time to come. The IFP's proposal for a postponement of 
the poll is also a non- starter with the ANC adamant April 27 
`is sacrosanct'. We will have to resign ourselves to the fact 
that a free and fair election in kwaZulu is not going to be 
possible and that the birth of a democratic South Africa will be 
marked by bloodshed. The mediation team will be well advised to 
focus primarily on the outstanding constitutional issues like 
the powers of regions." Amicable mediation and agreements on 
these issues "could defuse some of the tensions in the country 
and help the proposed Government of National Unity to find its 
feet. While we are pessimistic about the outcome, we urge all 
the parties involved to give the mediation process their best 
shot."

  [Text] In Cameroon, the government has given a 
clarification: civil servants' jobs will indeed be cut, but it 
will not be anything like the 23,000 layoffs announced by the 
press agencies and RFI. The whole operation will be carried out 
over four years and will be accompanied by a social plan 
described to us by the Civil Service Minister Sali Dairou. He 
is speaking to Chantal Lorho: 
  [Begin Dairou recording] We are in the process of thinking 
about reducing staff numbers, but by this we do not mean layoffs 
in the pejorative sense of the word, as the man in the street 
understands it. Cameroon in fact plans to reduce staff numbers 
progressively by encouraging voluntary early retirement and by 
creating a reintegration fund to finance the plans of certain 
civil servants and state employees who would like to retrain to 
work in the private sector. If these plans are considered 
viable and feasible, it is possible that they will be financed 
by those funds. Moreover, since 1987 we have kept recruitment 
frozen, which means that those who leave at normal retirement 
age and those who retire after 30 years service form a means of 
reducing the numbers of staff in the civil service without this 
being a constraint -- as a certain sensationalist section of the 
press wishes to believe, saying that we are laying off 20,000 
civil servants. The Cameroonian Government has never intended 
to lay off 20,000 civil servants. No agreement has been reached 
with the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to that 
effect. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Roch Marc Christian Kabore today 
gave an answer to labor unions' counterproposals. The 
government said that it was unable to meet the demands made by 
the unions. Here with the details is Newton Ahmed Barry: 
  [Barry] The demands made by the labor unions in response to 
the 5 April government responses are threefold: 
  The first group, including 13 labor unions, reduced their 
demands. Regarding salary increases, Group-13 is proposing a 15 
percent increase instead of the previously demanded 40-50 
percent. Regarding the price of rice and fuel, this group is 
asking for a 10-percent reduction. Group-13 supports the 
exemption of the value added tax on water and electricity 
consumption -- up to 50 cubic meters for water and 150 kw for 
electricity -- as proposed by the government, but expressed 
concern with the increase in the price of a cubic meter of 
water. Therefore, the group still demands that FASOYA 
[expansion unknown] be reactivated and that the crisis facing 
small-scale businessmen be solved. Group-6, which is led by the 
TGCB [expansion unknown] maintains its demands in their entirety 
-- a 50 percent increase in salaries, the reestablishment of 
pre-CFA devaluation prices for rice, fuel, gas, and drugs. 
  The only labor union that did not answer the government's 
call for counterproposals was the CSP [expansion unknown]. The 
prime minister stated that he was safisfied with the labor 
unions quick answer to the proposals, but regretted that because 
of budgetary constraints, the government was unable to meet any 
of the demands. The dialogue has not been disrupted, other 
avenues are still open, and the government will hold 
consultations with social partners over the coming days.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] will continue to seek every possible path that 
can lead our country to freedom. Within that context, the UNITA 
team to the Lusaka peace talks yesterday went to the hotel where 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, team is staying to discuss work-related issues. 
  No details have been made available concerning the meeting, 
but diplomatic sources have described it as cordial and very 
encouraging. That meeting of yesterday appears to have 
surprised many and it took place without the presence of either 
the mediators or the observers. 
  The Lusaka peace talks will continue until UNITA and the 
MPLA-PT have reached an agreement. In Luanda yesterday, UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye said no deadline had 
been set for the talks. Asked to comment on whether four months 
of negotiation was not excessive, Blondin Beye replied that in 
view of the fact that the conflict had been going on for 18 
years, four months should not be seen as a sign of despair. 
  Through Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, its spokesman in the 
Zambian capital, UNITA has made it known that it will not leave 
Lusaka without a peace accord. 
  Meanwhile, UN sources have disclosed that the UN special 
representative in Angola could travel to the city of Huambo this 
week to hold talks with the UNITA leadership. Attentive 
observers believe that Blondin Beye must have received new 
guidelines concerning methods to deal with the marathon Lusaka 
peace talks. 
  An adviser to the UN special representative in Angola said 
in 
Lusaka yesterday that there was no danger of the talks 
collapsing.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- International 
mediators began arriving in Johannesburg on Tuesday [12 April] 
to help resolve the constitutional deadlock between the African 
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], amid 
reports that the government would also become a party to the 
mediation process. 
  Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington was the 
first of the seven foreign mediators to arrive on Tuesday, but 
declined to comment on prospects for the mediation. He said he 
and ex-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger felt honoured to 
have been invited to mediate. 
  The other mediators invited are Mr Justice H K Bhagwati of 
India, Mr Justice A Leon Higginbotham of the United States of 
America, Prof Paul Kevenhorster of Germany, Mr Justice Antonio 
la Pergola of Italy and Prof Jean Antonie Laponce of Canada. 
  The terms of reference for the mediation process will be 
determined once they have all arrived. 
  Meanwhile, the government who until now has been lukewarm 
about the mediation process, fearing it could reopen a range of 
already-settled constitutional issues, will join the mediation 
process. 
  ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told Transitional 
Executive Council members on Tuesday although it was originally 
intended only to involve the ANC and the IFP, negotiators at 
Friday's leader's summit at Skukuza in the Kruger National Park 
had decided the government should become a party to the 
mediation. 
  He however warned against IFP expectations that the 
elections 
might be postponed. "The IFP seems to be getting into the 
mediation process in the hope that the process will result in 
the date of elections being postponed. 
  "The election date is sacrosanct, not even the mediation 
process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa added. 
  ANC President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday said he was 
confident 
the mediation could resolve the deadlock over the IFP's 
participation in the election as well as the role of Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini under a new constitution. 
  Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Mandela said the mediation 
process was an "important development" which raised the 
possibility of solving the problem "of some of those who are 
outside the process". "They (the mediators) have a very 
difficult job indeed" after the "lack of success in the meeting 
last Friday". 
  Mr Mandela said he would make "special recommendations" to 
the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be 
successful". 
  Should mediation fail, talks would continue with the parties 
involved. "Dialogue is our important weapon," he told reporters. 
  Meanwhile, Constitutional Development Deputy Minister Fanus 
Schoeman said on Tuesday the mediation should revolve around 
guaranteeing a free election as there was no time to renegotiate 
the interim constitution. 
  He said the government had doubts about the draft mediation 
guidelines to resolve the deadlock. According to the guidelines, 
the interim constitution would have to be virtually 
renegotiated, according to Mr Schoeman. But there was little 
time for this. 
  He said that specific parts of the guidelines should rather 
be used to bring the IFP into the constitutional process by 
obtaining the party's permission for a free election in kwaZulu. 
  The IFP could still get involved in constitutional 
negotiations after the elections, he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- Politicians, VIPs and 
journalists met at a central Johannesburg hotel on Tuesday [12 
April] night to welcome seven international mediators who will 
attempt to resolve constitutional differences between the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African National Congress 
and stem violence in Natal/kwaZulu. 
  Mediation spokesman former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Henry 
Kissinger told the conference, which was attended by IFP leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC Natal Premier Jacob Zuma, the 
country was worth the trouble. 
  "This is a country that's suffered like few others; been 
divided like few others...it's worth the dedication and effort." 
  Mr Kissinger said that if anybody had told him when at the 
time of Zimbabwe's independence he would be in South Africa 18 
years later, "with apartheid a memory," he would have thought 
the person crazy. 
  He said he had met both ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Mr 
Buthelezi in previous years. Mr Mandela was "one of the great 
figures of the epoch...and I remember how passionately Mr 
Buthelezi criticised the government and the institutions of that 
time". 
  With a nod also at Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha who 
attended the conference on behalf of the government, Mr 
Kissinger praised the "truly heroic effort by the chief actors 
to overcome their memories, their suffering and doubts". 
  Mr Buthelezi said in his address his party was entering the 
mediation process with expectation but also with trepidation. 
The country was divided by a deep wound which had to be healed 
before elections. 
  "The spirit of a miracle must emerge," he said.

  [Text] Both African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] leaders are positive that a solution to the 
constitutional impasse could be found. They were speaking at 
tonight's launch of the international mediation initiative, an 
exercise which is being brokered by the Consultative Business 
Movement. Conrad Burke has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Burke] They gathered tonight, seven 
international mediators and representatives of South Africa's 
three major political parties. The task over the next 10 days: 
to break the constitutional deadlock between the IFP and the 
ANC, something that has eluded South African negotiators. IFP 
leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC representative Jacob 
Zuma sounded positive notes. 
  [Buthelezi] I call for a new spirit to descend upon us, to 
inspire our actions and the actions of the mediators. You must 
find a just and fair constitutional compromise under a 
constitution which is a constitution for all freedom-aspiring 
South Africans. 
  [Zuma] We believe there will be a solution, because we 
believe that all parties, with all the difficulties, are keen to 
reach a settlement in this country. 
  [Burke] Foreign Minister Pik Botha offered government 
assistance. They'll probably be asked to pick up the tab. But 
the government is not yet directly involved in the mediation 
exercise. It wants the terms of reference to be clarified first. 
Leading the mediators, Dr. Henry Kissinger said what was 
happening in South Africa was important for all mankindd. 
  [Kissenger] We in turn will make every effort to bridge the 
remaining distances, because we are all in sight of a tremendous 
achievement of the human spirit. 
  [Burke] The mediation team includes Lord Peter Carrington 
and 
five leading international experts. They'll be meeting at a 
closed venue near Johannesburg. [end recording] 
  Solutions reached during mediation had to be translated as 
amendments to the interim constitution to enable the IFP to take 
part in the elections. 
  Reiterating his commitment to democracy, Mr Buthelezi said 
he 
hoped that in this way the IFP would be allowed a stake in the 
constitution "so we can also see it as our own". 
  Mr Zuma said the ANC trusted the integrity of the mediators. 
"Nobody will think there's anything up the sleeve. We will all 
take your views honestly." 
  Mr Botha said the presence of the seven mediators, all of 
them eminent in their own right, showed the first world had not 
forgotten South Africa and wanted it to succeed. 
  Indian Chief Justice Mr Justice P N Bhagawathi told SAPA 
after the conference the mediators had not yet received their 
terms of reference. 
  In a statement on Monday, the Consultative Business 
Movement, 
which is co-ordinating the mediation, said all outstanding 
matters regarding international mediation had been successfully 
resolved at an IFP/ANC joint working group meeting on April 10. 
  Some analyists, notably Anthea Jeffrey of the South African 
Institute of Race Relations, have said that before the mediation 
gets to "outstanding constitutional matters" it will first have 
to address the deadlock between the two parties on the election 
date. The ANC has said the April 27 deadline is "sacrosanct"; 
the IFP has said constitutional compromises mean little if it 
has no time to prepare itself for an election focused on the 
compromises. 
  Asked about this issue at the conference on Tuesday night, 
Mr 
Buthelezi told SAPA he was not totally [word indistinct] with 
the terms of reference. 
  "But in my opinion it (postponement of the elections) is 
absolutely vital if we are going to get an all-inclusive 
solution." 
  When asked about the same issue, Mr Zuma offered no reply. 
  Information about where the mediation will take place is 
being carefully guarded. 
  The mediation team is: 
  Mr Justice P N Bhagwati, India; 
  Lord Peter Carrington, United Kingdom; 
  Mr Justice A Leon Higginbotham, United States of America; 
  Prof Paul Kevenhorster, Germany; 
  Dr Henry Kissinger, U.S.; 
  Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola, Italy; and 
  Prof Jean Antonie Laponce, Canada.

  [Text] Bophuthatswana's traditional chiefs who had been 
deposed by the government of former President Lucas Mangope will 
be reinstated under African National Congress rule. During his 
meeting with more than a hundred traditional leaders from 
Bophuthatswana in Johannesburg today, ANC Northwestern Transvaal 
premier elect, Mr. Popo Molefe, told chiefs that they would 
still play a role in a future government: 
  [Begin Molefe recording] It is important for the chiefs to 
understand their role in that process. They must understand 
their future -- their future role under a new government. We 
will share with them the provisions of the interim constitution 
relating to the house of chiefs -- the council of chiefs, their 
participation in the district and rural councils. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The national organizer of the Egle Party, Shaykh 
Ibrahim Amartey, has observed that the call for national unity 
by the Progressive Alliance is in the interest of all political 
parties in the country. This is because no matter which 
political party is in power at any given time, no meaningful 
development can take place in any country which is divided 
against itself. 
  Shaykh Amartey made this observation at a rally of the Egle 
Party at Bawku in the Upper East Region. He drew the attention 
of the politicians and journalists to the fact that the more 
they fan national disunity the more they retard the nation's 
development. 
  Shaykh Amartey announced that the National Electoral 
Commission has given approval to the party to change its name 
from Egle to the Eagle Party. He said the Eagle stands for 
Every Accountable Ghanaian Living Everywhere. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Heavy fighting is continuing in Tubmanburg, Bomi 
County, between Madingo and Krahn elements within ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]. Alhaji Koromah 
and Roosevelt Johnson recently issued a joint communique in the 
Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, to stop the bloody conflict 
within the organization. People say the battle for Tubmanburg 
has escalated to other areas in Bomi County. A convoy of relief 
supplies for thousands of citizens in Cape Mount, Bomi, and 
Lower Lofa Counties was stopped at the Po River by ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring 
Group] soldiers. 
  Roosevelt Johnson's faction of ULIMO has vowed to revenge 
the 
death of their people killed by the Koromah faction. People say 
ECOMOG soldiers in the Tubmanburg area are being disarmed by the 
Krahn elements of ULIMO.

been warned not to allow himself to be used as puppet by Amos 
Sawyer and his bunch of political misfits who have brought 
disgrace to the West African subregion and untold suffering to 
the Liberian people. 
  In a statement issued, the executive committee of CAG 
[expansion unknown] said since the induction of the State 
Council over one month ago, the council has made no effort to 
visit other parts of the country to ensure genuine reunification 
and a process of confidence-building. The statement said 
Councilor Kpomakpor, as an eminent person on the State Council, 
must conduct himself in a more credible way to ensure that the 
contemporary wishes and aspirations of the Liberian people are 
protected.

  [Text] [Passage indistinct] There have been clashes at 
Kolouka. Our reporter Soumana Boubacar visited the scene of the 
clashes. His report, due to its poor sound quality, is 
interpreted in the studio by our reporter Ibounge. 
  [Ibounge] Indeed, according to Soumana Boubacar, the clashes 
are taking place, as you said, at Kolouka, a small village 5 km 
away from Bani Bangou. Violent and bloody clashes between 
defense and security forces and Muslim fundamentalists have been 
taking place there for the past three days. Here is the 
chronology of events as narrated by our correspondent: 
  At 1400 on 11 April, the brigade commander of Bani Bangou 
Gendarmerie took six of his men and proceeded to Kolouka to 
arrest five Muslim fundamentalists following a radio message 
transmitted from Oualam. On arrival at Kolouka, our gendarmes 
met with fierce resistance and violent clashes ensued. The 
Muslim fundamentalists, believing in their invulnerability, 
crushed and beat the seven gendarmes to death and on the same 
day declared their village a no-go area. 
  Yesterday morning, the prefect of Tillabery travelled to 
Bani 
Bangou to present his condolences to the bereaved families of 
the seven gendarmes, and yesterday afternoon, an impressive 
detachment of gendarmes and republican guards under the command 
of Captain Ibrahim Moussa left Bani Bangou for Kolouka with the 
mission to capture the fundamentalists responsible for the death 
of the seven gendarmes. There was a new development this time: 
a media representative was included in the convoy. 
  One may note that after several unheeded warnings, the 
gendarmes and republican guards fired teargas at the 
fundamentalists but they surged forward without any problem. 
The defense and security men therefore opened fire but all to 
no avail. The Kolouka Muslim fundamentalists -- under the 
influence of drugs according to Soumana Boubacar -- were not 
impressed by the intense firing and continued to advance. Then 
came the retreat order. However, misfortune set in. A vehicle 
belonging to the Republican Guard broke down. The occupants 
tried to flee. One of them was caught by the fundamentalists 
but before dying he managed, miraculously, to kill two 
fundamentalists. The detachment then returned to Bani Bangou. 
One republican guard, (Alga Dizabai), and two fundamentalists 
died in yesterday's clash. 
  According to the latest information, the fundamentalists 
plan 
to march on Bani Bangou, which at any rate is under their 
control as the gendarmes and republican guards have retreated to 
Baleyara. Soumana Boubacar reports, however, that soldiers based 
at (Kinoua) are reported to have cordoned off the area.

<F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Many of our Sierra Leone listeners are less than 
happy with the Army's pursuit of the civil war and its behavior 
toward the civilian population. Now, hard on the heels of this 
week's big shakeup in the high echelons, including the removal 
of the Army chief, the new head of the Army, Colonel Kelly 
Conteh, is promising a new look into Army policy. From Freetown 
Victor Sylver telexed this report. 
  In an interview this afternoon, the new Army head, Colonel 
Kelly Conteh, just back from a command course in Nigeria, 
emphasized the need for all Sierra Leoneans to be involved in 
eradicating the rebel menace throughout the country. He said 
that the relations between civilians and soldiers should be 
cordial and that he would not treat lightly incidents of 
soldiers acting as members of an occupation force. 
  Colonel Conteh was of the view that soldiers are servants of 
the people and that they have to protect civilians in whatever 
situation. Although he couldn't tell me what new strategy he 
intends to adopt in bringing the war to a speedy end, Col. 
Conteh hinted that the main cause of the reverses in the war 
could well be due to leadership and stressed that the 
enforcement of discipline will receive top priority from now on. 
  He agreed with me that the Sierra Leonean Army, like all 
others, has its crop of bad eggs and appealed to the civilian 
population to show understanding and patience. Col. Conteh also 
made a direct appeal to those who had taken up arms against 
their brothers to realize that it is their blood that is being 
shed and urged them to lay down their arms and make use of the 
amnesty being granted to all those who surrender.

<F P=106> [Report of a speech by President Ali Mahdi Mohamed at United </F>
Somali Congress Central Committee meeting; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Words indistinct] the president's speech 
included the results of the national reconciliation conferences 
held in Cairo and Nairobi. He said they were greatly respected 
by the Somali people. However, the president said it was 
unfortunate that while it was agreed that no further fighting 
should take place in Somalia and that a conference should be 
held on 15 April to pave the way for the establishment of a 
national government on 15 May, the Somali National Alliance 
[SNA] had launched attacks in different parts of Somalia by 
massacring people and destroying much property in Marka, 
Baraawe, and Jilib districts, and also in Hiiraan and Galguduud 
regions. The president said this was opposed to the wishes of 
our suffering people and the agreements signed in Cairo and 
Nairobi. [passage omitted] 
  Long debates and analyses were held for five and a half 
hours 
and an announcement for the Somali people was issued concerning 
the general situation in the country in the political, security, 
and social fields, as well as the implementation of the peace 
agreements reached, especially the Nairobi Manifesto of 24 March 
1994. It became clear that the SNA had carried out disorder in 
Mogadishu, Galguduud, and Hiiraan; destabilization and 
occupation of settlements such as Marka, Jilib, Baraawe, and 
others. They are planning to create endless chaos with the 
intention of scuttling the 15 April conference to prepare for 
the great Somali conference of 15 May. This violates the Addis 
Ababa Accord and Nairobi Manifesto. 
  These obstacles are proof of Aidid's policy of using brute 
force and bullets and his lack of confidence in democracy which 
is the basis of the Somali people's aspirations in the struggle. 
The 12 political organizations working for the good of the 
country are aware that they represent 98 percent of the Somali 
people and are constantly striving for peace and for resolving 
the problem. They are also aware of the consequences which may 
follow the habitual provocations and expansionism of the Somali 
SNA clique. Given that it is the duty of the 12 organizations 
to defend the wishes and work for peace and regaining national 
dignity they are aware of the problems all over the country 
perpetrated by SNA [words indistinct] to carry out its 
international (?agreements) in the administrative, security and 
political fields. 
  The 12 organizations, in respecting the Nairobi Manifesto of 
24 March, are ready to participate in the 15 April conference to 
be held in Mogadishu and attended by the signatories of the 
Addis Ababa agreement. They are completely opposed to any 
delay. The 12 political organizations urge the Somali people to 
stick by their desire for peace and for settling their affairs, 
and also to write and jointly confront the disruptive acts 
carried out by the SNA. The 12 organizations call upon the SNA 
to stop the war and withdraw from the areas they have forcefully 
and aggressively occupied.

  [Text] A DAILY NEWS front-page story says Tanzania has 
warned warring factions in Rwanda that it won't tolerate the 
killing of any Tanzanians in that country. Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha, 
principal secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation, said yesterday that his government 
will take stern measures against the murder of any Tanzanians by 
any group belonging either to the Rwandan Patriotic Front forces 
or by government forces. 
  He said Tanzania has made great efforts to promote peace in 
Rwanda and would therefore expect its citizens to be accorded 
security and special treatment in that country: We are not 
joking. We would never forgive any side held responsible for the 
death of any Tanzanians in Rwanda. 
  Meanwhile the government has moved to evacuate its citizens 
from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi, where the first batch of 20 
evacuees arrived on 10 April. The same story is carried in the 
fifth page of UHURU, which adds that the security of Tanzanians 
in Rwanda should be strictly ensured.

  [Text] The President's Office has dismissed as total 
fabrication a story which appeared in the Kenyan DAILY NATION of 
last Saturday [9 April], under the title: Ugandan Leaders in 
Crisis Meeting. The paper said that senior Ugandan officials 
had been in a meeting to discuss the possibility of sending 
troops to Rwanda to halt the anarchy in that country. 
  In a statement issued in Kampala today, the Office of the 
President made it crystal clear that this is a total 
fabrication. Uganda, like the other neighboring countries in the 
region, the statement said, is ready to assist in any way 
possible in the restoration of peace and stability in the 
region. However, the statement adds, we stand by our 
strongly-held view that any involvement in Rwanda by elements 
other than Rwandan, must be arrived at through either a regional 
or an OAU decision. This, the statement goes on, is underlined 
by the recent regional summit which took place in Dar es Salaam 
on 6 April 1994, when the regional leaders discussed the crisis 
in Rwanda and Burundi. 
  Uganda, which has always taken a neutral stance in the 
crisis 
in Rwanda, the statement declares, will continue to do so. 
Should we be called upon to assist, it adds, we shall act only 
in concert with the regional countries or with the OAU. There 
has therefore been no meeting to discuss the possibility of 
sending Ugandan troops to Rwanda. The Office of the President 
appealed to all journalists reporting on the events in Rwanda to 
desist from the temptation to thrive on the miseries of their 
African brothers and sisters by using the tragic event in that 
country to make money through fabricated stories.

  [Text] In Lusaka, Zambia, the observers, the government 
delegation and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] will meet at 1000 today under Alioune Blondin 
Beye's mediation. Alves Antonio reports: 
  The parties still have to hold discussions on national 
reconciliation and the conclusion of the second round of 
presidential elections. Alioune Blondin Beye has already said 
that it is necessary to speedily advance this negotiating 
process. According to Beye, cited by very reliable sources, this 
recommendation was made by UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, who also requested the parties to end the 
devastating war in Angola. 
  Another very reliable source also told Luanda Radio that so 
far there is no (?established agenda) for the resumption of the 
peace talks. The ball in Beye's court.

  [Text] Violent clashes are still taking place in Cuanza 
Norte Province where Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops are involved in an offensive 
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] for the control of N'Dalatando. The military offensive 
has already met its most difficult test near the Lucala 2 River 
bridge on the Dondo- N'Dalatando road. Sources from the Cuanza 
Norte Command [word indistinct] say that between 7 and 11 April 
our courageous soldiers destroyed an enemy military convoy and 
successfully blocked the repressive forces who were trying to 
advance toward the (Bimba) highlands. As a result, Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] combatants killed 57 MPLA 
elements, burned eight vehicles, including [words indistinct] 
tankers containing 6,000 liters of diesel, and captured four 
communication radios, 13 R-4 weapons, three PKM machine guns, 
countless rounds ammunitions of different calibers, as well as 
an assortment of war materiel. Seeing their plans to storm 
N'Dalatando thwarted, over the past few days the MPLA air force 
and artillery units stepped up attacks on civilian targets, 
killing innocent women, elderly people, and children. The 
gallant FALA combatants will continue to defend the people and 
their property [words indistinct].

  [Text] There has been a revival of the war in Angola. This 
afternoon Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, was the scene of 
heavy fighting between government and UNITA [National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola] forces. At the moment no one 
has given an explanation for the flare-up, which has already 
caused at least 20 deaths. Our correspondent Paulo Juliao 
reports: 
  [Juliao] Fighting between government and UNITA forces has 
been resumed and the city of Cuito is once again under heavy 
shelling. The clashes started at about 1600. The causes of this 
new flare-up between the Luanda and Savimbi forces are still 
unknown. 
  A source here in Luanda has said that 20 people have been 
killed in Cuito in the past few hours. There are no figures for 
the number of wounded. 
  The Cuito clashes are being interpreted here as a counter- 
offensive by UNITA forces following their loss of a substantial 
part of the city of Dalatando, capital of Cuanza Norte Province, 
occupied by the rebels for over two years now. 
  It will be recalled that Cuito was recently visited by UNITA 
leader Jonas Savimbi. Some believe that he instructed his 
forces to resume the fighting, hence today's developments.

  [Text] Maseru April 14 SAPA -- Lesotho's Deputy Prime 
Minister Selometsi Baholo and four other ministers were abducted 
from their homes and offices by armed soldiers in Maseru on 
Thursday [14 April] morning. Some of the ministers were carried 
away in the back of an open vehicle and taken to the maximum 
security section of the central prison in Maseru, according to 
unconfirmed reports. 
  The sound of gunfire was heard earlier on Thursday at the 
Makoanyane Army barracks on the outskirts of Maseru. The 
soldiers occupying the barracks are said oppose the ruling 
Basotholand Congress Party. 
  Lesotho's Parliament adjourned until Friday after the 
speaker, Dr Teboho Kolane, announced that some members of the 
house had been "kidnapped". He said the assembly could not 
concentrate on debate under the circumstance. 
  The arrested ministers were seen being taken away by armed 
soldiers as hundreds of Maseru residents were going to work on 
Thursday morning. 
  In January a group of Lesotho Army members mutinied after 
demanding a 100 per cent salary increase. 
  The presidents of Zimbabwe and Botswana were requested by 
Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku to visit Lesotho to 
investigate the causes of the problems. In their report tabled 
in the Lesotho Parliament last week, the two presidents warned 
that while the immediate danger of confrontation in the army 
appeared to have passed, it was clear to them that unless the 
broader underlying political issues were addressed, there could 
be no guarantee that such confrontation would not erupt again.

  [Text] Pretoria April 14 SAPA -- Defence Minister Kobie 
Coetsee has instructed senior SADF [South African Defense Force] 
officers to communicate with the Lesotho Defence Force in order 
to calm the situation in that country following reports of 
another military mutiny. 
  Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Lesotho's Prime Minister Dr 
Ntsu Mokhehle told a South African embassy official that the 
Lesotho Defence Force arrested the Deputy Premier S. Baholo and 
three other ministers on Thursday [14 April]. The prime 
minister was deeply concerned about their personal safety, Mr 
Botha said. 
  "The head of the Lesotho Defence Force could not be traced. 
At the time of the meeting with the prime minister no-one knew 
anything about his whereabouts." 
  Lesotho's prime minister requested immediate South African 
mediation with the Lesotho Defence Force. 
  "I informed the South African Minister of Defence Mr Kobie 
Coetsee about the situation and he is giving instructions for 
senior members of the SADF to communicate with the Lesotho 
Defence Force in an attempt to calm the situation and to find a 
solution to the present crisis," Mr Botha said. 
  He had also informed the Transitional Executive Council's 
[TEC] sub-committee on foreign affairs of the events in Lesotho 
as well as the foreign minister of Zimbabwe. President Robert 
Mugabe was the chairman of the committee consisting of Botswana, 
Zimbabwe and South Africa which had been involved for the last 
few months in assisting the Lesotho Government and the Lesotho 
Defence Force in finding a solution to a dispute that has 
threatened the country's stability. 
  "The South African Government and the TEC appeal to the 
Lesotho Defence Force to abandon its present course of action 
and to avoid bloodshed at any cost," Mr Botha said. 
  The South African Government wished to emphasize that it 
would not recognize any government that endeavoured to come into 
being through violence. Steps would be considered in 
conjunction with Zimbabwe and Botswana on how to deal with the 
present situation, Mr Botha said. 
  In the meantime South Africans were cautioned not to visit 
Lesotho until greater clarity emerged on the situation. Mr 
Botha appealed to those reponsible for arresting the ministers 
concerned not to inflict any physical or other harm upon them. 
  The South African Government stood ready to negotiate with 
the officers concerned for the ministers' release, which may or 
may not include safe conduct to South Africa. 
  An international task force earlier found that the Basotho 
people should solve their own political and military problems, 
although South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana were prepared to 
assist in this regard. This was the essence of the findings of 
the task force which investigated the Lesotho situation 
following earlier instances of military insurrection. 
  The three countries' heads of state met in Gaborone in 
January and, following an appeal for assistance from the Lesotho 
Government, instructed the task force to investigate fighting 
amongst factions of the country's defence force. 
  Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told a news 
conference in Pretoria in January: "We are trying to assist the 
Basotho people to solve their own political and military 
problems. 
  "The (task force) stressed this factor in this report and 
the 
heads of state will be appraised of this fact also. 
  "It is a Basotho problem that must be solved by the 
Basothos."

  [Excerpts] We begin with an item related to yesterday's 
special edition of "Sava-Ravina" ["Close Examination," Sunday 
radio program], which all of us probably listened to. Our guest 
was Professor Albert Zafy, the president of the Republic, who 
discussed the current state of national affairs for more than 
two hours. 
  One of the topics he touched on during the program was the 
disruptive acts being perpetrated by some people in the country, 
acts which President Albert Zafy described as acts of 
destabilization. 
  The head of state said yesterday that these acts of 
destabilization as well as those perpetrating them had many 
facets. He especially stressed that foreigners, local people, 
and foreigners in collusion with local people were among those 
involved in perpetrating these acts. 
  We have this evening received news concerning foreigners in 
collusion with local people. It is now known that, once again, 
there is an important foreign ambassador, still working and 
living in our country, who is attempting to disrupt the country. 
In other words, he is indulging in what is called 
destabilization. 
  According to news which reached us, the foreign diplomat is 
known to have toured various provinces during the series of 
elections held in the country in 1993, supporting at that time 
and still supporting, people who were not officially elected 
during these elections. 
  Investigations are now being held and evidence shows that 
the 
foreign diplomat is really indulging in acts aimed at preventing 
the head of state from carrying out his duty. This is what is 
called conspiracy. 
  There are even some top officials of the former regime who, 
according to what we have learned, are spreading rumors and even 
boasting that they would inevitably return to power. [passage 
omitted] 
  Not long ago, during a ceremony held on the occasion of the 
launching of Radio France International, RFI, many of our 
country's leaders including President Albert Zafy himself talked 
to RFI journalists. The president also mentioned this 
destabilization on that occasion which this foreign diplomat was 
trying to bring about in Madagascar. President Albert Zafy, 
however, at that time, pointed out that it was not the foreign 
country which was the subject of his concern but the behavior of 
its ambassador in Madagascar. 
  If we broaden our analysis, we may deduce that what happened 
in Togo, Rwanda, and Burundi, for example, may be considered as 
destabilization acts similar to those we are now experiencing in 
Madagascar. Those acts caused the death of the Rwandan and 
Burundian presidents. 
  We will all be monitoring the developments of this affair. 
What is worth noting is that there are acts of destabilization 
being perpetrated in our country by some local people or 
foreigners or foreigners in collusion with local people. We all 
have to be vigilant.

  [Text] The foreign minister, who was contacted this 
morning, has called on all Burundians in Kigali to gather if 
possible at the Burundian Embassy to await their imminent 
repatriation. According to a high-ranking official of the same 
ministry, negotiations on the repatriation of our compatriots 
from the Rwandan capital began last weekend. Those who were in 
Gisenyi have left Rwandan territory. There are around 40 people 
left. Two planes will leave Bujumbura soon for Goma, eastern 
Zaire, to where these people were evacuated. 
  A special flight is planned in the next few hours for those 
who are in Kigali and who are able to reach the Burundian 
Embassy. The high-ranking Foreign Ministry official told us 
that at the Burundian Embassy in Kigali, 30 Burundians are 
awaiting repatriation, and will receive French and Belgian 
military assistance. 
  Those who cannot easily reach the embassy are asked to join 
any Belgian or French citizens residing nearby to be evacuated 
with other expatriates. In case of problems, they can call the 
Burundian Embassy in Kigali on the following number: 75512.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 13 Apr (AFP) -- A brief clash occurred 
this morning between some ministerial reserve policemen and 
opposition supporters close to former President Denis 
Sassou-Nguesso, in the eastern Brazzaville district of Mpila, 
according to witnesses. No details have emerged on the causes 
and outcome of this clash, which occurred near the former 
president's residence. The machine-gun fire had stopped by 
midmorning but there were still signs of tension in the area, an 
Army officer said. Defense Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo has 
held a meeting with members of the Army High Command and 
officers from the north of the country, who are close to General 
Sassou-Nguesso, to study ways and means of ending the clashes, 
the same officer added. 
  Security forces have been deployed in Mpila to check the 
activities of armed robbers, who have been attacking the goods 
trains of the Congo-Ocean railway company, the police said. 
Police presence has been stepped up since the death on 3 April 
of a soldier, who was killed by a stray bullet during a 
shoot-out between security forces and the "cobras," the nickname 
of Gen. Sassou- Nguesso's armed supporters. His supporters are 
opposed to the presence of the security forces in Mpila and fear 
that this could serve as a pretext to attack the residence of 
the former head of state, who is presently in his native 
village, Oyo, 600 km north of Brazzaville.

  [Text] The rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] are 
still maintaining maximum pressure on Kigali, the capital of 
Rwanda. After a lull last night -- at least on the surface -- 
fighting resumed at daybreak between the government Armed Forces 
and the RPF troops. Can you confirm this, Christophe 
Boisbouvier? 
  [Boisbouvier] Indeed. For about two hours now, since 
daybreak, smoke has been visible from the airport, drifting 
above the district where the former parliament is situated and 
from where the RPF resistance pocket operated for six days, if 
you remember. The pocket is alleged to have linked up with the 
rebels from the north. This remains to be confirmed. 
  Fighting involving the use of heavy weapons is taking place. 
Light weapons are also being used, which would imply that there 
is now street fighting in these suburbs of Kigali, half way 
between the town and the airport. It is still difficult to know 
whether the Rwandan Armed Forces are still holding the largest 
part of the capital. In any case, what is certain is that they 
are still fighting, their resistance still holds. For instance, 
the forces around the airport, close to the French-Belgian 
forces, do not seem to be panicking. It is difficult to know 
what will happen over the next few hours. 
  As far as Westerners are concerned, one-third of French 
troops have left already. The remaining two-thirds are believed 
to be about to leave. The first company left Kigali this 
morning with the surgical unit. As for the Belgians, they may 
stay for another 24 or 48 hours in order to evacuate the last 
foreign nationals who are in town. This will not be easy given 
the fighting taking place right now. This is what we can say as 
far as the military side of things is concerned.

  [Text] Following the bloody violence that claimed more than 
20,000 people in Kigali, including the prime minister, Madame 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and some of her cabinet ministers, some 
forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have moved to Kigali 
in order to stop the massacre and establish law and order in the 
capital of Rwanda. 
  Latest reports from Kigali say that the Rwandan Patriotic 
Army [RPA] have captured some positions of strategic importance 
in Kigali. Fighting has also been going on between the RPA and 
the government forces in the northern part of Rwanda. The RPA 
has liberated Mutara zone completely. The government forces are 
now fleeing in disarray. In Byumba, the town is besieged by the 
RPA, ready to flush out the government forces but the operation 
has been halted by a request from the UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda], who requested the RPA to hold fire so that 
the UNAMIR can evacuate its forces that are in Byumba. 
  The current offensive by the RPA in Kigali is primarily 
intended to reinforce the RPA forces in Kigali who have been 
under attack by the presidential guard. A representative of the 
UNAMIR has confirmed that the RPA forces from the north have now 
linked with the RPA battalion in Kigali and there is no sign of 
resistance from the Rwandan Government forces.

  [Text] With the evacuation operation approaching its end, 
the question of whether our Blue helmets will remain in Rwanda 
needs to be clarified. In this respect, Foreign Minister Claes 
sounded out UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on this in 
Bonn last night. Butrus-Ghali reacted positively to Minister 
Claes' request to withdraw the Belgian Blue Helmets from Rwanda. 
This station has learned this from a reliable source. 
  The UN secretary general, however, wants a formal decision 
on 
this by the Security Council, which reportedly could meet today. 
  Belgium thus will avoid a unilateral withdrawal. A limited 
cabinet meeting was held this morning. The only topic on the 
agenda was the situation in Rwanda. The government is closely 
monitoring the evacuation of Belgians, as well as a possible 
withdrawal of the Blue Helmets from Rwanda. The government also 
has decided to hang the flags on public buildings at half-mast 
as a sign of national mourning, from tomorrow at 1100 to 
Saturday [16 April].

  [Text] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] would like UN 
Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] to stay in Rwanda, and has no 
objection to the presence of Belgian blue helmets in the force. 
We spoke to Jean-Baptiste Ndahumba, RPF spokesman in Brussels: 
  [Begin recording] [Ndahumba] We think that UN forces have to 
stay in Rwanda, UNAMIR must continue its mission, perhaps under 
different circumstances, but we need the help of the 
international community, we need the help of Belgium, which must 
return to our country once security is guaranteed. We want to 
maintain cooperation with the international community and with 
the United Nations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So the blue helmets will always 
be welcome? 
  [Ndahumba] They can stay if their security is guaranteed, 
and 
we think that as soon as the foreign nationals have been 
evacuated, we will do everything to bring back peace, order and 
security to Kigali, and to the rest of the country. [end

  [Excerpts] Foreign troops are starting to leave Rwanda. 
[passage omitted] 
  This morning, fierce fighting started up again in Kigali, 
the 
capital. One of our special correspondents, Christophe 
Boisbouvier, reports: 
  [Boisbouvier] The battalion of paratroopers commanded by 
Major Tabakunze is still trying to resist the advance of the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces of Paul Kagame. But the RPF 
vise is tightening round the town, and there is confirmation 
now, at midday, that the rebel forces who have come from both 
the north and south have managed to link up with the pocket that 
had been holding out for six days; they are now attacking the 
gendarmerie camp between the town and the airport. 
  This link-up has two consequences. First of all it has cut 
the Rwandan Armed Forces in two, one part in the town and the 
other at the airport, and then it has also cut the road between 
the town and the airport used for the evacuation of foreigners. 
Nevertheless, it appears that the last Belgian convoys going to 
fetch the last foreign nationals in Kigali are able to get to 
the airport without too many problems. 
  As for the French soldiers, they may all have left Rwanda 
before the end of the day. After three years of more or less 
active French military presence in Rwanda, a page is being 
turned.

  [Excerpt] In Rwanda, thousands of civilians are continuing 
to flee the massacres while the fighting between rebels and 
government forces appears to be escalating in the capital, 
Kigali. Today Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin confirmed the 
deaths of two French gendarmes and the wife of one of them to 
the National Assembly. Francois Leotard informed the senators 
of the departure late this afternoon of the last French company 
of soldiers. Before leaving Rwanda himself our special 
correspondent, Philippe Boisserie, sent us his report: 
  [Begin Boisserie recording] The French military are leaving 
Kigali at the same time as the Rwandan Patriotic Front are 
entering it. Operation Amaryllis, for the evacuation of 
foreigners, is ending. With 120 of his men, Colonel Poncet, who 
was leading the operation, left as night was falling, while all 
around the airport, the guns thundered. Only 50 French soldiers 
remain on the scene. Their mission is to support the Belgian and 
Italian soldiers in recovering their nationals who are still 
trapped in the four corners of the country. The two warring 
sides have promised to allow these operations to go ahead, the 
only condition being that everyone should be out within 48 hours. 
  The Rwandans are thus going to settle their scores among 
themselves, and it appears that the Tutsi minority of the Rwanda 
Patriotic Front are in the process of taking power. [passage

  [Text] In Rwanda, the extremist Hutu station Radio des 
Milles Collines denies the Patriotic Front's offensive. In the 
past few weeks this radio station has been responsible for the 
anti-Belgain witch-hunt. The Hutu station says that the rebels 
are still 80 km from Kigali. 
  There are only some 500 rebels in the capital, a Radio des 
Milles Collines journalist says. According to him, the 
government army can deal with them without difficulty: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording, in French] Some 
of them have been killed by us, some have hidden. To be frank I 
can assure you that there are no more than 500 of them [words 
indistinct] the groups retreat, they shoot at night. Well then, 
we will seek them out and crush them. There is another group 
which has retreated and is hidden but there is no battle which 
it has engaged in, there is no assault. The Patriotic Front has 
come from positions. [end recording] 
  Radio des Milles Collines is managed by a Belgian from 
Liege. 
Minister Clases has already protested against the station's 
anti-Belgian broadcasts.

  [Text] Fighting has continued throughout the day in Rwanda. 
The Rwanda Patriotic Front forces coming from the north have 
managed to link up with the 600 rebels in central Kigali, but 
they have not yet taken control of the city. The rebels said a 
moment ago that they control four strategic points in Kigali. 
Christophe Boisbouvier has just filed this report: 
  [Begin Boisbouvier recording] With the rebels coming from 
the 
north linking up with those who were holed up in central Kigali, 
the regular army now finds itself surrounded in the presidency 
district. Unless there is significant resistance from the 
civilian population which has set up roadblocks in the streets, 
the fall of Kigali seems imminent. It might, however, be more 
difficult for the rebels to take the northern strongholds of 
Byumba and Ruhengeri, since the government forces there are well 
armed with artillery. 
  The rebels will, however, have to be wary of their success. 
In statements today, they gave assurances that they would not 
confiscate the state for the Tutsi minority. The Rwandan people 
will judge them on their actions. [end recording]

  [Text] What is the current situation in Kigali? The 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is now fighting groups of 
Presidential Guards and a few government soldiers who support 
the groups. They will soon be defeated. Most of the government 
troops do not want to fight, nor do they want to support the 
small group of killers. 
  Meanwhile, in Kigali, the 600-man battalion which went there 
on (?28) December last year is not alone. Their colleagues have 
relieved them. They left the former RPF positions in the north 
to go to Kigali and they have now linked up with those in Kigali 
and are fighting together. That alone is a sign of the 
impending victory.

  [Text] Rwanda is obviously still at the top of the news. 
On the one hand there is talk of negotiations that might start 
between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the government, 
but details of this are still extremely unclear. 
  Meanwhile, things are speeding up in Kigali as far as 
fighting is concerned. Shells fell just now right by the 
runways at the airport, and all air traffic is halted for the 
moment. Simone Remont, RTBF special correspondent, is still 
there, and she has just called us: 
  [Begin Remont recording] The situation has worsened 
considerably in Kigali this morning. Mortar fire started again 
at dawn, and has not stopped, and it is coming very close to the 
airport. For example, at 0900 they hit the apron, less than 200 
meters from where we are, as convoys of Belgian peacekeeping 
troops are completing their withdrawal to Kigali airport. 
  The district of Gikondo, southeast of the town center, is a 
densely populated area. There has been firing this morning. 
Encircling maneuvers continue. The RPF is seizing all the 
strategic points around the capital. 
  This morning, two convoys went to the north and south of the 
town to pick up about 30 expatriates, including 12 Belgians. 
These are the very last operations of the kind, and the 
departure of the paratroopers should be completed today -- if 
the shooting permits, of course. But perhaps this is a just a 
warning to tell them to hurry. Anything is possible after the 
12-hour time limit. [end recording] 
  The arrivals continue, and just before 1000 a seventh plane 
bringing people evacuated from Rwanda back to Belgium landed at 
Zaventem airport. It was a Sabena airbus, coming from Nairobi, 
with 158 people on board.

  [Text] Colonel (Van de Weghe) of the Belgian Army says that 
the Rwandan Army leadership is prepared to enter into talks with 
the rebels about a truce. Even a joint government is not ruled 
out. Here is Colonel (Van de Weghe) being interviewed by Urbaan 
de Bekker: 
  [Begin recording] [Van de Weghe] Yes, indeed, there is a 
communique of a group of Rwandan higher officers, including the 
Rwandan Army chief. They state that they are prepared and that 
they wish to reach a cease-fire and even would want to form a 
provisional government together with Patriotic Front 
representatives. Until now this is of course a piece of paper, 
a statement. We must naturally hope that this will effectively 
turn into reality on the ground. 
  [De Bekker] It 's true that Colonel (Van de Weghe) is 
acquinted with some of the Rwandan officers but does not know, 
or does not yet know, to what extent the entire command and the 
entire Rwandan Army is bound by this communique. Nevertheless, 
it appears to be an important attempt to put an end to the 
atrocities and the violence in Rwanda. [end recording]

  [Text] The Rwanda Government Army chief of staff and nine 
other senior officers of the Rwanda Government Army today 
requested for a cease-fire. These officers should first explain 
whether they have been fighting. A cease-fire is arranged 
between two fighting forces. The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] 
is fighting that small clique of Presidential Guards and 
elements of the government Army who took it upon themselves to 
massacre innocent banyaRwanda [Rwandans]. These officers should 
explain whether they are in league with or fighting alongside 
these murderous criminals, which they are. Then they need not 
waste their breath requesting for a cease-fire, since the RPF 
went to Kigali to reinforce its battalion, which was under 
attack, to restore order and security and to stop the 
indiscriminate killing of innocent people by the Presidential 
Guards and elements of the government Army. 
  The RPF soldiers have accomplished their mission. If these 
officers are in the clique of murderers, then they should not 
ask for a cease-fire or later on expect it. If they are not 
with the murderous Presidential Guard and have disassociated 
themselves from the government Army elements who kill and loot, 
then they should not be requesting for a cease-fire. Instead 
they should be fighting alongside the RPF soldiers against the 
criminal elements of the government Army and the notorious 
Presidential Guard. How could they be asking for a cease-fire 
when the criminal elements are still killing innocent people? 
How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the retreating 
government soldiers are killing people in Kigali, Butare, 
Cyangugu, and Kibungo. 
  How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the extremist 
radio RTLM [Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines] speaks 
the whole day and night calling upon the population to kill each 
other just under the very noses of these officers? These 
officers should know that as long as all this is going on, the 
RPF will fight on until it restores order and security. Having 
said that, should these officers have separated themselves from 
the Presidential Guard, then they should join the RPF, fight the 
criminals and help restore order and security in the country. 
In this case, they should not be requesting for a cease-fire. 
Instead they should be disarming the Presidential Guard and the 
bad elements of the Army. They should be making statements to 
the effect that they have joined the RPF in the country in 
stopping the criminals from committing atrocities. On the other 
hand, if these officers are in league with or are part of the 
criminal elements, then they leave the RPF no option but to 
fulfill its patriotic duty of restoring order and security and 
protecting not only the Rwandan nationals but also the 
foreigners in the country.

youthwingers and some elements of the Army. The killings 
targeted members of the opposition and people of Tutsi origin. 
They killed the prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, 
cabinet ministers, and opposition leaders. It is clear that the 
massacres had been planned earlier on. 
  The PL denounces the so-called government that has been 
announced in Kigali, a government that is founded on the 
massacre of more than 20,000 people in Kigali alone. A 
government that was formed in disregard of the national 
Constitution. The PL denounces the murdering of Landouald 
Ndasingwa, formerly the first vice president of the Liberal 
Party and the other members of the Liberal Party who have been 
murdered. The PL denounces Mr. Justin Mugenzi and his clique 
who are trying to hijack the Liberal Party and join the 
illegitimate government that has been announced in Rwanda. 
  The current crisis in Rwanda is the implementation of a plan 
that has been hatched for some time. The plan is now 
implemented by murderers who have killed opposition leaders and 
people of Tutsi origin. This trend of killing has continued 
since the war started. These killers should be made to answer 
for their crimes. 
  The PL requests all the opposition parties in Rwanda, the 
international community, and all peace-loving people to join 
hands and fight the enemies of peace and democracy in Rwanda. 
  Signed by Kayiranga Esdras, Higiro Prosper, Musengimana 
Joseph. These are some of the surviving leaders of the Liberal 
Party.

<F P=106> [Article by Axel Buyse: "Chaos in Rwanda Threatens Stability </F>
of Whole Region"] 
  [Text] The chaos that has gripped Rwanda since Thursday [7 
April] could well have far-reaching consequences for the whole 
region -- the "Area of the Great Lakes." That covers not just 
Rwanda and Burundi, but also a large part of eastern Zaire, and 
by extension, even Uganda and western Tanzania. Rwanda and 
Burundi are among the least developed countries. The 
possibility of more or less stable regimes establishing 
themselves there seems to have disappeared for years to come. 
The departure of many foreigners and the freezing of some 
development funding could put the countries back years 
economically. There is a chance that another part of black 
Africa will go down in a huge turmoil. 
  The departure of most foreigners from Rwanda clears the way 
for a large-scale settling of scores between what remains of the 
regime and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. The contrast 
between the two groups is based on more than an ethnic division 
between Hutus and Tutsis respectively. During the last two 
years the RPF had successfully formed coalitions -- albeit 
constantly changing ones -- with a number of the opposition 
parties which were recruiting among Hutus. But at times of 
crises like this one, everything is easily reduced to the ethnic 
component. Hutus who made "common cause" with the Front were 
automatically called "collaborators." Which at the moment is 
equivalent to "shooting target." 
  If the Front does succeed in overrunning Kigali, thanks to 
its better organization and the motivation of its soldiers, 
there is little chance of it being able to rule the whole 
country alone. But it remains an open question whether by that 
time there will still be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to 
take things in hand. And whether RPF discipline will hold. The 
outside world is less well documented about what went wrong as 
regards human rights in the area controlled by the rebels. But 
it is absolutely certain that a large number of acts of terror 
were committed there too. There is a great danger of continuing 
instability, partly because in past years a large number of 
weapons entered the country via legal and illegal channels. 
  There is also little chance that if the Front "takes power" 
in Rwanda, that would not have consequences in Burundi. The 
calm which has ruled there in recent days is deceptive and 
almost makes one forget that in October and November between 
50,000 and 100,000 people died there, and that in a flare-up in 
Bujumbura at the end of March several hundred more people died. 
These recent experiences and the horrific scenes in Rwanda may 
bring the politicians in Bujumbura to a modus vivendi. But 
little is necessary to produce another short-circuit. 
  But even if Burundi remains calm, and things in Rwanda 
simmer 
down too, the economic consequences will remain. The two 
countries are largely dependent on development aid and for years 
Belgium has been the largest bilateral donor to these areas 
which were formerly under its guardianship. "Rwanda" has 
suffered wounds which will be difficult to heal in the coming 
years. 
  The NCOS [National Center For Development Cooperation], 
which 
groups together the Flemish nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), said in a declaration yesterday that Belgium could not 
abandon the people of Rwanda and that the violence was the work 
of an extremist group. Now, it may well be true that the 
continuation of development aid in "our" piece of Africa can 
well be defended, even on the grounds of pure self-interest -- 
because a large part of the money flows back to Belgium anyway, 
or in order to limit refugee flows. But in a first phase large 
sections of the public opinion risk completely turning against 
this. 
  There is considerable pressure to definitively turn away 
from 
central Africa. In mid-1990 Belgium "provisionally" cut links 
with Zaire after President Mobutu Sese Seko had broken the 
cooperation agreements out of anger with Brussels' interference 
in the incidents in Lubumbashi. In the meantime a group of 
experts and professors, at the request of the state secretary 
for development cooperation, continued to work on a "master 
plan" to restart cooperation on a better basis when the time is 
right. But for the time being the political developments in 
Kinshasa are not such as to offer sufficient support to any 
renewed cooperation. 
<H5>  Indifference </H5>
  The chance that an authentic democracy will gradually 
develop 
seems to have diminished. The shrinking but politically and 
symbolically important group round Etienne Tshisekedi has been 
completely cornered. It is unlikely that Belgian politicians 
can in the present circumstances accept a Zaire where there is 
no consensus about transition and where President Mobutu 
continues to play an important role. If Brussels is to change 
its course in this field, then it will take time. And it will 
certainly not be enthusiastic. The commercial interests hardly 
weigh up any more against an indifference which could turn into 
open hostility for a time, following the events in Rwanda. For 
many fellow countrymen, Rwanda 1994 is a rerun of Congo 1960-65. 
  Other donor countries and the international aid 
organizations 
will in time fill the hole left by the Belgians. But much will 
have to be built up from zero, depending, among other things, on 
what remains of Rwandan NGOs, cooperative ventures and "civil 
society" after the storm which is now gripping the land. 
  In the coming months Rwanda is in danger of becoming 
dependent on international aid for the most basic item -- food 
supply. Considerable time could pass before that process gets 
started. In the meantime there is also the threat of a 
potentially destabilizing disastrous situation among the many 
tens of thousands of Burundians who fled over the border at the 
end of October and start of November. The costs of restarting 
emergency aid will be considerably higher than having aid 
continue on the same level. In addition Rwanda and Burundi were 
the natural outlets for the most dynamic region of eastern 
Zaire: the Kivu. A regression in the two small countries could 
further endanger the perspectives of the independent development 
of the Zairian Kivu region. At present it is rather hopeless to 
look for positive points in a very somber situation.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 13 Apr (AFP) -- Casimir Bizimungu, former 
Rwandan public health minister, and his higher education 
colleague arrived in Kinshasa today from Goma (eastern Zaire) 
after fleeing the trouble taking place in their country. This 
was learned from reliable sources today in the Zairian capital. 
  According to eyewitnesses who saw them at the Ndjili 
airport, 
they were welcomed by Etienne Sigigera, the Rwandan ambassador 
in Kinshasa. The two former ministers, who were at the Kigali 
airport on 6 April waiting for the aircraft bringing back the 
Rwandan and Burundian presidents, had to flee towards Zaire when 
confusion followed the assassination.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 12 Apr (AFP) -- The future prime minister 
to be designated by the radical opposition must first sign the 
protocol agreement reached in January between the presidential 
group and the opposition and the special arrangement concerning 
the number of portfolios to be assigned to each political 
family, a statement issued by the bureau of the High Council of 
the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) indicated. These 
agreements between the presidential group and the opposition 
were reached after four months of negotiations at the Palais du 
Peuple in Kinshasa. 
  The HCR-PT bureau also underlined that the application for 
the post of prime minister should include among others the 
minutes and general report on consultations with the Sacred 
Union and its allies, and a report on consultations with the 
presidential group duly signed by all the parties concerned. 
  It may be recalled that Etienne Tshisekedi's party, the 
Union 
for Democracy and Social Progress, which participated in the 
Palais du Peuple negotiations, did not sign the protocol 
agreement due to differences over the appointment of the head of 
government. Under the transitional constitutional law 
promulgated on 9 April, a prime minister should be appointed 
between 9 and 20 April.

  [Excerpts] The adoption of a new Constitution has not 
dispelled the clouds over the political scene in Zaire. [passage 
omitted] 
  In a communique issued in Brussels, the "Zairian Opposition 
Committee of the Forces Supporting Change" (COFAZAC) condemns 
the complicity of some members of the international community 
and calls on the opposition to regroup around Etienne 
Tshisekedi, the prime minister elected by the CNS [Sovereign 
National Conference]. For its part, the USORAS (Sacred Union of 
the Radical Opposition)- Benelux thinks that "Zaire is at a 
crossroads faced with the delaying tactics of Mobutu and his 
men," and refers to "USORAS' right and duty to have an armed 
force for self-defense and the protection of the people."

  [Text] State President F. W. de Klerk says he hopes for a 
speedy agreement on the guidelines for mediation between the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC. He was addressing a news 
conference on the latest crisis in Pretoria at the end of what 
could be the last cabinet meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [De Klerk, in English] We can, through 
this 
mediation effort, move towards agreements which have escaped us 
for a very long time. We would like to see such agreements, and 
we instructed our delegation not to be technical, but to ensure 
that agreement is reached which will make successful mediation 
possible. 
  [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] He said the cabinet has 
discussed proposals by the working group which is examining the 
position of the Zulu monarchy and found them to be acceptable. 
President de Klerk said the government has some criticism of 
the proposals, but believes the solution to the problem could be 
contained in some of them. Referring to the postponement of the 
election date, President de Klerk said he saw no reason which 
could justify such a move at this point. 
  [De Klerk, in English] I sincerely believe that it is in the 
best interests of all South Africans, also of all the people of 
kwaZulu-Natal, that the elections take place on the scheduled 
date. But nobody can prevent any leader to put the question in 
negotiation on the agenda, and in a true spirit of negotiation, 
I'm always willing to listen to arguments of anybody, and to 
interact on the basis of such arguments. 
  [Van Zyl] President de Klerk said strikes are causing 
increasing problems, particularly in the former self-governing 
territories and independent states. He welcomed efforts by the 
Transitional Executive Council to play a role in the prevention 
of such strikes. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 13 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
said on Wednesday [13 April] he hoped the international 
mediation effort to resolve policial differences would result in 
agreements that had long escaped the country. Addressing a 
press conference in Pretoria after a cabinet meeting, he said 
government negotiators had been instructed to be constructive 
rather than technical at mediation talks. 
  Some progress had been made on Wednesday to establish the 
terms of reference for the mediation process for kwaZulu/Natal. 
"Hopefully, mediation will take off soon as a result of this 
meeting," Mr de Klerk said. 
  He warned that the success of the mediation effort hinged on 
the will of political parties to find a solution. If any party 
tried to use mediation for fancy tricks it would not work, Mr de 
Klerk said. 
  It seemed mediation might begin by Friday night or Saturday 
morning. 
  A second four-way summit would not be held before this 
because the bid to find a solution to the issue of a Zulu 
monarchy had to be co-ordinated with the foreign mediation 
effort. 
  He believed the four-way summit task group had come up with 
with a document which contained a solution to the issue of the 
political accommodation of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Mr de Klerk said he did not believe the election date should 
be "mediable". The date was a matter to be addressed by the 
country's political leaders. 
  Government, however, believed the elections should be held 
on 
the scheduled date. 
  Expressing his "deep concern" over strikes throughout the 
country, he said political parties such as the African National 
Congress, which was affiliated to unions organising the strikes, 
should be responsible for halting the stoppages and contributing 
to free and fair elections. 
  "Any action which harms the economy of the country is 
harmful 
to each and every voter." 
  Mr de Klerk denied the Transitional Executive Council had 
proposed that the state of emergency regulations for Natal be 
tightened. This was an oversimplified interpretation. The 
Executive Council had adopted a resolution that certain 
investigations should be conducted into the situation in the 
region, Mr de Klerk said. 
  Reacting to a television cameraman's remark that he found 
political developments confusing, Mr de Klerk said: "I don't 
hold it against you. I thnk things are pretty confusing."

  [Text] Johanneburg April 13 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] on Wednesday [13 April] night said it rejected the 
notion that it should agree to preconditions set by the 
government before it could participate in mediation to solve the 
constitutional dispute. 
  These preconditions, said an IFP statement, were that the 
party agree to national elections being held on April 26, 27 and 
28 and that any agreement on constitutional amendments not be 
implemented until after the elections. "The IFP has agreed to 
consider the possibility that the issue of the election date is 
not to be raised during mediation, but cannot agree under any 
circumstances to the imposition of this precondition in breach 
of all previous agreements related to international mediation." 
  Regarding implementation of any agreement on constitutional 
amendments, the IFP said: "The African National Congress/South 
African Communist Party alliance and the National Party are now 
requesting that the IFP agrees on an implementation procedure 
which would effectively pre-empt and prevent the 
participationehf the IFP in the election process." 
  Any agreement on constitutional amendments would be 
"delivered to a constituent assembly after elections, rather 
than being translated into constitutional amendments prior to 
elections". 
  "The IFP would not be represented in such a constituent 
assembly and it would be forced to operate as an 
extra-parliamentary force," the statement said. 
  It continued: "The IFP stresses the fact that the final 
purpose of international mediation is to create the basis for a 
political compromise which will enable the IFP to participate in 
elections."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Office of Chief Minister of kwaZulu on </F>
the SAPA PR Wire Service on 14 April] 
  [Text] Statement by the delegation of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] to the international mediators on the present 
impasse in the mediation process. 
  The IFP is ready, willing and able to begin the mediation 
process immediately as we have been ready for the past 12 hours. 
  The IFP stands by the consolidated terms of reference agreed 
upon between then ANC and the IFP on Sunday, April 10, 1994 , 
which the IFP believes must form the basis on which negotiations 
must begin and proceed. In fact the mediators were brought to 
South Africa on the basis of these term of reference. 
  If the South African Government wishes to submit to the 
mediators an additional document in which they set forth any 
different or additional concerns or any other matter, they may 
do so. During today's discussions it appears that the South 
African Government does not have an objection to the contents of 
the consolidated terms of reference agreed between the IFP and 
the South African Government which are basically reflected in 
the document produced by the government. 
  However, the government seems now to require that the IFP 
accepts a precondition as a price to pay to enter the 
international mediation effort. This request of the South 
African Government has been supported by the ANC which has 
reneged on the consolidated terms of reference previously agreed 
upon. 
  This precondition is that the IFP agrees that the election 
shall be held only on the scheduled date of April 26 and 27, 
1994. This means that by virtue of having agreed to such a date, 
the IFP could no longer sustain and advocate its policy position 
that the election date is to be postponed in any other fora in 
which the political debate is taking place. There is no doubt 
that the issue of the postponement of the election date is the 
crux of the present national crisis. In fact, any possible 
analysis of the situation shows that only through a postponement 
of the election will it be possible to ensure that a 
constitutional compromise can open the doors to enable the IFP 
to rejoin the electoral process on an equal footing with all 
other parties. 
  The IFP has agreed to consider the possibility that the 
issue 
of the election date is not to be raised during mediation but 
can not agree under any circumstances on the imposition of this 
precondition in breach of all previous agreements related to 
international mediation. 
  Furthermore, the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] 
alliance and the National Party are now requesting that the IFP 
agrees on an implementation procedure which would effectively 
preempt and prevent the participation of the IFP in the election 
process. They request that the IFP agrees that the only 
implementing technique to translate into reality any positive 
result emerging from negotiations shall be a "solemn pact". This 
means that whatever constitutional compromise produced through 
international mediation will be delivered to a constituent 
assembly after elections, rather than being translated into 
constitutional amendments prior to elections. The IFP would not 
be represented in such a constituent assembly and it would be 
forced to operate as an extra-parliamentary force. 
  In this light the only purpose of the "solemn pact" appears 
to be to ensure that the IFP has no political or moral ground to 
continue to oppose the legitimacy of the election process and 
the empowerment of a constituent assembly after elections. 
  During over four hours of negotiations today neither the ANC 
nor the South African Government has shown any flexibility with 
respect to the imposition of these two preconditions. 
  The IFP rejects the notion that it should accept these two 
preconditions in order to sit at the mediation table. The IFP 
stresses the fact that the final purpose of international 
mediation is to create the basis for a political compromise 
which will enable the IFP to participate in elections. 
  There will be no stability in this country or any certainty 
about future democratic developments if a significant political 
force such as the IFP is not part of the process. The ANC/SACP 
alliance and the National Party wish to close the only available 
options to ensure that such a result is achieved. 
  The IFP regrets that it might not be the role of the 
mediators to get involved in the issue of the election date of 
the election dat or the issue of whether any rasults of 
mediation should be translated into a solemn pact rather than 
constitutional amendments. However, it is not fair or just to 
require that the IFP accepts that the options of amending the 
constitution prior to elections an postponing the election date 
be eliminated from any political debate in the country at the 
outset of mediation as a precondition to begin mediation.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] officials were meeting at a Johannesburg hotel Thursday 
[14 April] morning amid continuing uncertainty about the 
international mediation process. 
  The process was meant to start on Wednesday morning but was 
delayed because of a dispute over the terms of reference for 
mediation. The dispute arose from the IFP's objection to a 
reference to the election date in the new terms of reference 
drawn up after the government joined the process as a full 
participant. 
  The IFP has argued that agreement on constitutional issues 
would lead inevitably to negotiations on a new election date, a 
position rejected by both the government and the African 
National Congress. 
  A spokesman for the international mediators said they had 
held discussions with the parties and were preparing to release 
a statement during the course of the morning. 
  A draft agreement between the government, the African 
National Congress and the IFP was reached after talks in 
Pretoria involving representatives of the three parties. The 
agreement suggested a two- phase approach to mediation whose 
effect would be to separate the question of the election date 
from the terms of reference. 
  The draft agreement was discussed with the mediators at a 
meeting late on Wednesday night. However, the draft was awaiting 
the final approaval of the IFP before the mediation began.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer was meeting international 
mediator Henry Kissinger for talks on Thursday [14 April] 
morning aimed at salvaging the embattled mediation process. Mr 
Meyer's meeting was one of several being held with the mediators. 
  Mr Meyer would not be drawn on what his meeting was about, 
but the parties are trying to settle their differences on the 
terms of reference so that mediation can get underway. 
  The international mediation forum said in a statement that 
mediators were still in contact with the parties. They have 
apparently given the parties until lunchtime on Thursday to 
settle their differences on the terms of reference.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The international 
mediation effort has struck "insurmountable problems," 
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said on Thursday 
[14 April] after meeting mediator Henry Kissinger. 
  Mr Meyer said that as far as government was concerned the 
mediation could continue, but the problems surrounding the terms 
of reference "will cause this current effort not to continue". 
  Asked whether the mediation, which was intended to resolve 
outstanding constitutional difficulties between the African 
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party would be 
abandoned, Mr Meyer said: "On the basis of them accepting that 
there is no clarity on the terms of refence that is 
unfortunately the position". 
  Mr Meyer said the divisive issue was not which particular 
terms of reference would be used by the mediators, but the issue 
of the election date. 
  He said the ANC believed there was no linkage between the 
election date and mediation, while the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] argued that there was a linkage. 
  He said government's position was that the elections should 
go ahead as scheduled. 
  The mediators were due to address the media at 1PM on their 
plans. 
  IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said he was still hopeful that 
the 
mediation could go ahead. Another IFP negotiator said government 
was prepared to go back to the original terms of reference that 
did not mention the election date but that this still had to be 
cleared with the ANC. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa was due to meet the 
mediators at Thursday lunchtime. 
  However, Mr Meyer said the issue was not what document was 
used but how mediation would affect the election date. "The 
election date is fixed and we are proceeding on that basis," he 
said. 
  He said it was "very unfortunate" that the mediators had 
come 
to South Africa when there was no agreement on the terms of 
reference. He said Dr Kissinger had taken the "correct position" 
in saying that the mediation did not include negotiations on the 
election date. 
  He said the government was still prepared to involve itself 
in mediation and in other attempts to resolve problems with the 
IFP and with the Zulu king.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The international 
mediation process collapsed in disarray on Thursday [14 April] 
afternoon with the mediatiors saying they could not continue 
without agreement on the terms of reference. 
  Mediator Dr Henry Kissinger said the mediators had dropped 
everything to come to South Africa on the understanding that the 
parties had agreed to the terms of reference. "We met the 
parties but made no proposals because our mediation could begin 
only after the terms of reference had been agreed. 
  "I wish the parties all the best," Dr Kissinger told a media 
briefing. 
  The mediation collapsed in spite of intense efforts 
involving the ANC, Inkatha Freedom Party and government 
negotiators to agree on the terms of reference. 
  The dispute arose from the IFP's insistence that the 
election 
date be part of the mediation process. 
  Another mediator, former British Foreign Secretary Lord 
Carrington said the mediators had not thought that they would 
have an easy task. "The fact that it has failed fills me with 
sadness," Lord Carrington said. 
  Dr Kissinger said the mediators understood that it would be 
difficult for the parties to resolve historic differences in 
such a short period. He said the mediators had urged the parties 
to see whether they could bridge the gaps between themselves. 
  Dr Kissinger said the terms of reference had been faxed to 
him on Sunday, which reflected agreement among the parties. 
  "When we came here we found that the terms of reference had 
either been reopened or were not fully agreed as we had 
understood." 
  The mediation was to have begun on Tuesday morning. The 
seven 
mediators were now making arrangements to leave the country.

<F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- African National 
Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday [14 
April] blamed the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] for scuttling the 
international mediation process. 
  Addressing a media briefing on Thursday afternoon shortly 
after Henry Kissinger said his mediation team was packing up and 
going home, Mr Ramaphosa said the IFP had tried to use the 
mediation to have the elections postponed. 
  He said security force numbers were being increased in 
Natal/kwaZulu to implement the state of emergency that was 
imposed to ensure elections in the province. "The breakdown in 
the discussions around the terms of reference was occasioned by 
the IFP's insistence that postponement of the elections had to 
be addressed by the mediation process." 
  He said the ANC was saddened by the mediation breakdown. 
"The mediation has failed and it has failed because the parties 
could not come to agreement on the terms of reference." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said there had been a "misunderstanding" among 
the parties that had led to terms of reference being decided 
upon when there were deficiencies with these. 
  The joint ANC, IFP and government task force had attempted 
to 
address these deficiencies but its proposals had been rejected 
by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. "Chief Buthelezi's 
rejection of the timeframes clearly showed the IFP wanted the 
date of the election to be a subject of mediation," he said. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the ANC was prepared to conduct 
negotiations with the IFP before and after the elections. He 
said discussions were continuing in the joint task group about 
the future of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. But he warned that 
security force action would be stepped up. 
  He said the ANC had made a last-minute proposal to the IFP 
to 
include it in provincial elections in Natal/kwaZulu and other 
provinces. This had been rejected. 
  IFP senior negotiator Ben Ngubane warned that a political 
solution was necessary. He said the South African Defence Force 
had failed to crush the ANC. "There is no ruler in the world 
that can crush people's aspirations with brute force. The ANC 
is refusing us the opportunity and is pushing armed force as the 
solution. They are very wrong." 
  Dr Ngubane said the ANC had agreed at the highest level to 
the original terms of reference negotiated by its national 
chairman Thabo Mbeki. "We are concerned that both the ANC and 
the government in this case have negotiated in very, very bad 
faith," he said. Dr Ngubane said he regretted what had happened 
to the mediation "but we had to stand firm".

  [Text] The DP [Democratic Party] has come under attack at 
the University of the Western Cape [UWC]. The party's PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region chairman, Mr. Tony 
Leon, narrowly escaped injury after he abandoned a lunch-hour 
meeting. The SABC's cameraman, Ezra Zweli, was slightly injured 
while trying to film the event. Gerhard Grobler has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Grobler] It started off peacefully, but 
it 
soon became apparent that the large crowd would not afford Mr. 
Leon the opportunity to speak. SASCO [South African Students' 
Congress] President Nale Mashapa stepped in. He appealed for 
calm. He was followed by the university's rector, Prof. Jaques 
Gerwel, and ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member Kader 
Asmal. 
  [Asmal] Wave your flags, ask your questions, hold up your 
banners, but we must allow every voice that is entitled in the 
elections to be heard, to be heard in this university. 
  [Grobler] An uneasy calm descended over the meeting, before 
students continued to disrupt Mr. Leon's speech. The DP decided 
to call the meeting off. Mr. Leon and security men moved out of 
the building to a waiting car. They sped off. They were forced 
to reverse across an open stretch of grass with hundreds of 
students chasing them. Stones, cans, and other objects smashed 
into the car as they fled to safety. This is undoubtedly one of 
the worst instances of political intolerance that we've seen in 
the Western Cape up to now. There was a very real possibility 
that Mr. Leon could have been seriously injured. Will the DP 
return to the UWC campus for the umpteenth time to try and 
practice their democratic right? It seems unlikely. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit: "Top Communist Says SACP Is </F>
Fighting for the Soul of the ANC; `Unique Communism' Planned for 
South Africa"] 
  [Text] The struggle for "the heart and soul" of the ANC 
begins immediately after voting day. It will be a fight between 
the South African Communist Party [SACP] and anticommunists, a 
battle to influence the ANC on its future direction. This was 
said by a member of the SACP's politburo, Mr. Jeremy Cronin. 
  Mr. Cronin, widely regarded as the party's chief ideologist, 
commented in an interview with RAPPORT on the SACP's aims and 
the accusation that the SACP controls the ANC. It is not true 
that the SACP manipulates the ANC, according to Mr. Cronin. I 
can truthfully say that a struggle is looming "for the heart and 
soul" of the ANC after the election. The SACP aims to persuade 
the ANC to broadly accept and carry out the principles of 
communism so that a unique form of communism can be applied in 
South Africa. 
  "The best features of the systems adopted in the Soviet 
Union, Cuba, and Red China should be included. The ANC and the 
SACP do not differ over short term issues, but we obviously have 
a long-term socialist perspective not shared by everyone in the 
ANC. We are unashamedly in favor of communism in South Africa 
as a medium and long-term solution. The best chance of applying 
socialism is to persuade the ANC on the issue. Some of our 
opponents, however, have a different agenda. They want to 
transform the ANC into a sort of social-democratic party. This 
means that it would be difficult to distinguish between the NP 
[National Party] and the ANC's policies, the free market system 
will remain, and the main parties will take turns governing." 
  But the SACP is fighting tooth and nail so that the process 
of "democratization" does not to come to a halt, and for the ANC 
not to just accept some form of neoliberalism -- for this reason 
the struggle will be waged for the heart and soul of the ANC, 
according to Mr. Cronin. "We are standing on the eve of a very 
long and complicated struggle on the direction of change in 
South Africa. A time could arise when the alliance with the ANC 
could cost us more than it is worth and then we could take an 
independent course. There is nothing in the ANC's policy that 
the SACP wants to change, but there are worrying tendencies 
within the ANC against which we wage an open battle." 
  On calls for the ANC to distance itself from the SACP, Mr. 
Cronin says: "The alliance has frightened off some people, but 
it has attracted far more. The SACP has given the ANC 
legitimacy in its struggle, in convincing some of its supporters 
that it is not selling out to government, and in this way it has 
been able to maintain unity within the ANC." 
  Mr. Cronin emphasizes that no one should suspect the SACP of 
plotting to establish an undemocratic government in the country. 
The party is committed to a multiparty system, a human rights 
charter, an independent judiciary, free press -- all the 
characteristics of true democratic government. "We will raise 
the Red flag, but in a constitutional way." 
<H5>  Change in Stance </H5>
  "The SACP has indeed changed its stance on many issues long 
associated with communism and should get the credit it deserves. 
Social and economic problems, however, should be addressed 
through a process of democratization." This democratization 
means greater powers to workers in, among other sectors, 
industry and agriculture. It does not necessarily mean the 
nationalization of industry and the expropriation of farms, but 
could include this. He has no problem with private ownership 
rights "on a small scale" but is nevertheless in favor of 
collective farming, according to Mr. Cronin. Through, for 
example, labor legislation and pressure on financial 
institutions, farmers can also be forced to grant more 
concessions to their workers. 
  The South African Communist Party is not ashamed of the 
history of communism, even though it has "significantly" failed 
in the Eastern Bloc, and though huge faults were made under the 
banner of communism, says Mr. Cronin. "We believe that we are 
interpreting Marx more correctly that the former Soviet leaders. 
Besides, did Christians reject the Sermon on the Mount, for 
example, because apartheid was applied in the name of 
Christianity?"

<F P=106> [Report by Jono Waters] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Although things would 
not improve overnight, the benefits of a government of national 
unity would show within six months and the levels of violence 
would fall, State President F W de Klerk said on Wednesday [13 
April] evening. "Heaven won't suddenly descend on South 
Africa," Mr de Klerk told Radio Metro. He said he believed 
people's expectations were too high. 
  However, a government of national unity would focus on the 
needs of the people to improve living conditions and the 
economy. "And, I think that within six months, already show 
some results. But it won't be wonders. It will take a year, 
two years, three years, five years and with regard to some of 
the problems even longer to really reach a much more ideal 
situation." 
  He said he expected the levels of violence to fall 
"tremendously" after the elections. "After the elections much 
of the cause of much of the violence ...the strife, the high 
political tensions will come down and will be removed. And life 
will be normalised to a great extent and people will take up 
with their ordinary lives and their ordinary activities." 
  However, Mr de Klerk said he did not think South Africa 
would 
be totally free of violence "for a long time" because there were 
radical groups to the right and left who were "not happy with 
the success of peaceful change and who have their own agendas". 
  He said a government of national unity would take "strong 
steps" against perpetrators of violence. "We will have to fight 
it with everything at out disposal." 
  Asked about the right-wing setting up their own local 
government councils, Mr de Klerk said it was an interesting move 
because there was little difference between African National 
Congress civics and the right's "burgerraads" [citizen 
councils]. "They are taking a page out of the ANC's books." 
  The state president said the right-wingers were making 
political statements at the moment, but if they interfered with 
the business of the municipalities "firm action" would be taken 
against them. "If they try to usurp the powers of the 
lawfully-elected and constituted municipalities, they will get 
into trouble with the law and we will apply the law."

  [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] has indicated its 
reasons for not wanting to participate in the election on 27 
April: 
  1. According to the CP, the new constitution does not 
recognize the Holy Trinity, making other gods equal with the 
Almighty God. References to Christian values which have been 
removed from the constitution, will make South Africa a totally 
secular state. 
  2. This election is the final process of the handing over of 
power which has been initiated by the communists through war, 
terror, negotiations and peace accords. Participation in the 
communist-dominated transitional structures will tantamount to 
the recognition of all these illegal structures, and the 
participation in them by the Boer-Afrikaner nation. 
  3. If the CP participates in the election, it will be forced 
to recognize the result and other constitutional elements such 
as the flag. 
  4. The so-called amendments effected fail to bring us even a 
step closer to obtaining a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. They 
will in fact only speed up the reality of unitary state. A 
volkstaat is therefore out of the question. 
  5. The election will in no way be free and fair. Large-scale 
irregularities in the registration of voters are taking place as 
no control whatsoever exists. 
  6. The ANC-controlled SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] TV is being unashamedly exploited for propaganda by 
the National Party-ANC conspiracy. According to the CP, the 
election is nothing else but the paving of the way for the 
coming of an atheist, communist ANC government in the country. 
The CP added that the Afrikaner nation, with the traditionally 
bound Zulu nation, could never take part in the election. Those 
who participate will be associating themselves with this highly 
unacceptable situation in our fatherland.

  [Text] Pietersburg April 13 SAPA -- The Electoral Appeal 
Tribunal in Pietersburg on Wednesday [13 April] interdicted the 
African National Congress from intimidating National Party [NP] 
members or supporters in Venda and impeding NP meetings or its 
canvassing and campaigning. 
  The Appeal Tribunal sat on Wednesday after the ANC appealed 
against a decision of an electoral tribunal in Dzanani, Venda, 
on March 30 at which a formal warning and fine of R100,000 
[rands], suspended for four months, was imposed on the ANC. 
  At the time, the tribunal found that ANC members were 
responsible for disrupting a National Party meeting at the 
Makhado shopping complex in Dzanani earlier in March and had 
prevented the meeting from taking place. 
  The ANC was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Police said on 
Thursday [14 April] they fired rubber bullets and stun grenades 
into a crowd of about 150 workers planning to stage a 
demonstration in central Johannesburg, where a Zulu march last 
month ended in a bloodbath. 
  Warrant Officer Andy Pieke said police had been sent to Park 
Station to prevent crowds of marchers pouring into the city 
centre, declared an unrest area after more than 50 people died 
in gunbattles surrounding the Zulu march. The police spokesman 
said one man fleeing the bullets on Thursday was injured when he 
ran into a traffic light post and another when he smashed into a 
shop window. 
  He said several people had been arrested and police were 
still at the scene of the gathering two hours after the police 
action, "monitoring" the situation. Police dispersed the group 
minutes before 9AM. 
  W/O Pieke said the demonstrators were trade union members, 
preparing for a protest march apparently connected to wage 
demands.

  [Text] KwaZulu Chief Minister and Minister of Police 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi has expressed strong reservations about the 
deployment of the National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF]. In his 
words, Buthelezi says, I have strong reservations about the 
deployment of the NPKF where there is still alienation between 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC. He's accused members 
of the NPKF of being former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation; ANC Military Wing] operatives who had been killing his 
supporters. Buthelezi says he's told South African Police 
General Johan van der Merwe and SADF [South African Defense 
Force] chief General George Meiring he cannot spare members to 
serve on the NPKF while there is so much violence around. 
Buthelezi says there is controversy surrounding the NPKF as he 
had heard that 10 of its members had fired rockets at a hostel 
in kwaMashu outside Durban.

<F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- About 16,000 Umkhonto 
we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC military wing] soldiers 
would gather at three MK-administered assembly points in the 
Transvaal from next week, MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  About 8,000 troops were expected at Walmansthal, north of 
Pretoria, 2,500 at Bourke's Luck in the Eastern Transvaal and 
1,500 at Hoedspruit in the Western Transvaal. 
  Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Masondo 
said 
the aim of the integration process was to ensure a stable 
security force which could protect the new South Africa. 
  MK soldiers did not need any special motivation to report at 
the assembly points. "Those who want to be soldiers have no 
qualm about going to the points. As soon as a new South African 
defence force is created... MK will no longer exist," he said. 
  Mr Masondo said the 16,000 troops included expatriates. MK 
assets such as military hardware and vehicles kept in other 
countries would also become part of the new defence force. 
  MK soldiers would be trained over three to six months to 
play 
a non-partisan role in the new defence force, according to a 
code of conduct still to be finalised by the Transitional 
Executive Council. 
  MK soldiers would not have to learn new military skills, 
although they would have to adapt to different technologies. 
Training would focus on building a new attitude and culture of 
peace and progress, Mr Masondo said. 
  A new defence force commander would be determined by the new 
state president, he added. 
  MK remained committed to reconciliation and peace, he said, 
assuring communities living near the assembly points that they 
would not be threatened by the troops. "The new South Africa 
will need a new military culture... of non-racialism, equality 
for all, particularly women, as well as good relations with the 
neighbouring states," Mr Masondo said.

  [Text] Umtata April 13 SAPA -- All members of the Transkei 
Defence Force [TDF] were ready for integration and 
wholeheartedly welcomed the political changes in the territory, 
TDF head General T T Matanzima said on Wednesday [13 April]. 
Speaking at special passing out parade in Umtata, he said TDF 
members would use their professionalism and training to defend 
the transition to a free South Africa. "The primary mission of 
a new and integrated national South African Defence Force [SADF] 
will be the defence and consolidation of our democracy in South 
Africa. Once successful here we will extend this mission on a 
continental level to friendly and peaceful relations in the 
world." 
  Gen Matanzima also said that because of its limited 
resources, the TDF had been directly dependent for training on 
the SADF. He thanked the SADF for their assistance, especially 
in sophisticated technical areas. "We could have benefited more 
from these courses but the use of Afrikaans (as medium of 
instruction) did make these training projects particularly 
difficult than they otherwise could have been." 
  On Thursday the head of Transkei's Military Council, Major 
General Bantu Holomisa, will preside over a ceremonial lowering 
of the Transkei flag to symbolise the territory's 
reincorporation into South Africa.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- The Goldstone 
Commission announced it will hold a public inquiry on Friday [15 
April] into illegal purchases or attempted purchases of arms 
from the electricity supplier Eskom. The inquiry comes in the 
wake of revelations by Eskom that there had been an attempt by a 
staff member to sell arms to a dealer who intended passing them 
on to kwaZulu. "With regard to that incident, Eskom promptly 
launched an efficient and thorough investigation which has 
reached an advanced stage. The information thus far gathered 
has been made available by Eskom to the commission. It has been 
ascertained that these arms were destined for kwaZulu," 
Commission Chairman Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on 
Wednesday. "After consultation with Eskom, the commission has 
decided to hold a public inquiry into the matter on Friday, 15 
April 1994." 
  He said the inquiry will centre on any unauthorised 
purchases 
or attempted purchases from Eskom to any organisation or person 
and into their purposes. The investigation will cover the 
period from July 1, 1989 to the present time. 
  The commission has requested several parties to furnish it 
with all relevant information at their disposal at the inquiry 
on Friday. They are: Eskom; the kwaZulu government; the kwaZulu 
Police; the South African Police; the National Intelligence 
Service; J Garb and Co (PTY) LTD; Soyeh International (PTY) 
Limited; Shotgun Willies; Gintans Security; National Union of 
Mineworkers; National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa; 
Iron and Steel and Allied Industries Union and other trade 
unions; South African National Civic Organisation. 
  The inquiry will be held on the ground floor Sandpark 
Building 24 Fredman Drive, Sandton.

  [Text] A police spokesman confirmed that the police have 
investigated allegations of mercenaries from the South African 
Defense Force [SADF] being involved in military activities in 
Angola. 
  A spokesman of the SADF, Colonel John Rolf, said it was 
being 
alleged that in cases where South African soldiers were acting 
as mercenaries in violation of the defense law, justice had to 
take its course. After the police have completed their 
investigation, the attorney general will have to decide whether 
prosecution will be instituted. Col. Rolf denied that the South 
African soldiers were involved in Angola with the full knowledge 
and consent of the SADF; also that the companies responsible for 
sending soldiers to Angola, Executive Outcomes, were a front for 
the SADF. 
  The police spokesman in turn said that there has been a 
police investigation into the allegations after the commissioner 
of police had requested the investigation. According to 
reports, there are still about 500 South African soldiers in 
Angola. These soldiers are fighting on the side of the Marxist 
MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] troops.

  On the sale of state land in kwaNdebele, the sub-council 
decided that no land be disposed of unless in exceptional 
circumstances and specially not through the process being 
planned by the homeland government; that sales, when necessary, 
be transparent and based on consensus; that the process of 
township development proceed on the basis that no decision be 
taken on entitlement of occupation or ownership; and that the 
process of establishing the identities of people living on the 
land in kwaNdebele proceed on the basis that it not involve 
decisions on who will be entitled to occupation or ownership.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  `Increasingly Vociferous' Trade Unions -- "One of the first 
challenges facing an ANC-led government of national unity will 
be to deal with the increasingly vociferous public sector trade 
unions," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 14 April. "If the new regime submits to threats of 
mass action, it will not be able to fulfill its ambitious 
programme of reconstruction and development." THE STAR notes 
that now South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo "calls 
for a moratorium on strikes," and Cyril Ramaphosa, former 
general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, "urges 
similar restraint from striking workers. The irony is 
palpable." Their exhortations "contrast with their previous 
silence" when striking civil servants undermined the 
administrations "of their foes" in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and 
kwaZulu. However, as the strikes spread to "pro-ANC polities, 
Transkei and Venda, causing chaos there, the proponents of mass 
action appeal for a halt." However, "with people dying in 
hospitals paralysed by strikes," Slovo and Ramaphosa's please 
"deserve support." "They should be reminded, however, that 
dreadful consequences ensue when dragon's teeth are sown." 
  International Mediation -- A second editorial on the same 
page points out that "at the very moment that the international 
statesmen arrive to play their part," Inkatha Freedom Party 
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi calls a media conference to 
"complain about ANC and Government bullying." His arguments 
"appeared to boil down to one thing: the IFP's desire to have 
the election postponed and to use the mediation process to 
achieve this end. Has this become the IFP's chief objective?" 
The ANC and the government too "are not being entirely 
transparent in their approach to the mediation. Their tactics 
appear to have much to do with keeping a potential enemy engaged 
at the talks table and thus denying it the opportunity to engage 
in open conflict -- at least until well after the election. The 
mediators, men of high repute, have travelled a long way -- but 
they must already be wondering if they were wise to come." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  International Mediation, Buthelezi -- Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 14 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that 
two events "threaten fatally to undermine Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's claims that he is the injured party in South 
Africa's political process." "The first was his unconditional 
rejection of the ANC's offer on the status of the Zulu king made 
at the four-way summit meeting last Friday. The second occurred 
yesterday when, against recommendations of his own negotiators 
and the international mediators, he threatened to scupper the 
mediation process unless it permits discussion of the 
postponement of the election." BUSINESS DAY believes that 
postponement of the election "is simply not an option." "The 
present government has lost the ability to rule and the country 
could descend into anarchy without a legitimate authority in 
place by the end of the month." If Buthelezi chooses to use the 
election issue to block the mediation process, "it will be 
difficult to argue against those who contend that he is not 
seriously seeking a constitutional settlement compatible with 
modern democracy." The "cynical view of Buthelezi is buttressed 
by his rejection of the ANC's offer to the king. An offer to 
the king of ceremonial and traditional powers is appropriate. 
If Buthelezi is, as seems to be the case, demanding legislative 
powers for an unelected monarch, that would support those who 
believe his priority is not a settlement but perpetual crisis. 
And if Buthelezi blocks mediation using the pretext of an 
election postponement, that would confirm it." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Mediation Cannot Resolve Buthelezi-Zwelithini `Negativity' 
-- 
South African elections will take place over a little more than 
two weeks and a tragedy of epic proportions is unfolding before 
us. All the role players can see the signs but there is still 
an unwillingness, or inability, to do something about it," 
begins a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 
11 April. "South Africans should not be led to believe that the 
situation will improve on its own. This is what people thought 
about Bophuthatswana until we had the bloody outburst." "The 
situation will only improve if there is the political will to 
find a solution." "Instead of a spirit of reconciliation at 
Friday's summit at the Kruger National Park we witnessed 
confrontation." "The end of the Buthelezi government is in 
sight. If the king decides to declare war then he will be 
engaging in a futile battle which could be more catastrophic for 
his people than rule by colonial superpowers and indigenous 
white governments. It seems that a collective stupidity, no 
longer in the interests of South Africa or the Zulus, 
characterizes the Zwelithini-Buthelezi campaign. One cannot see 
how international mediation can resolve this negativity, even 
with the best will in the world." "We can only hope that every 
South African leader will wrestle with his conscience in the 
days ahead and will find the path of reconciliation and 
understanding so that a disaster can be avoided."

  [Text] The speaker of the National Assembly, Dr. J.T. 
Kolane, this morning adjourned the house until tomorrow after he 
informed the members that some members of parliament had been 
abducted by armed soldiers. Dr. Kolane said he was of the 
opinion that the members could not concentrate on debates under 
these circumstances. The speaker said he was disappointed by 
these despicable acts. Although the speaker did not mention the 
names of the members concerned, it is believed that they are the 
deputy prime minister, the Honorable Selometsi Baholo; the 
honorable minister of justice, Mr. Kelebone Maope; the minister 
of trade and industry, the Honorable Shakhane Mokhehle; the 
minister of education, the Honorable Pakalitha Mosisili; and the 
minister of natural resources, the Honorable Monyane Moleleki. 
  It is understood that the ministers were arrested at their 
homes and offices, but there have been no details of the 
circumstances of their arrests.

  [Excerpts] An ordinary session of the Council of Ministers 
was held on 12 April 1994 under the chairmanship of Prime 
Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko. [passage omitted] 
  The first point on the agenda concerned the state of 
security 
in the country from 6 to 10 April 1994, which the government 
members noted was calm. However, they stressed that the 
situation in Rwanda might have negative effects on security in 
our country. The Council of Ministers urged all those concerned 
to sit round the negotiation table. It also recommended that 
everything be done to repatriate Burundian nationals residing in 
Rwanda who wanted to come home. 
  The second point on the agenda was to evaluate the field 
visits carried out by certain government members to Kirundo, 
Bubanza, Karuzi, and Makamba provinces. The situation was 
generally calm. Kirundo was experiencing the arrival en masse of 
Rwandan refugees and of Burundians returning home. [passage 
omitted] 
  Regarding preparations for the funeral of the head of state, 
His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, and those of government 
members recently deceased, the Council noted that preparations 
were going smoothly. The Council of Ministers informed the 
public that first, the bodies of the three late officials, His 
Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, Minister Bernard Ciza, and 
Minister Cypriaque Simbizi, had reached Bujumbura; second, as 
early as today, 13 April, books of condolences will be available 
at the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation, at the 
City Hall and at St.-Michel Church; third, on 15 April a 
memorial service will be held at St.- Michel Church; fourth, 
the funerals are scheduled for Saturday, 16 April 1994 at the 
sites reserved for the martyrs of democracy. The Burundi 
Government once again calls on the population to maintain peace 
and security. This is the only way to honor the memory of our 
dead officials.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Apr (PANA) -- Economic activity has 
resumed in downtown Bujumbura, the power house of the Burundian 
economy, a week after the death of President Cyprien Ntaryamira 
in a plane explosion near Kigali, in neighboring Rwanda. 
  The resumption of activity was more marked in the informal 
sector where traders selling second hand clothes, drinks, and 
luxury clothing from Europe, America and Asia were selling. 
  In the last three days, prices of beans and rice, the 
country's staples, have dropped below the symbolic two hundred 
francs a kilo (1 U.S. dollar; 575 Burundian francs). Prices of 
these commodities had risen way above this figure after the 
assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in an attempted coup 
on 21 October 1993. 
  Red meat is too expensive for low-wage earners. A slice of 
beef steak costs up to 1,000 francs. However, fish, beans, 
maize or casava (manioc) and rice are still affordable for 
low-wage earners. 
  However, government officials said that few civil servants 
are back at work. Those who are spend much of their on the 
telephone enquiring about the safety of relatives and debating 
political situation of the country. As a result, the speaker of 
the National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, gave a public 
warning to "idle people" when he visited other parts of the 
country Sunday [10 April]. "There will be no more wages for 
people who do not work," he said. 
  The warning seems to have had its effect judging by the 
resumption of activity in various sectors of production since 
the beginning of the week. However, the education sector is 
still paralysed. Students and teachers can still be seen 
outside the Education Ministry. They are asking to be sent to 
schools in the interior of the country, where they say is safer. 
Private schools have never closed.

  [Text] Pretoria April 13 SAPA -- Government, African 
National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] negotiating 
teams emerged from nearly five hours of talks in Pretoria on 
Wednesday [13 April] night to say they had a new proposal to 
save the international mediation process. 
  The process broke down before it began on Wednesday morning 
when IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the terms of 
reference. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said after the 
Pretoria 
talks the IFP still wanted to engage the ANC in negotiations on 
a new date for elections. He said a change of date was 
impossible and it was not on the table for mediation. "That 
date is sacrosanct and is not the subject of mediation," Mr 
Ramaphosa said. 
  He left the talks for a meeting in Johannesburg with 
mediators Dr Henry Kissinger and Lord Peter Carrington. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the negotiators had agreed in principle on 
dividing the mediation process into two phases. The first would 
be a pre-mediation agreement and the second an agreement on the 
implementation of the results of mediation. 
  Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte said government did 
not favour changing the election date. "The very last thing we 
would want to extend is the election date," Mr Schutte said. He 
said the proposal put together by the negotiators appeared to be 
acceptable to all the parties

  [Text] The attempted international mediation between the 
South African Government and the ANC on the one hand, and Chief 
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, on the other, to bring 
the IFP into the election process has ground to a halt even 
before it has begun. The mediators -- Henry Kissinger and Lord 
Carrington -- are kicking their heels after IFP negotiators 
refused to go to the venue where the mediation talks were 
supposed to take place. Chief Buthelezi claims that the ANC has 
gone back on its word given at the weekend meeting and is 
insisting that the election dates, between April the 26th and 
April the 28th, aren't up for discussion. The whole process is 
stalled, while government, ANC, and IFP officials try to sort 
out the deadlock. On the line, Jeremy Skeet asked Chief 
Buthelezi if he held out any hope of the mediation talks getting 
off the ground. 
  [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] Well, it is difficult to be 
optimistic when people shift things around like that because 
after all the consolidated agreement or the consolidated terms 
of reference were actually something we considered because the 
ANC insisted, and we were surprised that they have brought in 
these issues now which have stalled the process we should be 
starting by now, you know, if it hadn't been for that purpose. 
So, I just hold my tongue that things will work out. I don't 
want to abandon hope, but I am just holding tongues in the hope 
that things will work out. 
  [Skeet] Now, it was Inkatha and you yourself who originally 
called for international mediators. The international mediators 
have come, but at the moment it looks as though that's broken 
down, and some people are going to blame you for this. They are 
going to say: Well, you never really wanted to take part in the 
elections. 
  [Buthelezi] Blaming for what? I am not surprised, Mr. Skeet, 
that you are asking me this question because the BBC is also in 
that game of trying to heap blame on me. I don't think that I 
could have been more explicit than I have been even now to say 
that even now my delegation is waiting to go to the venue. Now, 
you are putting that question precisely because you are putting 
in the minds of listeners that we are to blame for this when 
actually the thing has been stalled by the ANC. 
  [Skeet] Okay, let me ask you another question chief 
minister. 
What needs to be done by the government and the ANC to bring you 
on board in these elections? 
  [Buthelezi] But surely it (?wasn't a) matter for mediation 
now, because there was a deadlock. What more can I say than 
that? Because we asked for a mediation in the first place 
precisely because there is a deadlock. I don't think that I 
have any thing to contribute to that question more than that. 
  [Skeet] But now with the mediation effort apparently failed, 
does that mean that Inkatha will definitely not take part in the 
elections? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, as far as I am concerned it has not 
failed. 
I have told you very explicitly in clear terms that we are 
waiting to hear now what happens at the meeting in which the 
IFP, the government, and the ANC are participating at this 
moment as you are talking to me. 
  [Skeet] But so, if nothing comes out of this meeting this 
afternoon, that is it as far as you are concerned? 
  [Buthelezi] No, that is a decision you are asking me to 
take. 
Fortunately, I don't take decisions like that. It will be the 
IFP Central Committee that will take decisions if that happens, 
and even now I have not abandoned hope that this thing can be 
sorted out. 
  [Skeet] You say that you haven't abandoned hope, but [words 
indistinct] an outside observer it looks as though there is no 
hope in South Africa at the moment. There is a lot of killing 
going on in Natal. 
  [Buthelezi] You are entitled to your opinion, of course, on 
that. I mean, I don't begrudge you that, Mr. Skeet. You are 
quite entitled to make that conclusion, but it isn't necessarily 
mine. 
  [Skeet] How do you think you can help stop the killing that 
is going on daily in Natal and kwaZulu? 
  [Buthelezi] How can Major stop the killing that goes on with 
the IRA there? 
  [Skeet] But people ask him that question. I am asking you, 
how do you think you can help in bringing about peace in 
Natal-kwaZulu? 
  [Buthelezi] We have just been discussing at length with me 
the fact that the deplorable problems of this country have not 
been resolved. As long as those problems are not resolved, I 
don't think I have a magic wand to stop, you know, what is going 
on, which has been going on for 10 years. You should know from 
your library or cuttings which you have in your library that the 
peace accord which was signed in this country in which Mr. 
Mandela, Mr. de Klerk, and myself, and other leaders signed, and 
that my people, IFP, have been involved in the peace committees, 
but a few days ago, right here where I am in the Reef, one of 
the leaders was shot by the members of the South African Defense 
Force, you know. But in spite of that we have not withdrawn 
from the structures which are trying to bring about peace. [end

  [Text] Nairobi, April 14 (AFP) -- Somali warlord Mohamed 
Farah Aidid's faction has seized control of the town of Merca, 
south of Mogadishu, a United Nations official in Nairobi said 
Thursday [14 April]. 
  Fighters of General Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) 
took over the town, 75 kilometres (45 miles) from Mogadishu, on 
Tuesday, said Huntley Anderson, a UN spokesman in Nairobi. 
  Merca had been rocked by weeks of clashes between SNA 
militiamen and fighters of a rival faction, the Southern Somali 
National Movement (SSNM) which formerly controlled Merca. 
  The two groups had been allies until they fell out during 
UN-sponsored peace talks in the Kenyan capital Nairobi last 
month. 
  The SSNM then joined the Group of 12 factions led by Aidid's 
chief enemy, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
  Anderson said the UN had evacuated its four international 
staffers from Merca to Mogadishu this week. 
  Details of the fighting in Merca and the number of 
casualties 
were unknown.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)-- The Egyptian force taking 
part in the UN peacekeeping forces in Somalia checked an 
offensive by an armed Somali group against a UN ammunition depot 
southwest of Mogadishu airport on 12 April. 
  An official military source today stated that the Egyptian 
force fired warning shots to deter the attackers. To deter the 
repeated attempts against the depot, it had to surround the 
group members and engaged them in a 35-minute clash, after which 
they surrendered. 
  The source added that the Egyptian force turned the group 
members, who numbered 19, over to the Somali police, adding that 
the Egyptian force sustained no losses. 
  Defense and War Production Minister Field Marshal Muhammad 
Husayn Tantawi thanked the commander, officers, and soldiers of 
the Egyptian force in Somalia for their vigilance and good 
performance. 
  The UN commander in Somalia also thanked the Egyptian force 
for its distinguished performance in frustrating an attempt to 
seize the UN ammunition.

  [Text] Jean-Bedel Bokassa this morning appeared before the 
Bangui district court, which recently authorized the Central 
African Republic [CAR] state to file a civil and commercial suit 
against him. Hearing was adjourned to a later date. In fact, 
this case is a continuation of the lawsuit brought against him 
in 1987 for money owed to the state and another by parties 
claiming damages. 
  In an interview with CAR radio today, the former CAR emperor 
said the money for which he is being prosecuted was used in 
building the 500-room Hotel Intercontinental, a white elephant 
situated right in the middle of Bangui's residential district. 
According to CAR State Attorney Jean Ngandou, following his 
death sentence in 1987, Bokassa was asked to pay a fine of 6 
million CFA francs to the parties claiming damages while the CAR 
state was authorized to confiscate his property to the tune of 
3,143,473,300 CFA francs. 
  During the same interview, the former CAR emperor talked 
about the running of the country, which he said has been 
destroyed. He said it was ruined by President David Dacko, whom 
he held responsible for Barthelemy Boganda's death. He also 
accused former President Kolingba and French Colonel Jean-Claude 
Masson of assassinating Boganda's son, Bertrand Salate. Bokassa 
thereby confirms these allegations.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Calm has returned this 
morning to the eastern Brazzaville industrial district of Mpila, 
where a brief clash occurred yesterday between opposition 
supporters and security forces. Traffic has resumed in the 
area, where businesses had remained closed yesterday because of 
the prevailing tension after an exchange of gunfire. No 
gunshots have been heard by journalists. This return to 
normalcy follows President Pascal Lissouba's message warning all 
Army and police officers against any act that "would jeopardize 
the peace process and the security of people and property." 
  Former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's supporters are 
opposed to the deployment of security forces in the district, 
fearing that this could serve as a pretext to attack the 
residence of the former head of state, who has been living for 
several months now in his native village, Oyo, 600 km north of 
Brazzaville. According to the police, the security forces were 
deployed in Mpila to check the activities of armed robbers, who 
have been attacking goods trains.

announced today that Paulin Ayina, the chief treasurer of Congo 
(director of the Treasury), was dismissed yesterday by Prime 
Minister Jacques Joachim Yhombi Opango. 
  He was replaced by a principal inspector of the Treasury, 
Mampassi Tsika, the radio added, without giving the reasons for 
the dismissal. 
  A senior civil servant close to the Congolese Presidency 
told 
AFP that the government accused Mr. Ayina of the "centralization 
of power and an absence of transparency in his activities." 
  The public treasury collects about 7 billion CFA francs (70 
million French francs) every month, representing regular income 
and oil royalties for the Congo. 
  Several trade unions have recently denounced the poor 
management of state incomes and the abusive expenses of public 
treasury funds.

  [Text] Libreville, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Gabon's main opposition 
leader Father Paul Mba Abessole returned to Libreville this 
morning after over a month's visit to Paris. Father Abessole 
left Gabon after last February's disturbances which led to nine 
deaths. The National Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] party leader was 
welcomed by about 100 enthusiastic RNB supporters on arrival at 
Libreville Airport where policemen had taken position. Father 
Abessole made no statement on arrival. 
  The opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March 
officially to "rest and to contact his friends," an opposition 
spokesman announced. His departure followed four days of 
violent disturbances, from 21 to 24 February, in several parts 
of Libreville's residential districts during which nine persons, 
including two soldiers, were killed, according to an official 
report. The government had accused Father Mba Abessole and his 
party of being responsible for the disturbances that had flared 
up following a strike called by a labor union close to the 
opposition. During the disturbances, security forces had, 
notably, stormed the opposition leader's residence in Libreville 
in his absence. The state of alert which banned demonstrations 
and a curfew were reimposed following the disturbances. The 
state of alert was lifted on 8 April.

  [Text] The killing of innocent people in Kigali by MRND 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] 
youthwingers and Presidential Guards continues. In commune 
Bicyumbi, Kigali Prefecture, 350 people have been killed. The 
organizer is the chief of commune Bicyumbi, Mr. Juvenal 
Rugambarara. Yesterday, Chief Rugambarara killed 200 people who 
had taken refuge in a missionary station at a place called 
(Mushya). (Mushya) is in Commune Gikoro, which the neighboring 
commune [word indistinct]. Mr. Rugambarara has said that he has 
[words indistinct] deal with, after which he will move to 
neighboring communes. 
  The Presidential Guards and the MRND youthwingers are 
conducting killings in other prefectures of Rwanda, notably 
Cyangugu and Gisenyi. These killings should be stopped before 
anybody can talk about a cease-fire between the Rwandese 
Patriotic Front and those killing the innocent people. Those 
calling for a cease-fire, either they are not willing or unable 
to stop the killing of innocent people in Rwanda. A cease-fire 
is not therefore a solution. The only option is to arrest the 
killers and restore law and order in the country.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Kigali Airport was 
shelled Thursday [14 April] and Belgium decided to withdraw its 
peacekeepers as Rwanda's rebels and military were to open talks 
on restoring order after a week of ethnic slaughter and chaos. 
Two salvoes of mortar shells were fired at the airport as 
Belgian and French paratroopers prepared to leave, but there 
were no casualties or damage, a Belgian Defence Ministry 
spokesman said in Brussels. 
  Guerrillas of the Front, dominated by the minority Tutsi 
tribe, meanwhile continued battling government troops, mostly 
from the majority Hutu group, for control of the blood-steeped 
capital Kigali. It was unclear who was responsible for the 
shelling of the airport, but the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front 
(RPF) on Tuesday gave foreign forces 24 hours to leave the 
airport or face attacks. "This is a serious incident which 
endangers the evacuation of foreigners," the Belgian spokesman 
said. 
  The rebels and government forces accused each other of 
attacking the airport. A senior government officer told AFP the 
RPF had set up mortars on a hill overlooking the airport, where 
he said the government had troops stationed. He also said his 
troops were currently battling rebels for control of a fuel 
depot about three kilometers (two miles) from the city centre. 
"The depot is strategic, we must maintain control of it or 
we'll be strangled," he said. 
  Rebel commanders were to meet government military officers 
to 
discuss ways of ending the bloodletting that has claimed 20,000 
lives since the deaths of Rwanda's and neighbouring Burundi's 
presidents last week. The senior Army officer said the talks, 
to be held under UN-control, would go ahead despite renewed 
fighting between the two sides, but the meeting had not begun as 
of 2:00 P.M. (1200 GMT). [passage omitted] 
  The rolling green hills on the outskirts of Kigali echoed 
with artillery and small arms fire Thursday. But there was no 
sign of a breakthrough by the rebels, who have announced that 
they will soon win control of the body-strewn capital, and 
military sources said government forces were trying to retake a 
rebel-held area. 
  Meanwhile the rebels reinforced their positions in Kigali 
and 
remained in control of an eastern area which they have held for 
the past six days. The rebels failed to capture a Gendarmerie 
base in northern Kigali on Wednesday, sources said here. 
  Wednesday's announcement by the UN Security Council that the 
rebels and government forces were to open talks was hailed as 
"the first glimmer of hope" by government radio on Thursday. 
The Front had earlier refused to negotiate with the government 
and had rejected its truce offers. 
  Rebel radio said Thursday that the talks would not be about 
a 
ceasefire but about uniting against the "clique of killers" 
which it blamed for the bloodshed. 
  The two sides were to meet at the UN headquarters here at 
the 
Amahoro Hotel in eastern Kigali. 
  UN chief in Rwanda, General Romeo Dallaire, said the meeting 
would be a chance for the warring parties to talk face-to-face, 
but stressed that it was probably too early to open ceasefire 
negotiations. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Instead of a truce, the noose is tightening 
round the criminals, especially in the capital, where people are 
fleeing the fighting en masse and also because they are 
expecting a final assault to take place soon after the departure 
of all [foreign] nationals and UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda] Blue Berets. Indeed, many people have already left the 
capital in a hurry. [passage omitted] 
  Other people who have fled have done so because of fears 
that 
they will have to account for the atrocities committed against 
innocent people. In this regard, those who were involved in 
organizing the events have cleared off with their families. For 
instance, reports say that 200 people are stuck at Bujumbura 
international airport waiting to be evacuated to France. They 
have asked France to grant them asylum. Burundi gave them 36 
hours to allow France to decide their case. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Heavy fighting took place last night in the 
Rwandan capital, Kigali. [passage omitted] The situation is 
confused. Some parts of the city are in the hands of government 
troops, others in the hands of the rebel Patriotic Front or 
civilian militias. 
  Yesterday afternoon more foreigners were evacuated from 
Kigali. They were about a dozen Belgian journalists and around a 
dozen other foreigners. They were flown to Nairobi. Two 
hundred Belgian paratroopers also left. Another dozen or so 
Belgian journalists are still in Kigali. This morning flights 
were delayed by mist. [passage omitted] 
  The Belgian troops under the United Nations have gathered at 
the airport, awaiting a decision from the United Nations 
Security Council and the government to withdraw. 
  Information has also been received of the death of around 30 
Rwandan Red Cross workers and seven UNICEF staff. [passage 
omitted] Supporters of the killed president, Habyarimana, have 
also perpetrated a massacre in a church not far from Kigali. 
Almost 1,200 people were murdered. The majority were children.

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
radio station has warned that, after midnight, foreign troops or 
aircraft entering the country are likely to be considered as 
hostile. [passage omitted] 
  In the streets of Kigali there is already talk of trench 
warfare, something seen on the front line by Jean Helene: 
  [Helene] Boulevard Umugamba has become a veritable front 
line: 200 meters from the airport, controlled by the government 
army, is the RPF's first barrier, and from this point on, along 
the lower lefthand side of the boulevard, runs a very long 
trench holding several dozen RPF fighters, who have positioned 
heavy machine guns in firing positions at regular intervals 
along it. Even when escorted by UN vehicles you must not hang 
about here, because bullets sometimes whistle past all around 
you. On the left is the former rebels' billet, which today is 
the core of the pocket of resistance taken by the RPF in the 
northeast section of the capital. To the right, just below the 
hill, extends a vast no-man's land, where its commandos venture 
out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Some soldiers are removing their military uniforms 
and hiding among Rwandan refugees in Uganda. They are hiding 
among refugees. It is understandable for one to take refuge, 
especially if one does not want to assist the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] combatants in fighting the war. However, it is not 
understable for one to take refuge and hide one's identity. How 
would one know there is no other objective? 
  Why do the soldiers want to hide among civilians? We have 
spoken on several occasions about the mistreatment of people in 
our country. Enemies hide where civilians are taking refuge and 
then start killing them. There is that possibility. 
  Let us hope that the government forces who are fleeing and 
hiding do not have such plans. They should not try to hide. 
They should wear their military uniforms while in hiding. 
There is war so they can flee but they should present 
themselves to the Ugandan authorities who will show them where 
to stay. They should not stay in the country disguised as 
civilians. It is better for them to identify themselves rather 
than to disguise themselves.

  [Text] Foreign radio stations said this morning that talks 
have been planned between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and 
another side. Some have been misled to say that the RPF might 
meet the government. Which government? Major General Romeo 
Dallaire for his part said on BBC radio that the talks will be 
between soldiers at the front and troop commanders at the front. 
He added that the talks are low level. Maj. Gen. Dallaire did 
not say what the aim of the talks is. 
  There are two things which must be explained: Which people 
will the RPF meet and what is the aim of the talks? We refer 
here to those who may wrongly think that the talks concern a 
cease-fire. Going back to the first point, who will the RPF talk 
to? There are soldiers who have dissociated themselves from the 
clique of killers. These soldiers, in addition to meeting the 
RPF, even said they could work together with the RPF to plan how 
to get rid of the clique of killers. On the other side, there 
are soldiers and politicians who are part of the clique, for 
example government members. They cannot all hold talks with the 
RPF. The clique is the one which kills; it is the one the RPF 
is fighting, and the RPF will only relax once it has saved 
Rwandans from it. Therefore those who can meet the RPF and who 
can work with it are the ones who have distanced themselves from 
the clique. 
  Even the talks would not be aimed at stopping the war. The 
talks would rather be aimed at removing the case for resuming 
the war. The reason for resuming war is that the Presidential 
Guards continue to kill innocent people, and the Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development militia continue 
to bereave the country in all corners. There are people like 
Rugambarara from (Bicyumbi) commune who have massacred people. 
Therefore the talks would be aimed at restoring peace to the 
country. 
  This is one of the reasons why the RPF has resumed fighting. 
To restore peace in the country means annihilating the killers; 
to defeat the enemies of peace means continuing the fight until 
they are defeated. So, even if the talks took place, they would 
not be about a cease-fire but rather to form a coalition to 
fight the enemies of peace so that they are completely defeated. 
That means that they would be held between the RPF and those 
who have distanced themselves from the clique. We have always 
said that soldiers who really believe they are Rwandan soldiers 
should distance themselves from the clique of presidential 
guards and work together with the RPF. Many of these soldiers 
have always distanced themselves from the clique. They should 
show their courage and love for the motherland by officially 
declaring that they are with the RPF. Rwandans will thank them 
for that.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Faustin Twagiramungu, prime </F>
minister-designate and president of the Republican Democratic 
Movement on 13 April; place not given] 
  [Excerpts] Members of Republican Democratic Movement [MDR] 
and Rwandans. Peace be with you and continue to trust God, as 
the truth will finally win out. Rwandans, the death of His 
Excellency President Juvenal Habyarimana has not yet been 
explained. Some continue to say, without evidence, that he was 
killed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], while others are 
saying that enemies of the country were responsible. Let us 
hope that the truth will finally be known. [passage omitted] 
  How can we hold talks with the people who killed Prime 
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was the president of the MDR 
in Butare, who was the people's mother, an intellectual, a 
nationalist? How can we hold talks with these killers? How can 
we hold talks with the murderers of Frederic Nzamurambaho, the 
minister of agriculture and livestock and the national president 
of the Social Democratic Party, a father of all who was a 
peace-loving person. How can we hold talks with those who 
killed Felicien Ngango, the first vice president of Christian 
Democratic Party [PDC] at the national level, an intellectual, 
and a Rwandan who knew the law. [passage omitted] 
  We shall never hold talks with those who killed Faustin 
Nucogoza, who was the minister of information and president of 
the MDR in Byumba. He was a fearless man who loved democracy. 
All those who were killed joined others who were killed earlier 
by those murderers. They took the lives of Mayuya, Gapyisi, 
Gatabazi and others. The killings show and identify who is 
Rwanda's enemy. 
  The ethnic war that the killers wanted to launch in the 
country is not acceptable to us. Were all the above-mentioned 
people who died killed by Tutsis? One cannot say that the RPF 
waged a war because of the killings. We should understand and 
explain to the people that the RPF did not attack, but came to 
the rescue of the people to stop the killers from shedding blood.

  [Excerpt] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are 
continuing with their armed fight against elements of the 
Presidential Guard, as well as government soldiers who decided 
to join the criminals. The fighting is centered in the capital, 
where the Presidential Guard continues to massacre innocent 
people, after being prompted by the pretext of President 
Habyarimana's death in an plane crash. 
  The information broadcast this morning by several foreign 
radio stations and on Kigali radio concerning truce negotiations 
between the RPF and the transitional government put in place by 
those who organized the massacres is baseless. (Jean-Baptiste 
Kades) has this report: 
  [(Kades)] Yes, [words indistinct] since this morning, 
several 
international news media have reported that the RPF agreed to 
meet the self-proclaimed authorities in Kigali, in order to 
discuss a possible cease-fire. The RPF insists on informing 
Rwandan and international opinion that this information is 
baseless. There is no question of the RPF holding any 
negotiations whatsoever with this pseudo-government while the 
killers working for certain government members now based in 
Gitarama continue to kill all over the country. 
  We repeat: There will be no dealings whatsoever between the 
RPF and this government. The only consultations which have 
taken place in Kigali are, to the best of our knowledge, between 
the executive committees of political parties involved in the 
Arusha peace agreements. The members of these executive 
committees, or at least those of them who have escaped the 
massacres organized by the Presidential Guards, the Coalition 
for the Defense of the Republic [words indistinct] of the 
Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, met 
today in Kigali to discuss the situation now prevailing in the 
country. This has nothing to do with any form of cease-fire.

issued on 10th April 1994, we informed you that since the death 
of the president many innocent people have been killed by 
Presidential Guards, some elements of the Army and MRND-CDR 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth 
wingers, who have been trained and armed with military 
equipment. [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
took an irreversible step to fight this group of people, and the 
RPF calls upon government and the entire Rwandese population who 
are not in the clique to join hands so as to accomplish this 
task. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: Since the RPF decided on 8th April 
1994 to take up arms and stop these acts of murder and terror, 
the Rwandese people welcomed the act and have been cooperative 
in places where our soldiers passed on their way to Kigali. 
Peace-loving government soldiers who were against shedding 
blood of innocent people have also disassociated themselves from 
the killers. These killers are the ones who have denied the 
democratic process our country has been prepared to take based 
on the Arusha peace agreement. I am pleased to inform you that 
at this particular moment, the Rwandese Patriotic Army soldiers 
are already in Kigali fighting with the clique of government 
soldiers who are continuing to kill innocent people. Countrymen 
and peace-loving soldiers: Let us come together and pursue 
those murderers and we shall defeat them within a short time. 
  Let me take this opportunity to request the youth who are 
involved in these acts, be they in government forces or MRND-CDR 
youth wingers, (Inyeuhamwe) and (Imhuzamugambi), [as heard] to 
stop killing innocent people. Let me also remind you that the 
people who deplored you to do such acts are already running out 
of the country and the so-called government Sindikubgwabo and 
Kambanda [as heard] is in a state of confusion with no direction 
of where to go. We request the military commanders, leaders in 
prefectures and communes, religious leaders to disassociate 
themselves with this clique of murderers. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen: I request you not to listen to bad 
elements who scare that the RPF is your enemy. I cannot repeat 
the lies broadcast by radio (RTLM) and Radio Rwanda, together 
with MRND and CDR cohorts. The days for such lies meant for a 
resumption of hostilities are numbered. Our objective is to 
defend the Rwandese people by stopping such wanton killings in 
our country. We request for your cooperation so that we can 
achieve our objective within the shortest time possible. I once 
again thank all those who are assisting the RPF in this war we 
are fighting so as to completely eliminate dictatorship from our 
country. I request all of us to be together in sorrow in these 
bad days we are (?existing). Victory is certain. Thank you. 
Signed by the RPF chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.

  [Text] Rwanda is enduring a wait. The capital, Kigali, is 
waiting to see one of the two sides gain the upper hand. It 
does not appear that the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] have taken complete control of the town. So far, they 
have dug trenches along a frontline in the center of town. This 
morning, the government radio called on the people to mobilize 
against those who want to take power, I quote. 
  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda is 
continuing 
its contacts with the warring sides to attempt to get them to 
meet. Meanwhile, the French and Belgian paratroopers are waiting 
for a period of calm at the airport in order to be able to 
repatriate their nationals. 
  The International Committee of the Red Cross has announced 
that it has lost 30 employees; as for UNICEF, it has lost 7 of 
its employees.

  [Text] In line with the implementation of UN Security 
Council Resolution 872 of 5 October 1993 under which the council 
established the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], our 
country, Togo, was requested by the United Nations to send two 
contingents to Rwanda. The first contingent comprising military 
observers has been operating in Rwanda since December 1993. The 
second detachment meant for the UN civil police has been on 
mission in Rwanda since January. The Togolese Armed Forces High 
Command is in permanent contact with UN and UNAMIR officials. 
  Following the recent painful events in Rwanda following the 
assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, the 
United Nations has taken measures to ensure the security of all 
UNAMIR contingents. At the moment, we can assert that the 
situation of our detachments in Rwanda does not give cause for 
concern.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] Belgium has been the major single donor to 
Rwanda, granting Rwanda about 5 billion Rwandese francs 
annually. Despite all this, the Kigali dictatorship, made up of 
MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development], members of the current so-called government, left 
no stone unturned in portraying Belgium an enemy of Rwanda. 
This was done deliberately and thoroughly through the MRND-CDR 
[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] radio, RTLM [Radio 
Television Libre des Milles Collines], through MRND-CDR 
newspapers, through MRND-CDR public rallies and conferences. 
The Belgians were labelled pro-RPF even before their troops 
stepped into the capital, Kigali. The MRND-CDR had labelled the 
Neutral Military Observer Group [NMOG] commanded by Tanzanian 
General Hashim Mbita as pro-RPF. The MRND- CDR has labelled 
NMOG II, commanded by Nigerian General Opaleye, as pro-RPF too. 
It therefore came as no surprise when MRND-CDR labeled UNAMIR 
[UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], commanded by Canadian General 
Romeo Dallaire, as pro-RPF, and more specifically the Belgian 
contingent in the UNAMIR. 
  The MRND-CDR radio embarked on a deliberate campaign to 
tarnish the Belgian troops, preparing the Rwandese people for 
what the Presidential Guards and elements of the government army 
had all along been planning to do, that is, to scare away the UN 
troops and derail the peace process completely. Notwithstanding 
the campaign by RTLM and the MRND-CDR leaders, the Belgian 
troops in Rwanda performed their duties even-handedly. This did 
not please the MRND-CDR, who, as a final blow, unleashed the 
notorious Presidential Guards to cold-bloodedly kill 10 Belgian 
Blue Berets, together with the late Rwandese Prime Minister Mrs. 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her family. Even after these 
murderous acts were committed, Radio RTLM continues to fan 
disaffection on the Belgian troops and the Presidential Guards 
continue their attacks on Belgian troops in Rwanda. 
  Though the Belgians are leaving, there are questions that 
arise: 1) Should MRND-CDR, the Presidential Guard and the RTLM 
go unpunished for their murderous crimes against the Rwandese 
people, the UN and Belgium? 2) Should the Bangladesh, the 
Ghanaians, the rest of the current Blue Berets and any other 
international effort suffer the same fate as the Belgians did at 
the hands of MRND-CDR, Presidential Guards and the RTLM ? 3) How 
many UN resolutions ought to be made so that this clique is 
routed completely? 
  For the Rwandese Patriotic Front [RPF] the answers to all 
these questions are no. The RPF has decided to completely rout 
this murderous clique and to silence voices such as the RTLM for 
ever. The RPF together with the majority of the Rwandese people 
invites the UN, the Belgians and the international community to 
make a final resolution on Rwanda, which is to rid the Rwandese 
people of this evil clique. We join the Belgian people and the 
families of the Belgian troops who died defending peace in 
Rwanda in their mourning today.

  [Text] The United Nations says that foreign troops in 
Rwanda will be given another 24 hours to evacuate foreigners. 
The United Nations has made new agreements with the Patriotic 
Front and with government units. Previously, the Patriotic 
Front had said that the evacuation operation had to be over by 
yesterday evening. There are about five Belgian citizens left 
in Rwanda. Apart from that, there are 10 journalists at Kigali 
airport. 
  In the meantime, about 200 Belgian paratroopers have arrived 
in Kenya. In the course of the day as many other soldiers as 
possible will be withdrawn from Rwanda -- their exact number 
depends on the circumstances on the spot.

<F P=106> [Live telephone relay between Vilvoorde studio and Boudewijn </F>
Van Spilbeeck on the plane from Kigali to Nairobi] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer Verstraeten] We come back for a 
moment on the situation in Rwanda. We are in direct contact 
with our reporter Boudewijn Van Spilbeeck, who is on a plane 
that is shuttling between Kigali and Nairobi. So, Boudewijn, 
you have left the Rwandan capital. Why? Has the situation 
become too dangerous? 
  [Van Spilbeeck] Well yes, Danny. We have just landed in 
Nairobi and indeed, the situation in Kigali has become very 
tense and has made the evacuation gain momentum. This morning 
around 1030, the Rwandan troups installed two multiple rocket 
launchers [Stalin orgels] right at the entrance of the airport, 
some 150 meters from the airport building. They have fired a 
couple of rounds with these rocket launchers toward a hill a few 
kilometers away where the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] was 
located. They are very impressive rounds, up to eight rockets 
at a time. There was the risk that the RPF would return fire 
and consequently hit the airport building, the runway, or the 
planes. 
  The Belgians then warned the Rwandans that they would 
destroy 
the position if one more shot was fired by the Rwandans. The 
Rwandan soldiers did fire one more shot. The Belgians then 
fired a couple of rounds with a heavy machine gun mounted on a 
tank. Immediately thereafter the planes that could, left. One 
Belgian C-130 was ready to leave and took as many people as 
possible on board; a Spanish C- 130 stood ready and another two 
C-130s were approaching. I went on the first C-130 that skimmed 
over the military camp near the airport to avoid antiaircraft 
missiles and then suddenly went up in the sky. We could then 
see from the plane that on the way to the east thousands of 
Rwandan people, packed with their belongings, were fleeing 
Kigali. 
  [Verstraeten] They are running because the rebel army is in 
town and the battle with the Rwandan Army can burst out any 
moment. 
  [Van Spilbeeck] Yes, Danny. The situation in town has 
become untenable for many people. The RPF continues to close in 
from the north, along the east side of the town, toward the 
south. The RPF has already taken positions in the southwest of 
the old city, by which the Rwandan army in town is becoming more 
encircled. 
  Also the fact that the lines of the Rwandan army had 
retreated just up to the airport building is a sign that the 
rebel army is marching in. 
  [Verstraeten] The Belgian Government, Boudewijn, was in a 
meeting the past couple of hours on the fate of our Belgian Blue 
Helmets in Rwanda, but we don't know what the results are. The 
United Nations in New York seems to be waiting with its 
decision. How are these people doing in Kigali right now? 
  [Van Spilbeeck] Let me explain that there are actually two 
kinds of Belgians soldiers, that is the ones wearing a blue 
helmet, from the UNAMIR peacekeeping force and the Belgians who 
left recently, our paratroopers. The Belgian paratroopers are 
trying to evacuate everything on the double. They needed 
another six flights and it could be completed today. But 
Colonel Roman from the brigade paratroopers, who is in charge of 
this operation, has said that he can only leave the airport if 
it can be secured completely and be controlled by the UN 
peacekeeping force. 
  Obviously, the airport is the key location in Kigali and he 
wants to avoid at any price that the airport be taken by either 
the RPF or the Rwandan army. He said that he will not withdraw 
his last troops before the Blue Helmets take over control of the 
airport. 
  The Belgian Blue Helmets detachment has already taken 
positions all around the runway and the airport buildings, and 
Bengali Blue Helmets have now arrived as reinforcement. 
  In the next phase, the Bengali and possibly other troops 
will 
control the airport, and then the Belgian detachment can start 
withdrawing, provided the United Nations in New York has made a 
decision. 
  This morning I have been talking to Colonel Marchal, the 
commander of the Blue Helmets for the Kigali sector, and he 
suspected that the withdrawal, once the signal has been given by 
New York, obviously, could take between two and seven days.

  [Excerpts] All Belgian citizens who wanted to leave Rwanda 
have left that country. So the evacuation operation is over. 
This morning the situation was very dangerous at Kigali 
airport. Because of confrontations between the government army 
and the rebels, foreign troops, too, were jeopardized. The 
Rwandan army pounded the rebels with heavy artillery. A shell 
fired by the rebels exploded at the airport. There were no 
casulties. 
  The blue helmets have demanded that firing should cease and 
have fired warning shots. 
  The withdrawal of the Belgian paras is meantime being 
continued at a higher rate. [passage omitted] 
  But from Kigali we have received the report that the blue 
helmets, too, have permission to leave as quickly as possible. 
For the time being, the Defense Ministry in Brussels is unable 
to confirm this.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, April 14 (AFP) -- The Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU) on Thursday [14 April] called for an 
immediate end to the "senseless violence" in Rwanda to enable 
relief and medical assistance to reach the wounded and refugees 
displaced by the ethnic bloodshed. 
  In a statement, issued after a meeting of its Central Organ 
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, 
the OAU urged the international community to provide increased 
resources to cater for the urgent humanitarian needs of the 
Rwandan people. 
  It also called for an immediate start to negotiations 
between 
government forces and Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels, 
scheduled for Thursday, which would "lead to the establishment, 
without delay, of transitional institutions as provided for 
under the Arusha peace agreement" of August last year. 
  The OAU reaffirmed that the Arusha Accord remained the only 
viable framework for the resolution of the Rwandan conflict and 
served as the basis for peace, national unity and reconciliation 
in the country. 
  It appealed for continued involvement of the United Nations, 
including the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) as an 
essential element in the restoration of peace in the country and 
the implementation of the Arusha peace agreement. 
  "We are conscious of the security and humanitarian 
implications of events in Rwanda for the sub-region", the 
statement said, appealing to the UN Security Council 
representatives in the region and Tanzanian President Ali Hassan 
Mwinyi to persevere and intensify their ongoing efforts to bring 
peace to Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi.

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks continue to be a source of 
hope concerning the peace the Angolan people so desire. The 
expected government-National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] meeting has not taken place yet, but the process 
has not halted. Manuel da Conceicao, our correspondent in 
Lusaka, reports: 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] Angola is increasingly close to 
peace. Of the 10 points on the agenda of the Lusaka peace talks 
[words indistinct] eight have already been dealt with. Only the 
discussion of two points must still be concluded: national 
reconciliation, providing for UNITA's participation in the

meaning holding the second round of presidential elections. 
Those are two sensitive, rather than delicate, issues. 
  Today, the government, UNITA, the observers, and the 
mediators held a working meeting with (Peter Hatchet), UN 
assistant secretary for humanitarian aid, who will be visiting 
Angola as 15 April. The meeting focused on aid to be given 
Angola (?by the international community) [words indistinct]

  [Text] In Cuanza Norte the Luanda government is trying to 
storm N'Dalatando. Our correspondent Morais Abel reports: 
  In a vain attempt to cross Lucala 2 River, a number of 
clashes have taken place, particularly one in which the enemy 
lost a number of senior officers, including Colonel Chico Cuma, 
chief of the General Staff of the 45th Regiment, Lieutenant 
Colonel Neto, commander of that regiment's 1st Battalion, and a 
captain in charge of the tank company. 
  Two battalions of special forces, which the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] regards as the most powerful 
units involved in the ongoing offensive, have been put to 
flight. The two battalions suffered (?17) killed, including a 
lieutenant and three noncommissioned officers. Our forces 
captured 14 AK47's, and assorted ammunition. Noncommissioned 
officer Carlos Antonio Congumi, a member of the Luanda garrison 
command and born in Cuanza Sul, was taken prisoner during a 
clash. He revealed secret information which has helped Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola combatants in their 
defensive operations [words indistinct] on the Luanda-Dondo and 
Dondo-Dange-ia-Menha roads, which are used as supply lines for 
the MPLA. 
  Enemy commanders and soldiers have become frustrated in view 
of systematic desertions and embezzlement of supplies [words 
indistinct]. On 10 April 87 members of the operational 
commandos fled, one of whom was captured by our forces. The 
others headed to their homes.

  [Text] On 12 April Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft bombed Quirima in yet 
another attack on the armed forces of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for having tightened their 
siege on (?Malange) to ensure the success of relief operations. 
A source with the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] says the bombing was carried out at 
1045, resulting in two dead and four seriously wounded. The 
dead include 78-year-old Antonio Jose Capando and a two-year-old 
child. 
  Meanwhile, clashes were reported in Bie yesterday. It all 
began when an MPLA-PT air force plane overflew UNITA defense 
lines and parachuted lethal equipment. Military sources say 
that once government troops realized that the supplies had 
fallen beyond their positions, they used force to try to break 
through UNITA lines. 
  FALA forces stationed in Bie are instructed not to react to 
any provocation, but had to take action in view of the threat 
posed by the advancing troops of Brigadier Simeone. Fire was 
exchanged for over three hours. The government army suffered at 
least 15 killed and an unspecified number of wounded. 
  It is believed that a number of civilians have been killed 
because of clashes in a residential area. FALA's command in the 
city of Bie regret the occurrence and has warned Luanda to 
desist from overflying the city of Bie with its air force. 
Today the situation returned to normal and the residents were 
able to go about their lives.

  [Text] Prospects of violence are so great in South Africa 
that it is making hundreds of white people in South Africa flee 
across the border into the neighboring states of Zimbabwe, 
Namibia, Swaziland, and Botswana. However, as Derek James now 
reports from Gaborone, the locals of Botswana have also been 
making their own panic moves. 
  [Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South 
Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace. 
Already stories abound and are confirmed by top Bank of 
Botswana officials of large amounts of South African rands being 
handed over to banks here. Monday's (?free) fall of the South 
African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas 
confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to 
get it out of South Africa. One such person handed over 300,000 
in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana 
bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich 
enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with 
friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are 
already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making 
temporary use of neighboring countries. 
  Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic 
drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes 
from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes, 
hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited 
supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of 
Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that 
Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8 
percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to 
affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand. 
People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned 
food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with 
food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great 
days of election and freedom approach. 
  The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries 
first, although the influx of money will be a temporary 
blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the 
outflow of cash. [end recording]

  [Text] Maseru April 14 SAPA -- Lesotho deputy prime 
minister and minister of finance, planning and manpower 
development, Mr Selometsi Baholo was shot dead by a disaffected 
unit of the Lesotho Army at his home at Ha-Matala, near Maseru 
on Thursday [14 April] morning. 
  Another four cabinet ministers are reportedly been held 
captive at the Makonyane Barracks, occupied by the disaffected 
unit of the Army. 
  According to an eyewitness armed soldiers arrived at Mr 
Baholo's house at about 5AM. 
  There were also reports of at least another cabinet minister 
killed, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reports. 
  They started shooting at about 6.30AM, when they tried to 
force their way into the house, but failed. Thereafter they 
fired bullets into the building. Mr Baholo screamed for help 
inside the house. His body was found slumped in a pool of blood 
in the kitchen. His body was only taken the Maseru mortuary on 
Thursday afternoon. 
  The Office of the Prime Minister announced on Thursday 
afternoon that army officers interviewed at Makonyane Barracks 
said there was nothing they could do about the detained 
ministers in the absence of the commander in chief of the 
Lesotho Army, a Maj-Gen Mosakeng. 
  They were informed that Gen Mosakeng had gone to the Prime 
Minister's Office, but he could not be traced there. 
  The SA [South African] Embassy in Maseru said Gen Mosakeng 
was negotiating with the disaffected army unit for the release 
of the other ministers taken captive at the Makonyane Barracks. 
An embassy spokesman said the situation appeared calm on 
Thursday afternoon.

  [Text] Maseru April 14 SAPA -- Lesotho soldiers on Thursday 
[14 April] night freed four cabinet ministers they had taken 
hostage earlier in the day, a Western diplomat said. He said 
the ministers of justice, education, natural resources and trade 
and industry had been released unharmed. They are Trade 
Minister Shakhane Robong Mokhehle, Natural Resources Minister 
Monyane Moleleki, Education Minister Bethuel Pakalitha Nosisili 
and Justice Minister Kelebone Albert Maope. 
  It was still unclear which soldiers had carried out the 
"arrests", which the diplomat said appeared to have taken senior 
military officers off guard. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo was killed earlier on 
Thursday. The diplomat said the circumstances of his death, 
which may have been accidental, remained unclear. The Lesotho 
military is understood to have an outstanding demand for a 100 
per cent pay increase. 
  Diplomats in Maseru said it appeared the military leadership 
had been caught unawares by the kidnapping by lower ranks. 
  Maseru was quiet during the day and on Thursday night. 
  Lesotho's army is understood to have an outstanding demand 
for a 100 per cent wage increase.

  [Text] The prime minister, the right honorable Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, yesterday released a statement on the current military 
crisis in the country. In his statement Dr. Mokhehle indicated 
that a contingent of the military attacked the home of the 
honorable deputy prime minister, Mr. Selometsi Baholo, during 
which attack Mr. Baholo was fatally wounded. The prime minister 
further said that four government ministers were subsequently 
abducted by this section of the army and these are the Honorable 
Monyane Moleleki, the Honorable Shakhane Mokhehle, the Honorable 
Pakalitha Mosisili, and the Honorable Kelebone Malope. 
  Dr. Mokhehle further indicated that he reported the matter 
to 
His Majesty King Letsie III and requested his majesty's 
intervention. He said that after consultations a delegation was 
sent to both military barracks with the purpose of safeguarding 
the lives of the kidnapped ministers and to try to find a 
solution to this new wave of unrest in the country. Dr. 
Mokhehle said that the Council of State under the presidency of 
his majesty, King Letsie III, also held a meeting yesterday 
afternoon to resolve this new disturbing situation. 
  While the matter was being resolved, the prime minister said 
the government received the assurance of the delegation which 
had been sent to both Makoanyane and Ha Ratjomose barracks that 
the lives of the four ministers were safe and that they had been 
released to their families and were receiving all the protection 
they required. Dr. Mokhehle conveyed his most sincere 
condolences to the widow and family of the deceased and to his 
majesty, King Letsie III, and the government and people of 
Lesotho for this great loss. 
  The prime minister concluded by appealing to the Basotho 
nation to remain calm to enable a speedy solution to the crisis.

  [Text] Maseru April 15 SAPA -- Troops from the Royal 
Defence Force occupied a stragtegic hill overlooking the Lesotho 
capital of Maseru on Friday [15 April] morning, Information and 
Broadcasting Permanent Secretary Seeiso Sarutla said. This was 
apparently a bid to stop soldiers from the Makoanyane barracks 
from coming into town. 
  It was soldiers from Makoanyane who held four cabinet 
ministers hostage on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Sello 
Metsi Baholo was shot dead in a bid by soldiers from a section 
of Lesotho's Army to storm his house, Mr Sarutla said. 
  Automatic rifle fire was heard from the hill early Friday 
morning, but Maseru was otherwise calm and residents appeared to 
be going about normal business. 
  Prime Minister Itsu Mokhehle was scheduled to address 
Lesotho's Parliament and Senate on Friday morning. 
  Mr Sarutla said Thursday's killing and kidnapping could be 
an 
attempt to separate the prime minister from his cabinet and so 
render him ineffective. He said Lesotho's one year-old 
government under the Basotho Congress Party was still looking 
for clarity on long-standing pay demands from the military, but 
was determined not to give soldiers any increases above those 
received by other civil servants.

  [Text] Maseru April 15 SAPA -- The uprising in Lesotho 
appeared to be over on Friday [15 April] and South Africans were 
advised that it was again safe to visit Maseru, SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported. South 
Africa's Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard Visser said it was no 
longer dangerous to visit the Lesotho capital, where a minister 
was shot dead and four others were kidnapped on Thursday. 
  Troops occupied a hill overlooking Maseru on Friday morning 
and sporadic rifle fire was heard, but the city was otherwise 
calm. 
  The reason for Thursday's revolt could not yet be 
determined, 
but it was reported the soldiers who took part in the 
insurrection bore a grudge against Deputy Prime Minister 
Selometsi Baholo, who was killed on Thursday, and Justice 
Minister Kelebone Maope. 
  The two ministers earlier this year took part in talks at 
which rationalisation of the Lesotho Defence Force was 
recommended.

<F P=106> [Interview with South African Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard </F>
Visser by Andre Jordan in Maseru on 15 April; from the 
"Newsbrief" program -- first paragraph is announcer's 
introduction] 
  [Text] A day after the events in Lesotho which resulted in 
the death of the deputy prime minister, many questions remain 
unanswered. Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA] 
ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it 
would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup 
attempt. 
  [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so, 
I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could 
have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of 
the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister 
was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a 
coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already 
mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African 
Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] 
that South Africa will not recognize any other government in 
Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was 
democratically elected in April 1993. 
  [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of 
Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have 
had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing 
coup? 
  [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this 
statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of 
January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on 
radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any 
military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or 
persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent 
means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will 
receive no support whatsoever from the outside world. 
  [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who 
in the army might have been behind yesterday's events? 
  [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the 
Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the 
Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four 
ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane 
Barracks. 
  [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite 
side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they 
loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two 
factions, pro and anti-government? 
  [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a 
diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two 
factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me, 
as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in 
Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not 
the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the 
ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the 
RLDF at the moment. 
  [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of 
clashes as happened earlier in the year? 
  [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put 
it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now 
to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with 
the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per 
se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups 
cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to 
tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister 
Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho 
will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism. 
  [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal? 
  [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult 
to 
describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks 
here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of 
January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each 
other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went, 
more or less, on with his daily life. [end recording]

  [Text] Channel Africa reported this morning that the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has elected Afonso 
Dhlakama, its leader, as Renamo candidate in the presidential 
elections scheduled for October. Quoting the Renamo secretary 
general, Channel Africa reported that the decision was made at 
the minicongress being held at the Renamo headquarters in 
Maringue. 
  The source said that Dhlakama's candidacy was unanimously 
approved by all attending the meeting. Renamo's congress, which 
was scheduled to wind up today, is now focusing on issues 
relating to electoral strategy and it could last longer than 
initially expected.

<F P=106> [Second and final part of interview with Renamo Secretary </F>
General Vicente Ululu; Alcido Ngwenha, member of the Frelimo 
Political Commission; Monamo Secretary General Maximo Dias; and 
Inacio Chire, PCN foreign affairs coordinator, by correspondent 
Moises Mabunda -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Ngwenha] I would like to answer Chire. I think 
this a very appropriate moment for dialogue. My view is not 
only that things may be positive. My view is that things may be 
positive or negative. I think it is somehow demagogic to say 
that there are countries with perfect democracies. We are at a 
certain phase of democratization in our country. It is true 
that it may be relatively inferior or limited, but neither Chire 
nor anyone else are to blame for this. There is no way one can 
deny that Chire formed a party on the basis of a law in 
Mozambique and he was not harassed. No one can deny that we are 
holding this dialogue, that there are different parties in the 
country, and that this is an important moment for the country, 
for the democratization process. 
  No one can deny that the National Convention [PCN] Party has 
been criticizing the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party 
in newspapers and it is not being harassed... hence, one cannot 
say Frelimo is not changing !!... Even the most beautiful girl 
in the world cannot show what she does not possess. This means 
the Frelimo Party is making efforts to democratize the country. 
If the PCN was in power it could do more, that is another 
issue... but there is no evidence that it could do more. It is 
totally wrong to completely refuse to acknowledge what has been 
happening. This is not going to help the situation. 
  As Mozambicans we are making very concrete steps forward to 
democratize the country. We cannot do more than others, because 
we are poor. One must bear this in mind. We are holding a 
debate, but we are still poor. One cannot say that the Frelimo 
Party is not talking with the people. The president of the 
republic has been to provinces on several occasions, held 
meetings with the people, and talked about multipartyism. Even 
I myself have talked about the PCN in my rallies. I have 
explain the situation. One cannot completely deny what has 
taken place... what surprises me is: What is the PCN's work? 
What does it do? It only says it has no resources, it has no 
this or that, but what has it been doing? It is able to air its 
views in newspapers, but I have never heard that it has ever 
done anything for multipartyism. It only says the government is 
corrupt and nothing else. It is false to say that there is no 
democracy and nothing is being done... there can never be a 
perfect democracy. Democracy is an old concept and it is always 
changing, even in the United States... 
  [Mabunda] I would like to hear Renamo's comments on this 
issue, that Frelimo is not making any changes... 
  [Ululu] People say that there is no democracy in Mozambique 
because they have reasons. They say this because they are able 
to justify it. We are democratizing the country. We know that 
democracy was nonexistent in this country. We are trying to 
build a society where we can enjoy our political rights. When 
people say there is no democracy in the country, they may be 
right because the principles, the democratic ingredients are 
still lacking. There is talk of corrupt, inefficient 
government... 
  [Mabunda] But there is also corruption in democratic 
countries... 
  [Ululu] There is ... I say this because the opposition uses 
these small faults to say there is no democracy in the c?untry... 
  [Chire] We could speak of the independence of the judiciary, 
the news media. We could speak of means of communication; do 
you think that the judiciary here in Mozambique is independent? 
  [Mabunda] Are you asking me? 
  [Chire] I am putting the question on the table...there are 
clear examples. There is a law that speaks of the independence 
of the judiciary, but this independence does not exist at 
present. For years, the media has operated in a certain manner. 
There has never been a clear-cut change. I am not saying that 
all journalists belong to Frelimo. I am not saying that and 
that is not what I think. I am also not saying that journalists 
are working for Frelimo. I am not saying that. I am ony saying 
that there have never been clear-cut changes. The directors of 
principal news media are the same people who were there during 
the period of the one- party system. I can even say that most 
of them are Frelimo members. There are many other examples... I 
think that theoreticians define a series of principles that are 
fundamental for a transition to democracy. I would also like to 
clarify that I have never said -- I would never say it -- that 
there is perfect democracy. There is no perfect democracy. It 
does not exist, as far as I know. Democracy is a process of 
readjustments, reorganization. I believe that from phase to 
phase, we have to find the best form of democracy. 
  [Ngwenha] I agree... 
  [Mabunda] I would like to ask Dr. Maximo Dias to air his 
views, but I would like you to begin by clarifying the 
following: Of the experiences of a Government of National Unity 
[GNU] that we know of, there are some that were successful and 
others less successful. After 25 April, Portugal tried to 
establish a GNU but it had more failures than successes. There 
are people who even say that the two years of its existence was 
a period of total misrule. Will it function in our case? 
  [Dias] No, your example...it is not true that a GNU did not 
function in Portugal. The GNU operated during a period of 
revolutionary shakeup. It was able to establish a Constituent 
Assembly which prepared the Constitution. The Constitution was 
not prepared by Salazar or Marcelo Caetano. It was prepared 
during the revolutionary GNU. As a matter of fact, it was not 
clearly a GNU. It was a revolutionary government formed by 
certain parties and the Armed Forces Movement. Despite all the 
problems it worked. It reached a consensus. It formed the 
Constituent Assembly which prepared the elections which were won 
by the Socialist Party by a more-or-less 35- or 40-percent 
margin. The Socialist Party ruled with difficulty because it 
was a minority Government...then there was a democratic 
alliance, a majority government, and now the Social Democratic 
Party. Here in our country, we speak of many problems. The 
national problems are so serious, so fervent. We are holding 
this round table to discuss GNU's establishment. I believe our 
people would want to know what we mean when we talk about GNU 
and how it is going to function. GNU is not a political option. 
It is a political imperative. Each party should not think: "I 
am going to form a GNU", no. This is reserved for parties 
capable of greater political consciousness, greater political 
responsibility, in this case, Frelimo and the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo]. I am not saying other parties 
cannot have political consciousness. The problem is they have no 
capacity to impose themselves on the two parties, which are 
still parties with a military tendency. It does not mean that 
we cannot hold dialogue with either Frelimo or Renamo. We have 
already held dialogue with them, but they are different from 
other parties. 
  It now remains to be seen whether these two parties will 
have 
the political awareness. One of them, Renamo, already has. At 
least, its president presented a solution to save the situation. 
Renamo believes that there should be a GNU. We are now waiting 
to hear the stand of the other party, the ruling party, which 
has not yet said whether or not it is going to have a GNU. Its 
president said that after elections, we are going to see whether 
or not GNU is necessary. There is a declared and open awareness 
from both sides however to discuss GNU's establishment. 
  [Mabunda] Perhaps we could conclude here. The aim of this 
round table was to exchange views on GNU's establishment, as 
well as to clarify its meaning to the common citizens. It was 
not the newspaper's intention that the parties should reach a 
consensus on the issue. That is not its role. Mr. Ululu, would 
you like to have the last word? 
  [Ululu] I think all the essential things have been said... 
  [Dias] I would just like to once again stress that GNU is 
not 
an option. It is not power sharing. GNU, I repeat, is a 
political imperative. It is a political awareness decided by 
the existing economic, social, and political difficulties in the 
country. GNU, for when? We all agree that it should be after 
elections. Why after elections? After elections, because the 
country cannot postpone them. The two militarized parties must 
publicly promise that elections are going to be held this 
October. 
  We cannot accept what a British diplomat said: "There will 
be elections, even if the armed forces have not been 
constituted". We cannot accept that. It is a recipe for 
military confrontation. We have to avoid it. How can we do 
that? By adopting a system of proportionality, involving 
independent or political individuals, individuals in the 
religious, economic, and social fields, people who are ready to 
volunteer to reach a compromise. When Monamo defends a GNU's 
establishment, it is not demanding to participate in it. If the 
two most voted for political forces in the country feel, 
however, that there are elements in Monamo -- which despite not 
having the required percentage -- who can participate in the 
government, Monamo will allow them to do so as a concession, not 
because that is its ambition. Many people can think that we are 
calling for GNU's establishment because we are unable to win the 
elections. That is not the case.

<F P=106> [Report by Nimrod Mabuza] </F>
  [Text] Statements made by a certain country that Swaziland 
is not a democratic country has irked the government. Minister 
for Foreign Affairs, Mr Solomon Dlamini told the House of 
Assembly last night that government has sent several protests to 
that country. The country was not named. However, it is assumed 
that the country referred to is the United States of America. 
  Recently, a report on human rights in Swaziland, prepared by 
the United States Department attacked the Tinkhundla 
[traditional community councils] System, saying even last year's 
elections were not democratic. 
  Mr Dlamini was replying to a question from Kwaluseni MP, 
William Msibi who asked the minister what was government doing 
to discourage the country from continuing to make defamatory 
remarks about Swaziland. Further, Mr Msibi said the continued 
derogative statements made by this country about Swaziland did 
not show any respect for this country. In reply, Mr Dlamini 
said government has protested several times to the government of 
this country. He said some of the replies that they got from 
the government of that country is that, it is one of their 
responsibilities to monitor the political system of the 
particular country they are accredited to. 
  Mr Dlamini also said government has also protested to the 
government of that country about its envoy, whom he said, used 
to meddle in the affairs of this country. 
  Motshane MP, Robert Anthony Mabuza asked the minister to 
inform the House if it was true that there was a diplomatic 
blunder in the appointment of the Swazi envoys, announced by 
Prime Minister, Prince Mbilini in February. In reply, Mr 
Dlamini said it is true that the diplomatic procedure was not 
followed in appointing the new Swazi envoys, adding that there 
were pressing isf+?s, resulting in the diplomat?c blunder. He 
said it is true that the count?ies were informed after the 
announcement was made, which is not supposed to be the case. 
  Mr Mabuza also wanted to know what will happen, should any 
of 
the Swazi Ambassadors and High Commissioners be rejected by the 
countries they have been accredited to. Mr Dlamini said 
although it has not happened before, another country can be 
asked to accredit him. However, he told the MPs that there is no 
policy covering such unforeseen circumstances. 
  Khubuta MP, Phillip Vonya Dlamini asked the minister to 
inform the House on the period expected to be stayed by an envoy 
abroad. He also wanted to know if the husband of the woman 
appointed is consulted first. Mr Dlamini said he was asking 
this to avoid a situation whereby, the husband, who may not be 
qualified may be called upon to go and stay with his wife abroad. 
  Mtfongwaneni MP, Roy Nicholas Fanourakis asked the minister 
to inform the House on the criteria used in appointing High 
Commissioners and Ambassadors. In reply, the minister said the 
appointments are done by the King. He said it is therefore, 
difficult for his ministry to know if the husband is consulted 
before his wife is appointed. However, the minister said his 
office does consult when officers are seconded to the missions 
abroad. The debate and replies on this ministry took less than 
40 minutes. In most ministries which have so far been debated, 
they sometimes take two days each.

ANC representative in Zambia Japhet Ndhlovu confirmed on

training, but the plan could not be implemented immediately 
because it had not been budgeted for in the 1993 year. ANC 
President Nelson Mandela had formally made the request when he

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] When the Liberian factions signed the peace accord 
in Cotonou last July they were not accounting for the emergence 
of a new anti-Charles Taylor movement, the Liberian Peace 
Council, LPC. It's been creating havoc with attacks in the River 
Cess region, south of the port of Buchanan. What its ultimate 
aim was has remained unclear. Now, it has come out into the 
open demanding a piece of the action and a place in the 
transitional government. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison 
telexed this report: 
  The Liberian Peace Council today vowed to continue fighting 
until the Cotonou Accord was amended. The Peace Council's 
spokesman, Octavius Walker, said: We insist on being included 
in the Liberian National Transitional Government. He said: We 
made this clear when we met with the Transitional Council on 13 
March. Mr. Walker said that Isaac Musa, Charles Taylor's 
National Patriotic Front representative, had walked out of that 
meeting when the LPC was putting forward its demands. He added 
that after Mr. Musa had left, the LPC had made it clear that the 
NPFL could not represent areas under LPC control. Mr. Walker 
claims that the LPC is in control of six counties: River Cess, 
Grand Bassa, Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, and Grand Kru. He 
said that the Peace Council is seeking to represent these 
countries on the Interim Council, but the NPFL information 
minister designate, Joe Mulbah, disputed the LPC's claim that it 
controlled six counties. Mulbah said that the NPFL had recently 
dislodged Peace Council fighters from River Cess and Compound 
No. 2, in Grand Bassa County. 
  Meanwhile, the fighting between the LPC and the NPFL 
continues to trigger a large number of refugees in the 
southeastern region. United Nations Shelter officials said that 
in the first six days of April alone 1,200 people had fled to 
the town of Buchanan.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Mediation Committee for the </F>
Preservation of Social Peace and National Unity on 14 April; 
place not given] 
  [Text] Faced with the particularly tense situation our 
country is experiencing, and in view of the dramatic 
consequences that this could have for democracy, national unity, 
peace, and social harmony, the ANDDH and the (?DMD) have agreed 
to join hands within the framework of a mediation committee for 
the preservation of civil peace and national unity. 
  The mediation committee notes that the authorities of the 
Third Republic -- the state president, the speaker of the 
National Assembly, and the prime minister -- support and 
encourage the mediation efforts being undertaken by these two 
associations, and that the parliamentary opposition has shown 
its willingness for dialogue and equally endorses the initiative 
of the two associations. Consequently, the mediation committee 
notes with satisfaction the desire for openness and dialogue 
exhibited on both sides, and strongly urges the two parties to 
refrain from any act or acts that could compromise national 
unity, peace, social harmony, democracy, or the Republic. 
  At this juncture, the committee earnestly calls on the 
opposition to set aside any initiatives which could lead to 
strikes and civil disobedience, and to refrain from any 
statements likely to thwart the ongoing negotiations. The 
mediation committee counts on the two parties' sense of 
responsibility, wisdom, moderation, and their commitment to the 
creative values of civilization -- which constitute one of the 
basic hallmarks of our people -- in order to preserve unity and 
brotherhood among all Nigerois, to ensure economic well-being 
and progress, and to guarantee as well as safeguard democracy, 
peace, and social harmony in our country.

  [Text] Niamey, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Muslim fundamentalists who 
took refuge in Kolouka after occupying the neighboring town of 
Bani Bangou, (180 km to the north of Niamey), began to surrender 
at midday today, Niger Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told 
AFP. 
  A detachment of the Nigerian Army encircled the village in 
the early hours of the morning and threatened to attack if the 
fundamentalists, who are members of the Izala sect, did not 
surrender. 
  On 11 and 12 March, clashes between members of the sect and 
security forces left 10 dead at Kolouka. The fundamentalists 
succeeded in leaving Bani Bangou during the evening of 12 March 
to return to their village.

  [Text] The parliamentary opposition is getting set to carry 
out its civil disobedience campaign. In a statement read today, 
the group pointed out that this civil disobedience campaign will 
only apply to appointed representatives of state authority and 
will affect all sectors of state activity. It will, however, 
not harm the interests and activities of individuals and private 
firms. 
  It may be recalled that for the past few days, human rights 
associations have been mediating in discussions between the 
government and the opposition. In a statement reported by this 
radio yesterday, the spokesman of these associations called on 
the two parties to refrain from engaging in any act or acts that 
could compromise national unity, social harmony, democracy, or 
the republic.

  [Text] The Federal Government has rejected the recent 
categorization of Nigeria by the United States of America as one 
of the four countries not cooperating with it in the fight 
against drug trafficking. The head of state, General Sani 
Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today 
in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives. 
State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha 
described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a 
productive government-media partnership: 
  [Begin recording] [Nguw] The head of state's briefing 
centered on six options: government-press relationship [words 
indistinct] policy, foreign policy, the imminent constitutional 
conference, drug trafficking, and the Nigerian-Cameroon dispute 
over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of the highlights of the 
briefing was his reference to the United States' recent listing 
of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in the fight against drug 
trafficking as a political [words indistinct] genuine component 
of the United States policy on drug control. Gen. Abacha said 
the United States' pronouncement was a surprise, especially as 
Nigeria's efforts at combating drug trafficking are well known 
had been recently applauded by the American Embassy in Nigeria 
and the United States drug administration. He said his 
administration would, however, not be deterred in the fight 
against drug trafficking. 
  [Abacha] [Words indistinct], should be understood by all 
concerned that this administration is going to continue its 
fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes [word 
indistinct] to ensure that the drugs [words indistinct] in our 
society. We shall intensify our antidrug crusade. Of course, 
we believe it is right to do so in our national interest and to 
protect our society from its cancerous effects that we have 
observed in Western societies. We urge the Western governments 
to look inwards into their owns societies and (?calm) the 
excessive appetite of their own [word indistinct] which create 
the drive for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any 
hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people. 
  [Nguw] On the political economy, the head of state 
identified three major sources of conflict, not only in Nigeria, 
but also in other African countries: the heavy debt burden, the 
effects of the structural adjustment program and last of them, 
as he put it the conflict-ridden [word indistinct] 
democratization process going on on the continent. He said 
[word indistinct] of the idea of the national conference in 
Nigeria has been raised on non-partisan interests. (?Referring) 
to the issue of government and the media, Gen. Abacha assured 
the media executives that his administration is willing to 
accommodate criticisms and that free flow of information will be 
encouraged. However, he appealed to the media not to publish 
[words indistinct] facts and to remember that discretion is the 
better part of journalistic prowess. 
  On foreign policy, Gen. Abacha said Africa stands [words 
indistinct] the centerpiece of policy. Outside the continent, 
he said Nigeria is reviewing her diplomatic representation in 
the former Soviet Union to ensure the nation's presence in the 
(?15) republics that have emerged from the breaking up of the 
Soviet Union. Some members of the Provisional Ruling Council 
and ministers were present at the briefing which went into a 
closed-door session shortly after the head of state's address.

  [Text] Lagos, 14 Apr (PANA) -- France denied Thursday [14 
April] in Lagos that the recent joint military exercise it held 
with Benin, Nigeria's western neighbour, was aimed at 
intimidating Nigeria in the event of an out-break of hostilities 
with Cameroon over the disputed Bakassi Peninsula. 
  French defence attache in Nigeria, Col. John Eglinger, said 
that the exercise was planned "about a year ago," long before 
the current disagreement between Nigeria and Cameroon. Col. 
Eglinger said that Nigeria had been duly informed about the 
plans for holding the joint exercise. Concerning France's 
position in the Bakassi dispute between Nigeria and its former 
colony of Cameroon, englinger said that France was committed to 
""an amicable resolution"" of the conflict. He reiterated 
France's preparedness to assist mediate in the dispute which, he 
said, France believed could be resolved through "bilateral 
discussion." 
  France held its military exercise with Benin in March, an 
operation interpreted by military sources in the Nigerian 
capital as an effort to intimidate the Nigerian Army should the 
dispute over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula escalate into a 
military confrontation between Nigeria and Cameroon. France had 
allegedly used an unusually "large" arsenal including war planes 
and war ships in the exercise which lasted for several days.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Abdou Diouf by </F>
Marie-Pierre Subtil; place and date not given: "President Diouf 
Wants Imprisoned Opponents To Be Tried `as Soon as Possible'"] 
  [Text] Senegalese President Abdou Diouf ended his official 
visit to Paris on Tuesday, 12 April, by chairing a meeting of 
the World Bank on onchocerciasis (river blindness). His 
meetings during this week's visit have been dominated by the 
consequences of the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial 
Community] franc. 
  The Senegalese president told LE MONDE that, in his meetings 
with French officials, he had "above all stressed the problem 
faced by companies based in Senegal, both French and Senegalese, 
which cannot bear sole responsibility for the economic 
recovery." "We also spoke at length about the cost of 
medicines, which should remain at predevaluation price levels." 
  Discussions also focused on the fate of the parliamentarians 
imprisoned two days after the 16 February riots. At a Foreign 
Ministry dinner on Monday, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated: 
"We hope that the trials will be concluded rapidly and that, as 
a result, the political climate will again return to normal." 
In reply, Mr. Diouf said: "I, too, want this to be the case, 
but I am a head of state who respects the Constitution, and this 
Constitution has separated the powers. I would therefore not 
give orders to the Justice Ministry. However, it would be good 
if justice could take its course very rapidly, as rapidly as 
possible." 
  As for the cases of Mody Sy, a deputy of the Senegal 
Democratic Party (PDS), and Samuel Sarr, a member of the same 
party, who have been in prison for almost a year, the president 
said that a decision would be made soon: "I believe that the 
Justice Ministry is currently putting the finishing touches to 
their cases." Asked whether a trial would be held in the next 
few weeks, he replied: "I think so, yes, according to my 
sources, but again I refuse to get involved in the business of 
the Justice Ministry." 
  The demonstrations of 16 February which led to eight people 
being killed, including six police officers, were mostly put 
down to a Muslim youth movement, the Moustarchidines, which was 
banned in the aftermath of the riots. Mr. Diouf was asked if 
the rise of this movement reflected a rise in religious 
fundamentalism: "What occurred on 16 February must force us to 
be more careful and extremely vigilant." Has the involvement of 
the Moustarchidines movement in the violence of 16 February been 
proven? The head of state replied: "I do not have access to 
the judicial files, but my sources tell me that this was the 
case, and that they assembled people from all over Senegal." 
  In addition, Mr. Diouf informed us that talks with the 
Casamance separatists had not been broken off, despite the 
cessation of hostilities: "We are still talking, but not on the 
public stage. We remain in contact with all the protagonists." 
He admitted that "after the intervention of France, things have 
calmed down considerably." (At the request of the separatists, 
Paris had arbitrated on the region, the conclusions of which had 
been generally favorable to Dakar) 
  Asked if the Senegalese head of state regarded himself as 
the 
new leader of the region, as some people had wished after the 
death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, he replied: "I have 
no leadership ambitions. My only ambition is to govern Senegal 
wisely, of course in a framework of African and world 
solidarity, without worrying about leadership."

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh; issued </F>
in Lome on 13 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In view of the persisting political impasse in the 
country and the confusion created following statements made by 
certain political leaders, Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh 
wants to make the following clarifications: 
  1. The outgoing prime minister tendered in his resignation 
and that of his government on 21 March. The head of state 
accepted the resignation and asked the prime minister to 
continue conducting the daily affairs of state, which he has 
been doing to date, to ensure continuity. 
  2. Like every Togolese, the prime minister deplored and 
continues to deplore the difficulties the parliamentary majority 
parties are encountering in agreeing on the appointment of a new 
prime minister because this state of affairs is thwarting the 
establishment of the new institutions that are much desired by 
all. 
  3. It is proper to recall here the position of the 
government which refrained from interfering in the electoral 
disputes, in its concern for the absolute respect for the 
Electoral Law. In fact, Article 189 of the Electoral Law 
stipulates the following: Should the Supreme Court notice 
serious irregularities in the elections that might taint their 
sincerity and affect the global results, the court can annul the 
elections. The government would then fix the date for new 
elections which would take place within a month, at the latest, 
after the date on which the Supreme Court announces its 
decision. Clearly Togolese should know that it is not the 
government that annuls elections. However, the government is 
bound, in all circumstances, to respect the Electoral Law by 
fixing a date for the new elections. 
  4. Consequently, Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh wants to 
inform the concerned political leaders that as soon as they find 
a prime minister, he is ready at all times to hand over the 
baton of office to him. 
  5. After all the sacrifices made with the people, Prime 
Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh reaffirms his faith in democracy 
in Togo. He, however, refuses to play the role of a scapegoat. 
  Prime Minister Koffigoh also appeals to the parliamentary 
majority party leaders to reach an agreement and to announce the 
outcome of their consultations in the superior interest of the 
Togolese people who have suffered far too much from demagogy and 
partisan squabbles.

<F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday [14 April] said 
armed insurrection in kwaZulu/Natal was not a possibility, even 
if people expected it to happen. Speaking at a press briefing 
in Johannesburg, Mr Buthelezi said it would be sad if South 
Africa moved in that direction. 
  Asked what he would do now that mediation had failed to 
settle constitutional differences, Mr Buthelezi said he would 
have to discuss the matter with the IFP Central Committee. Mr 
Buthelezi said he was disappointed that mediation had failed, 
but added the African National Congress and government had never 
favoured it. 
  He said the ANC and government had wasted an opportunity by 
which the IFP could have returned to the electoral process and 
the elections. Claims that the IFP had spoilt the mediation 
effort were nonsense, he said. The election date may have come 
up in discussions at some stage, but Mr Buthelezi denied the IFP 
used the issue as a hidden agenda. 
  Mr Buthelezi did not want to commit himself to taking part 
in 
another planned leaders' summit, but said negotiations could 
continue because he would leave no stone unturned to find a 
solution. 
  Reacting to a question on whether Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini would accept a new package offered to him by 
government, he said "if people think they can buy him (the king) 
with packages, they do not understand him". The king was only 
concerned about his people and his land, not himself, he said. 
  Mr Buthelezi predicted violence would increase in the 
province in spite of troops being deployed there. Only Zulus 
were killed in taxis or while protesting, he said. "The 
catastrophe is here." 
  But elections in kwaZulu would be held because he did not 
have the option to stop them. It was a democratic right for all 
South Africans to choose whether to vote or not, he said. 
  Regarding the provision of polling stations, he said the 
kwaZulu government had offered the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] use of its buildings. Mr Buthelezi said he had 
even offered IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler "to put a 
word in" so the commission could use buildings which fell under 
the control of tribal chiefs. 
  The process of mediation, which was to have been led by 
former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and 
British Politician Lord Peter Carrington, came to a halt on the 
question of whether the election date should be included in the 
terms of reference. Both Mr Kissinger and Lord Carrington 
agreed to mediate on a draft version of the terms which had not 
mentioned the date. A later draft, revised when government 
joined the mediation, specifically excluded the election date. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he had received a message from Lord 
Carrington through the British Embassy that Lord Carrington 
wanted the terms of reference consolidated. Mr Buthelezi said 
he still did not know the status of this document which was sent 
to him and others on Tuesday night.

<F P=106> [Report by Esther Waugh] </F>
  [Text] The post-election political diary is filling up with 
decisions to be taken by the new government of national unity. 
It is understood that the seven Transitional Executive Council 
subcouncils are also developing recommendations for the new 
government. 
  These recommendations, which can lead to new legislation or 
amendments of existing legislation, are to be included in a 
report which will be presented to the new government. However, 
the Interim Constitution details a series of decisions to be 
taken by the government. 
  Key among these steps is the appointment of the 27-member 
multiparty cabinet and the allocation of portfolios. The 
president, after consultation with the two deputy presidents and 
the leaders of parties with more than 20 seats in the national 
assembly, will appoint cabinet members. 
  The president is to appoint a commission on provincial 
government within 30 days and a financial and fiscal commission 
within 60 days. 
  The interim Constitution stipulates that a chairman and 
deputy chairman be elected for the constitutional assembly at 
its first sitting. The president is to appoint judges for the 
constitutional court. A council of traditional leaders is to be 
established within six months of the Constitution coming into 
operation. The president is to appoint a human rights 
commission within two months of the first sitting of the senate.

<F P=106> [Article by Alan Fine and Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] With the inauguration of SA's [South Africa] new 
President less than four weeks away, speculation -- often 
dressed up as fact -- is mounting on the shape of the new 
Cabinet Nelson Mandela is likely to appoint. The speculation is 
as intense within the ANC as without. 
  As far as is known, final decisions have not yet been made 
despite reports to the contrary. But the considerations at 
stake are becoming clearer -- particularly in the key posts of 
Deputy President, Finance Minister, Reconstruction and 
Development and the security portfolios. It is not yet decided 
whether the Reconstruction and Development post will be a 
separate Cabinet position or be placed within the President's 
department. Either way, it is obviously the surefire bet -- 
former COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general 
secretary Jay Naidoo is unchallenged. 
  Constructing the new Cabinet is likely to be one of 
Mandela's 
loneliest tasks. Devising the candidates' lists was much easier 
-- it having been a product of the popular will combined with 
tinkering by the national executive and special interest 
lobbying by the likes of COSATU, SANCO [South African National 
Civics Organisation] and the SACP [South African Communist 
Party]. Where the Cabinet is concerned, Mandela will (and 
presumably has already been) pondering these issues with only 
limited reference to many of his most senior colleagues since 
they have a direct personal interest in the outcome. 
  Some insiders suggest that, to the extent that he consults 
initially, he will do so informally with his closest friends -- 
mainly his old fellow inmates on Robben Island and primarily 
Walter Sisulu who probably has no Cabinet ambitions of his own. 
Eventually he will have to go to his National Executive 
Committee, but that organ will be hard pressed to make objective 
decisions. 
  The Deputy President post is a curious one. Some observers 
see it as a straight contest between Cyril Ramaphosa and Thabo 
Mbeki -- two of the contenders (likely PWV 
[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] premier Tokyo Sexwale being 
the third) for Mandela's position when he retires. But it is 
questionable whether the post is a significant one beyond that, 
especially given that F.W. de Klerk will also probably be a 
Deputy President. Unless, of course, the Deputy President is 
also able to hold a senior Cabinet post. 
  Which brings us around to the most crucial post -- that of 
Finance Minister. Will it be Derek Keys, and if not, then who? 
First, there is no undertaking in the TEC's [Transitional 
Executive Council] statement of policy to the IMF that Keys and 
Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals have been guaranteed their 
posts in the government of national unity (as was suggested 
yesterday by BEELD). 
  However, there is broad agreement in the ANC that Stals 
should be reappointed when his present term expires in June. 
The issue, quite simply, is investor and business confidence. 
(There is some concern in parts of the ANC, though, at talk 
that the deputy governorship may go to Bank of Beijing-trained 
radical economist Vella Pillay, which would not enhance 
confidence.) But it does go further, as reflected by a question 
put this week by a senior ANC source: "Do we need to keep both 
Keys and Stals in place to maintain confidence, or is Stals 
enough?" 
  There is genuine ANC concern about giving the key Finance 
portfolio to an NP [National Party] member -- many would not 
stand for it. While the incumbent may have to ensure financial 
discipline, he should at least be committed in principle to the 
RDP [Reconstruction and Development program], it is argued. 
Even a senior NP source argued cogently this week that the post 
should be held by the ANC. Keys, the argument goes, was able to 
maintain financial discipline because he had the unstinting 
support of De Klerk. Given the populist pressures the ANC will 
face, the new Finance Minister should be someone with a 
political base sufficiently sound to empower him (or her) to say 
"no" to excessive claims on the Treasury by his colleagues. 
  The question is -- who fits this bill? It is widely accepted 
that neither of the ANC's top two economics department figures 
-- Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni -- have the stature in terms 
of experience or political popularity. The two most likely 
candidates, therefore, are Mbeki (tipped by the SUNDAY TIMES 
some weeks ago) or Ramaphosa. Both have the necessary political 
base, and some, though limited, economic and financial 
expertise. But they would be surrounded by the bright young 
officials who have advised ANC policymakers in the past four 
years, and many of the incumbent Finance Ministry bureaucrats 
trained latterly by Keys. 
  There are many other economics-linked posts which could be 
occupied by Keys, Manuel, Mboweni and others -- such as Trade 
and Industry, Public Enterprises, Mineral and Energy Affairs, 
Agriculture, Transport, Manpower, Water and Forestry and so on. 
  This raises an international fact of life of 
cabinet-building. As a Centre for Policy Studies analyst points 
out, many appointments are made on the basis of political 
favours owed rather than expertise in a portfolio or other 
special qualities. There is no reason to think the ANC will be 
any different. The key to avoiding chaos is to ensure that 
senior departmental officials are capable. They then need only 
"to give the Minister a few papers to sign each day" and to 
focus their energies on running the show. 
  Mandela's position is made all the more difficult because 
many of the top ANC candidates have no obvious administrative 
skills in vital areas of government. Although Mbeki would be an 
obvious candidate for Foreign Minister if he does not get 
Finance -- and even if he makes Deputy President -- and Steve 
Tshwete must be a sitter for the sport portfolio, who in the ANC 
knows anything about how to administer transport, water affairs, 
the environment and even education or health? 
  When it comes to handing out rewards for favours, Mandela 
will have some leeway by virtue of the fact that he also has to 
establish, in terms of the constitution, a public protector, a 
human rights commission, and the restitution of land rights. In 
his selection of Cabinet candidates, De Klerk is likely to be 
swayed by the success of each region in the election. On this 
criteria, and on the basis of seniority in the party, the most 
likely candidates would therefore be Cape leader Dawie de 
Villiers, Transvaal leaders Pik Botha and Roelf Meyer and 
[Orange] Free State leader Kobie Coetsee along with Keys. 
  The portfolios Mandela may consider distributing to NP 
candidates would be Agriculture to appease white farmers, and 
Public Administration to quell the fears of the 
Afrikaner-dominated public service. The DP's historical role as 
parliamentary watchdog and its centrist position could well be 
recognised by the appointment of party veteran Colin Eglin as 
Speaker of Parliament. 
  The constitution provides for the appointment of a maximum 
of 
27 Cabinet Ministers, but it does not specify which portfolios 
must be allocated to opposition members. Technically, 
therefore, Mandela could make the four or so NP candidates 
(assuming the NP gets 20 percent of the vote) "Ministers without 
portfolio" but he is required to engage in a process of 
non-binding consultation with other party leaders and make his 
decisions "in the spirit underlying the concept of a government 
of national unity." 
  Mandela is not constrained by the constitution on what 
portfolios should be created. The ANC has already expressed its 
desire to reintegrate the State Expenditure and Finance 
departments. Other likely changes are a separation of the 
Regional and Land Affairs portfolio in line with the increased 
importance of regional government, and the creation of a Gender 
Affairs Ministry. Whether Housing and Public Works should be 
split is an open question and whether the current Public 
Enterprises Department will keep its "and Privatisation" epithet 
is a moot point.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] unveiled Thursday an almost 
R700-million [rand] budget it needs to ensure the country's 
first all race elections are free and fair. 
  In the period December 20, 1993 to May 31, 1994, the IEC 
expects to spend R696.53-million on salaries, administration, 
supplies, equipment, rents, professional services and other 
projects. The IEC will spend the most on staff renumeration, 
with R296.933-million being allocated to salaries and allowances. 
  The second largest item is administrative expenditure at 
R145.7- million which includes post and communications, as well 
as advertising. An estimated R124.093-million is expected to be 
spent on equipment related to the polling process, while 
R65.588-million has been allocated to stores including printing 
and stationery. 
  The rental of buildings, staff accomodation and furniture 
are 
expected to cost R33.981-million, professional services are 
likely to amount to R23.235-million and R7-million is to be 
spent on Operation Access. 
  The IEC budget is the combined spending estimates of the 
commission's functional units; the election adjudication 
secretariat, the election administration directorate, the 
election monitoring directorate, and the chief executive officer.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Merton] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] commissioners are paid R25,000 [rand] a month, 
in keeping with the Transitional Executive Council's principle 
of "no gain, no loss", IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler 
said on Thursday [14 April]. Speaking at a press briefing, he 
said those seconded to the commission were paid by their regular 
employers who could claim the salaries back from the commission. 
However, some employers had volunteered to bear the costs of 
seconded commissioners' salaries. 
  The two IEC advocates were paid a salary in line which what 
they would have received in private practice, he added. American 
commissioner Ms gaye McDougal was getting a salary equal to the 
one she was paid in the United States, with an additional 
subsistance allowance, he said. 
  Commissioners could also receive non-executive director's 
fees. Nobody was entitled to benefits such as pension, medical 
aid or leave pay, Mr Justice Kriegler said. 
  The IEC employs 16 commissioners, 11 from South Africa and 
five from abroad. 
  IEC finance sub-committee convenor Rosil Jager said the 
commission's preliminary budget was more than R696.5 
million."The logistics of the elections are an enormous task," 
she said. 
  "The scope of our operations has been changed by external 
circumstance," she added, referring to contingencies such as the 
double ballot system. Mrs Jager said staff levels has also been 
problematic. The commission had increased its staff from 200 to 
about 200,000 within a very short time. 
  A source said the IEC was not yet certain how long it would 
be in existence after the elections, but would cut its staff 
back radically from April 29. 
  The greatest proportion of the budget, R375.8 million, was 
allocated to election administration, which included salaries, 
printing costs and building rentals. 
  IEC financial director Nonesi Ndungane said nearly R163.5 
million was allocated to election monitoring. This would cover, 
among others, monitors' salaries and transport. It was "the 
price of the legitimacy of the elections", she said. 
  The commission's adjudication directorate received nearly 
R29.5 million, most of which was used to pay legal staff. The 
IEC's office received R5.5 million, the communication 
directorate R29.5 million and voter education about R26.7 
million. 
  Mrs Ndungane said the IEC would honour any liabilities 
incurred when it cancelled April hotel bookings countrywide, but 
the World Trade Centre rental dispute was a matter for the 
public works department. 
  A Public Works Department spokesman recently refused to 
comment on the issue, saying "legal representatives were looking 
into the matter". 
  The IEC budget was approved by both the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] and the State Finance Department. It 
will be audited by the auditor-general. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler also announced the TEC had approved a 
doubling of the election fund, to R44 million. He was hopeful 
the increase would soon be approved by the state Finance 
Department. This meant political parties qualifying for 
assistance because they had collected sufficient signatures 
could receive what he called a second dividend. The fund was set 
up to help political parties finance their campaigns.

  [Text] The security forces face four phases of potential 
disorder in the election process. One is the run-up during 
which groups with low political tolerance try to intimidate one 
another, as well as other parties whose tradition of tolerance 
is perceived as weakness. This has already begun, the process 
already marked by events such as the Johannesburg massacre, the 
intensification of communal violence in kwaZulu/Natal and on the 
East Rand and -- on a decidedly lower key -- the breaking up of 
NP [National Party] and DP [Democratic Party] meetings. 
  Next is the polling period when intimidation is likely to 
intensify (especially if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stays 
out of the election and the very act of voting becomes a public 
political statement). Confusion and panic are possible at the 
polling stations, where most voters have absolutely no 
experience of the process. Attempts to interfere with the 
polling process are possible, while tensions could be created by 
people marching in large groups to cast their vote, out of a 
sense of insecurity. 
  A period of over-exuberance could threaten public order 
immediately after the results are made known. It would be 
exacerbated if the ANC should register the kind of runaway 
victory that could encourage some of its supporters to press for 
a scrapping of the power-sharing mechanisms of the interim 
constitution. It is possible elements of the disadvantaged 
classes will have totally unrealistic expectations and will 
stream into the suburbs to claim their houses, swimming pools 
and cars. And the losers could seek to give forceful expression 
to their rejection of the outcome. 
  Finally, a phase of disillusioned anger is almost certain, 
and this could occur after the military reservists have been 
demobilised. 
  Chris de Kock and Charl Schutte, of the Human Sciences 
Research Council, examine this question in depth in an empirical 
study of the question of violence over the elections. They note 
that posters promoting voter literacy pose the question: "Why 
vote?" then answer: "Education, housing, jobs and peace." They 
ask if the compilers are ignorant of the theory of rising 
expectations or whether they want to pass on a subtle message 
stimulating such expectations. 
  "Whatever their reasons, there can be little doubt they are 
doing an elected transitional government a great disservice. 
Expectations of immediate gratification in terms of housing, 
education, work and peace are being aroused in the largest 
segment of the South African population." 
  They say no transition government could meet such 
expectations in a short period, which will cause high levels of 
frustration and aggression to be exploited by enemies of the 
transitional government. "One should also not lose sight of the 
fact that the black population in particular, after a decade of 
ungovernability and not paying for services and alternative 
structures, will not recognise the authority of a transitional 
government that does not 'deliver the goods' overnight."

  [Text] A thin blue line and a thicker khaki line are what 
make orderly political transition a more likely scenario in 
South Africa than chaotic uhuru [freedom]. 
  Zimbabwe is a better analogy than Angola or Mozambique. In 
Angola and Mozambique the Portuguese troops -- and the police 
structures -- withdrew almost overnight (as in the earlier 
Belgian Congo), leaving a power vacuum. Looting and disorder 
took over, then civil war. Portuguese civilians fled with what 
they could carry. 
  In Zimbabwe, Ian Smith's police and army stayed in place. 
The transition was orderly and the army later integrated with 
guerilla forces. Some of the white civilian population chose to 
stay on, many today enjoying a lifestyle barely distinguishable 
from before. 
  South Africa is in the grip of social and political upheaval 
far beyond what happened in Zimbabwe, in spite of the scale and 
ferocity of the bush war. But South Africa also has in place a 
large and efficient police force and, to back it up, the most 
effective military machine south of the Sahara. 
  Citizen Force and Commando reserves have been called up for 
later this month to keep the lid on disorder. More can be 
called up if necessary. They will be used to patrol and protect 
city centres and suburbs as well as the township flashpoints. 
The military back-up has been severely stretched by commitments 
in Bophuthatwana, Lebowa Ciskei and kwaZulu/Natal, as well as on 
the East Rand, but the authorities are nevertheless determined 
to keep a firm grip. 
  The police have put together a comprehensive plan for the 
period leading up to elections, the days of polling and the 
post-election phase. Measures include "maximum visibility in 
all areas by means of intensive patrols in all residential areas 
and on routes to polling stations". Spotting will be done from 
the air and fixed observation posts, while there will be maximum 
use of video cameras. "By the day of the election our forces 
will be at a peak," says Major-General Opperman, a former 
infantry commander who is now director of communications at 
Defence Headquarters. "We will be in a position to contain any 
situation that might arise." He says the frequency of incidents 
needing security force attention is expected to pick up as the 
election date approaches. 
  The troops will stay in place after the election, to help 
the 
police. If conditions warrant, the call-up could be extended. 
"We will still be in place in the post-election phase, to 
provide the security we regard as essential for transition to a 
new dispensation and democracy." 
  Gen Opperman emphasises that, in consultation with the 
police, military units will patrol urban and suburban areas as 
needed, as well as rural areas and townships. No part of the 
country will lack a security force presence. "I suggest 
communities who feel anxious about their security should get in 
touch with their regional police commands so that adequate 
arrangements can be made. Our operation will be very much 
hearth and home-protection of the ordinary civilian". He is 
bemused by speculation that the military call-up later this 
month will be poorly answered. "We have no evidence at all to 
suggest this. The call-up hasn't happened yet, so how do people 
make these claims? We have every confidence the call-up will be 
answered, as it always was before. It doesn't make sense for 
people to refuse when it's law and order and their own security 
that is at stake." 
  After the elections the SADF [South African Defence Force] 
will continue to be a stabilising force, says Gen Opperman." 
"We are not a colonial power about to return home. We will 
integrate with other forces over a period but we won't lose our 
efficiency. We will be an effective fighting force. Internally 
we act as a back-up to the police but, in the end, the SADF is 
the only force with the numbers and resources to stand firm 
against chaos and anarchy.

  [Text] The police have released a detailed report on 
security measures for the coming election. A police spokesman 
said in releasing the report in Pretoria that measures would be 
implemented nationally to prevent disturbances at polling 
stations. No weapons or firearms will be allowed within a 
1,100-meter radius of voting stations, and people will be 
searched before being allowed in to vote. No party tents, 
political activity, flags, or banners will be allowed within the 
same radius. The polling stations will be searched for 
explosives or other undesirable objects before people will be 
allowed to go in, and only voters will be allowed within a 
600-meter radius of polling centers.

two full days of IEC training. International observers will be 
able to attend sessions at national office on the 19-20 April or 
on the 20-21, or 22-23 at a regional office. Domestic observers 
will be able to attend either of the latter two training 
sessions. All training sessions will cover the same material. 
  Additional training of international observers takes place 
in 
their home country by their organisation. The IEC has provided 
the (sample) training manual and handbook to registered overseas 
organisations. 
  It should be noted that, unlike monitors, observers have no 
intervention powers. They are not employees of the IEC and make 
their reports to their accredited organisations. These 
organisations then report to the IEC. 
  Liaison between international and domestic observers will be 
overseen by the monitoring directorate; a close relationship is 
expected.

  [Text] The Freedom Front has called on all parties apart 
from the National Party and the ANC to participate in a joint 
meeting at which a demand for the postponement of the election 
would be formulated. Party leader Constand Viljoen told a 
public meeting in Kraaifontein in the Western Cape last night 
that the aim was to ensure that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
and the Conservative Party [CP] could also be included in the 
poll. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent James Barkhuizen] The 
Kraaifontein meeting was the biggest so far on the Freedom Front 
election tour. General Viljoen told more than 1,500 supporters 
that election in the present climate of violence and without the 
IFP was unthinkable. He said the smaller parties would urgently 
have to consider the fairness of the election. 
  [Viljoen, in progress]...and if we decide that it is not the 
case, then we should put a joint case to the Independent 
Electoral Commission to say that we smaller parties, with the 
exclusion of the ANC and the National Party, we feel that this 
is not a free and fair situation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Kurt Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 15 SAPA -- Prospects of further 
violence in central Johannesburg loomed large on Friday [15 
April] when the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Youth Brigade vowed 
it would embark on "rolling mass action" in the city from Monday 
despite a magisterial ban. 
  If police or the African National Congress attempted to stop 
planned marches to protest against the elections and the killing 
of Zulu marchers in the city on March 28, South Africa would 
become another Bosnia, the Youth Brigade warned at a news 
conference. 
  The IFP's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Youth 
Chairman Charles Loliwe said the Youth Brigade called on "all 
peace- loving Africans" to observe Monday as a day of mourning 
"for the innocent Zulus massacred outside the ANC headquarters 
in Plein Street and in Library Gardens by the SA Police and MK 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
security guards". 
  Mr Loliwe said the IFP was also calling for a stayaway from 
April 18 to 23 to demand the South African Government and the 
Transitional Executive Council lift the state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal, which it regarded as "illegal". 
  The stayaway applied to everybody, including people who were 
not IFP members. Only journalists, students and civil workers 
were exempted from the call. The IFP would "enforce" the 
stayaway. "Anyone who comes to town will do so at their own 
risk." 
  The IFP would march at 10AM on Monday from Library Gardens 
to 
the ANC headquarters where wreaths would be laid in honour of 
members killed at the spot nearly three weeks ago. A 
commemorative service at the Library Gardens would end at 4PM. 
  On Tuesday the IFP would march from George Goch Station to 
John Vorster Square police headquarters where it would demand 
the lifting of the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal and the 
withdrawal of troops from the townships. 
  On Wednesday a sit-in would be staged at the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange [JSE] "because the JSE is part of the government 
and can put pressure on them". 
  On Thursday the IFP would march on the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] to protest against bias favouring the 
National Party and the ANC, and on Friday it would march on the 
offices of the Independent Electoral Commission. "The police 
have refused us permission to hold these marches, but we will 
take the law into our own hands to pay tribute to our members 
who lost their lives. We are going to march. If anything 
happens to us we warn the government it could lead to a Bosnia 
situation in Johannesburg," Mr Loliwe said. 
  Asked whether the IFP was not concerned its campaign would 
lead to more loss of life, Mr Loliwe replied: "It is not the 
first time people have died in South Africa. We are going to 
march peacefully and it is the responsibility of the government 
and the police to see that we are protected." 
  No arms would be carried by marchers as Monday was a day of 
mourning but the IFP could not prevent the carrying of 
traditional weapons. 
  Asked whether the stayaway applied only to IFP members, IFP 
Youth Treasurer Mthandeni Mkhize said: "Non-IFP members are not 
free to come to work. The ANC has enforced stawyayas like this 
before. Journalists, students and civil workers are exempted. 
Everyone else has to stay at home." 
  Asked how the IFP would enforce a stayaway by non-IFP 
members 
who wanted to come to work, Mr Loliwe said: "That is our 
secret. We will not tell you how we will make this stawayay 
successful, but it will be successful, I assure you. People 
come to work on Monday at their own risk. We are going to 
ensure people do not come to work." 
  IFP media spokesman Sipho Magubane said Putco [Public 
Utility 
Transport Corporation] would be asked to stop its bus services 
during the stayaway. "It is well-known that taxis will not come 
to town and we do not believe people will take the trains." 
  The campaign would show the`world, which had been led to 
believe that all South Africans wanted the elections, that this 
was not true. 
  Angered by journalists' persistent questions on whether the 
IFP wanted war or peace and if its campaign was a declaration of 
war, Mr Mhikze snapped: "If the government or the ANC attack 
us, this country is going the same way as Bosnia." 
  Mr Loliwe said there would be no free and fair elections 
until the government and the ANC met IFP demands. "From the end 
of the stayaway, rolling mass action will begin and continue 
until the election. This is the start off our struggle," said 
Mr Magubane. 
  Within hours of the press conference, SAP [South African 
Police] Gen Koos Calitz banned marches and gatherings in various 
Witwatersrand magisterial districts, including the planned 
Library Garden gathering and the marches to the ANC headquarters 
and to John Vorster Square. "Members of the public as well as 
shopkeepers in the Johannesburg CBD [Central Business District] 
are apprehensive about the intended IFP march planned for April 
18. The SAP will be out in force," said police spokesman Lt-Col 
Eugene Opperman.

<F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] The release of the R39bn [billions of rands] figure 
for spending on the ANC's reconstruction and development 
programme [RDP] over five years has been greeted with a cautious 
welcome from economists, while politicians have rejected it as 
misleading. Economists said the figure appeared moderate and 
could augur well for future budget deficits, but noted it was 
not yet clear what it comprised and exactly how it would be 
financed. Politicians slated the figure as an understatement of 
the true cost of the programme. 
  NP [National Party] spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk said 
the R39bn figure was a "deliberate and spectacular 
underestimate". Preliminary results of an independent study 
costing the programme indicated that about R75bn would have to 
be spent in the first year alone. The study, commissioned by 
the NP two months ago, would be published next week. He called 
on the ANC to release full details of its own costing, and how 
it had been arrived at, so people could decide whether it was 
convincing. "The time has finally come for a serious public 
debate about how much voters will have to pay for the ANC's 
promises." 
  The ANC plans to release a detailed study of costs and 
priorities, drawn up by the National Institute for Economic 
Policy, after 22 April. Institute head Max Sisulu said that was 
the date scheduled for handing over the study to the 
ANC/COSATU[Congress of South African Trade Unions]/SACP [South 
African Communist Party] alliance leadership. The R39bn figure 
quoted by ANC economics head Trevor Manuel represented new 
outlays over and above existing social expenditure by the state. 
It could be financed by a variety of sources, ranging from 
cutting other budget items to introducing user charges. 
  Rand Merchant Bank economist Rudolf Gouws told a Centre for 
Policy Studies seminar in Johannesburg yesterday that he 
welcomed the release of the spending figure as it would help 
bankers convince foreign investors that government would not 
"explode the deficit to 10 percent." 
  ANC parliamentary candidate Alec Erwin, speaking at the same 
seminar, said it would take at least another 10 years for the 
vision outlined in the RDP to come to final fruition. He said 
there was a misunderstanding that the state would carry out the 
entire programme. He reiterated that an process of consultation 
was being conducted with the private sector, and boasted that 
its expertise would be harnessed through the National Economic 
Forum in drawing up the Budget. He appealed to business people 
to "talk hard and talk fast" if they had any problems with the 
programme. 
  Witwatersrand University professor Charles Simkins warned 
that the next government might be so preoccupied with managing a 
balance of payments crisis that the aims of the RDP would get 
let behind. SA would not be able to sustain the economic upswing 
without further IMF loans, which meant economic policy 
conditions would be imposed on the country. 
  SAPA reports that the DP finance spokesman Ken Andrew said 
the omission from the ANC's plans of a commitment to contain the 
budget deficit confirmed the DP's fears that an ANC government 
would mortgage SA's future by borrowing excessively to finance 
its extravagant promises.

<F P=106> [Report by S. Denny] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Thursday [14 April] demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of the visa of visiting American David Duke, a former 
member of the Ku Klux Klan and avowed right-winger. Mr Duke, a 
former U.S. congressional candidate, arrived in South Africa on 
Tuesday on a private visit. 
  "His purpose here seems to be to stoke up the war psychosis 
which has already been ignited by a broad coalition of black and 
white right-wing extremists," the ANC said in a statement in 
Johannesburg. 
  "He said on his arrival there had not been 300 years of 
oppression (in South Africa), but years of opportunity. 
  "This country would be better off without this sort of 
malicious meddling in our affairs," the ANC said. South Africans 
did not need Mr Duke, the ANC said, adding that he should not be 
given time on radio or television to air his "noxious" views. 
  "The ANC demands the immediate withdrawal of his visit 
permit 
to South Africa."

<F P=106> [Report by A Thomson] </F>
  [Text] Mmabatho April 14 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana Joint 
Administrator Tjaart van der Walt on Thursday [14 April] night 
refuted a report that the homeland was on the brink of going out 
of control. A South African Broadcasting Corporation [SABC] 
report quoted Dr van der Walt's co-administrator Mr Job Mokgoro 
as saying dissatisfied policemen in Mmabatho were demanding 
payment of their pensions, law and order was threatened and this 
month's elections could be affected. 
  Reacting to rumours that some policemen loyal to the deposed 
government of Mr Lucas Mangope were threatening trouble during 
the elections, Mr Mokgoro said sentiments expressed at a meeting 
with policemen in Mmabatho on Thursday morning confirmed the 
possibility of loyalty to the old order. He said the 
Transitional Executive Council had been informed about the 
deterioration of the situation in the homeland. 
  Dr van der Walt said he had attended the meeting with about 
500 policemen and he had "not the least doubt" that the 
Bophuthatswana police were committed to being officers of the 
law, with responsibility to the community. After hearing the 
SABC report, Dr van der Walt continued, he had held talks with 
the acting commissioner of the Bophuthatswana Police and the 
acting chief of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, as well as the 
officer commanding the South African Defence Force contingent in 
the territory. "They were unanimous that, of course, the 
situation in Bophuthatswana is volatile, but definitely not out 
of control," he said. "There are all kinds of political 
tensions and we are very much concerned about the efficiency of 
the public service but, for example, the crime rate is lower 
than it was a year ago. There is no need for panic." 
  Regarding the elections, Dr van der Walt said: "If the 
public 
service isn't functioning effectively it will be difficult to 
have free and fair elections. However, we are sure the tide is 
turning." 
  On Tuesday the Executive Council Task Force on the Public 
Service held talks with the joint administrators, and a council 
for administration was established in the homeland. 
  "We are certainly making progress. Yesterday (Wednesday) 
morning I met (Dr) Frank Chikane of the Independent Electoral 
Commission and both of us don't have the least doubt we will 
have free and fair elections. "We still have to solve some 
problems, that we don't deny, but the situation has improved 
over the past few weeks." 
  Dr van der Walt said he had not yet had the opportunity to 
discuss the SABC report with Mr Mokgoro.

  [Text] A group of about 70 Lebowa state officials have 
occupied the officers of the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] in Pretoria. A spokesman for the Health and Education 
Workers' Union, NEHAWU, said that the group would stay there 
until the TEC management committee had addressed their 
grievances. 
  The group say the situation in Lebowa has deteriorated since 
Minister of Regional and Land Affairs Mr. Andre Fourie took over 
the administration duties of the territory. They've asked for 
Mr. Fourie to be replaced by a neutral administrator and for 
their promotions to come into affect immediately.

<F P=106> [Report by Sello Motlhabakwe] </F>
  [Text] The ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of 
the Nation; MK], would not be deployed in any capacity in Natal 
should guerrilla activity arise in the province in the 
post-election period, MK commissar Andrew Masondo said 
yesterday. He said the issue of deploying counter-insurgency 
forces in the province would have to be dealt with by the new 
Parliament, which would be in command of the integrated armed 
force. The ANC's force would not be in existence after the 
current process of integration into a new defence force, Masondo 
said. 
  Camps to which MK members were reporting in the run-up to 
amalgation into the new force had a strict code of conduct 
designed to avoid a possible repeat of the problems encountered 
with the National Peacekeeping Force in Bloemfontein, he said. 
Men and women at assembly points would undergo a three- to 
six-month training period in preparation for their non-partisan 
role in the SA National Defence Force. 
  Masondo said all the armed forces in the country would have 
to undergo an orientation period to create a single, unified 
army. Training would ensure and maintain professional standards 
so that the army could meet national and international 
obligations. The top command would be determined by the new 
president, he said. 
  He said 16,000 MK troops would assemble at various assembly 
points identified in conjuction with the present SA Defence 
Force [SADF] and the Joint Military Co-ordinating Council. 
  An advance party of 400 cadres were already in the camps 
preparing to receive 8,000 others who would report next week. 
The assembly points would also be administered by MK 
commanders. Recruits were currently assembling at Walmansthal 
north of Pretoria, Bourke's Luck in the eastern Transvaal and 
Hoedspruit in the western Transvaal. MK military hardware 
stored in the neighbouring states would be brought home and 
would be added to the national arms inventory, he said. This 
would be done according to a formula drawn up in discussions 
with the SADF. Joint security mechanisms had been agreed on by 
the Joint Military Co-ordinating Council, Masondo said.

  [Text] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has 
confirmed that Zulus are being trained on the farm of Mr. Eugene 
Terreblanche at Ventersdorp in the Western Transvaal. This 
follows an eyewitness report from the ANC that at least one 
busload of Zulus had been seen arriving at the farm of the AWB 
leader. Earlier Mr. Terreblanche told a newspaper that he was 
providing training for what he termed nonwhites who were opposed 
to communism. Mr. Fred Rundell of the AWB confirmed the reports 
but would not say if the Zulus were members of the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] or if the training enjoyed the support of the 
Zulu king.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  ANC's Economic Plan -- The financing of the ANC's 
Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) "is certainly in 
the realm of the possible," says a page-12 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 15 April. Higher economic 
growth could provide "at least R(rand)3 billion," and cutting 
the defense budget "may yield R2 billion -- though many wonder 
just how much more can be pared from that bone that is needed 
for policing." However, "hard-nosed local and foreign 
businessmen may still find the lack of financial detail 
puzzling; likewise the promises of no tax increases and a tight 
reign on the deficit. True, overall taxation may not increase 
but that doesn't exclude juggling around with an increased tax 
burden on the wealthy while lifting that on the poor." "The 
ANC's admission that it doesn't yet have all the answers and 
won't be prescriptive is heartening. So is the softening of the 
populist rhetoric of the first few RDP drafts. Still, there 
remains too much emphasis on the role of the State and 
insufficient recognition of how the market economy works. But 
much of this could change after the election." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Irresponsible To Boycott Elections, Encourage War Talk -- 
"The dangers facing the holding of elections increase by the 
day," begins a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 15 April. "No mediation in our view will now solve 
the problem. What the country needs at this late hour are low 
profile attempts at bringing the contending parties closer. It 
is difficult even at individual level to think that one of the 
option is to sit the whole thing out and do nothing. It is even 
more irresponsible to encourage war talk." The "black 
population" is paying for the mistakes of the past "in lives 
lost every day, a situation that is likely to increase 
dramatically in the next two weeks. It is for this reason that 
we are forced to continue trying in whatever way possible to 
bring about peace." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Election `Issues' -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN in 
English for 15-21 April says in a page-14 editorial "it is worth 
trying to cut through the agency-created images and slip-off-the 
tongue slogans and focus attention on the real issues of the 
election. Among them are: "Who can deliver on the promises of 
socio-economic reform," peace, human rights, good governance, 
and gender issues? However, "there are some `issues' one can 
readily dismiss. The National Party [NP] is trying to make an 
issue of the ANC's alliance with the SA Communist Party -- old 
Reds in the bed campaigning that is peripheral to this election. 
The NP is also trying to make much of its own experience and 
skills, in contrast to the ANC's lack; but to take this 
seriously you have to forget that most of the NP's experience is 
in segregating, repressing, removing houses, destroying 
education and facilitating corruption. You also have to swallow 
the fact that if the NP's opposition lacks experience, its 
because the NP ruthlessly prevented anyone from getting that 
experience."

  [Text] Today's news also concerns the flight of the clique 
of killers, who are currently stuck at Burundi International 
Airport. Let us recall who they are: There is Ferdinand 
Nahimana, whom you know, who was minister of higher education 
and scientific research. He belongs to the Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic [MRND-CDR] and is known for dividing Rwandans. 
He made this the law of Rwanda and the law became MRND ideology. 
  You also know Simeon Nteziryayo, minister at the Presidency. 
He was too powerful in the office of the president recently. 
There is Cyprien Munyankundu, secretary general of the National 
Assembly that was imposed by the president. The head of the 
deputies, Theodore Sindikubwayo, is the one who imposed himself 
as president of the Republic. 
  There is Faustin Ruzindana, (Fidel Ntuyenabo), and Supreme 
Court President Alphonse Marie Nkubito, who is among those who 
fought for change, who fought the dictatorship. He escaped the 
presidential guard killers. 
  There is also Lieutenant Colonel Charles Uwihoreye and Mrs. 
Casimir Bizimungu, wife of former Health Minister Casimir 
Bizimungu, who is a staunch member of the MRND-CDR. He is not 
in Burundi; he fled to Zaire. There is Daniel Mbangura who was 
minister of higher education and scientific research. You know 
him. He belongs to the MRND-CDR. There is Mrs. Deo Nsabimana, 
wife of Major General Deo Nsabimana, who was chief of staff of 
the Rwandan Armed Forces. He died in the crash with the Rwandan 
and Burundi presidents on 6 April. There is Mrs. Sylvestre 
Nsanzimana, wife of the former prime minister of the first 
coalition government and Mrs. Pascal Ndengejeho, wife of 
Ndengejeho of the Republican democratic movement, who is known 
to have refused to take part in the government of the late 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana. There is Mrs. Faustin Maniraho, Mrs. 
Felicien Kabuga, wife of Kabuga, head of the divisionist 
Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines radio, and Mrs. 
Ntagerura, wife of former Transport and Communications Minister 
Ntagerura, a staunch MRND-CDR member. All these people have 
fled. 
  So, the clique of killers has fled along with its families. 
The clique which started the war has fled. They have left the 
Rwandan youth they sent to war behind. Those who are still 
fighting for the clique, why are you fighting now that those you 
fought for have left you at the front? What is the relationship 
between you and those who left you at the war front? Unite with 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to search for all those who 
supported the clique wherever they are, whether in the communes 
of (Bicumbi), Gikoro, and elsewhere.

  [Text] A new party has been created called the Action Front 
for Renewal and Development-Alafia [Front d'Action pour le 
Renouveau et le Developpement-Alafia, FARD-Alafia]. Its 
constituent assembly was held in Parakou on 2 and 3 April. 
During the deliberations, the party's activists from the 
country's six regions studied and adopted the basic documents of 
the party. They also analyzed the political, economic, and 
social situation on the national and international levels. 
  According to its communique, the FARD-Alafia is determined 
to 
go beyond its ambition of just creating a microparty. It will 
contribute to the creation of viable macroparties to rally and 
organize Beninese citizens in the respect of the Constitution 
and the laws of the Republic. The FARD-Alafia activists are 
determined to engage in common thoughts and actions to fulfill 
the tasks of nation building and the advent of a new Benin, full 
of hope, the communique further stated. It concluded that the 
FARD-Alafia is a national party that will bring the sons of 
Benin together and make them join hands to face all challenges, 
especially that of the devaluation of the CFA franc, and other 
national problems. 
  The FARD-Alafia is composed of a 21-member executive bureau 
including its general secretary, Dr. (Salif Aka). The new party 
is at the forefront of the political scene with five deputies at 
the National Assembly.

<F P=106> [Debate between State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC </F>
President Nelson Mandela at the Johannesburg Civic Center 
Complex, chaired by SABC political reporter Freek Robinson, with 
panelists SABC radio correspondent Ferial Haffejee, SABC 
political correspondent Lester Venter, SABC announcer Tim 
Modise, and BBC foreign editor John Simpson -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Good evening and welcome to the Civic 
Theater in Johannesburg for this historic debate between two 
South African leaders of international stature. Both are 
recipients of last year's Nobel Peace Prize and the American 
Liberty Award. Both are certain to be part of a new government 
of national unity. Their position in that government will be 
determined in South Africa's first nonracial election, now only 
12 days away. Twenty-six parties are in the race. Tonight, for 
the first time, these two prominent leaders square up in public 
debate. We present to you F.W. de Klerk of the National Party 
[NP] and Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress. The 
debate will start with opening statements, followed by questions 
from a panel of journalists. They are Tim Modise of Radio 
Metro, Ferial Haffejee of SABC radio -- and of course, this 
broadcast is also going out live on radio -- Lester Venter, the 
SABC's political correspondent, and John Simpson, foreign editor 
of the BBC. The toss of a coin determined that Mr. De Klerk 
will start. Mr. Mandela will make the last closing statement. 
Mr. De Klerk, you have the opportunity now of three minutes. 
  [De Klerk] Goeienaand [good evening], good evening, 
sanibonani [good evening], dumelang [good evening]. In less 
than two weeks, the South African nation will go to the polls, 
for the first time ever really together, as a nation. As the 
state president, it has been my privilege to lead the process 
which brought us to this historic moment. In that, I have been 
assisted by leaders from many other parties, also Mr. Mandela 
here, and I pay tribute also to them. 
  I promised when I took office to guide South Africa to a new 
era. I promised to end apartheid. I promised to release Mr. 
Nelson Mandela. I promised a new constitution through 
negotiation. I promised a free and fair election in which all 
South Africans can participate with an equal vote. I promised 
justice to all. I have kept that promise, and this has brought 
us to a new beginning. The years of apartheid are over. A new 
beginning awaits a new South Africa. Your vote will decide 
whether that new beginning is a good one or a bad one. It will 
be a good new beginning if the result of the election achieves a 
balance of power between the two main contenders, the NP and the 
ANC. If any one party gets too much power, it will be a bad 
beginning, bad, also, for all South Africa. Our people who are 
going to vote have the choice to make it a good beginning or a 
bad one. The electorate in South Africa are deeply concerned 
about a number of issues. Time only allows me briefly to deal 
with two. I hope that during question time we can come back to 
it. Our people are concerned about their jobs, about their 
prosperity. They are concerned, deeply concerned, about the 
social services and the lack of it, and they are concerned about 
violence. If you vote for the new NP you will enable me to 
continue with my task to bring conciliation, reconciliation, and 
thus, peace and prosperity to our country and all its people. I 
look forward to cooperate. 
  [Robinson] Thank you. Thank you Mr. de Klerk. [applause] 
Mr. Mandela, you now have the opportunity of three minutes for 
an opening statement. 
  [Mandela] My fellow South Africans. It is an honor for me to 
appear here tonight on the eve of a historic election, when many 
South Africans will claim...[pauses] reclaim their hopes for a 
better life. I am humble to represent the work and struggle of 
so many people who made democracy a reality in our country. It 
is their good work that inspired me every day during those 27 
years of my prison life. It is that good work that inspires me 
tonight. I will resist the temptation to deal with issues which 
are unimportant. 
  There is much at stake in this election, and I must use this 
opportunity to state very clearly the very differences between 
ourselves on our approach to the major national issues facing 
this country. Those of you who are watching this discussion at 
your homes, look to us to exercise effective leadership worthy 
of the contribution and the sacrifices that we have made just to 
bring about a little improvement in your own family, in the 
difficult situation in which we live. The African National 
Congress has put forward a thorough and realizable program of 
action. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Mandela. We must leave it there. 
Now...[applause] Thank you. Now questions from our panel. The 
two parties have agreed on a format in which the answers and 
questions will be bound strictly by time. A candidate has two 
minutes to answer a question from the panel. His opponent will 
have two minutes to respond. Each will then get one minute to 
make further statements. We start with Tim Modise putting the 
first question to Mr. de Klerk. Tim. 
  [Modise] Well, thank you, Freek. Question to Mr. de Klerk: 
Mr. De Klerk, violence, both political and criminal, poses a 
number one threat to the elections, and over the past few years 
it has continued unabated, and seemingly the government is 
unable to deal with it. With that kind of record, as still 
incumbent president, what guarantees do you give the electorate 
tonight that violence will not get completely out of hand and 
thus subvert the forthcoming elections? 
  [De Klerk] Thank you for the question, Tim. Let me start 
out by saying I disagree with the analysis that the government 
is not dealing effectively with it. Yes, there is too much 
violence, but the government has taken extensive steps to deal 
with it. In kwaZulu-Natal there is a state of emergency. In 
the other trouble spot in South Africa, the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, but specifically Johannesburg 
and surrounds, 11 districts have been declared as unrest areas. 
We've increased the police force by almost from 75,000 to round 
about 100,000. 
  The government is taking whatever steps are possible, but 
its 
task has been made very difficult by, inter alia, our main 
opponent, the ANC, by their demonizing of the police force, by 
driving a wedge between communities and the police force. Our 
task has been made extremely difficult by the continued 
existence and activities of the self- defense units and of 
activities also of supporters of the ANC. I sit here with eight 
extracts from the Goldstone reports, showing that the violence 
in all eight instances -- and they were serious instances -- in 
all eight instances was attributed to ANC supporters and Inkatha 
supporters at each others' throats. That is not an easy problem 
to solve. The government has done its duty in that regard. 
  If we look at the future, I believe that the election will 
lay a basis for real reconciliation in South Africa. The 
electoral strife will be over. It will be clear who are the 
winners, who are the strong parties, and in a government of 
national unity our approach will be to take hands with all those 
who serve with us, and jointly to continue to deal with the 
problem of violence. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. De Klerk. [applause] Mr. Mandela, 
your response in two minutes. 
  [Mandela] I deal with this question on the basis that it is 
the duty of the leadership to put before the public a total 
picture. Any leader who is merely promoting the point of view of 
his political party is not a leader who is going to help to pull 
out South Africa from this mess. What I find unacceptable is 
the fact that the president should misquote the report of Mr. 
Goldstone, because if you look at his report, the police are 
deeply involved in this violence. You have one of the top 
police officers who has been suspended from his duties, 
precisely because there are serious allegations against him, of 
gun-running, of working with murderers, to murder innocent 
people. I have discussed these issues with Mr. De Klerk on a 
one-on-one basis, confidentially, provided him with evidence of 
the activities of his police. There is one thing he does not 
want to know; there is one thing that he covers very stubbornly, 
and that is the involvement of senior police officials in this 
violence. That is the proof. That is the total picture. 
[applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk? Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. A 
rebuttal from you, Mr. De Klerk. 
  [De Klerk] Yes. The fact of the matter is that the Goldstone 
Commission was an initiative of the government, and I have 
constantly said if there is any evidence of any involvement of 
any members of the security forces in the fomenting of violence, 
of them being partisan, of them being involved in violence and 
political acts, then it must be reported to the Goldstone 
Commission, and the Goldstone Commission, when it brought out 
its report, I immediately acted. Can the ANC say the same with 
regard to people who have been implicated by the Goldstone 
Commission? They are high on the ANC's candidate lists. We 
have taken, and will continue to take, firm action, if there is 
any evidence. Lastly, the Goldstone report, in this instance, 
referred to a small group of people. It does not refer to the 
whole police force, and Judge Goldstone went out of his way to 
emphasize that it is not the police force as such which is 
involved. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, a final reply from you in one 
minute. 
  [Mandela] Well, again Mr. de Klerk is not putting accurately 
the report from Mr. Goldstone, because that report, whilst it 
accepts that there are many policemen who are good, has actually 
laid grave charges against senior police officers and I don't 
accept the explanation which the state president has given. He 
has much to explain than he has done. He is less than candid in 
putting facts before the public. [applause] 
  [Robinson] I'm afraid there is no time left to have further 
explanation on that particular issue. I now invite Ferial 
Haffejee of SABC radio to put her question to Mr. Mandela. 
  [Haffejee] Good evening, Mr. Mandela. 
  [Mandela] Good evening. 
  [Haffejee] Everywhere you've gone on your election campaign 
trail, you've promised--and people have demanded--jobs, houses, 
and peace. But 7 million people don't have jobs, 3 million 
don't have homes, and almost 300 people have died in political 
and criminal violence in this month alone. Has yours been an 
election campaign been a campaign trail of empty promises? 
  [Mandela] Not at all. We have got a plan to build a better 
life for all South Africans, and a better life means housing, 
jobs, free college education, hospital services. We believe 
that these are realizable. The present budget of South Africa 
is 126 billion rands. Last year, the National Party government 
paid 10 billion rands for arms, guns, and tanks and only 2 
million...[pauses] billion, for houses. 
  We are going to rearrange the budget so that we can be able 
to address the basic needs of the masses of the people. We 
believe that we have a very clear plan which has been discussed 
not only with members of the liberation movements but with 
government departments, with business, with academics, state 
corporations, all of whom regard this plan as being reasonable 
and which they support. For that reason we say that our plan is 
realizable. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk ...[applause] Mr. de Klerk.... Thank 
you. Mr. de Klerk, your response in two minutes. 
  [De Klerk] The National Party and the ANC have been 
promising 
very much the same things. We also promise houses, we also 
promise better education, better health facilities, and more 
jobs. The real test is: Who has a plan which can achieve it? 
And I say that the National Party has a plan which can work 
because we can only achieve that if we have dynamic economic 
growth, and we can only have dynamic economic growth if we get 
investments, and we'll only get investments and new factories 
being built and increased economic activity if we follow 
economic policies which are in step with our policy, because our 
policy is in step with the economic policies which have 
succeeded across this world. 
  The ANC's policy is riddled with that which has failed. It 
is riddled still with clinging to nationalization. You won't 
get investments as long as that is the case. The ANC continues 
to talk about stronger government intervention and more central 
... centralist control. Those economic policies will not 
succeed in generating the wealth which we need. The ANC's plan 
is going to cost much more than they indicate. 
  I've had an independent investigation done. In the first 
year, implementation of that plan will cost 70 billion rand. 
That 70 billion rand is just a little bit less than the total 
income from personal income tax of the state. It means that the 
taxpayers' income tax will be doubled if we have to raise the 70 
billion and that their tax on cigarettes, on beer, on petrol 
will also be doubled. It is not affordable and 
therefore...[pauses] and you can't save it from the defense 
budget. Mr. Mandela is bringing in 12,000 new MK's [Umkhonto we 
Sizwe -- ANC Military Wing] into the defense force. The defense 
budget is going to rise and not deplete, therefore, we will have 
to generate wealth and that is the only way. 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, the clock demands that I stop you 
there. Mr. Mandela, you can respond in one minute. 
  [Mandela] This is the reply of a man who is not used to 
addressing the basic needs of the majority of the population, 
whose government is committed to a small minority. He is 
alarmed that we have to devote so much resources to blacks, 
whose concerns they don't care for. 
  [Robinson] Ladies and gentlemen, can I please ask you to 
give 
Mr. Mandela an opportunity. We've agreed there will be no 
interjections. Thank you, Mr. Mandela. Go ahead. 
  [Mandela] That is the reason why Mr. de Klerk has consulted 
some unspecified people to conduct a study. Again, I say Mr. de 
Klerk is less than candid in analyzing national issues. We have 
produced at length, we have circulated to everybody, including 
government officials. Where is their plan? Where is it? 
[applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, you have one minute. Thank you, 
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. One minute. 
  [De Klerk] Mr. Mandela, our plan is absolutely on the table, 
and it has been accepted by the National Housing Forum. It was 
basically impeded by the ANC and ANC-supported organizations. 
They did not want the plan to be realized. We have a plan 
which will draw in those billions of rands from the private 
sector. We have a good housing plan on the table, which will 
achieve all those results. I care for all South Africans, 
irrespective of their race or color. 
  But let me say, Mr. Mandela, my comments were not the 
comments of a man who is less than candid. They were the 
comments of somebody with experience, of somebody who sat in the 
cabinet and worked through budgets since 1978, and who knows how 
the economy of the state works. And there is... No, it wasn't 
apartheid. We abolished apartheid, we made the country free, 
we...[applause] 
  [Robinson] Ladies and gentlemen, please give him an 
opportunity. 
  [De Klerk] I'm giving you the assurance, when you share 
responsibility in that government of national unity, you will 
realize that we have over the past 4 years already cut the 
budget to the bone. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. de Klerk. Lester Venter, our 
political correspondent, has the opportunity now to put a 
question to Mr. de Klerk. 
  [Venter] Thank you, Freek. Mr. de Klerk, you said earlier 
that the election will determine which is the strongest party. 
Now if that is not the NP, then in two weeks' time you will be 
a former state president of South Africa, and in fact that will 
be a direct consequence of the process that you yourself set in 
motion four years ago. 
  But of the many consequences to be counted in that process, 
South Africa today is one of the most violent places in the 
world. You've accused your political adversaries of bringing 
into government an out-dated ideology -- namely, communism 
itself. As you stand today with these prospects ahead of you, 
are you happy with the way things have turned out for that 
process that you set in motion, and are you content, in fact, to 
now take a subservient role if it so turns out in that 
government? 
  [De Klerk] Thank you, Lester. Let me start out by saying the 
NP has become the most representative nonracial party in South 
Africa. We are growing by the day, and we are going to come up 
with a dramatic result, so don't be too sure in the assumptions 
that you've made. But if the ANC turns out to be the party with 
the largest slice of the vote, we'll firstly be very near to 
them. Second, I will become executive deputy president, not at 
the behest of the ANC, but in terms of the constitution, and I 
will be representing, in that government of national unity, 
proudly, millions and millions of moderate South Africans, and I 
will be putting their case, and I will be looking after their 
interests, and I will be cooperating with the other parties, 
because that is what the government of national unity is about, 
that we should rise above our political differences and address 
the challenges which we face in this country, address the needs 
of all our people. 
  It is in that spirit that I say, yes, I'm happy with the way 
it has turned out. There was no other alternative for South 
Africa. We were on the road to total confrontation, which would 
have annihilated everything which has been built up in this 
country. We have negotiated a good, balanced constitution with 
checks and balances. The power of politicians are effectively 
limited. There will not be any form of suppression. The courts 
will be independent. We have a good bill of rights in that 
constitution. There will be power-sharing, there will be 
devolution, there will be federalism. Yes, I'm happy with what 
we achieved, and I have confidence in the future. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela your reply. 
  [Mandela] It is a source of great concern when those who 
claim to be experienced make vague and starry-eyed claims which 
have no basis, whatsoever. I must say that the African National 
Congress is an organization with more than 80 years of building 
national unity in this country. [applause] 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Thank, you. Thank you. 
  [Mandela, continuing] There is no organization in this 
country as divisive as the so-called New National Party of my 
friend on my left. It is actually promoting racial hatred. I 
hope...[audience murmurs] 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Please, ladies and gentlemen. 
Please. 
  [Mandela, continuing] I hope I'll be able to demonstrate now 
how they are trying to turn the colored community against the 
African people...[audience murmurs] through slogans which are 
totally without foundation and where the Independent Elections 
Commission has condemned the National Party for promoting 
inflammatory and racist attitudes in the community. That is the 
so-called New National Party. That is the false claim of 
building unity which my friend is making. I reject that 
totally. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk you have one minute to reply. 
  [De Klerk] I would like to start out by telling Mr. Mandela 
that the National Party support base amongst the so-called 
coloreds is a spontaneous, warm, and very strong support base. 
We have proven, in our relationship within the party, that 
reconciliation can work. I didn't have to intervene as leader 
to get a colored person appointed into an important position in 
the Western Cape as Mr. Mandela had to do because his own 
supporters wouldn't elect one. We have a good relationship and 
the colored are our people, my people. They are South Africans. 
They are wonderful people, and I totally reject the accusation 
that the National Party is racist. I don't have 150,000-rand 
fines against me in the National Party for intimidation, as the 
ANC now has. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk, time demands that we stop there. 
Mr. Mandela, a final rebuttal from yourself. 
  [Mandela] This document, Die Winde van Verandering [The 
Winds 
of Change], is full of the most scandalous, outrageous, racist 
allegations, where they say the slogan of the African National 
Congress is: Kill the coloreds, kill the Boer. I challenge Mr. 
De Klerk to renounce that statement now. 
  [De Klerk, interrupting] I have, last night. 
  [Mandela, continuing] If he is less than candid. Last night, 
when you knew you were coming to this debate. [applause, 
laughter] 
  [Robinson] We must leave it there -- unfortunately, as we've 
agreed in the format of this program. And now we go to John 
Simpson, the foreign editor of the BBC to put his question to 
Mr. Mandela. 
  [Simpson] Mr. Mandela I hope you'll forgive my being frank. 
I'm thinking very much of the kind of people who are watching 
this program in other countries than South Africa. Many of them 
are going to see the National Party [as heard] as a party with a 
past that has not always been very good, or very democratic, not 
always been nonviolent in many ways, even within its own 
organization. They are going to see that you've made a number of 
very large election promises which have raised the expectations 
of people a great deal in this country and they are going to 
wonder, frankly, whether South Africa under your presidency 
won't be heading down the same road that many other countries in 
black Africa have. Will you...will you, for instance, borrow 
money on the scale that so many other countries have -- Zimbabwe 
for instance. How will you deal with this problem? 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela? 
  [Mandela] South Africa is not a poor country. As I have 
said, our budget this year is 126 billion rands. We also are 
going to reorganize the budget, restructure the budget, in order 
to avoid the wastage of apartheid. We will be able to use the 
country's resources in a more efficient manner, and to prevent 
the corruption which is so endemic in the NP government. 
  [Robinson] Please, ladies and gentlemen... 
  [Mandela] The gravy train where most of the funds of the 
country had gone has come to an end. We have committed 
ourselves to leaders trying to lead a style of life similar to 
those of the community. We are going...[pauses] I am going to 
suggest that my own salary, if I am elected as state president, 
must be cut. [applause] I am doing that, unlike the NP 
government, which has paid, attempted to pay, large sums to the 
director generals when there are 5 million people unemployed, 
when there are 7 million people without houses. We are not 
going to live like fat cats. My friends in the NP can do that. 
That's what they know. 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk? A response from Mr. de Klerk. 
  [De Klerk] May I at the outset say that our deficit before 
borrowing is much too high. If we want to be in step and 
attract foreign investment and be sure of the support of the IMF 
and the World Bank, we will have to continue in South Africa to 
maintain strict fiscal and financial discipline. This is what 
the government has@?en doing. By doing it and by taking other 
steps we brought down the inflation rate to single-digit 
figures, and soon it might be 7 percent. We've brought down 
interest rates. All our economic indicators are pointing in the 
right direction. 
  I'm very glad to hear that in the government of national 
unity I will have the support of Mr. Mandela in being frugal 
with regard to government expenses, but then we must be frugal 
across the board, because it is at the moment organizations 
allied to the ANC who are once again doing damage to the South 
African economy by strikes with regard to various disciplines. 
And through those strikes they are first helping to create an 
atmosphere which is not conducive to free and fair elections, 
and second, they are harming the economic interests of the 
country. So I'm glad to hear that he's committed to fiscal and 
financial discipline. He won't have any difficulty with me in 
achieving that, but if he thinks that he can save on the salary 
of politicians enough to solve the economic challenges which we 
have in South Africa, then he's in for a big surprise. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Thank you for your cooperation. Mr. Mandela, you 
can have a rebuttal. 
  [Mandela] Obviously Mr. de Klerk was not listening when I 
was 
speaking. I may as well add that I'm happy he is going to 
cooperate with me if I say a state president should pay a tax on 
his income, on his resources, on his purse. That is what heads 
of state do throughout the Western world, not in South Africa. 
We are also going to issue government bonds, reconstruction 
bonds, both in South Africa and abroad, to raise the funds that 
we need. We are going to impose a fair tax to be paid by 
everybody. All these are going to help to get revenue for the 
country, but we are not going to live like fat cats. The days 
of the gravy trains are gone. Everybody should know that. 
[applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, your final reply. 
  [De Klerk] I was under the impression that the ANC has 
promised lower taxes for everybody in its manifesto. Bonds 
which you raise also carry interest with them. One of the 
biggest problems of South Africa is that the fastest growing 
item in our budget has been the interest on loans. Every loan 
that you take out needs to be repaid, and who repays it? The 
taxpayer. Therefore, we need across the board to ensure that we 
maintain fiscal discipline. That is the economic solution for 
the future. I've been listening very carefully to what Mr. 
Mandela has said, and I'm very glad that we're going to have a 
government of national unity, because it is clear that our 
experience will be absolutely essential if we want to have good 
government in South Africa. 
  [Robinson] We now move on to the next question. John 
Simpson again of the BBC, foreign editor. Your question now to 
Mr. De Klerk. 
  [Simpson] Another frank one, if I may. In February 1990, you 
assured white voters that they would have a part to play in the 
future political development of the country. At the end of your 
negotiations with the ANC, Mr. Joe Slovo of the ANC-South 
African Communist Party came out and said, I think, the Nats 
[National Party] caved in at the end. By 1999, perhaps earlier, 
you won't be part of the national...[pauses] of the government 
of national unity. Is it possible, do you think, that whites in 
South Africa will then perform the same function that they do 
in, say, Kenya or Zimbabwe, that's to say they earn the money, 
earn some of the money, but they don't have any part to play, 
whatever, in the political process of the country? 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk? 
  [De Klerk] The answer is a frank no. I'm white, but I'm no 
longer the leader of a white party. I don't represent white 
interests. I represent a value system and my party has support 
across the board from all population groups, colors [pauses] 
...colors, creeds, and races in South Africa. If my party is 
not the biggest party in this election, it will definitely be so 
in the next election. [applause] And the whites within the 
National Party and many other whites, also supporting other 
parties like the DP [Democratic Party], don't look upon 
themselves as a little group of people who are going to sit in a 
corner, divorcing themselves of South Africa and its problems 
and its people. We are part of a South African nation. Color 
in the National Party's vocabulary has become unimportant. What 
is important is: What do you believe in? We believe in free 
enterprise. We believe in good family values. We believe in 
real peace. We believe in reconciliation. We believe in 
Christian norms and standards and that is bringing together all 
the people across the old divisions from all the population 
groups, into our party, and that is giving an impetus to our 
party which assures that for those who believe in this value 
system, which has proven itself across the world, which is in 
step with the successful part of the world, will become the 
dominant political factor. The ANC is a conglomeration. It's 
going to rip apart because they don't have a clear philosophy. 
They live in the past. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Your reply, Mr. Mandela. You have two minutes. 
  [Mandela] It is quite clear that we are dealing with 
somebody 
who either does not know what he is talking about. If he does 
what he...[pauses] if he does know what he is talking about, he 
does not care. In the first place, it's a false statement to 
suggest that any one individual started the negotiation process 
in February. Everybody knows that negotiation is the result of 
the suffering of the masses of the people [applause] -- 
supported by the international community. It is them who came 
out to the streets, called strikes, boycotts, who were shot and 
killed by the racist security police of the National Party, who 
threw us in jail, who turned our lives into nightmares. Those 
are the forces who have brought about these changes in this 
country. We have been dragging Mr. de Klerk and the National 
Party, screaming, not wanting to come forward with us on this 
process. There are various examples which we can quote but we 
are happy....[pauses] I'm happy that we are working together. I 
met him three times in prison. We agreed to work together, and 
that is what I am committed to in spite of all the differences 
that we have. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, your rebuttal in one minute. 
  [De Klerk] The National Party changed its policy to its 
present policy three and a half years before Mr. Mandela was 
released from jail, in 1986. Secondly, Mr. Mandela can't bluff 
with these accusations. The families of the victims of the 
necklace murders which we had from supporters of his 
organization, the people in the townships who are suppressed and 
intimidated by the SDU's [self- defense units] -- they know who 
are suppressing them. The people whose houses have been burned 
down know who are the guilty ones, and the parents of the 
children whose lives have been ruined by the misuse of education 
by the ANC know who caused the misery for their children. 
[applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela? 
  [Mandela] This election is about securing a better life for 
our people. That is what the ANC is concentrating upon. Mr. de 
Klerk is alarmed because he is a leader of a party which even 
today is maintaining apartheid. He is spending three times, in 
education, on a white child than he does on a black child. What 
is the reason? What is his reason if apartheid has died? He 
has not built houses for Africans for more than 10 years. What 
is the reason for that discrimination? I cannot vote. There 
are 5 million people unemployed. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, with respect to you, you need to 
finish. We must unfortunately leave it there. May I point out 
to our audience, to the extent, of course, that you are clapping 
and egging your leaders on, that you are also taking their time. 
May I please ask our political correspondent, Lester Venter, 
now to put his question to Mr. Mandela. 
  [Venter] Thank you. Mr. Mandela, the Inkatha Freedom Party's 
decision to stay out of the election, the Zulu king's claim for 
an independent kingdom, and the associated tensions and the 
violence that arise from this situation seem to be problems that 
will not go away soon. In fact, this country could end up with 
a secessionist struggle waged from kwaZulu. If, when you are in 
power, how do you plan to deal with this matter? 
  [Mandela] I have maintained constant dialogue with the IFP, 
as well as with His Majesty, the Zulu king. I attach a great 
deal of importance to peaceful solutions of problems, and I 
think that it has now been demonstrated that that is a very 
powerful weapon. I am going to continue to talk to the IFP, to 
the Zulu monarch. But the situation that is taking place now in 
kwaZulu-Natal where there is no free political activity in many 
areas in that country, where people are dying by scores, have 
compelled us to link the political initiative and security 
measures together. We regret that, because we would like to 
emphasize, to concentrate, on the peaceful initiative. We are 
doing that now. We will do that after 27 April. We will have 
formidable resources of being able to ensure that we reinforce 
our political initiatives as a government which exercises state 
power. [applause] I hope we will succeed. 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, you have two minutes to reply. 
  [De Klerk] On this issue there has lately been very good 
cooperation between the government, the NP government, and the 
ANC, and specifically between the two of us. I welcome that. I 
was critical earlier on. I felt that the ANC did not do enough 
with regard to Inkatha, but that is in the past. We have met in 
the Kruger National Park. It was an important meeting. We have 
made certain proposals, the ANC came forward also with 
constructive proposals. Inkatha and the Zulu king also came 
with specific proposals, and if you analyze the proposals from 
all three sides, there is already really a clear framework for 
consensus and for agreement. 
  We then agreed, with regard to the monarchy, to form a 
working group. That working group has reported back to its 
principals, and I think it is a good report, I can live with it. 
I have some criticism, but basically I can live with it, and I 
would like to thank all those who made an input. So I think the 
problem of the Zulu monarch can, within the framework of the 
transitional constitution and the principals, be really 
accommodated in a very dignified way, and we need not be worried 
that that problem cannot be solved. 
  Inkatha is, in the words of Chief Minister Buthelezi 
himself, 
not a Zulu party. My analysis is that Inkatha has made major 
mistakes by not participating. I have bent over backwards from 
time to time, making new suggestions how to bring them aboard. 
Together with the multiparty forum we have called Parliament 
together, changed the constitution, and brought in five, six 
fundamental changes which really accommodated their most potent 
objections to the first version of December. 
  [Robinson] I'm obliged to stop you there, Mr. de Klerk. 
Mr. Mandela, the last few words on this matter. 
  [Mandela] We must also assess...[pauses] always assess the 
statements made by Mr. de Klerk about the Inkatha Freedom Party 
-- that this is his former ally. They used funds, state funds, 
in order to finance the murderous activities of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party. [audience murmurs] Mr. De Klerk admitted in July 
1991 that they had given 8 million rands of our taxes, of our 
money, to Inkatha. He admitted that. He had earlier admitted 
that they had given 250,000 rands to Inkatha. Always assess his 
statements with regards to Inkatha against that background. 
[applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk? 
  [De Klerk] I find the sudden aggression of Mr. Mandela on 
this issue strange. It is the one thing that we have been 
cooperating well on. Can I just say that Mr. Mandela is 
referring to historical situations. I have stopped all the 
covert actions, and the Kahn committee under Professor Kahn has 
monitored it has assured me now that he is happy with the way in 
which all the covert activities which took place without my 
knowledge have been properly put under the table and it's 
finished. Can I just say that as far as Inkatha is concerned, 
we are near to each other because they also believe in free 
enterprise, because they also believe in federalism. It is a 
policy bond, yes, which exists between us, but this government 
does not fund murderous activities. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Time is up on this issue. Thank you, ladies and 
gentlemen. I invite again now Ferial Haffejee of SABC radio to 
put the question to Mr. de Klerk. 
  [Haffejee] Thank you, Freek. Mr. de Klerk, many people 
believe that your government has not been accountable. There 
have been three years of Third Force allegations; nobody has 
taken the rap for it, although you may have appointed a number 
of commissions. Many billions of rands have been lost to 
corruption; again, nobody has taken the rap for it. How do we 
ensure accountability in the future, especially under a 
government of national unity where there is no opposition 
watchdog? 
  [De Klerk] The National Party government has already put 
into 
place the instruments to ensure that accountability. We have 
strengthened the position of the auditor general. We have made 
him more independent. We have appointed an ombudsman, and we 
have given that ombudsman more powers. Apart from all the 
commissions that we've instituted, we've built into the 
financial and administrative control system absolute improved 
systems to ensure that this is properly dealt with. But most of 
the corruption that you refer to took place in some of the 
homelands, and if you analyze the reports you will find that the 
emphasis was, for instance, on Lebowa and on kwaNdebele. Those 
two homelands were run by Chief Minister Ramodike and Chief 
Minister Mahlangu. They are now on the ANC's candidate list -- 
[laughter] -- well knowing, well knowing that that corruption 
took place under their administration. I am against corruption 
and I have a proud record -- this government has a proud record 
-- of absolutely, fearlessly following up every allegation of 
corruption, and whenever anyone was found to be guilty, firm 
steps were taken. Accountability of the government comes into 
being when there was negligence or where there is knowledge, and 
in none of these instances has any government member been 
accused of negligence or of having had knowledge of the 
corruption which was uncovered. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, your response. 
  [Mandela] There is no transparency or accountability insofar 
as the National Party government. When we held a commission of 
inquiry into allegations of violation of human rights, we 
published our report. We took South Africa into confidence. He 
appointed a commission, General Pierre Steyn, to investigate the 
activities of the MI [Military Intelligence]. He did dismiss 
certain officers. I then asked him to give me that report, 
because I said to him that report has got confirmation of the 
existence of the Third Force. I have not got that report from 
him even now. I am the leader of the most important political 
voice in this country. I started negotiations [audience 
murmurs] when I was in jail. I discussed it with...I discussed 
it with Kobie Coetsee, quite apart from the contribution of the 
masses of the people, but he has not given me that report. The 
reason, because it has got concrete evidence of the existence of 
the Third Force. That is the reason why there is no 
transparency in the statement which Mr. De Klerk is making -- is 
less than candid. That is the reality. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Opportunity for a rebuttal, Mr. de Klerk? You 
have one minute. 
  [De Klerk] Minister Coetsee and I have explained -- I think, 
now, three times -- the situation with regard to the so-called 
Steyn report, and I'm really not going to do it. I only have a 
minute. It wasn't a report of that nature, but I took steps. 
There was a transparency with regard to the commission's report 
on the detention camps, but were they acted against by the ANC? 
No, they're once again high up on the candidates' list. The 
very people who have been implicated by that commission are now 
maybe ministerial candidates in the government of national 
unity, having been implicated by that commission. The ANC 
should take steps against their supporters who make themselves 
guilty of atrocities or any unacceptable behavior. That is what 
we are doing constantly. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Opportunity for a final reply, Mr. Mandela. 
  [Mandela] He has completely evaded my question. I am saying: 
If that report was innocent, he would have published it, he 
would have given it to me. I am his partner. We are trying to 
solve this problem together. We are trying to promote mutual 
confidence so that we, the two of us and other players, can 
persuade a government of national unity to build this mutual 
confidence, to proceed with the task of nation-building. He has 
not given me that report. Why? [applause] 
  [Robinson] We must leave the issue there. Now for the final 
question from my colleague, also from Radio Metro, Tim Modise, 
and it goes to Mr. Man?ela. 
  [Modise] Thank you, Freek. Mr. Mandela, we've been listening 
to the promises of the ANC and the NP tonight. The ordinary man 
and woman in the street is watching this and is listening. They 
want to know are they going to feel safe on the streets after 
the government of national unity has been elected? They want to 
know if there will be delivery of social services, given the 
strikes that have been taking place, especially in the 
homelands? They want to know if public violence and criminal 
violence is going to be eradicated completely in South Africa. 
Above that, they want to know if there will ever be racial 
reconciliation in this country. 
  [Mandela] The ANC is committed to national reconciliation 
and 
to nation-building. There is no organization in this country 
which has issued a policy statement to compare with the Freedom 
Charter, which is the most devastating attack on all forms of 
racialism. We have come out with a clear program to ensure a 
better life, to build houses, to offer employment, to provide 
free, quality education. But you must remember that violence is 
not caused by those who carry a gun, by those who stab. It is 
also caused by poverty, illiteracy, hunger. All these are evils 
of apartheid. We are going to address these problems, and 
restructure the police force so that it could be a community 
police. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk? 
  [De Klerk] I and the National Party share the deep concern 
of 
all our people about the violence -- and within the government 
of national unity which will no longer have any legitimacy 
problem -- I believe that we will be able to address it through, 
firstly, restructuring, improving the economy -- if our policy 
is followed then we will succeed with that. 
  Unemployment is one of the problems of crime and violence. 
The so-called lost generation, the millions of young South 
Africans, mostly of them black, who are not properly trained, 
who left school early -- they need to be looked at, and at an 
earlier occasion Mr. Mandela and I have already talked about it, 
that in the government of national unity we will have to address 
this problem in an imaginative way. 
  Yes, I believe that through economic growth, through 
improvement of social conditions which can then be afforded 
because there is economic growth, we can improve the quality of 
life of our people. 
  We have already started to improve the relationships between 
the police and the community, and I'm fully in favor of 
community policing and the new constitution makes provision for 
that. I hope that the election will also bring to an end the 
demonization of our police force. We only have one police force 
in South Africa. One-third of them are at the moment almost 
full-time busy in preventing or fighting or managing political 
unrest and political violence. Hopefully, when the election is 
over those policemen and women will also be able, once again, to 
concentrate on crime prevention and on accosting criminals and 
on bringing them to book. I really believe that the election 
will bring us to the end of this violent period. 
  [Robinson] Thank you Mr. de Klerk. I must stop you there. 
[applause] Mr. de Klerk, we are doing very well on time. You 
are very disciplined, both of you. I will give you 
one-and-a-half minutes each now to respond. Mr. Mandela. 
  [Mandela] The exchanges between Mr. de Klerk and I should 
not 
... not obscure one important fact about our country. I think 
we are a shining example to the entire world of people drawn 
from different racial groups who have a common loyalty, a common 
love, to their common country. That is the dominating issue. 
We are going to fight these issues out, but we have men and 
women in this country who have reason -- who are honoring the 
ideals of liberty and democracy in this country, and in spite of 
my criticism of Mr. de Klerk, Sir, you are one of those I rely 
upon, that we are going to face the problems of this country, 
together, and with other....[applause] 
  [De Klerk] Thank you for those kind words, Mr. Mandela. I 
am also...[pauses] I can also testify that on major issues such 
as nation building we are finding it possible to work together. 
Can I say that we won't have peace before we have real 
reconciliation? This election is about the future. It is not 
about the past, and until we bury the bitterness of the past, 
until....[pauses] One can never forget injustice, but you can 
forgive. And we need forgiveness, we need reconciliation, we 
need to put our hands in each others' hands, and all the 
population groups need to say: We need each other, we have a 
common destiny, let us work together. And that is why I am so 
satisfied that we have agreed upon a government of national 
unity, because that is the instrument we need to lead this 
country toward that nationhood which will make us all proud 
South Africans and which will ensure that we as a country will 
move forward together. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Well, with 
that we come to the end of the question and answer session. I 
will now ask each of you to have a final closing statement. We 
have some time. I will give you four minutes. Mr. De Klerk, as 
agreed, you will go first. 
  [De Klerk] Having come to the end of this debate, I would 
like to appeal to all the voters out there -- firstly, who have 
not decided as yet for whom to vote -- to seriously consider 
their position. We need a balance of power. There is only one 
party which can form that balance of power against the ANC, 
which is a strong party with wide support -- they are the 
favorite -- and that is the National Party. It is the new 
National Party, notwithstanding what has been said. It is a 
party which has renewed itself from within. It was an internal 
process; we have cleansed ourselves from within. We have 
admitted that our past policy led to injustice. We have 
apologized for that and we say: We have a job to do; we also 
want to rectify those injustices. This new National Party is a 
growing party. This new National Party is fighting to become 
the biggest party, not for jobs for ourselves, but because we 
believe in the values for which we stand. 
  We believe in sound family values. We believe that parents 
should still be parents and that children shouldn't deal with 
parents and grown-ups as is happening in our country at the 
moment. We believe in Christian norms and standards. We believe 
in free enterprise. We believe in universal human rights and 
feel that the Bill of Rights needs to be strengthened. We 
believe in religious freedom, and we care about the needs of our 
people. We know many people are suffering. We must accept the 
challenge to fight hunger, to fight poverty, to ensure that more 
and more jobs will be created, to build homes for the homeless, 
to improve the quality of education, to bring primary health 
care nearer to the people. We have accepted it as a party, and 
we will work together with all those who also stand for that. 
  And on peace -- we are committed to peace. Our hands are 
clean. The National Party, none of the National Party supporters 
are involved in violence. We are a peaceful party, and 
everybody who knows our party can testify as to that. And if 
one of our party members gets out of line, we discipline him. 
  The National Party believes in the future of this country 
and 
all its people. We see our country on the threshold of a new, 
wonderful, prosperous era. The whole of Africa wants us to 
succeed. The whole of Africa is reaching out toward a successful 
conclusion of the process in South Africa, because Africa needs 
us. The international community wants us to succeed because 
they realize that South Africa has a pivotal role to play, not 
only in Africa, but also globally. The whole world is waiting 
for us to succeed because what we have embarked upon in South 
Africa -- all the leaders of all the parties together -- has not 
succeeded in many countries elsewhere. There is a way, and that 
way is the real tolerance and the real commitment to peace, and 
the adherence to workable policies which have succeeded 
elsewhere. That is the way, and that is the way of the new 
National Party for which I ask the support of all the voters out 
there. [applause] 
  [Robinson] Thank you. Mr. Mandela, the final closing 
statement from you. 
  [Mandela] To deal with my statement, I would have liked to 
know from Mr. De Klerk, who was disciplined when 8 million of 
tax payers' money was given to Inkatha Freedom Party? [sentence 
as heard] That was in July 1991. Who was disciplined? His 
vague statements are counterproductive, because they lead to the 
conclusion that Mr. De Klerk is less than frank in making 
important statements on national issues. 
  But I want to say that various points of view have been 
expressed here. I want to assure you that on the 27th of April 
you will make your choice, and I don't doubt what it is going to 
be. The choice will be whether you want the same problems to 
continue within the next five years -- massive unemployment, 
limited opportunities, continued racial division -- or whether 
you want the beginning of a new era of hope, of peace, of 
security, where the basic needs of everybody have been attended 
to. 
  Here, we are saying the ANC has the most cogent plan to deal 
with this situation. The fact that Mr. De Klerk when we asked 
for his comprehensive plan to deal with these basic needs, he 
can only tell us of some document he has given. There is no 
evidence at all of the circulation. I have never received it. 
He has never given to me. I have been with him very frequently. 
Where is their plan? With whom was it discussed? 
  But we are saying: Let us work together. Let us work 
together for reconciliation and nation building. I am proud to 
hold your hands...for us to go forward. [applause] Let us work 
together to end division and suspicion. I have traveled 
throughout this country, spoken to thousands of people. I know 
that they deserve a better life. They deserve a better future. 
And the only organization I am calling upon you to vote for is 
the African National Congress. [applause] If you vote for the 
African National Congress, you are voting for an organization 
which has got an experience of more than 80 years in nation 
building. It's an organization which will never issue documents 
of this nature, which today in 1994 says, Boesak, why are you 
not with your people? Why are you with Africans? It is the 
most divisive party in this country. If you want national 
unity, that is the organization I lead -- the African National 
Congress. 
  [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Mandela. We must leave it there. 
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. May I thank both 
of you for the spirit of this debate, and with that we come to 
the end of this historic from the Johannesburg Civic Theater 
Complex. We bid you good night.

  [Text] 
<H5>  President F W de Klerk, clear winner of TV debate </H5>
  President F W de Klerk was the undoubted winner of tonights 
debate, particularly on all questions about the future of South 
Africa. He had the clearest view of where the country is going 
and demonstrated he has the experience to get us there. 
  He gave a performance which was decisive, showed his mastery 
of the facts, and was compelling in setting out the 
transformation that has taken place in the new national party. 
  By contrast Mr Mandela, was generalised and sometimes vague. 
He dwelt too much on the past, and had very little to offer when 
it came to the hard questions about the economy. He was also 
more intent on scoring cheap debating points than addressing the 
real issues. It was alarming to see his finger-wagging style 
when he ran out of arguments. 
  This election is about the future not the past. Clearly 
President de Klerk and the new National Party are the ones to 
lead us there.

  [Text] The Burundi Government is satisfied with the 
peaceful and dignified way the burial ceremonies for President 
Ntaryamira were carried out. In a communique issued 17 April, 
the government declares the following: A day after the funeral 
ceremonies of President Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Burundi 
Government once again thanks and hails the Burundi people for 
the good behavior, wisdom, and dignity they showed during the 
national mourning ceremony in honor of the late president of the 
Republic and Ministers Bernard Ciza and Cyriaque Ciza. 
  Burundi welcomes Burundians who took refuge in Rwanda and 
who 
are returning en masse, and it takes this opportunity to invite 
them to join other citizens with a view to strengthening peace 
and to take part in the country's reconstruction in a spirit of 
tolerance and reconciliation. 
  To the Rwandan people faced with the civil war, the Burundi 
Government reiterates the calls it made on the day of the 
funeral and on previous days, notably the call of 12 April which 
urged them to follow the path of dialogue. The Burundi 
Government once again calls on Rwandan brothers at war to lay 
down their arms. Burundi urges them to come together so that, 
through frank dialogue, they end the war immediately. The 
Burundi Government assures the Rwandan people, that in 
connection with the political crisis being experienced by 
Rwanda, Burundi observes and will continue to observe strict 
neutrality. It assures Rwanda, in particular, that no 
aggression against Rwanda will be perpetrated from Burundi 
territory.

  [Text] Bujumbura, April 17 (AFP) -- Funeral services were 
held here Saturday [16 April] for Burundi president Cyprien 
Ntaryamira and two of his cabinet ministers who died in a plane 
crash April 6 that also took the life of Rwandan President 
Juvenal Habyarimana. 
  The crash of the Rwandan presidential jet occurred as the 
aircraft was approaching the airport in the Rwandan capital 
Kigali on a flight from Tanzannia, where the two leaders had 
discussed efforts to end friction between the Hutu and Tutsi 
groups afflicting both countries. 
  Rwandan authorities charged that the plane had been shot 
down, although officials here have spoken only of an "accident." 
  While Burundi remained calm after the incident, inter-ethnic 
fighting erupted in Rwanda and has now left at least 20,000 
people dead and caused thousands of refugees to stream into 
neighboring countries. 
  The Burundi cabinet members who perished in the crash were 
Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi and Planning Minister 
Bernard Ciza.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The battle for the Rwandan capital, Kigali, 
continued overnight and today. The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] rebels went back to war against government forces 
following the atrocities in Kigali after the death of President 
Habyarimana in a plane clash last week. The RPF apparently 
mounted a (?pincer) movement around the capital, and there have 
reports of fighting in the south of the city. Well, today the 
United Nations brokered a meeting between the RPF and the 
government to discuss the possibilities of a cease-fire. Our 
correspondent Mark Doyle is in Kigali. Aba Saleh asked him what 
was the outcome: 
  [Begin recording] [Doyle] Well, senior civilian United 
Nations official said that a cease-fire had not been signed and 
that there was no cease-fire. However, that they thought it was 
very positive that this first meeting had taken place and it 
does seem that this is the.... [pauses] Even though a cease-fire 
was not signed, the fact that the two parties could get together 
is the best news we have had for a week, although, of course, 
without a cease- fire the fighting could continue and there are 
still a great many extremely serious issues to address. 
  [Saleh] You say they said that it was good news that the two 
parties could get together. Now, can you tell us something 
about the logistics of the meeting? Where was it held and how 
did they arrive? 
  [Doyle] It was held at the Meridien Hotel, which is in the 
central-north of Kigali. It was the result of intensive efforts 
by General Dallaire, the UN commander and, no doubt, his other 
liaison officers, who worked with the RPF and the government 
side. They arrived at the hotel which was guarded, and on the 
roof were Tunisian soldiers with some very fierce-looking 
weapons. There were a lot of Senegalese involved as well, and 
20 Ghanaians and the others who were guarding the hotel, and 
some Bangladeshis. The Bangladeshis, in fact, drove the two 
sides to the meeting in large white armored personnel carriers 
which are made of very thick metal. Those small arms can't 
pierce the shell. And then they left in the same vehicles, back 
to their respective armed camps. 
  [Saleh] And no indication yet of what the points of 
disagreement were? 
  [Doyle] No, I'm afraid I can't give you any details of what 
actually took place inside. None of the participants said 
anything substantial as they dashed out of the lobby of the 
hotel and into these big white vehicles driven by the 
Bangladeshis. 
  [Saleh] And would you say that the RPF is negotiting from a 
position of strength? Does it hold much of the country or many 
positions in the capital? 
  [Doyle] It holds some positions in the capital, in the 
north, 
and in the center, and the Rwandan Army is [words indistinct] 
resisting, holds also some very important parts, including the 
embassy area. All the embassies are abandoned now... [pauses] 
the main Army camp. They appear also to hold important 
positions around the strategically very important airport in the 
northeast of the city. And so both sides hold important areas. 
  [Saleh] And has there been much fighting today? 
  [Doyle] Not compared with three or four days ago, when it 
was 
very heavy. There have been some sporadic exchanges of mortar 
and small arms and machinegun fire, anti-aircraft guns not used 
against aircraft [words indistinct], and the point I 
heard....[pauses] What I saw was a multiple rocket launcher, and 
United Nations officials couldn't confirm that, although they 
don't know all the weapons that are in the town. The town is 
awash with weapons. This fighting was relatively sporadic, and 
they may well [words indistinct] been in certain circumstances 
the activities of bandits rather than direct military clashes.

  [Text] Army and RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] leaders met 
this afternoon for the first time in eight days, since the 
fighting broke out. Their talks lasted about one hour, and they 
are due to resume tomorrow. For now, no agreement has been 
reached, no cease-fire signed. On the ground, things seem to be 
calming down, as Colonel Luc Marchal, commander of the Belgian 
UN peacekeeping forces, explained to Thierry Perret: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] We have seen a certain 
stabilization, which means that the fighting has died down 
somewhat, one could say that it has all but stopped, though 
there have been a few flare-ups. A series of political 
negotiations are going on, which should allow them to clarify 
their positions. It is clear that with what has happened in the 
last 10 days, I do not know, we cannot expect things to 
stabilize overnight, but, well, I am quite skeptical at the 
moment as to the chances of a solution or a definitive status 
quo [sentence as heard]. 
  [Perret] Do you have the feeling in Kigali today that the 
RPF 
can take the town? 
  [Marchal] The RPF has massed to the north of the town. It 
has brought in regular units which progressed quite normally. I 
think that it had hoped that these battalions could infiltrate 
and win a victory from within, but it seems that these units 
that have been infiltrated have got as far as they are likely to 
get, and that in order to take the city, the RPF will now have 
to use all its available means. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Kigali, April 16 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebel leaders 
demanded the dissolution of the interim government as a 
precondition for entering truce talks, AFP learnt here Saturday 
[16 April], as renewed fighting rocked the capital and trapped 
refugees and UN troops at the airport. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile the chief of staff of the interim government's 
forces issued his own set of truce conditions, appealing for an 
immediate halt to all fighting in the east African country, as 
media sources reported heavy arms clashes between the two sides 
in the capital Saturday afternoon. 
  The airport was another flashpoint, with Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes saying Saturday in Brussels that some 400 
Belgian UN peacekeeping troops were "trapped like rats" there 
and under imminent threat of a rebel attack. [passage omitted] 
  A second bilateral session scheduled for Saturday in a hotel 
in a rebel-held sector of Kigali had yet to get under way at 
6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) in Kigali, AFP learnt. The meeting was 
called to discuss both sides' ceasefire proposals under the 
auspices of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
(UNAMIR). 
  In Brussels, Claes told journalists his troops were "trapped 
like rats ... We have information from very good sources that 
armed Rwandan (rebel) forces are preparing to attack the 
airport, while the chaos in Kigali is growing by the hour and 
anti-Belgian sentiment is still intense." Claes added that the 
commander of UNAMIR, General Romeo Dallaire, had been charged 
with ensuring the safe departure of the Belgian troops along 
with around 100 European and Rwandan refugees still at the 
airport. "There is no time to lose, the runway at Kigali 
airport is in danger of being destroyed," he said. 
  Belgium has decided to pull out its troops from Rwanda, 
where 
10 days of inter-ethnic bloodletting has ravaged the country and 
left thousands dead since the April 6 death of the country's 
long-ruling Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane is 
thought to have been destroyed by rocket fire. 
  Reporters witnessed from their hotel as violent heavy arms 
exchanges rocked the eastern side of the Kigali Saturday 
afternoon, the combats centred on a communications centre 
equipped with a satellite broadcast receiver. [passage omitted] 
  In a document received by AFP in Nairobi, the government 
forces' chief of staff, Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi, called for "an 
immediate end to fighting and military operations" in Rwanda as 
one of a series of "mechanisms to be put in place to help ensure 
a return to peace. He demanded an end to "punitive expeditions 
and revenge operations led by the RPF," and called on rebel 
radio to end its "provocative campaign of lies." 
  Government forces also called for frequent meeting between 
themselves and RPF commanders to help put an end to attacks by 
renegade forces, and the establishement of emergency aid 
corridors to feed "forces on both sides." [passage omitted]
