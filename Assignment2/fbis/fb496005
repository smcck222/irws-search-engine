  [Text] In an attempt to seek a solution for the current war 
in Rwanda, a meeting took place at Hotel Meridien in Kigali 
yesterday. The meeting was between Army officers in the Rwanda 
Government and Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] officers. UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was there and observers 
and mediators. On the side of UNAMIR, present were Dr. 
Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, Major General Dollaire, and Colonel 
Caner. In the RPF part, there was Lieutenant Col. Kayonga and 
Maj. Rwigamba. The Rwandan Government was represented by five 
Army officers, including Col. Gapfizi, Lt. Col. Rwabalinda and 
Maj. Gakara. Before any negotiations for a cease-fire can take 
place, RPF gave the following conditions to the Rwandan 
Government soldiers: 
  1. To stop the widespread killings. This should be enforced 
in the following manner: 
  a) restore telephone communications in the National 
Development Council [CND] building and also restore telephone 
services for internal and external uses; 
  b) the two sides must check on whether the killings have 
stopped and assess what has been spoiled or damaged; 
  c) it should be made easy and possible for the journalists 
to enter and visit CND; 
  d) release and announce a list of all politicians killed 
in the violence; and 
  e) allow or permit people, organizations who want to help. 
  2. To denounce and condemn the Presidential Guards for what 
they have done. This should be done in the following manner: 
  a) remind them that they are soldiers and have to behave 
accordingly; 
  b) disarm them and keep them in a camp where they are 
under strict control of RPA and the government Army pending 
court trials; 
  c) abolish the Presidential Guard; 
  d) hunt all those members of the Presidential Guard who 
have escaped wherever they may be in and out of the country; 
  e) denounce the violent acts of Presidential Guards on 
Radio Rwanda four times a day and in both French and Kinyarwanda 
languages. The nature and form of the announcement will be 
agreed upon by the two sides before it goes to radio. 
  3. To denounce and imprison all the groups that have taken 
part in the acts of violence like murdering, raping, looting and 
destroying property. This should be done in the following manner: 
  a) denounce and punish the leadership of the national 
Gendarmerie for not taking any action to stop the violence; this 
should be announced on Radio Rwanda four times a day and in 
French and Kinyarwanda languages; 
  b) try in the court of law and imprison those who are 
found guilty; 
  c) announce on Radio Rwanda four times a day and in French 
and Kinyarwanda to ask civilians to surrender arms and 
ammunition in their possession;

suspected of collaborating with the killer groups; 
  e) arrest and imprison politicians and journalists who 
have taken part in encouraging violence; and 
  f) stop Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines) [RTLM] 
completely and use only Radio Rwanda to broadcast selected 
programs and to restore radio and television workers, only those 
who are known for clean political lines. 
  4. Denounce the self-imposed government and its president. 
This should be done in the following manner: 
  a) use radio statements to denounce the government four 
times a day in French and Kinyarwanda languages; 
  b) the so-called government should return and handover 
government property or documents in their possession; 
  c) examine what that government has done with a view to 
the misuse of funds or property; 
  d) any member of this government who might have taken part 
in or encouraged acts of violence should be tried and brought to 
justice. 
  All the above must be observed and fulfilled before any 
cease-fire talks can begin.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF) rebels kept up the pressure on government forces in Kigali 
overnight, with fierce mortar and cannon-fire exchanges aimed to 
weaken the Army's resolve, a military spokesman said. "It's a 
classic technique, to weaken the opponent psychologically and 
physically, to keep him awake," he told AFP. 
  The spokesman was speaking at the Meridien Hotel in the 
capital, situated on the front line in the northeast of the 
capital, which is disputed by government and rebel forces. 
Intermittent bursts of gunfire rang out during the night from 
the surrounding hills. [passage omitted] 
  Rwandan state radio said late Sunday [17 April] that 
government forces had responded to a set of RPF preconditions 
for talks issued by the Tutsi-dominated movement on Saturday, 
but failed to indicate the tenor of the response. 
  Abdul Kabia of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda told AFP 
Sunday the Armed Forces had accepted a rebel demand for joint 
patrols by security forces and its guerrillas to restore order. 
They also agreed to the principle of a judicial inquiry into the 
bloodshed in Kigali. But it was unclear how they had responded 
to the rebels' insistence that the government and the 
presidential guard -- accused of horrific atrocities -- be 
disbanded. 
  Many of the RPF conditions are thought unacceptable to the 
new Armed Forces Chief Augustin Bizimungu -- branded a "Hutu 
hardliner" by the RPF -- appointed Saturday to replace General 
Deogratias Nasabimana, killed with the president.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is trying to negotiate a 
cease-fire in Rwanda. Meanwhile, after the departure of the 
Belgian and French paras, the fighting and the massacres have 
resumed. Francois Cornet reports: 
  [Cornet] Kigali airport, a strategic point in the Rwandan 
war, fell this morning after the last Belgian and French paras 
left yesterday. Since dawn, the Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels 
have pounded the airport runways and installations, where 450 
Blue Berets have taken refuge. [passage omitted] 
  In the chaos, the Belgian paras last night managed at the 
last moment to save some 50 Tutsi children hiding in an 
orphanage surrounded by the mainly Hutu soldiers of the 
Presidential Guard. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, fighting grew more intense in the 
capital today. Fighting between the armed forces and the 
Patriotic Front [RPF] even reached the center of Kigali. UNAMIR 
[United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] reported intense 
fighting with light weapons and shells lasting for about two 
hours. 
  Dug in at the old parliament building, which dominates the 
east of the town, the RPF leaders repeated to the few 
journalists there that they were still fully resolved to take 
the town if the killings did not stop. 
  According to our colleague from AFP, the conversation was 
punctuated by deafening artillery fire coming from right next to 
the building and aimed at targets the rebels refused to identify. 
  The RPF has still not taken control of the strategic points 
because the time is not yet ripe, they said during this news 
briefing, and indeed the three large military camps are still 
held by the regular army, even if the one in the north has been 
surrounded by the rebels, they said. 
  According to the UNAMIR head of military operations, the 
time 
for the RPF to take Kigali is not far off. 
  Finally it must be noted that the RPF shelled the 
pro-government free radio, Mille Collines, today, accusing it of 
incitement to murder. After having demanded its closure in 
vain, this morning it reduced it to silence. [passage omitted] 
  The nomination of a new chief of staff, Augustin Bizimungu, 
today will not make things any easier: he is an extremist, says 
the RPF, and his appointment to head the army makes the 
situation more dangerous. 
  The UN mission on the ground, however, is not giving up; it 
is continuing discussions with the two sides separately in the 
hope of trying to arrange a meeting.

  [Text] Another consignment of food and medicine arrived in 
Kigali airport today as part of a humanitarian program keeping 
emergency supplies flowing to the beleaguered Rwandan capital, 
but the battle for Kigali continues and the two sides have not 
yet met for face-to-face negotiations. Shuttling between 
opposing camps has been the UN commander in Kigali, General 
Romeo Dallaire who desperately tries to find common ground 
between the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] and Rwandan Government 
forces. On the line to Kigali this afternoon, Herbert Sallah 
asked General Dallaire whether he has been making any progress. 
  [Begin recording] [Dallaire] The RPF indicated unless the 
preconditions are met they will not be attending any other 
meeting and we have just finished spending the afternoon with 
the RGF [Rwandan Government Forces] going over the responses to 
the preconditions. 
  [Sallah] And what are there responses to the conditions of 
the RPF?. 
  [Dallaire] Well again, if you don't mind, we have just come 
back from our meeting with them. We certainly want to review 
the notes of the meeting and then discuss them with the RPF and 
when that is done, then I think we would be in a position to go 
public. 
  [Sallah] In the meantime, is there a lot of fighting in the 
capital today? 
  [Dallaire] Not very much fighting though. There has been 
exchanges but we have had some rockets fired this afternoon 
aimed at a radio station that has been producing some very 
inflammatory propaganda misinformation. It has been doing that 
for some time and so our estimate is that the RPF targeted it 
but we just don't have the confirmation of the sites where 
possibly those rockets were fired from. 
  [Sallah] At the moment who has the upper hand in the 
fighting? 
  [Dallaire] I don't think it would be readily evident who has 
the upper hand. I think that the RPF do have some offensive 
power and they are exercising it with certain reserve as they 
are very far from the lines, of course. So I would suspect that 
they are husbanding their resources for possibly another push or 
something. 
  [Sallah] Would you estimate that they have got the necessary 
military strength to take Kigali as they have been threatening 
to do? 
  [Dallaire] They will need a lot of capability to do that and 
also their capability is going to have to also consider the fact 
the local militias or self-defense groups are becoming bolder, 
and so that is a factor that may also affect their operation. 
  [Sallah] Finally, Gen. Dallaire, can you tell us about any 
fighting in the rest of the country? 
  [Dallaire] Apart from the last tidbit of information that we 
did get from the north in (Jumba) area, with that pocket 
apparently surrounded and action going on, the rest of the line 
is essentially quite quiet and people are simply sending off 
patrols. [end recording] 
  While the UN struggles to find common ground between the 
combatants, the fighting for control of Kigali continues. Our 
correspondent Mark Dowle has been down to RPF headquarters in 
central Kigali today where amid the gunfire he talked to rebel 
spokesman Seth Sendor Shanga. 
  [Begin recording] [Shanga] There has been outgoing shot 
heard 
but at the moment what you can hear is heavy machine guns, 
antiaircraft guns firing at enemy positions. 
  [Dowle] How long do you think it would take you to take 
Kigali if indeed you do take it? 
  [Shanga] I think it can't take long now that we have 
positions around (Kigalo). As you are aware we have taken 
Rebero. We are concentrating around (Montari). We are all 
around the city. It won't take long before we take the city. 
  [Dowle] How many days? 
  [Shanga] It is a matter of a few days. 
  [Dowle) But why haven't you taken the main Army camp, the 
main Gendarmerie camp, and the camp by the airport. Why haven't 
you taken those if you think you are willing?. 
  [Shanga] No, we have not taken those because our aim is not 
to take the military camps. And again as we say we are always 
fighting people who come out of the population, and when they 
attack us we also attack them. Our aim is not to take the 
military camps as such because we still believe that there are 
many, many Rwandan soldiers who are genuine and they are looking 
for peace, and we have no need of attacking them. So we attack 
those who attack us. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwandan Government has 
started an argument with the Belgian Government. In a letter 
addressed to his Belgian counterpart, Willy Claes, the Rwandan 
foreign minister states that elements of the Belgian military 
contingent are actively taking part in the Rwanda Patriotic 
Front offensive, using the equipment which was supposedly 
destined for the evacuation of Belgian nationals. The Rwandan 
foreign minister also writes that his government has information 
at its disposal which proves that the RPF is receiving similar 
support from the Belgian Blue Helmets in UNAMIR [United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda]. 
  The Rwandan foreign minister also raised the issue of the 
stringently anti-Belgian broadcasts of RTLM -- Radio Mille 
Collines. The Rwandan minister writes that the burgeoning of the 
democratic process in Rwanda was accompanied by the birth of 
private media organizations, which by definition are beyond the 
government's control. This reality is as much a fact in Rwanda 
as it is in Belgium, he writes, adding that the Belgian 
Government is quite free to intervene on Radio des Mille 
Collines, either by issuing denials or by making use of its 
right of reply, end quote.

  [Text] In Rukira Commune, Kibungo Prefecture, the 
combatants of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have just freed 
600 people. There were previously 800 of them who were detained 
after the death of President Habyarimana. Elements of the 
Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe [Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development militia] threw grenades 
into the area which killed some people, while others died of 
hunger. The 600 surviving people, just like the 2,000 survivors 
of (Mugambazi) Commune, were evacuated to the area controlled by 
the RPF where they are safe. However, the survivors are 
destitute and need assistance from humanitarian organizations.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A BBC correspondent in the 
capital, Kigali, says the rebels' demands are almost certain to 
be rejected by the Army. There has been more fighting in the 
capital today. The road between Kigali and the town of 
(Kitarama), southwest of the capital, is choked by more than 
5,000 refugees. A BBC correspondent who has driven through the 
area said that at several checkpoints he saw the corpses of 
refugees apparently killed by local militia on suspicion of 
being Tutsis or sympathizers with the rebels. He said lorries 
and convicts from Kigali prison are being used to remove the 
bodies. At the border between Rwanda and Burundi, the United 
Nations is now dealing with more than 3,000 Burundians who had 
previously fled ethnic killing in their own country last year 
and now want to go back to Burundi. A UN spokesman says Rwanda 
has closed its border with Zaire, halting the flow of refugees.

  [Text] As the war continues in the country, a sense of 
insecurity has gripped the nation. Many people continue to die 
under the hands of the Presidential Guards, the MRND-CDR 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth 
wingers and some elements of the Rwanda Army. So far the death 
toll is exceeding 26,000 people. Yesterday, reports said that 
Dr. Theoneste Gefaranga was murdered in his hiding place. Dr. 
Gafaranga was the second vice president in the PSD [Social 
Democratic Party]. In Commune Rukira, about 800 people were 
found by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] soldiers locked in one 
place since the death of President Habyarimana. Some had died, 
and others were badly injured due to grenades that were thrown 
at them regularly. Others were dying of hunger. Those who were 
survived were rescued by the RPF troops. Reports say that the 
road from Kigali to Gitarama is ringed by dead bodies and 
starving refugees. The government is using trucks to clear the 
bodies. 
  Another incident took place at the Zaire Embassy in Kigali, 
where 22 people were killed. Some of these people could have 
been Zaire nationals. And, in another turn of events, people in 
Commune Bicyumbi [Kigali Prefecture] have started defending 
themselves against the killers. They use traditional weapons 
like spears, bows and arrows, and pangas. 
  Meanwhile, the Belgian foreign minister expressed fear that 
all the Belgians remaining in Rwanda were in imminent danger. 
He had information that the Rwanda Government soldiers had 
plans to kill Belgian soldiers who were part of the UN mission 
in Rwanda. Yesterday 440 Belgian soldiers were still stranded at 
the Kigali Airport. The foreign minister, Mr. Willy Claes, 
continuously appealed to his government to do all possible to 
evacuate them.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing in Lusaka 
today. The general principles of the Angolan electoral process 
will be on the negotiating table and the talks will focus on the 
second round of presidential elections. 
  Dr. Jorge Valentim, National Union for the Total 
Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] information secretary, said in the Zambian 
capital yesterday that there was the possibility that an 
agreement might be reached in that area. That UNITA official 
said, however, that he favored more exchanges of ideas between 
the two sides so as to permit a greater understanding of the 
problems at hand. 
  The UN mediators and the team led by Faustino Muteka are due 
to meet today. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
is expected to receive the Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party's counterproposal on national 
reconciliation, for which he has waited more than a week. 
  The mediators and the UNITA team to the talks met throughout 
the morning yesterday. In the afternoon Blondin Beye met with 
the Ad Hoc Commission for Electoral Affairs.

  [Text] Lusaka April 17 SAPA -- Angola's rebel UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] movement 
has appealed for an end to the war in the country, saying this 
would help strengthen continuing peace negotiations between it 
and the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] 
government, the ZIANA national news agency reported on Sunday 
[17 April]. The two sides have been negotiating in the Zambian 
capital of Lusaka for five months. 
  UNITA secretary for information, Jorge Valentim, said 
although general principles for a ceasefire had been agreed 
upon, the war in Angola continued to escalate. "Nobody is 
supporting the war officially. It's against the wishes of 
mediators, observers, and the international community, 
particularly the United Nations Security Council," said Mr 
Valentim.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Luanda] </F>
  [Text] The mediator met today with the government 
delegation, which submitted a document on its views about the 
conclusion of the elections. Sources close to the negotiations 
say the government and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed to the document 
submitted by the mediator, which is based on proposals presented 
yesterday by UNITA and today by the government, regarding the 
conclusion of elections. 
  The document on national reconciliation will be discussed. 
This is the final document, and it provides for UNITA's 
participation in the various government echelons. Political 
analysts say the document is very brief in that UNITA does not 
discuss what the government has to offer. UNITA says it has 
asked for nothing from the government, including the sharing of 
power, because it was the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola that won the elections. UNITA will take part in the 
government in view of the latter's offer in line with the spirit 
of national reconciliation.

  [Text] The peace talks continued in the Zambian capital 
yesterday, even though it was a Saturday. There was no plenary 
meeting, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and 
the troika of observers held a lengthy meeting with the Luanda 
team led by Faustino Muteka to discuss issues pertaining to the 
second round of presidential elections. This issue had already 
been discussed with the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] team on 15 April. It would 
appear that there were not too many problems and UNITA and the 
government managed to overcome some of their differences. 
  However, no progress has been made concerning national 
reconciliation. Sources said that nothing major is expected 
until Luanda has responded to UN proposals concerning UNITA's 
participation in the government of the country. The two sides 
have decided to leave those matters for discussion at a later 
stage. 
  Today is Sunday and there is no negotiation under way in 
Lusaka. The peace talks are scheduled to resume tomorrow.

  [Excerpt] There is no hope for tranquility in Cuito, Bie 
Province, in the coming days. Clashes took place in the city on 
13 April, after Eduardo dos Santos' aircraft parachuted war 
materiel on the defense lines of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA]. This scenario was repeated 
yesterday. 
  According to our reporter Jardim Sikito Prata, a Ilyushin-76 
aircraft belonging to the Luanda Air Force on two occasions, at 
0900 and 1500, dropped war materiel, fuel, backpacks, and other 
equipment. A total of 10 parachutes once again fell on the 
FALA's defense lines. Military sources contacted by Sikito 
Prata, say these constant operations are part of a deliberate 
plan by Eduardo dos Santos to resume clashes in Bie in order to 
delay peace which is being negotiated in Lusaka. 
  The FALA military command in Bie has warned, however, that 
it 
will not tolerate any act of provocation and all those who 
insist will be severely punished. 
  Military operations by the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] continue to be the 
center of attention inside Angola where Eduardo dos Santos' men 
have not learned from their defeats. In Cuanza Norte Province, 
the UNITA armed forces pushed to Lucala-2 River region the 
Luanda regime troops who had in vain tried to take N'Dalatando, 
the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. Lieutenant Colonel Sexto 
Sachi, chief of FALA operations in the province, gave assurances 
that the city will never fall into the hands of the MPLA-PT by 
the force of arms. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Unable to cope with National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops and disenchanted with 
seeing their parachutes falling in UNITA-controlled areas, 
MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party] troops stationed in Bie today decided to mount an attack, 
using artillery fire. Sources say powerful explosions were 
heard inside the city. Although the situation is worrisome, 
sources in Huambo told our correspondent that World Food Program 
aircraft managed to land in Bie with foodstuffs on board. The 
sources added that UNITA armed forces in Bie have been 
instructed to remain calm, but if Luanda continues with its 
bombardments, the situation could worsen. 
  Meanwhile, our Cuanza Norte correspondent reported today 
that 
the MPLA-PT air force continued with its attacks on N'Dalatando 
and nearby locations. The source said the MPLA-PT air force has 
been carrying out two attacks daily. Civilians are the 
preferred targets for the air force [words indistinct] and 
Lucala villages. The source added that bombardments by 
artillery units have been stepped up. The command of the Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola in the region said this 
afternoon that N'Dalatando will never be occupied by neither 
[words indistinct] let alone aircraft.

the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, forces went on the attack and started shelling Bie 
[Cuito] yesterday. 
  Civilian sources in the area of Bie have told the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, that large explosions 
were heard in the city. Despite the worrisome situation, 
sources in humanitarian aid organizations in Huambo have told 
Vorgan that World Food Program aircraft carrying aid have been 
able to land at Bie. 
  Those sources also said that the UNITA armed forces in Bie 
have been instructed to remain calm, but the situation could 
deteriorate if Luanda does insist on bombing the city. Two 
MPLA-PT attempts to provide parachute assistance to the People's 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola were thwarted this 
week. It would seem, though, that Luanda wants to expand the 
area it controls. Such a move would not appear to be peaceful.

  [Text] The right honorable prime minister, Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, today appealed to the Basotho nation to be calm over 
the tragic death of the late deputy prime minister, Mr. 
Selometsi Baholo. Addressing parliament this morning, the prime 
minister said he had received reports on the attack and murder 
of Mr. Baholo and the abduction of four other cabinet ministers. 
The matter was reported to the Council of State, which met 
under the chairmanship of His Majesty King Letsie III. 
  A delegation of four people were sent to the Makoanyane and 
Ratjomose barracks to investigate the condition of the four 
ministers and safeguard their lives. They were also to try to 
determine the causes of the crisis. The ministers were released 
last night and provided with tight security at their homes. Dr. 
Mokhehle congratulated the delegation on the excellent work they 
did. Dr. Mokhehle said he met members of the diplomatic corps 
and explained the situation to them. 
  The prime minister said he had received a special message of 
solidarity from the Commonwealth secretary general, Chief Emeka 
Anyaoku, who also promised two envoys to Lesotho to help in 
investigations into the causes of the present crisis. The 
envoys are Mr. Max Gaylard and Dr. Moses Anasu. Dr. Mokhehle 
told the house that arrangements for Mr. Baholo's funeral were 
being made. He expressed his deepest sympathy to Mr. Baholo's 
widow and family, to His Majesty the king, the government, and 
the people of Lesotho over the sad loss. The prime minister 
also briefed members of the senate on the same issue.

<F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>
  [Text] Maseru April 15 SAPA -- Two Commonwealth envoys 
arrived in the Lesotho capital Maseru on Friday [15 April] to 
probe the murder by dissident troops of Deputy Prime Minister 
Selometsi Baholo at his home early on Thursday morning. By 
Friday evening there had been no arrests or obvious government 
action on the killing, nor the kidnapping of four cabinet 
ministers who were released unharmed on Thursday night after a 
day in army barracks. 
  A government spokesman said an investigation was under way 
by 
military leaders. The government was unable on Friday to 
identify reasons for Thursday's events, although observers and 
diplomats pointed to an undisciplined military without loyalty 
to the one-year-old government of the Basotholand Congress Party 
[BCP]. 
  Soldiers continued to occupy strategic points on hills 
surrounding the capital on Friday, but told journalists this was 
routine. Short bursts of machine gun fire were heard in Maseru 
early on Friday morning. The city was otherwise quiet as 
residents went about their business. 
  Flags were not flown at half mast. However, the political 
situation remained "very tense", according to government 
spokesman Seeiso Sarutla. "The streets are not tense, but the 
situation is tense in government circles...they just lost their 
number two," a diplomat said. 
  Cabinet ministers and military leaders were unavailable for 
comment on Friday, and Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, who is also 
minister of defence, declined to take questions from journalists 
after briefing Lesotho's Parliament and Senate. 
  There was no word from King Letsie III, who on Thursday 
convened an emergency sitting of his state council to deal with 
the crisis. 
  Lesotho's military is engaged in a long-standing dispute 
over 
demands for a 100 per cent wage increase. Government has lumped 
soldiers with civil servants and says all salaries are under 
review. 
  Conflict between soldiers over acceptance of a government 
pay 
offer saw two armed camps shell each other in Maseru earlier 
this year, prompting the Commonwealth to appoint an 
investigative task force. That force, in its report released 
recently, called for more dialogue between parties; a reduction 
in size of the 2,500 royal Lesotho Defence Force; and more 
government transparency. 
  Some observers said ministers targeted by the army were part 
of a clique resisting its demands and pressing for increased 
discipline and government control of the armed forces, which 
they said needed re-orientation towards serving a democratic 
government. 
  Mr Sarutla said the killing and kidnapping could have been 
an 
attempt to isolate Mr Mokhehle and render him ineffective. He 
said the new government had inherited an undisciplined force and 
was having problems imposing discipline. "As long as the army 
is undisciplined then the safety of everyone is under threat." 
  The Commonwealth emissaries who arrived on Friday, Mr Moses 
Anasu and Mr Max Gaylard, were scheduled to meet the prime 
minister and military leaders at the weekend in a bid to solve 
Lesotho's latest crisis. 
  The BCP holds 64 of the 65 parliamentary seats, having swept 
to power in March last year in the country's first democratic 
elections in 22 years. A BCP victory at the polls in 1971 was 
rejected by then Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan who banned the 
party and exiled many of its leaders. Jonathan was toppled by 
Gen Metsing Lekhanya in a military coup in 1986. 
  Gen Lekhanya was in turn overthrown in 1991 by a member of 
his military council, Gen Elias Ramaema, who led the country to 
elections in 1993. 
  South Africa was concerned at recent events in Lesotho and 
was ready to render all moral assistance to the landlocked 
mountain kingdom, South African Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard 
Visser said.

  [Text] The Commonwealth delegation today met with the 
Lesotho Government mediation group to discuss the current 
situation in the country. The meeting follows an appeal by the 
right honorable the prime minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, for both 
parties to assist in resolving the crisis in the Lesotho armed 
forces. 
  The Commonwealth delegation consisted of Mr. Max Gaylord and 
Dr. Moses Anasu, who arrived in Maseru yesterday; and the 
Lesotho Government group comprised, Bishop (Phillip Mukuku), the 
president of the law society, Mr. (Tandiso Tlaudi), and Chief 
(Masopha Seyiso). Further negotiations between the Commonwealth 
group and the Lesotho military representatives were envisaged 
today. 
  The meetings follow an uprising by some members of the armed 
forces on Thursday this week which resulted in the fatal 
shooting of the deputy prime minister, the honorable Mr. 
Selometsi Baholo, and the arrest of four other ministers who 
were set free later that day after negotiations between the 
Lesotho Government mediation group and the military.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] The immediate tension appears to have subsided 
in Lesotho following the killing on Thursday [14 April] of 
Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo at the hands of rogue 
soldiers who also briefly detained four other government 
ministers. [passage omitted] Following this week's crisis, a 
Commonwealth mediating team has flown in to Lesotho. On the 
line to Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked Max Gaylord, director of 
political affairs in the Commonwealth secretariat, whether he 
thought this latest crisis was in fact an army revolt: 
  [Begin recording] [Gaylord] It's not that. In fact we have 
just come from a meeting with the delegation of 25 soldiers, the 
people that we dealt with last January. They have sought to 
reassure us of a couple of things. One is that the Royal 
Lesotho Defense Force is still united notwithstanding the rogue 
elements who perpetrated the events of last Thursday. They 
pledged again through us their loyalty to the Government of 
Lesotho, the democratically elected government, and have 
reiterated they want to be a professional army. 
  [Ecott] So, what do you have to do this time? 
  [Gaylord] Well, I think the principal purpose of our coming 
here, we have already been asked: Are you going to solve the 
crisis, whatever it is. Well, we are not doing that. We are 
here to help the Basotho. The government and the people of 
Lesotho are going to solve the crisis (?such as it is). But I 
think what we have been able to do is take a reading of the army 
through the 25 representatives. Of course, we will be passing 
that on to the government. In fact, we have already done so. 
And I think that is reassuring in itself. But certainly at one 
stage a couple of days ago, I think the international media was 
talking of a coup. Well, there is no evidence of that. 
  [Ecott] Can you say though what the incident actually 
revolves around because the government didn't seem to be too 
sure. They said it was a good guess that it was related to a 
pay dispute. 
  [Gaylord] I don't think our guess is any better than theirs 
at the moment, Tim. In fact, the investigation process is now 
under way and I guess it will have to be left to the commander 
and the authorities, but it is certainly to early for us to cast 
any sort of opinion on it. 
  [Ecott] Is the situation, however, volatile? Have the people 
you have spoken to given you the impression that this was a 
flare up that can be contained or will be contained? 
  [Gaylord] Well, I think it can say to you that I believe it 
can be contained. I believe it will be contained because as I 
say it looks very much like -- I used the term before -- rogue 
elements within the defense force. Certainly there is no hint 
of anything in the officer corps from, say, the rank of 
lieutenant and above. The deed appears to have been done by 
soldiers. So, it certainly can be contained, although it would 
be fair to say there is tension in the town. I think the 
civilians are probably (?heartily) sick of this sort of thing. 
Most of the soldiers or all of the soldiers we spoke to this 
afternoon are absolutely dismayed by it (?as well as they) might 
be. Some tension, but containable. [end recording]

  [Text] Mbabane April 17 SAPA -- A tribal Swazi chief has 
claimed that Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front--AVF] cadres 
are being trained in northern Swaziland. Chief Prince Mnikwa 
told SAPA's correspondent in Mbabane he had informed the Swazi 
military of the activities of the AVF, but so far nothing had 
been done. Chief Mnikwa did not say how he come to the 
conclusion that the people he had "seen in the mountains" were 
AVF cadres, but he feared these people would attack his subjects.

<F P=106> [Report by Bhekie Matsebula] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's right wing group -- AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] is reported to be holding political 
meetings at Lubodlwana mountain near Hhelehhele in Northern 
Hhohho. 
  This was confirmed on Saturday [16 April] by the chief of 
the 
area, Prince Mnikwa who said the meetings started a few weeks 
ago. He said the Umbutfo [warrior] Swaziland Defence Force 
(USDF) which patrols the area had been informed about the 
presence of the AWB at the mountain, but no action has been 
taken against them. The area is situated near the fence 
separating Swaziland from South Africa close to the Matsamo 
border gate. 
  Prince Mnikwa said he was told by his subjects on Monday 
last 
week, after he came back from hospital for an operation that 
last Saturday, that there was a large gathering of Boers at the 
Lubodlwana mountain close to a farm owned by a certain Mr. 
Botman. "When I asked whether the army had been informed about 
this, I was told that they had been informed, but no action was 
taken." 
  Prince Mnikwa said there had been similar reports in the 
past, but it had been difficult for him to believe them because 
the Boers were never seen. "But now they have been seen holding 
a meeting in broad-daylight. I therefore now believe that these 
Boers are using my area because they feel it is free from 
patrols." 
  Prince Mnikwa said the behaviour of the AWB was a violation 
of the country's laws which prohibit the holding of political 
meetings without a permit. He said he was planning to meet with 
the Pigg's Peak police station commander, Mr. Smart Dlamini to 
discuss what steps would be taken against the AWB.

  [Text] Niamey, April 17 (AFP) -- Opposition demonstrations 
here left at least one person dead and 20 injured, while police 
arrested leading opposition members on Niger's first anniversary 
as a democracy, a spokesman for the main opposition party MNSD 
said Sunday [17 April]. 
  The violence erupted Saturday, a day after the country's 
three opposition parties, lead by the MNSD or National Movement 
for the Development Society, called for civil disobedience to 
protest at the marginalisation of their supporters by the 
government. 
  Niamey Hospital said one demonstrator had died from his 
injuries and a second was seriously hurt. 
  The MNSD spokesman said police arrested about 100 party 
militants including "several influential members," among them 
Karadji Ayarga and Sani Mahamane, respectively a former 
government minister and former general secretary of the National 
Assembly. 
  MNSD is Niger's former sole party. The demonstrations came 
as the ruling Alliance of Forces for Change was celebrating the 
first anniversary of President Mahamane Ousmane's investiture. 
  The worst clashes occurred near Niamey stadium between 
opposition supporters and backers of the Alliance participating 
in the swearing-in ceremonies, the spokesman said. 
  Throughout the afternoon, youths erected roadblocks of 
burning tires at the city's main intersections and looted 
government cars. 
  On Friday, in a letter sent to Ousmane, the 33 opposition 
deputies (out of 83 deputies in total) threatened to form a 
parallel administration if their supporters were not given 46 
percent of top government jobs, a figure which corresponds to 
the amount of votes won by the opposition March 27, in the 
second round of presidential elections. 
  Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo condemned the 
demonstrations Saturday and said the government would not back 
down in the face of their protests. 
  Earlier in the week clashes between police and Islamic 
fundamentalists left 10 dead in northern Niamey, while 
negotiations with the rebel Tuaregs, due Friday, were postponed 
yet again. Tuaregs have been fighting a war since 1971 for 
recognition by the Niamey authorities of their rights and a 
share in the wealth derived from their uranium-rich traditional 
lands.

  [Excerpt] Niamey, April 17 (AFP) -- Police rounded up the 
leaders of the three main opposition groups here Sunday [17 
April], party officials said, in a crackdown launched the day 
after anti-government demonstrations left one dead and 20

  Mamadou Tanja, leader of the National Movement of the 
Development Society (MNSD), his counterpart Andre Salifou of the 
Union of Progressive Patriots and Democrats (UPDP) and the head

Assoumane, were arrested at midday (1100 GMT), an MNSD official 
told AFP. The party worker said the men were detained by 
detectives for questioning after emerging from a meeting at 
headquarters of the MNSD -- Niger's former sole party -- but 
official sources declined to confirm their arrests. [passage

  [Text] The Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] 
launched a general strike to demand salary increases to stem the 
effects of CFA devaluation. Now the opposition is calling for 
civil disobedience. Andre Salifou, the former speaker of the 
interim National Assembly and leader of the opposition Union of 
Progressive Patriots and Democrats, explains their demands. 
  [Begin Salifou recording] The (?UCI) [expansion unknown] is 
ailing. Democracy has been twisted for a year now, and the 
negative result is that our freedom of movement is not 
respected. What can we do in the face of such a situation? 
  After a year of various attempts, I repeat, various 
attempts, 
to solve the issue, because we condemned the way things were 
being conducted in Parliament and I myself am a parliamentarian, 
nobody listened. We issued press communiques, most of which 
were censored, asking the authorities to change their methods. 
We also held rallies and organized demonstrations. We 
petitioned and sent motions to the head of state, the prime 
minister. We sent a number of letters without receiving a 
single response. The only recourse left to us is the use of an 
article contained in our Constitution. Article 6 stipulates that 
the Niger people can call the state to order. The second point 
of this article further describes any power, any regime that 
deliberately violates the present Constitution, as oppressive. 
That is why we will launch a campaign of civil disobedience, 
because Niger is stifled and threatened with chaos. We should 
stop this devilish machine that could crush the country and its 
citizens. [end recording] 
  The Niger head of state, President Mahamane Ousmane, 
believes 
that the opposition should return to the negotiating table. To 
Mr. Ousmane, this call for civil disobedience is merely an 
emotional reaction from the opposition. 
  [Begin Ousmane recording] The opposition is expressing its 
fears. This is absolutely normal in the context of freedom of 
speech, of democracy, and political pluralism. Everybody has 
the right to express himself, express what they think, their 
views and conception on what is going on in the world. However, 
we have a framework that is the Constitution, the parties' 
manifestos, the laws and regulations of the Republic. As far as 
I am concerned, the opposition is not questioning these 
fundamental elements. I also think that until now, the 
opposition publicized their intention to use Article 6 of the 
Constitution and call for civil disobedience. Therefore, I 
believe this is an emotional expression. With consultations 
and dialogue, everything will be fine. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Mike Robertson and Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] The document Mohammend Valli Moosa carried in his 
briefcase is just five pages long. But what it contains -- a 
list of changes to government structures that have to be made in 
terms of the constitution -- is a task so mammoth that if Mr 
Valli Moosa and his fellow ANC members do nothing else in their 
first year in office, they will have achieved much. 
  But, simultaneously, the ANC will want to begin implementing 
its reconstruction and development programme. It will also have 
to deal with a secessionist KwaZulu government and a rebellious 
right wing. 
  Almost impossible challenges await the new government, but 
somebody has to formulate plans to meet them. As the ANC is 
the only party that seriously believes it will win the 
election, that task has fallen to a small sub-committee of its 
senior members headed by president Nelson Mandela. 
  Others on the task group are ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki, 
secretary- general Cyril Ramaphosa and national working 
committee members. Mohammed Valli Moosa, Cheryl Carolus and Zola 
Skweyiya. 
  The plans prepared by the group can be divided roughly into 
three categories: 

  -  Changes that have to be made at national level; 
  -  Changes that have to be made at provincial level; and 
  -  The appointment of the various statutory bodies provided for 
in 
the constitution. 
  The constitution states that President F.W. de Klerk and 
his cabinet will continue to run the country after the elections 
until the new president is inaugurated. If, as expected, Mr 
Mandela wins the election, Mr de Klerk will consult him before 
taking any action. 
  On May 6, the 400 members of the new National Assembly will 
meet in Cape Town to elect the president. As the rules that 
governed the functioning of Parliament no longer apply, the 
Assembly will have to draw up its own set of rules. In the 
meantime, a temporary set of rules has had to be drawn up in 
conjunction with the Secretary of Parliament. 
  On May 10, the new president will be inaugurated at the 
Union 
Buildings in Pretoria. The arrangements are being overseen by a 
committee under the chairmanship of Chief Justice Corbett. 
  The president will appoint his cabinet the following day. 
  The task group has clearly given much thought to possible 
cabinet appointments, but as these appointments are ultimately 
the prerogative of the new president, Mr Valli Moosa would not 
comment on this matter. However, interviewed in his Shell House 
office, he did offer some thoughts on how the ANC believed the 
cabinet should be structured. 
  He said cabinet committees would oversee the reconstruction 
and development programme and the promotion of gender equality. 
  Rather than have a Law and Order Ministry, control of the 
police should fall under the Home Affairs Department, he added. 
  The Department of Environment should be given much stronger 
powers than at present, and a Ministry of Science and Technology 
should be created. The committee has clearly also given much 
thought to candidates who could fill the post of 
director-general in each department. However, Mr Valli Moosa 
would only say that the matter was being discussed within ANC 
departments. 
  At a lower level, there will have to be seismic changes in 
the civil services and these will also have an impact on the new 
provincial governments. Under the new dispensation, the number 
of civil services in South Africa will be reduced from the 
current 15 to 10. The restructuring of the civil services will 
be arduous task which could necessitate uprooting many people's 
lives. 
  For example, the area that is now Bophuthatswana will fall 
into the Northern Cape, the North West and the Orange Free 
State. Civil servants will be transferred to the new provincial 
governments. 
  Some functions, such as foreign affairs and defence, will be 
taken over by the central government, and senior military 
officers could be required to move to Pretoria. 
  The constitution stipulates that a range of functions will 
have to be transferred from central to provincial government. 
Civil servants working for the central government in Pretoria 
may accordingly have to be transferred. 
  Millions of people will be affected by these changes, which 
will be dealt with by the president in consultation with the 
nine provincial premiers, the Public Service Commission (which 
has to be appointed as soon as practically possible after the 
election) and the Commission on Provincial Government. 
  The third broad category of constitution requirements facing 
Mr Valli Moosa and the task force -- the appointment of a range 
of new statutory bodies -- includes the appointment of a 
constitutional court, a public prosecutor, a Judicial Services 
Commission and a Human Rights Commission. 
  Not least of the task force's difficulties will be the 
appointment of the right person for the right job. More 
complicated than most will be the task of appointing the 
constitution court judges. The president will appoint the head 
of the constitutional court. The fact that top ANC legal 
experts Arthur Chaskalson and Albie Sachs are not standing for 
the election suggests they could be in line for this post. 
  Four serving judges will be appointed by the president in 
consultation with the cabinet and the Chief Justice. The 
remaining six judges will be chosen from a list of 10 submitted 
by the Judicial Services Commission. 
  But that commission has yet to be set up and there are even 
more elaborate procedures for appointing its members. For 
example, the constitution states that the attorneys' profession 
has to appoint two members. There is no single body 
representing attorneys. 
  The constitutional court has to be established as soon as 
possible after the election. It will hear any case involving a 
possible violation of a fundamental right entrenched in the 
constitution. 
  Given the complexities of the task awaiting the new 
government, it is no wonder Mr Valli Moosa speaks rather 
wistfully of the U.S. where a new president is given three 
months to prepare to govern and appoint members of his 
administration. South Africa's new president will be afforded 
no such luxuries.

<F P=106> [By Lena Slachmuiljder and Bereng Mtimkulu] </F>
  [Text] Inkatha's war plans began falling into place this 
week as the kwaZulu government merged its Umfolozi army with the 
homeland's police force -- a move that is seen as an attempt to 
licence its private army. This followed the collapse of 
international mediation between itself, the government and the 
ANC. 
  Inkatha's Youth Brigade announced on Friday [15 April] that 
it would embark on "rolling mass action," involving a week-long 
stayaway beginning tomorrow with marches in various cities and 
townships. 
  Reports from sources in Natal indicate that hostel dwellers 
were evacuating women and children from the hostels in 
anticipation of a civil war which they say will start soon. 
  In another development, the kwaZulu Police (KZP) has 
absorbed 
about 1,000 trainees from the kwaZulu government-sponsored 
training camp adjacent to the Umfolozi Game Reserve. 
  This has led to fears that the move might be aimed at 
providing cover to the Umfolozi trainees so that they can carry 
out attacks with impunity. 
  The trainees are to be employed by the KZP as special 
constables and will be under the command of the KZP's Internal 
Stability Unit (ISU). They will then be dispatched in groups of 
200 to the districts of Esikhawini, Umlazi, Nqutu, Madadeni, 
kwaMashu and Ulundi. 
  They have been trained in basic skills of self-defence and 
shooting, according to camp commander Philip Powell, an Inkatha 
Central Committee member. It is also assumed that the trainees 
were brain-washed with anti-ANC propaganda. 
  KZP Commissioner Lieutenant-General Roy During confirmed 
that 
the recruitment of the Umfolozi trainees -- as they have since 
become known -- was underway. He insisted that the recruits 
would receive further training by the kwaZulu Police. This is 
an unlikely scenario, as the election is due to take place in 10 
days' time. 
  Inkatha's Youth Brigade threatened to turn South Africa into 
a second Bosnia if the ANC and the police try to prevent their 
planned marches into Johannesburg and parts of Natal this coming 
week. 
  Public transport will be disrupted during the week-long 
stayaway and there are reports that taxis, buses and trains that 
defy the stayaway call will be attacked as the passengers 
travelling in them will be regarded as ANC supporters. 
  SA Police regional commissioner Lt-Gen Koos Calitz on Friday 
banned marches and gatherings in Witwatersrand magisterial 
districts. The banning orders, promulgated under the unrest 
regulations of the Public Safety Act, were "deemed necessary for 
the combating or prevention of public disturbance, disorder, 
riot or public violence," Gen Calitz said. The banning orders 
cover Alberton, Boksburg, Benoni, Springs, Germiston, Kempton 
Park, Johannesburg, Randburg, Roodepoort, Krugersdorp, and 
Westonaria. 
  The ANC and its youth league have called on the security 
forces to ensure that it deploys enough personnel to protect 
innocent people. The ANC also called on the security forces to 
ensure that Inkatha impis [group of warriors] are stopped from 
leaving the hostels. 
  Meanwhile, the Johannesburg City Council yesterday said that 
several areas of the city will be cordoned off from 6am 
tomorrow. Razor-wire installations will be erected in some of 
the streets -- especially along roads leading to ANC 
headquarters at Shell House -- and at the Library gardens and 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) offices in Kruis Street. 
A strong police presence is expected in the city centre. 
  "The city council is opposed to unlawful marches that 
endanger the safety of people and interfere with their right to 
go about their normal daily lives," town clerk Nicky Padayachee 
said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 17 SAPA -- The planned Inkatha 
Freedom Party Youth Brigade [IFPYB] march through Johannesburg 
on Monday [18 March] has been postponed, but rolling mass action 
would continue at a later date, possibly Tuesday, IFPYB 
executive committee member Sipho Mathobela told a news 
conference in Johannesburg on Sunday. 
  But he evaded questions on whether the mass action would be 
provocative by saying: "Mass action will take place. The date 
will be announced late tomorrow (Monday). It will be peaceful, 
very, very peaceful and non-violent." 
  The brigade's executive committee was meeting the IFP's 
Executive Committee to discuss plans for the protests, he said. 
  Mr Mathobela said the march would have to be held in 
Johannesburg because eight Zulu marchers were killed outside the 
African National Congress headquarters at Shell House in 
Johannesburg. He said people could decide themselves whether to 
take part in the stay-away and wreath-laying ceremony outside 
Shell House. 
  When the IFP Youth Brigade first announced its planned 
week-long stay-away on Friday, PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] regional chairman Charles Lilowe said only 
journalists, students and civil workers were exempted from the 
call. 
  Youth brigade members at the media briefing said they could 
not comment on details of the planned mass action because it was 
being discussed at the moment. They insisted the march would be 
peaceful. 
  But the march would go ahead by force if police did not give 
permission, brigade PWV Regional Secretary Carter Ndlovu said.

  [Excerpts] The proposed march through Johannesburg by the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Youth Brigade tomorrow has been 
postponed. It's expected to go ahead on Tuesday, instead, along 
with the stayaway. March organizers today blamed what they 
called technical problems for the postponement. The say they'll 
make a final decision on the march late tomorrow. Police say 
they'll continue with their contingency plan in the city 
tomorrow, treating it as a crime prevention exercise. Arlene 
Wainstein reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Wainstein] The IFP Youth Brigade is 
adamant that the march will go ahead in Johannesburg. They say 
it will be a peaceful one, but they are determined to defy the 
ban imposed by the regional commissioner of police. 
  [Youth Brigade spokesman Charles Loliwe] We actually appeal 
to him as a party that he should give us a permission so that we 
should march in the Johannesburg city to mourn for our people 
who were brutally murdered, because if he is going to disagree 
to grant us a permission to march in Jo'burg [Johannesburg], 
what I'm going to say is, we are going to march by force in 
Jo'burg. 
  [Wainstein] The pivotal part of any IFP march through the 
streets of Johannesburg will be a memorial service here at ANC 
headquarters in Plein Street. In line with ancient black custom 
the spirits of those who were killed here just two weeks ago can 
only be laid to rest once a wreath-laying ceremony has been held 
at the spot. The IFP Youth Brigade says ban or no ban, this is 
one duty they simply have to perform. It's a sentiment that was 
echoed today by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  [Buthelezi] So I think that 53 people that were killed in 
cold blood has made the blood of many people to boil, and I 
think the least that they would like to do is to pay tribute to 
them. I don't think there are any other motives as far as I can 
see myself. [passage omitted] 
  [Wainstein] The Youth Brigade says the rolling mass action 
will continue until after the election. Among their plans, the 
march is on the Independent Electoral Commission and the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. They say they want to coerce big 
business into intervening to postpone the elections until the 
IFP is part of the process. Also on the cards is a 
demonstration at SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
headquarters. This is to protest, what they call, the ANC 
allegiance of board chairman, Dr. Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, and the 
assistant to the chief executive, Mr. Zwelakhe Sisulu. [end

  [Text] Johannesburg April 17 SAPA -- The South African 
Police [SAP] on Sunday [17 March] welcomed the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's decision to postpone its planned march on Monday through 
Johannesburg. "The South African Police appreciates the 
responsible decision taken by the IFP Youth Brigade not to 
conduct their demonstration on Monday. 
  "In view of the IFP's decision to postpone the 
demonstration, 
it must be stated that any intention to conduct the 
demonstration on any other day should be negotiated and any 
application will be considered according to its merits and the 
prevailing circumstances at the time," police liaison officer 
Col Dave Bruce said. 
  The postponement of Monday's planned IFP Youth Brigade march 
through Johannesburg was announced on Sunday by Brigade 
Executive Committee Chairman Sipho Mathobela. 
  He said however rolling mass action would continue at a 
later 
date, possibly Tuesday. The issue was being discussed at the 
brigade's Executive Committee and the IFP National Executive 
Committee. 
  Col Bruce said: "In the light of events on March 28 (when 53 
Zulu marchers were killed in Johannesburg), there remains a 
distinct possibility that any demonstration in the CBD [central 
business district] could be disrupted. "This poses a definite 
danger to public order and saftey," he said. 
  The police would consider any application by the IFP to hold 
another march, but "the possibility of police allowing thousands 
of demonstrators (into Johannesburg) was minimal". 
  A demonstration was not bannned because it was organised by 
a 
particular political party. Considering the events of March 28, 
other elements were present during a march in the city centre. 
  An IFP march through benoni on the East Rand was allowed to 
go ahead on Saturday because the IFP there had a history of 
non-violence and police did not expect any trouble there, he 
said. 
  In the run up to the election, Col Bruce continued, police 
regional commissioner Lt Gen Koos Kalitz decided police would 
maintain high visibility. 
  Police would conduct crime prevention operations despite the 
demonstration's postponement.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The Inaktha Freedom 
Party [IFP] Youth Brigade on Monday [18 March] announced a 
stayaway in Johannesburg and its environs on Tuesday, saying 
this was part of its right to push for true democracy in South 
Africa. 
  At the same time, the Youth Brigade set a deadline of 4PM on 
Tuesday for President F W de Klerk to respond to a series of 
demands, failing which it would embark on rolling mass action. 
  "We also ask our people to mark tomorrow (Tuesday) as a day 
of prayer for our parents who were murdered by (African National 
Congress armed wing) Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the 
Nation] thugs in Johannesburg two weeks ago," Mr Zenzeli 
Phakathi, the brigade's national publicity secretary, told a 
press conference in Johannesburg. 
  He said demands put to Mr de Klerk include investigating the 
deaths of eight people outside the ANC's Shell House 
headquarters on March 28, to explain why MK had not been 
disbanded and IFP constitutional requirements. 
  If Mr de Klerk did not responded appropriately to their 
demands, the Youth Brigade would embark on "rolling mass action". 
  This would be spontaneous, with participation by IFP members 
in Natal, the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], the 
Orange Free State and parts of the Cape. 
  IFP Central Committee member Themba Khoza acknowledged the 
action could have serious consequences for the economy. "We say 
that the rand is our major target. We want to shoot it down. But 
before the rand falls, (Mr) de Klerk must rise and deal with our 
demands," Mr Khoza said. 
  "This is civil disobedience in the way that Mahatma Gandhi 
carried it out. The position of the Youth Brigade needs to be 
taken seriously. We are trying to prevent a civil war," he said. 
  On the constitution, Mr Khoza said it was important the 
April 
elections be postponed. 
  "If they don't postpone the elections half the people will 
stay away and will not want to be ruled by a new government 
composed of (Mr) Mandela/(Mr) de Klerk. 
  "We say they should rather postpone the elections for two or 
three months and deal with the unrest during that period, rather 
than have the elections now and then have unrest that does not 
stop at all," he said. 
  He said the IFP Youth Brigade had the support of the parent 
body's national leadership. 
  "We are one body just as an upper abdomen and a lower 
abdomen 
are linked."

  [Text] Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini says he has never 
supported violence as a means to settle political differences. 
Speaking after a 5-hour meeting with a delegation of church 
leaders and members of the National Peace Committee, King 
Zwelithini called on his subjects to stop killing each other. 
He said he was aware that Zulus belong to different political 
parties, however, as Christians they should be able to settle 
their differences in a peaceful manner. 
  After the talks, Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed the hope 
that the Zulus would heed their king's call. Peace Committee 
Chairman John Hall said South Africa would be relying heavily on 
peace structures in the months ahead. He said it might be 
necessary to meet with political leaders again to reaffirm their 
commitment to the peace accord.

  [Text] Piet Retief April 16 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini is expected to consider a draft agreement this 
weekend, spelling out his future as Zulu monarch, the 
government's chief negotiator Mr Roelf Meyer told a National 
Party [NP] meeting in Piet Retief on Friday, reports SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news. Mr Meyer said the 
draft agreement had been drawn up this week by the government, 
the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. 
  He expected the king to react to the draft next week before 
it would be considered by the multi-party negotiating council. 
  Mr Meyer appealed to Inkatha Freedom Party supporters to 
vote 
for the NP in the election as they had no other choice, as he 
put it.

  [Text] A Natal right-wing group, the northern Natal Boer 
Commando, has come out in support of Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini's call for a Zulu kingdom. At a rally addressed by 
the king near Newcastle today, a spokesman for the group said 
they would be at the disposal of the king. The king again told 
his followers that suppression would follow if they voted on 
April the 27th and 28th. Gary Alfonso reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Alfonso] It was a day of contrasts which 
became a day of unity. Zulu impis [warriors] armed with spears 
and knobkieries danced passed the group of stone faced 
right-wing commando members. They have, however, one thing in 
common. They refused to acknowledge the state of emergency in 
kwaZulu/Natal. The Zulus are defying the restrictions by 
carrying illegal traditional weapons. The right wingers have 
occupied a site in the center of Newcastle. Despite emergency 
regulations, they refused to budge. 
  At Dick's Halt outside the town, King Goodwill Zwelithini 
told his followers their vote on election day would empower a 
central government that did not understand their needs. 
  [Zwelithini] As long as central government continues to 
exist 
and the voice of the people is silent, the bigger our problems 
in the region will become. 
  [Alfonso] A while later, a spokesman for the Boer Commando 
told the crowd what they apparently wanted to hear. 
  [Boer Commando's Delarey Schoeman] We are here to tell the 
king of the Zulu people that our strength is his strength. Our 
power is his power. [loud applause] 
  [Alfonso] The unit was cheered as they marched from the 
gathering site, and the king later officially opened a 
life-giving water supply scheme to the small Zulu community. An 
ANC rally in the same area was postponed to tomorrow. Most 
party supporters opted to go to Ladysmith to catch a glimpse of 
their leader. Newcastle is well known for its political 
divisions. Local ANC, IFP, and now right-wing officials say the 
area belongs to them. That claim will not be tested because 
thousands of people have been told not to go to the polls in 
less than two weeks' time. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary signed by "The Editor": "Stop Throwing Cash at </F>
Them"] 
  [Text] The bellicosity of the Inkatha Freedom Party grows 
daily more reckless, and the actions of its youth wing approach 
treasonable insurrection. The challenge can no longer be 
ignored. 
  The youth brigade, egged on by more adult leaders, plans to 
march tomorrow on Shell House, headquarters of the African 
National Congress, in the heart of Johannesburg. Its leaders 
say they will defy a police ban to do so. 
  They also plan a week of rolling mass action to bring the 
country, or at least its leading metropolis, to a halt. Their 
attitude is defiant and confrontational, and their aim is to 
stop or disrupt the country's first free elections. They are 
willing to risk bloodshed and to precipitate civil war to do so. 
  They cannot be allowed to succeed. The birth of South 
African democracy cannot be made hostage to violence. Inkatha 
has ceased to be a mere political problem; it has become a 
problem of basic law and order. 
  The police are deploying massive resources to stop the march 
on Shell House. That is proper, but it is important for the 
future to combine firmness with restraint. It is especially 
important to prevent wild shooting or mass killings such as 
occurred in Johannesburg a fortnight ago. The march must not 
give martyrs to the future. 
  At the same time, it is not sufficient simply to break up 
concentrations of marchers or demonstrators with tear gas, and 
allow them to reassemble elsewhere, or to make the notorious 
hostels a base for future raids and sallies. It is necessary 
for the police to disarm as many people as they can, and to 
arrest those who break the law. 
  But police action alone will not end this incipient 
insurrection. The power of the Inkatha Freedom Party to sow 
mayhem in the Transvaal derives in very large part from the 
immense flow of public money -- more than R4-billion [rand] a 
year -- from the government to the Zulu bantustan. 
  That flow of money should have been cut off months ago. The 
tasks of paying pensions and salaries, and especially of 
controlling the kwaZulu Police, should have been taken over by 
the central government months ago. 
  Our progress towards democracy, not to speak of our lives 
and 
property, is now threatened because President de Klerk tried as 
long as he could to preserve Chief Buthelezi as a future 
political ally against the ANC. That endeavour has proved vain. 
  Even that expedient reason for keeping Chief Buthelezi 
afloat 
has fallen away. 
  In about a fortnight's time the new government will begin to 
take control of kwaZulu from Ulundi. There is no need to wait. 
  President de Klerk owes it to the nation, and to its hopes 
of 
free and democratic elections, to cut off all state support for 
Chief Buthelezi's regime: money, personnel and facilities, and 
access to credit. He owes it to the nation to do so immediately. 
  Only when Chief Buthelezi's reign of terror in Ulundi is 
brought to an end will we know how many Zulu people truly 
support him. Only when his administration is allowed to 
collapse will the Zulu people be able to join the rest of South 
Africa in their march to freedom. 
  Until then we shall depend on an over-worked police force, 
and an army spread thin, to hold the line against the mayhem 
which, clearly, it is Inkatha's intention to sow. Until then, 
we shall depend on the fortitude of the people of Johannesburg 
to keep this economy ticking over, and this country functioning. 
  All these people have a right to expect President de Klerk 
to 
stop fiddling while Rome burns.

  [Text] Five men showing signs of serious assault have been 
taken to the district surgeon after a police swoop on the ANC's 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] offices in 
Johannesburg last night. A police spokesman, Colonel Dave 
Bruce, said that an injured black man had stopped a police 
patrol in Hillbrow last night and had taken them to the ANC's 
regional offices at Lancet Hall from where he said he had 
escaped earlier. There the police had been confronted by a man 
armed with a handgun. The man was wounded and arrested. 
  Inside the building, four males, the youngest of whom was 14 
years old, were found in a barred holding cell. All of them 
showed signs of severe assault. Col. Bruce said ANC officials 
had claimed that the five had been detained at the ANC offices 
for suspected car theft, and that they were to have been handed 
over to the police. The police are investigating charges of 
abduction and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

<F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- Police on Sunday [17 
April] night found four men who claimed to be Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] members being held captive in a cell in the basement 
of the African National Congress regional headquarters in 
Johannesburg after a fifth man told a patrol in Hillbrow he had 
escaped. 
  Three of those inside were elderly and the fourth was a 
14-year-old, said Witwatersrand Police Spokesman Col Dave Bruce 
who added that they all showed signs of serious assault. He 
said when members of the flying squad attempted to enter the 
building, Lancet Hall, a man tried to prevent them from gaining 
access by pointing a firearm at them. One of the captives said 
he had been held since April 16. 
  Col Bruce also said the ANC members had told police the 
captives were caught breaking into a vehicle and that they had 
planned to call them when the flying squad arrived. The ANC 
have not yet furnished comment. 
  ANC spokesman Mr Ronnie Mamoepa said he was not aware of the 
details of the police report. "It is not the policy of the ANC 
to hold people against their will," he said, adding that a full 
statement would be issued later in the day.

  [Text] Police in Johannesburg say four men claiming to be 
members of the Inkatha Freedom Party were found by police held 
captive in the basement of a building that houses the regional 
offices of the ANC. A police spokesman said the four, three of 
them elderly, and a 14-year-old were found after a fifth man who 
said he had escaped alerted a police patrol. The police 
spokesman said ANC officials told them the men were held as they 
attempted to break into a car outside the building, and that the 
police arrived before the ANC had time to alert them. 
  The ANC was not immediately available for comment, but the 
movement's regional chairman, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, promised a 
statement later in the day. He also promised a full internal 
investigation and disciplinary measures within 24 hours if there 
was any wrongdoing by ANC security staff in the building.

  [Text] The National Party [NP] has questioned the need for 
a political party to have a cell in its offices following last 
night's police swoop in which four injured men were found at the 
ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters in 
Johannesburg. The four, some of whom claimed to be IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] members, were found in a barred cell after a 
fifth man summoned the police to the ANC offices at Lancet 
House. The fifth man also showed signs of serious assault and 
said he had escaped from the ANC headquarters. 
  ANC officials told the police last night that they had 
detained the men because they were suspected of breaking into 
cars. The NP said this incident confirmed many people's 
suspicions about what went on in ANC offices, and raised new 
questions about the reasons why ANC President Nelson Mandela had 
stopped the police from searching ANC headquarters after 
shooting in the city three weeks ago.

  [Text] Durban April 18 SAPA -- The Natal Security Committee 
on Monday [18 April] reported at least 20 killings in the 
province at the weekend, raising to at least 237 the toll from 
violence in Natal since a state of emergency was declared 18 
days ago. 
  Most of the weekend killings were in townships north of 
Durban and at other trouble spots. Additional reports were 
expected from the kwaZulu Police later on Monday. 
  South African Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said two men, 
Mr B. Dlamini and Mr T. Dlamini, were burnt to death when their 
shack was set alight at Bhambayi on Sunday night. He also 
reported the killing of headman Mr Jacob Magwazi in the Port 
Shepstone area. There were no further details. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party spokesman Mr Ed Tillett reported the 
killing of kwaZulu self-protection camp instructor Mr Bheki 
Vilakazi at kwaMashu and the murder of Mr Senzo Dwara, the son 
of a kwaMashu councillor. Maj Naidoo could not immediately 
confirm these reports.

<F P=106> [From the "PM Newswrap" program] </F>
  [Text] The results of an internal Eskom [Electricity Supply 
Commission] investigation into an aborted arms deal to kwaZulu 
was revealed today, while the Goldstone Commission of inquiry 
into the same deal also got under way in Johannesburg. Ferial 
Haffejee reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Haffejee] The commissioner of police, 
General Johan van der Merwe, approved the export permit 
necessary to sell 1,000 rifles from Eskom to kwaZulu. This was 
one of the findings of an Eskom internal investigation into the 
aborted sale. The findings were released at a press conference 
this afternoon. The electricity company's chief executive, Allan 
Morgan: 
  [Morgan] This was confirmed later on by the South African 
Police [SAP], that they did receive the application and that 
they also issued a permit on that application on the Friday 
morning, the 25th. This application was dealt with at the 
highest echelons of the SAP. It was also approved at that 
level. The permit was signed by a Major Le Roux on behalf of 
the commissioner of police. 
  [Haffejee] The arms drama started when Eskom Executive Dr. 
George Lindeque found two unlicensed trucks being loaded with 
guns on 25 March by employee Johan van der Walt. Van der Walt 
manages arms at Eskom. Lindeque investigated immediately, and 
the arms deal was canceled. The internal probe has found that 
Eskom procedures for weapons sales had not been followed by the 
staff involved. But the company also found that no Eskom 
employees knew the arms were bound for kwaZulu. Instead, Eskom 
is laying the blame at the door of the three arms dealers 
involved in the plan. The company claims that one of the 
dealers, J. Garb and Company, repeatedly denied that the guns 
were for the kwaZulu Police. 
  [Morgan] On the 25th, when the negotiations started with 
Eskom in all seriousness, the Garb brothers were in fact in the 
office of Mr. Bonthuis. Mr. Bonthuis -- and this has been 
confirmed by other witnesses -- then asked them whether these 
weapons will not be destined for either the far-right or for 
kwaZulu Police. They did not comment on this, but indicated 
that the firearms will be exported out of the country. 
  [Haffejee] Meanwhile, the Goldstone investigation into the 
aborted sale of guns got under way this morning. The commission 
heard that Philip Powell of the kwaZulu government first 
approached arms dealers Gintans Security for weapons. He 
claimed that the arms were for northern Natal farmers. Powell 
is in charge of training kwaZulu's self-protection units. 
Lawyers for the kwaZulu government told the commission that 
kwaZulu was finding it difficult to procure arms. It needed 
weapons for the 1,000 special constables who are currently being 
recruited. KwaZulu is expecting trouble in the run-up to the 
election, they said. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by John Perlman, Janine Lazarus, and Guy Jepson] </F>
  [Text] Amid allegations that Police Commissioner General 
Johan van der Merwe authorised the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic 
rifles from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] to the Kwazulu 
Police [KZP], the SAP [South African Police] yesterday failed to 
arrive at a Goldstone Commission hearing called to probe the 
attempted weapons deals Eskom's corporate investigations 
consultant, Gaf van Niekerk, said yesterday that the export 
permit for the weapons (required by law for weapons sales to 
"self- governing" territories) had been approved by the police. 
He said it had been discussed with the commissioner and signed 
by a Major R le Roux on Van der Merwe's behalf. 
  And Ivan Garb, MD of the firearms dealer involved in the 
weapons transaction, yesterday told the inquiry he was also 
given to understand that it had been authorised by the 
commissioner. 
  Van der Merwe yesterday denied he had personally authorised 
the deal or was aware of it. Speaking from his home yesterday 
afternoon, he told WEEKEND STAR. "That is not correct, not at 
all." 
  Van der Merwe said the SAP section responsible for the 
issuing of firearm permits had inquired at his office whether 
there was any special provision regarding "the issuing of 
permits for the exporting of certain arms to KwaZulu". 
  "My office went through the minutes of the Cabinet and 
informed the Firearms Register that there is no such provision 
and that they can continue in terms of the normal requirements 
of the Arms and Ammunition Act, and they did so." 
  Yesterday's hearing lasted barely two hours, but the 
information that has begun to emerge may well prove to be 
explosive when the hearing is reconvened on Wednesday. The 
commission heard evidence that Phillip Powell, commander of 
KwaZulu's controversial self-protection units, had initiated the 
deal from the KwaZulu government side. 
  Evidence was also presented that while the KwaZulu 
government 
paid out R2.1 million [rand] for the weapons -- the money was 
returned when the deal fell through -- the purchase price for 
the guns was just R675,000. Seyeh International, a private 
company whose director John Sleep helped to initiate the deal, 
made a profit of R1.03 million, with the rest of the balance 
going to Garbs, the firearm dealers. 
  But the biggest surprise came at the start when Mr Justice 
Richard Goldstone called the roll of legal counsel and found 
that the SAP was not represented. He told the hearing that he 
had written to Van der Merwe on Wednesday requesting SAP 
representation at yesterday's inquiry. In this letter Mr 
Justice Goldstone also asked Van der Merwe to provide the 
commission with certain information, including "all documents 
and correspondence relating to the issue of the permit for the 
delivery of 1,000 LM-4 rifles on Friday, 25 March 1994." This 
was the day the Eskom deal was supposed to go through. 
  The judge asked for the names of the police officials who 
had 
authorised the permit and the reasons for such authorisation. 
He also required information about Eskom's earlier sale of 
1,043 G-3 rifles to the KwaZulu Police. 
  Subsequent correspondence clearly signals a looming 
stand-off 
between the commission and SA's top policeman. Van der Merwe 
replied the following day, saying that "the time allowed was not 
sufficient". The commissioner said that the "short notice 
received of the inquiry" had made it impossible for the SAP to 
"consult with and instruct its legal representatives". He asked 
Mr Justice Goldstone to "consider postponing the inquiry to a 
mutually arranged date". 
  The judge replied that the matter had been made public by 
Eskom on April 1, "more than two weeks ago". He said the arms 
sale on March 25 and "the permit issued on that day by the SAP 
are hardly complex matters". 
  At the hearing, Eskom representative Dr George Lindeque 
described how he was on his way to his car when he stumbled 
across men loading rifles into trucks parked in the company's 
garage. He said a check revealed that Henk Pienaar, Eskom's 
head of protective services, knew nothing about the deal. Van 
Niekerk told the commission that the vehicles had not been 
signed in on Eskom's security register and did not have number 
plates. 
  Stephen Mullins, appearing on behalf of the KwaZulu 
government and the KZP, said it had become "increasingly 
difficult" to source weapons for the homeland's forces. 
  Responding to WEEKEND STAR's story last week that a vehicle 
belonging to the National Intelligence Service [NIS] had been 
seen at Eskom during a weapons transaction NIS head of 
information security Andre Roux said inspection of the vehicles 
log showed that it had not been used on the day in question. He 
said an examination of fuel consumption and questioning of 
personnel who controlled the vehicle's use had confirmed this. 
  Eskom representatives said they "could not find any trace of 
(the NIS vehicle) being there". Roux said a vehicle, belonging 
to a security company, with a similar registration was at Eskom 
on the day in question. Eskom representatives confirmed this.

  [Excerpts] With billions of rands leaving South Africa, the 
Reserve Bank has warned that people taking money illegally out 
of the country "will be dealt with with the full force of the 
law". 
  In the past 18 months, more than R16-billion [rand] has 
flowed out of the country as international and local businesses 
react to political uncertainty and unrest. 
  Since 1985, the figure is estimated at close on R50-billion 
-- money this country can ill afford to lose with massive 
unemployment and the expected demands on socio-economic 
programmes during the next five to 10 years. 
  A senior Reserve Bank spokesman said it was difficult to 
establish exactly what percentage of the money that left the 
country was taken out illegally. 
  "But we are aware of the different ways that companies and 
individuals use to take their money offshore. And the fact 
that several people have landed in prison because of illegal 
transactions and foreign exchange fraud confirms that we are 
ready to act and to act with the full force of the law," said 
the spokesman. [passage omitted] 
  But the spokesman for the Reserve Bank warned that the bank 
and the commercial branch of the South African police had 
excellent relationships with the relevant departments in these 
countries and that details of these illegal accounts and 
transactions would be laid bare to the bone. 
  "We view these crimes in a very serious light and will leave 
no stone unturned to expose and bring to book people who have 
committed these crimes. 
  "Our courts have already shown that they have little 
sympathy 
for these so called white collar criminals." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>
  [Text] The bloodbath in currency markets this week will not 
affect Mr and Mrs Average South African immediately, but the 
long term effects are potentially devastating. 
  Higher inflation, higher interest rates and a dearth of 
foreign investment are just some of the worries if we don't 
bring violence under control. 
  The precipitous 13 percent collapse of the financial rand 
R5.71 [rand] to the US dollar on Monday is a stark warning to 
all South Africans that unless violence in the country abates, 
we may not have an economy left after the election later this 
month. 
  The freefall in the investment currency was sparked off by a 
failed four-leader summit, coming on top of television images of 
bodies lying in the streets in central Johannesburg after an 
Inkatha Freedom Party protest march. 
  As such it is a stark indication of just how jaundiced a 
view 
foreign investors are taking about our flirtation with anarchy. 
  They've voted with their feet and sold at any cost. 
  They'll also be hard to entice the second time around. 
  Although overseas investors may succumb to attractive yields 
as the discount between the financial and commercial rands 
widens on political uncertainty, it's not speculation we want to 
encourage by long-term confidence in the country. 
  Without foreign investment, massive reconstruction has 
little 
chance of going ahead. 
  And the expectations of the electorate of free homes and 
education under the ANC's ambitious R39 billion Reconstruction 
and Development Programme will likely be dashed. 
  The finrand is specifically designed to protect and absorb 
political shocks and to discourage foreign investors from 
removing their money from the country -- and it's arguably the 
best barometer of overseas confidence in South Africa. 
  Unfortunately, bearish sentiment in the finrand market 
inevitably spills over onto the commercial rand market, as 
happened on Monday when the commercial rand fell to historic 
lows of R3.75 to the dollar. 
  If the devaluation of the rand continues, imported 
inflationary pressure will start to hot up, which could 
encourage higher domestic inflation. 
  This in turn could delay the long-awaited cut in interest 
rates -- in a worst-case scenario they could even rise. 
  This could stop credit demand and retail sales picking up -- 
and consumer spending is a crucial factor in economic recovery. 
  Although many economists were predicting growth of more than 
4 percent for 1994 after more than four years of grinding 
recession, many are now predicting a deceleration of growth in 
the first quarter of 1994 because of the endemic violence and 
political uncertainty in the run-up to the election. 
  And growth of at least 3 percent is needed simply to offset 
burgeoning population growth.

  [Text] The Portuguese Government is to evacuate about 
600,000 Portuguese nationals to neighboring Mozambique in case 
widespread violence breaks out in South Africa after the 
elections. This is according to the Portuguese daily newspaper, 
PUBLICO. The newspaper said that the Portuguese Air Force will 
be on standby to airlift the Portuguese nationals from South 
Africa to Mozambique. However, the newspaper said the 
Portuguese authorities were confident that violence would 
decrease in South Africa after the elections.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Liberal Democracy -- South Africa "has now joined the 
nations 
where political choice is a matter of of weighing freedom 
against welfare, the efficiencies of the market against the 
bureaucracy of government, liberty against order" or "crudely 
put, how much government, how much freedom," an editorial in 
Johannesburg SUNDAY TINES in English on 17 April on page 34 
notes. THE ANC "has tried to define the future" putting forward 
a "comprehensive `plan' for reconstruction and development" 
which is "attractively populist, showing a sincere concern for 
needs of deprived and relatively helpless communities," but "it 
perceives solutions not in the disorderly process of a free 
society, but only in the coercive interventions of government." 
"To its left is the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], mired in 
primitive socialism and driven by an anger that is deeply 
racist" and the SACP [South African Communist Party], intent on 
"dragging the ANC and the country leftwards and backwards." 
President de Klerk wears his new "liberal democracy" clothes 
"uncomfortably and his party is simply bewildered by the 
change." The Democratic Party, DP, "does at least understand the 
principles of liberal democracy, but it has fallen on hard 
times." The Federal Party is considered "a lobby rather than a 
political movement." "A vote for any of these would serve to 
strengthen opposition to the ANC, but only the DP -- given fresh 
leadership -- can possibly form the base around which a 
liberal-democratic alternative must, sooner or later, 
consolidate. To change leaders is easy, but to create a new 
institution to serve as the vehicle of liberal-democratic values 
would be the work of a generation." 
<H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>
  Inkatha Defiance -- As "past experiences gained during 
Inkatha demonstrations" have shown "we ought to be concerned 
about the safety of those that will chose not to heed the 
stayaway call" and to prevent violence "serious measures" have 
to be taken, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in 
English on 17 April on page 6. "The marches cannot be allowed to 
go ahead in the Witwatersrand at least" because "several areas 
have been declared as unrest areas." "We expect the security 
forces to be out in full force to enforce the law by preventing 
unlawful marches from taking place, take action against any 
transgressors and protect all those wishing to go about their 
day-to-day business. Those intending to defy the ban and unrest 
regulations against the carrying of dangerous weapons should be 
prevented from leaving their hostels." "The police also need to 
show their capacity and will to enforce the law, as what we 
might see this week, could be a rehersal of what we are likely 
to see next week when millions of people are supposed to go to 
the polls." 
  Rightwing Sabotage -- "The SA Police Union (SAPU) has 
threatened to disrupt the elections and refuse to perform 
election protection duties" unless salary demands are met, the 
second editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION on 17 April 
notes. "Clearly, this threat is nothing but the pursuance of a 
well-known rightwing agenda to sabotage the forthcoming 
election." The South African Police campaign against the 
National Peacekeeping Force, NPKF, since the NPKF "started 
training," "is something Law and Order Minister Hermus Kriel 
should be ashamed of." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Inkatha Youth March -- The Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 
on 17 April cautions in a page-18 editorial: "Even in the 
confusion of the final days of transition to a new dispensation 
two wrong actions do not make a right. The fact that the police 
failed to thoroughly search the ANC's headquarters at Shell 
House in Johannesburg after the massacre of Zulus was totally at 
odds with the generally held view of the authority of the law." 
"But the march planned by the Inkatha Freedom Party Youth 
Brigade to the -- to them -- hated ANC headquarters is equally 
ill-considered and wrong. By marching in their thousands 
through the streets of the country's financial capital they are 
not only challenging the law. They are exposing innocent lives 
to danger and playing with the kind of fire which makes even the 
most peace-loving and law-abiding citizens shudder. Not to 
mention a week's mass action. The IFP youth may argue that in 
the ANC they have outstanding teachers for this kind of action. 
After all, the ANC and its allies conducted strikes, marched, 
and demonstrated -- and then patted themselves on the back over 
the sucess of this kind of action, ignoring the cost to the 
country." "The public shakes its head at the futile attempts to 
maintain law and order by the people involved in the Peace 
Accord and by the police. Through their office windows in the 
city center they have actually seen bodies being carried past, 
and now they look with suspicion at what they perceive to be a 
cover-up of what actually happened. Even at this late stage the 
guilty, regardless of who, what and of whatever political 
conviction they might be, must be brought to justice by the 
guardians of the law. In this they must have the full 
coooperation of all parties, and all doors open to them. Fast. 
Because if that does not happen, the next error, worse than the 
first, will take place, namely, people beginning to march, and 
continuing to march through and after the election, out of a 
feeling of injustice and revenge. With all the accompanying 
dangers for the future." 
  Moderates Must Show More Muscle in Election -- In his 
"Actuality" column on page 18 of RAPPORT, Izak de Villiers 
writes: "When South Africa became a republic in the sixties, 
the English-language press referred to the `silly season.' If 
that period was silly, the present one is certifiable." "After 
the De Klerk-Mandela debate this week, the names of the parties 
which will contest the election rolled across the television 
screen: Trotskiites, black racists, old-world socialists, 
liberal democrats. Names which did not appear were those of the 
communists sailing under ANC banner, the Inkatha Freedom 
Party...and the Conservative Party..." "Will an election be 
able to satisfy all these participants and nonparticipants? 
That is the question facing a dazed electorate which must make 
their crosses in little more than a week." To keep things 
together "will demand more than a handshake from Mr. Mandela and 
Mr. de Klerk. It needs statesmanship, wisdom, and realistic 
planning. For decades the world's successful countries have not 
been faced with choices across such a broad political spectrum." 
"These days if a politicl party wants to become the government 
of a couuntry it must walk the middle of the road and look after 
all its people, but must also be committed squarely to the 
proven ways of democracy and the free market." "During the past 
few weeks international impatience has been clearly evident. In 
particular, after the happenings in Bophuthatswana, the massacre 
of IFP members at Shell House in Johannesburg, and the struggle 
to get Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi involved in a constitutional 
settlement, there has been growing skepticism towards the ANC 
and its authoritarian lust for power and flirtation with 
socialistic dinasaur politics. Prominent overseas newspapers 
which used to be in the front ranks against apartheid have been 
critical." RAPPORT warns that "Western opinion makers will give 
an ANC-dominated government very little time to prove its good 
sense or stupidity. And only one test will be set: to what 
degree does the new regime satisfy the recipe that works, 
particularly with regard to the economy and human rights." 
"That is why moderate voters have such a tremendous 
responsibility to form an effective counter to the ANC in a new 
parliament. Should the ANC and its communist and socialist 
allies opt for all kinds of wild and ill-considered courses, 
there must be sufficient muscle to pull them back sharply in 
their tracks."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Buthelezi `Loser' in International Mediation Collapse -- 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 15 April in its page-6 
editorial "cannot think of a greater waste of time and money" 
than the international mediation that never took place. The 
government and the ANC "blame the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] -- 
the IFP blames them." However, THE CITIZEN blames "all three, 
for how could they let this chance of ending the constitutional 
impasse go by? How could they waste the time of the mediators by 
bringing them here and then changing the terms of reference once 
the government came into the process?" "If there is a loser, it 
is Chief Buthelezi. mediation was a chance to get his demands 
for greater autonomy for regions accepted by international 
mediators. He has lost that chance." 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Too Many Strikes, Public Holidays -- "Warning signs are 
flashing that the new South Africa -- its problems of 
governability aside -- will be born amid a culture of 
unproductivity," begins a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 18 April. "Strikes are endemic, particularly 
in the former homelands. The election period plus a plethora of 
public holidays are effectively writing off half of April -- and 
a good part of May -- as working months." Besides the strikes by 
public servants in the homelands over pay disputes, there have 
also been "major stoppages in the food industry, mining and the 
public sector?" "All this disruption adds to the widespread 
feelings of uncertainty and impending chaos. A priority of the 
new government should be to get South Africa back to work again." 
  IFP's Rolling Mass Action Act of `Provocation' -- A second 
editorial on the same page says that despite the postponement of 
the 18 April march on the Johannesburg central business 
district, "the IFP Youth Brigade's programme of `rolling mass 
action' is an act of provocation which cannot be ignored. Once 
a principled opponent of this tactic, the IFP has been afforded 
every opportunity to participate in the democratic process." If 
violence breaks out again, "the blame will rest primarily with 
those under whose banner the protest takes place -- and that 
means Chief Buthelezi and the leadership of the IFP." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Postponement of IFP March; Use of Security Forces -- The 
decision by the Inkatha youth leaders to call off the 18 April 
planned march in Johannesburg "is probably just a temporary 
respite, based on considerations of self-preservation," declares 
a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 
April. "Inkatha seems intent on a campaign of mass 
mobilisation." BUSINESS DAY notes that the banning of marches 
by provocative demonstrators, "though perhaps necessary, is 
nothing to feel self-righteous about. Worse, the willingness by 
the new generation of politicians to support the use by security 
forces of lethal crowd control measures against those who defy 
banning orders is an ugly throwback to the past. Most 
disturbing is the apparent faith likely key members of the 
future government place in such measures as a total solution. 
It is really no more than a holding operation." 
<H8>  CAPE TIMES </H8>
  Freedom Front Viljoen's Leadership -- "Any loose talk in 
British newspapers of civil war brewing in South Africa, the 
realistic role of General Constand Viljoen and his Freedom Front 
in encouraging conservative Afrikaners to vote should help to 
keep the political temperature down," states a page 6 editorial 
in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 12 April. "It is 
encouraging, also, to note that Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg of the CP 
[Conservative Party] is not insisting that CP supporters should 
boycott the poll." CAPE TIMES hopes General Viljoen's 
leadership "is steadily marginalizing the wild men on the 
right." "If he succeeds, his strategy will keep the majority of 
conservative Afrikaners within the democratic process, and will 
undermine spurious attempts to justify any resort to violence by 
fanatical rightists."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] A front-page story in UHURU newspaper says that an 
official in the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation has ordered the Tanzanian ambassador 
in Rwanda, Saleh Tambwe, to oversee the evacuation of all 
Tanzanians from that country. 
  Meanwhile, talking to the DAILY NEWS, Colonel Abdulrahman 
Kinana, minister of state in the office of the president in 
charge of defense, said precautionary measures have been taken 
to ensure the security of Tanzanians on its border with Rwanda. 
Recently, the government warned the factions in Rwanda to 
ensure the security of Tanzanians in Rwanda and that the 
shedding of blood of any Tanzanian would not be tolerated. In 
this regard, Honorable Abdulrahman Kinana said he hoped the 
government call would be heeded by those groups, and that 
Tanzanians would be guaranteed their security until they left 
for home. 
  Meanwhile, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has stressed the need 
for east and central African countries to involve themselves 
fully in promoting peaceful solutions to the problems of Rwanda 
and Burundi. We read this story in UHURU. Speaking to Zairian 
President Mobutu's special emissary, (Mbanda Akimba), at State 
House, Dar es Salaam yesterday, President Mwinyi said 
neighboring countries have special obligations to end 
hostilities in those two countries.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Today the mediator only met with the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] delegation, which 
submitted a document containing its views on the conclusion of 
the elections. UNITA proposed the reinstatement of state 
administration throughout Angola, guarantees, security, and 
freedom of expression for citizens, and the resumption of air 
and ground links with a view to ensuring the free movement of 
people and goods nationwide. A national electoral commission 
will be responsible for preparing the elections, and the United 
Nations will monitor the situation to determine whether 
conditions have been created to hold the second round of 
presidential elections. 
  It is believed that the UNITA document has been referred to 
the government delegation. The meeting between Chief Beye and 
UNITA lasted a long time, with Alioune Blondin Beye having to 
postpone for tomorrow the meeting he had scheduled with the 
government delegation. Today the government delegation met to 
discuss internal issues relating to the Ad Hoc Commission.

  [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- Trilateral talks between 
the government, the African National Congress and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] temporarily ended in Pretoria just after 3 
PM on Monday (today) without any clear indication whether 
progress had been made to include kwaZulu in the constitutional 
process. 
  The talks were held at the Union Buildings between President 
F. W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Cyril 
Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after 
the meeting the talks would be continued later on Monday or on 
Tuesday. Mr Meyer, who refused to be drawn on whether he was 
optimistic, said the discussions concerned the country's future. 
  All parties had expressed their concern about the situation 
in South Africa and all were looking for solutions, Mr Meyer 
added. He said the talks were at a sensitive stage. 
  Emerging from the Union Buildings, Mr Ramaphosa said: "We 
are dealing with a very sensitive matter as you all know and 
we're trying to see...What is possible." 
  Mr Ramaphosa was accompanied by SA [South African] Communist 
Party National Chairman Joe Solo. It is believed the talks were 
broken off in the afternoon to allow Mr de Klerk to attend a 
pre- arranged meeting with Pan-Africanist Congress President 
Clarence Makwetu.

  [Text] Dar es Salaam -- The government has said efforts to 
repatriate Tanzanians in Rwanda are continuing, in light of the 
deteriorating situation there. 
  In an interview with the BBC today, the minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, Honorable Joseph 
Rwegasira, said the first group of Tanzanians had already 
returned and another was expected to leave Kigali this morning 
via Burundi in collaboration with the Belgian Government, which 
had the task of evacuating its own citizens from Rwanda. 
Minister Rwegasira said the situation in Rwanda remained 
deplorable and that the fighting was continuing. He said the 
government was following up on reports that some Tanzanians had 
died in the fighting. 
  Honorable Rwegasira said that as a result of the worrying 
situation, the government had taken precautionary measures along 
its borders to protect itself under any circumustances. He said 
Tanzania did not intend to interfere in the fighting under way 
in Rwanda but, if there was a danger to the lives of the 
Tanzanians and all other ordinary means of evacuating them were 
blocked, then there was a possibility that the government might 
intervene to save its citizens.

announced that it will undertake the second phase of 
demobilizing soldiers tomorrow, in accordance with the 
resolution of the army council of 26 May 1992 to reduce the army 
to an economically manageable size. 
  In the second phase, 10,000 soldiers are to be demobilized 
to 
join the 20,000 discharged in phase one, which ended in August 
1993. This would bring the total of soldiers who would have been 
demobilized under the program by the end of May 1994 to 30,000.

  [Text] Kampala, April 16 (AFP) -- Some 2,500 Ugandan 
soldiers were pensioned off Saturday [16 April] as part of an 
ongoing military demobilization programme aimed at reducing 
government defense spending, military officials said. The 
demobilization, backed by Western donors, is intended to bring 
down Uganda's 90,000-strong military to about 40,000. 
  Military expenditure by the Ugandan government is estimated 
at 30 percent of the country's annual budget. 
  Some 10,000 soldiers will be laid off by the end of this 
month, the officials said, bringing to 33,000 the number of 
troops demobilized since 1992. 
  Donors have so far given 31 million dollars for the 
programme, but Uganda is seeking more funds to complete the 
exercise. 
  A retiring soldier's benefits include 550 dollars in cash, 
bulding material and transport home.

Gouled Aptidon received General Mohamed Farah Aidid, the Somali 
National Alliance chairman who is visiting Djibouti for the 
first time, for about two hours today, the Presidency announced. 
The "courtesy and information" visit that Gen. Aidid paid to 
the Djibouti head of state enabled both men to "broadly examine 
the situation in Somalia." They also discussed the different 
attempts to achieve reconciliation in Somalia, which took place 
in several regional capitals, the Presidency's media section's 
communique stated. Djibouti Interior Minister Idris Harbi Farah 
and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdou Bolock Abdou participated in 
the discussions, which took place in "an atmosphere of 
understanding and frankness," according to the communique.

  [Text] Djibouti President Hassan Gouled received this 
morning Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister of culture and information 
and President Saddam Husayn's envoy, who conveyed to him a 
personal message from the leader president. The message spells 
out Iraq's view of the position of the Security Council and the 
importance of activating this position to lift the unjust Iraq 
embargo, as well as the need to coordinate between friendly and 
brotherly countries toward this end. 
  The president of Djibouti asked the personal envoy to convey 
his brotherly greetings to leader President Saddam Husayn, as 
well as Djibouti's solidarity with Iraq and its constant call 
for lifting the unjust Iraq embargo. 
  Gouled stressed that Djibouti's position at the Security 
Council will be in favor of Iraq, especially since Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations under Section C of Resolution 687. 
  The Iraqi envoy discussed with President Gouled ways to 
enhance brotherly relations between the two countries, including 
activating their joint committee. President Gouled said he had 
issued instructions in this regard. 
  Hamid Yusuf Hammadi met earlier with Mohamed Bolok Abdou, 
the 
foreign minister of Djibouti. During the meeting, they 
discussed the Security Council position. 
  The Iraqi envoy met also with Barkat Gourad Hamadou, the 
prime minister of Djibouti. They discussed ways to enhance 
relations between the two brotherly countries. 
  The Iraqi envoy then met with (Ismail Omar Ghila), chief of 
the Djibouti Presidential Court. They discussed the position of 
other nations toward lifting the unjust Iraq embargo, as well as 
bilateral relations.

  [Excerpts] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi will convene peace 
talks in Arusha to be attended by the Rwandan Government and 
rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] on 23 April. 
  A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation said the meeting was called following 
a deterioration of the war situation between the Government of 
Rwanda and RPF fighters, and as part of UN efforts to bring 
about a ceasefire. Tanzania has been involved in reconciling 
the two sides for a long period, culminating in the signing of a 
peace accord last year. [passage omitted] 
  The statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation said the government had received 
unconfirmed reports of the death of three Tanzanians. The 
statement also stated that the government was continuing with 
arrangements to repatriate Tanzanians currently in Rwanda [words

  The government also called on the Government of Rwanda to 
immediately release 44 vehicles and the goods in them. The 
vehicles belong to Tanzanians and have been held at the border. 
In the meantime, the Kagera regional commissioner, Honorable 
Phillip Mangula, has said that six UN soldiers have entered the 
Mara Region from Rwanda and that they are being looked after by 
the UN High Commissioner on Refugees.

  [Excerpts] Since the beginning of the war in Rwanda 
following the death of the Rwandan president, a number of 
Rwandans have been fleeing to Burundi while Burundians who had 
taken refuge in Rwanda are returning in great numbers. Today, 
our colleague Emmanuel Ngendanzi asked the governor of Ngozi, 
Mr. Joseph Ntakirutimana, who informed him of the situation 
there. 
  [Begin Ntakirutimana recording] We have welcomed Burundians 
who fled on many occasions. The first groups came through [word 
indistinct] commune, [word indistinct]. They numbered about 
6,000. We sent them to the Kirundo governor. I would like to 
take the opportunity to thank the Army headquarters which sent 
us 12 lorries in addition to the UNHCR vehicles which assisted 
us to transport them to the place. Today, they transported the 
last 1,000 people to Kirundo. Now there are returnees from 
Mwumba Commune. Yesterday they numbered some 5,966 people. 
  We also welcome fleeing Rwandans. In (Gatsinda), Mwumba 
Commune, we had received around 70 people up to yesterday. Most 
of them are men. In Busiga, we also received 70 Rwandans. Most 
of them are men. [Words indistinct] government employees. There 
are also Burundian returnees from other communes. For example 
the returnees from Kiremba Commune did not go to a refugee camp 
such as in Busiga. They number about 1,000 people who went 
straight to their homes. In Marangara Commune, about 3,000 
people also returned to their homes from Rwanda. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kirundo Province also continues to receive the refugees who 
fled last year to Rwanda, without forgetting Rwandans who are 
fleeing the war currently under way in the country following the 
death of the country's president this April. Up to 10 April, 
these Rwandan refugees numbered 1,700. Most of them are in 
Busoni Commune. Others are in Bugabira Commune. The number of 
Burundian returnees is slightly above 22,500. Most of them 
originate from Busoni and Bugabira communes, and there are 
others from Ntega and Kirundo communes. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> [Speech by interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya at the </F>
funeral for late President Cyprien Ntaryamira in Bujumbura on 16 
April] 
  [Excerpts] His excellency, the head of state and friends, 
their excellencies Ministers Bernard Ciza and Cyriaque Simbizi 
and friends. We are meeting just four months and a week after 
coming here in your company, to bid farewell to President 
Ndadaye, his aides and other friends who were killed during the 
events of 21 October 1993. [passage omitted] 
  President of the Republic, Cyprien Ntaryamira, all 
Burundians 
are currently crying because of you. You leave us at a time 
when we hoped to get a lot from you. Who could have thought 
that the plane you travelled on when you were trying to reach 
your country as soon as possible could have killed you. Now you 
are dead. You left this world on 6 April 1994. You died 
outside the country. Nobody has seen you since or heard you 
talking. You left this world without quarreling with anybody. 
Burundians are also biding farewell to Ministers Ciza Bernard 
and Cyriaque Simbizi who were traveling with you. 
  They died together with you. We are not aware of the content 
of your last conversation. But what we do know is that Burundi 
has lost men, wise men, who only dreamed of fighting and 
strengthening peace for freedom, democratic rule, and 
development for all Burundians. Let the Almighty welcome you in 
his kingdom and give you an everlasting life. There is no doubt 
about this. Our prayers will be accepted because neither you, 
the head of state, nor Ministers Ciza and Simbizi, did wrong to 
anyone. In the event of you having wronged any Burundian or 
foreigner, we join you to ask for forgiveness. 
  Burundians, this is the second time that you lose a head of 
state in not more than six months. Some think that God has let 
us down. Others say that God may be testing us. Still others 
say this is the pain felt by a mother while giving birth to a 
baby. Here in Burundi, we are looking for a good path that can 
help us release ourselves from the ropes of divisionism in our 
country. Looking at it, none of the above comments are wrong. 
Our country is going through a difficult time. It is therefore 
necessary that Burundians unite, so that Hutus, Tutsis, and Twas 
know that they are brothers; so that they unite to build a new 
Burundi, a peaceful Burundi in which justice and development 
prevails for all; so that the peace prevailing in Burundi will 
also spread to the whole of our region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Kigali, the fighting continues. The Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are still holding all the 
positions they captured. Mutara region is under the control of 
the RPF combatants. The government troops never returned there. 
In the Byumba area, the RPF troops are doing very well. 
Contrary to lies that have been spread, Byumba town is entirely 
in the hands of the RPF troops. In Ruhengeri, the RPF 
combatants control many areas of the prefecture while the 
government troops are tired and have started fleeing. They have 
now resorted to seeking help from the Interahamwe [Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] and 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic members, involving 
them in a war they know very well that they will never win.

  [Text] In Rwanda, fighting between Rwanda Patriotic Front 
[RPF] rebels and Rwandan armed forces in Kigali has been raging 
all day. Shelling and small arms fire have not ceased. 
Christophe Boisbouvier has just phoned General Dallaire, 
commander of the UN Mission in Rwanda: 
  [Begin recording] [Dallaire] There has been a partial 
offensive by the RPF in the southeast sector of the town. 
  [Boisbouvier] Have RPF rebels entered the town center? 
  [Dallaire] If you mean the presidential district, no, not as 
far as I know. I was there part of the day today, and there was 
no fighting. 
  [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the rebels will be able to 
seize the town center and the presidential district? 
  [Dallaire] The RPF continues its operations; it has received 
reinforcements. What are its aims? Is it to seize this sector? 
Is it to isolate it? It depends on the resources it managed to 
get in order to seize the most secure sector of the town. 
  [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the Rwandan Armed Forces 
have enough men and artillery to resist for several days? 
  [Dallaire] After seeing the number of men and their 
preparedness, I believe that they seem very resolute to defend 
their positions. 
  [Boisbouvier] Are those refugees now in the Hotel des Milles 
Collines and in the Amahoro stadium being threatened? 
  [Dallaire] The evacuation of those refugees [words 
indistinct] in the current situation any movement of people 
would certainly not be a plausible option. Where they are now, 
they are at least with us. Those staying at the Milles 
Collines, if they are still there, are with gendarmes and 
soldiers as well as with UN observers. [end recording]

  [Text] Kigali, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting intensified in 
Kigali early Tuesday [19 April], with "heavy shelling and lots 
of gunfire" as rebels battled government forces for control of 
the body-strewn Rwandan capital, a United Nations official said. 
The increase in fighting followed an admission by Army 
commanders Monday that 1,000 rebel reinforcements had entered 
Kigali. Acting Armed Forces chief of staff General Marcel 
Gatsinzi said the military was prepared to consider all rebel 
conditions for a ceasefire. But UN officials contacted by 
telephone in Kigali said the two sides had failed to meet to 
negotiate a ceasefire because they had rejected each other's 
demands. 
  The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front wants the disbanding of 
the 
interim government proclaimed after the death of President 
Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious April 6 plane crash. 
Habyarimana's death triggered a frenzied bloodbath as 
hardliners from his majority Hutu tribe, led by the presidential 
guard which accused the rebels of shooting down the president's 
plane, massacred members of the minority Tutsi group that 
dominates the rebel movement. 
  The Red Cross said tens of thousands of people had been 
killed in the past 12 days of frenzied ethnic carnage in the 
capital and around the small central African highland nation. 
Most of those killed were Tutsis or people accused of 
supporting the rebels, though some witnesses have reported 
revenge killings by rebel guerrillas or Tutsi civilians. The 
massacres triggered an exodus of tens of thousands of refugees 
to neighbouring countries, the Red Cross said.

  [Text] The president and the members of the self-imposed 
government who nominated themselves arbitrarily with the 
intention to kill, are, instead of restoring peace, as they led 
Rwandans to believe, thanking instead of dismissing those who 
have excelled in murder. This shows the lack of will on the 
part of murderers who are not ready to put down their arms. The 
self-imposed institution met today and upgraded Colonel Augustin 
Bizimungu, a renowned murderer while serving as military head in 
Ruhengeri. The government council upgraded him to the rank of 
major general and appointed him as the chief of staff of the 
Army to replace Col. Gatsinzi who was the interim chief of 
staff. The latter, who was previously called Col. Marcel 
Gatsinxi, was given the grade of brigadier general. 
  Col. Gacien Kabiligi, who was formerly the Army head in 
Byumba region and was removed from there due to lack of 
discipline, and who was known for his provocations, has been 
appointed commander of the government troops in Ruhengeri and 
was upgraded to the rank of brigadier general. 
  Col. Leonidas Rusatira who (?was) the first chief of staff, 
has been appointed as brigadier general. The Council of 
Ministers reappointed him as head of the higher military academy 
in Kigali. The Council of Ministers, which was chaired by the 
self-appointed Jean Kambanda, requested that the remaining 
military files be studied quickly so that a decision could be 
made. 
  It is, therefore, not surprising to hear that killers who 
make up self-imposed institutions, promote those who helped them 
in the killings by appointing them to posts in which they shall 
not last very long. The priority of the clique of killers is to 
continue the killings, lootings, and other crimes. Their work 
is continuing. Killers are still chasing opposition leaders. 
  Today we informed you that Dr. Theoneste Gafaranga, who was 
the only remaining high-ranking official of the Social 
Democratic Party, was killed by Presidential Guards, assisted by 
the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development youth wingers] and the Coalition for the Defense of 
the Republic, in Rugenge sector, Kigali. 
  Other serious crimes include the ones committed in Commune 
Rukara, Kibungo, where the Rwandan Patriotic Front combatants 
found about 800 people detained in a place since the death of 
President Habyarimana. The Rwandan Army threw grenades on them. 
Some lost their limbs while others were injured. The RPF 
combatants rescued those who were still alive.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerard Gahima] </F>
  [Excerpts] Following the recent death of the Rwandan head 
of state, President Habyarimana, our country has witnessed 
sectarian violence unprecedented in history. That violence 
erupted following the death of President Habyarimana was itself 
not surprising. Gross human rights violations have marked the 
whole of the post- independence period. Indeed thousands, 
perhaps tens of thousands of lives, have perished in Rwanda over 
the past few years. International human rights organizations 
such as Africa Watch, Amnesty International, and others have 
accurately documented the atrocities which President 
Habyarimana, the Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development, his party, and associates have committed in recent 
times. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, the health minister, is in Kinshasa. 
Many others are already in Europe. The world cannot and should 
not forget the genocide which is being perpetrated in Rwanda 
today by the surviving associates and allies of the late 
President Habyarimana. No effort should be spared in ensuring 
that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are all brought to 
justice. The leaders of the evil forces which are carrying out 
the genocide who are escaping or may in the coming days escape 
from the country, should not be permitted by the Rwandan people 
to get away. Neither should foreign countries grant them 
asylum. Our criminals who are directly and personally 
responsible for causing the death of tens of thousands of their 
fellow citizens, they should be promptly apprehended in the 
countries to which they may flee so that arrangements can be 
made to bring them to justice. We call upon the international 
community, especially governments, the United Nations, the OAU, 
and international human rights organizations to spare no effort 
in helping to highlight the extent of the current genocide and 
to assist in bringing the war criminals in question to book. 
  We also call upon all Rwandan people, diplomatic personnel, 
nongovernmental organizations, and other well-wishers who have 
been witnesses of the atrocities which have been committed in 
Rwanda over the past week, to render every assistance possible 
towards exposing the culprits so that they may be ostracized, 
isolated, and adequately punished for their war crimes. The 
complete apprehension, incarceration, and punishment of every 
one of the war criminals involved in the atrocities which are 
being committed would be a prerequisite for the restoration of 
peace, law and order, and in the long-term democracy in our 
country. Last but not least, we call upon the community of 
nations to come to the assistance of the surviving victims of 
the genocide and to assist the RPF in its efforts to liberate 
our country from the grip of the murderous regime responsible 
for the genocide.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 16 Apr (AFP) -- Four days before the 
deadline expires to designate a transitional prime minister, the 
Zairian opposition has accused President Mobutu's supporters of 
preventing Etienne Tshisekedi from returning to power. The 
opposition based its accusations on the fact that the 
presidential camp "boycotted" the summit meeting of the two 
political groups scheduled for yesterday at the Palais du Peuple 
in Kinshasa. 
  A 24-hour deadline was given to the presidential camp by the 
opposition "to give its views and considerations" after Mr. 
Tshisekedi was chosen for the post of prime minister by the most 
radical wing of the opposition, the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition [USOR]. 
  Two political parties of the opposition, the Union of 
Republic and Democracy and the Rally of the Forces of Democratic 
Change [RFCD] did not participate in the meeting at which this 
appointment took place. They had denounced the "irregularities" 
and the "fait accompli" to which, according to them, the USOR 
wanted to subject them. 
  The presidential camp believes that the consultations within 
the opposition should be held with all its members as demanded 
by the law. However, it is guarding itself from any 
interference in its "internal affairs." 
  Furthermore, in a statement to the media, Joseph Nsinga, 
chairman of the RFCD, an ally of the USOR, called on the Union 
to agree to discuss "objectively" and "on an equal footing" with 
all the members of the opposition concerning the appointment of 
the prime minister. But this should be done in line with the 
spirit of the transition Constitutional Act. For Mr. Nsinga, if 
the entire opposition discusses "without dictate and spirit of 
exclusion," a solution will be found quickly. 
  "With what is going on at Zaire's border, the country cannot 
be left without a government," Mr. Nsinga stated, stressing that 
the Zairian people do not need a civil war, but want to be 
governed.

  [Text] The Rwandan scenario is foreseeable in Zaire. A 
member of the Executive Bureau of the Sacred Union of Radical 
Opposition stated this during a European tour. (Jacques Matamba 
Moyo), who is also the chairman of the Confederation of 
Reformist Nationalists, said that the radical opposition has 
just formed an army. The mission of this armed branch of the 
opposition is to topple the Mobutu regime. (Moyo) is asking 
foreign nationals to leave Zaire. Here with the details is 
(Moyo), talking to Ousmane Kaba: 
  [(Moyo)] It is possible -- when one looks at what is 
currently happening -- that a social explosion of great 
magnitude could take place at any time in Zaire, due to the 
extreme deterioration and degeneration of the current 
socioeconomic situation for the military, I repeat, the 
military, civilians, and religious followers. We are saying 
that, in order to prevent--as usual--Mobutu's friends abroad 
from putting pressure on state powers in their respective 
countries, and in order to prevent them from coming to Zaire 
under the cover of a rescue operation and saving the dictator, 
we are asking them as early as now, to make the decision -- as 
precautionary measures -- to evacuate their nationals. 
  The socioeconomic situation has deteriorated so much that it 
obliges responsible people, responsible statesmen, to prevent 
what might happen. We are asking foreigners to leave, to leave 
us alone to settle our disputes calmly, and when we are through 
with this we will resume our political cooperation and aid 
efforts with them.

  [Text] This morning, four local opposition officials 
including a national deputy were arrested in Maine-Soroa, Diffa 
Department. According to Henri Ibrahim, prefect of the 
department, the four were arrested for inciting people to 
violence and tribal hatred. They are presently detained at the 
Diffa Gendarmerie Brigade headquarters. They had planned to 
attack the Maine-Soroa Subprefecture, to abduct the subprefect, 
and to demand the release of Tandja Mamadou, chairman of the 
National Movement of the Development Society-Nassara. The 
regional authorities, who were alerted, foiled the plot by 
arresting the ringleaders. 
  A report we have just received says that in order to 
maintain 
social peace, the Diffa authorities have, as of today, banned 
all public gatherings and demonstrations until further notice.

  [Text] Niamey, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Niger opposition party 
supporters appeared disconcerted this morning after the arrest 
of their main leaders. They hesitated between the desire to 
fight back and the need to avoid plunging the country into 
chaos. Apparent calm prevailed in the Niger capital where 
streets, which are still strewn with broken glass, melted tires, 
and charred tree trunks, testified to the degree of violence 
that marked the demonstrations which resulted in one death and 
24 injured on 16 April. In all, 87 people were arrested, among 
them leaders of the three main opposition parties which had 
called the previous day for a civil disobedience campaign to 
protest the exclusion of their cadres from the management of the 
country. 
  This morning, civil servants of all political leanings 
reported normally to their administrative services. "This 
country belongs to us. If it collapses, we will perish," a 
government employee -- a well-known opposition activist -- 
stated. "Our leaders called on us to observe a peaceful civil 
disobedience campaign but unfortunately we indulged in 
violence," he regretted. "I support the opposition but not 
violence. Should this violence continue, Niger will experience 
the same situation as other countries," added one of his 
colleagues, a supporter of the National Movement of the 
Development Society [MNSD], the former single ruling party which 
became the main opposition force after the country's first free 
elections in February 1993. At the MNSD headquarters, however, 
young activists, who were openly brandishing knives, were 
already working out strategies: "Offensives must be increased 
to speed up the fall of the regime," one of them shouted. 
  The two main parties within the ruling coalition -- the 
Democratic and Social Convention [CDS] of President Mahamane 
Ousmane and the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism [PNDS] 
of Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou -- yesterday evening 
appealed to their activists "not to yield to the opposition's 
provocations." 
  The most violent clashes took place on 16 April between 
opposition activists and supporters of the ruling Alliance of 
Forces of Change near Niamey stadium, where the ceremonies 
commemorating the first anniversary of President Ousmane's 
inauguration were being held. The CDS and PNDS have, in a joint 
communique, "condemned the insurrectional situation and the 
appeals for civil war" made by the opposition which is now 
completely beheaded. Its three main leaders -- Mamadou Tanja of 
the MNSD, Andre Salifou of the Union of Progressive Patriots and 
Democrats, and Issoufou Assoumane of the Democratic Union of 
Progressive Forces -- have been imprisoned. 
  No incidents were reported in the interior. The national 
radio and television reported on the ceremonies organized in 
many localities that are considered opposition strongholds but 
where supporters and adversaries of the majority celebrated the 
first anniversary of the advent of democracy in Niger "together 
in a brotherly manner."

  [Text] As you know, four opposition personalities from 
Diffa Department, including a deputy, were arrested this morning 
at Maine-Soroa, accused of exciting violence and ethnic hatred. 
Following these arrests, the prefect of Diffa convened an 
extraordinary meeting with department directors, representatives 
of political parties, labor unions, and associations. The 
meeting was aimed at informing the participants of the reason 
for the arrests. Tusla Sadepa reports from (Bougako). 
  [Begin Sadepa recording] The four local leaders of the 
National Movement of the Development Society [MNSD-Nassara], 
including a deputy, were arrested this morning at Maine-soroa, 
the birthplace of MNSD-Nassara chairman, Tandja Mamadou. They 
are accused of inciting violence and ethnic hatred, for they had 
planned to attack the subprefecture and kidnap the subprefect. 
They therefore armed their activists with arrows, sticks, and 
knives. According to the prefect of the department, they were 
demanding the release of their party chairman, Tandja Mamadou. 
When the regional authorities were informed, they preempted the 
attack by arresting the four leaders. 
  This morning, the activists, who were not yet informed of 
the 
arrest of their leaders, went to the meeting place but the 
organizers were absent. They took hostage two activists of the 
Alliance of Forces of Change: the secretary general of the Niger 
Party for Democracy and Socialism and the president of the 
Democratic and Social Convention Delegation of Maine-Soroa. 
  According to the department's prefect, the opposition 
activists intend to proceed with their hostage-taking operation, 
kidnapping supervisory officers and officials appointed by 
decree. That is why the prefect, Mr. Ayi Frem, told 
participants that the law will be rigorously applied. If there 
is bloodletting, we shall all weep, Ayi Frem stated, adding that 
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The prefect 
reiterated the worst-case scenario must be avoided. He told his 
audience that any civil servant who would heed the call for 
civil disobedience and yet fold his arms in front of his body 
would be punished in accordance with the law. 
  Finally, it must be noted that in order to preserve social 
peace, all public gatherings and demonstrations are strictly 
forbidden in the department until further notice. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Mahamane Ousmane in </F>
Niamey on 15 April--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Fellow Niger citizens and dear countrymen! A 
year ago on 16 April 1993, I was sworn in as president of the 
Republic and head of state. The celebration of this important 
event should in no way eclipse another even more important event 
-- the first anniversary of the final establishment of the 
democratic process in our country. Indeed, thanks to God and to 
the will of the sovereign people of Niger, democracy is 
henceforth an indispensable reality in our country. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dear countrymen, on this solemn occasion we deem it 
important 
to briefly recall the socio-political and economic context in 
which we founded the state of Niger. On the socio-political 
scene, the atmosphere was marked, among other things, by an 
armed rebellion brought about by previous regimes' inability to 
create conditions for the balanced and harmonious development of 
the various regions; an increasingly dangerous situation of 
insecurity in cities and the countryside; constant growth in the 
unemployment rate, caused notably by the closing down of some 
enterprises and with difficulties in getting a job in the civil 
service; social conflicts, notably between farmers and livestock 
rearers, and workers and employers. 
  On the economic scene, the report on the ad hoc commission's 
review of the country's economic situation revealed the 
catastrophic situation in which our country found itself on the 
advent of the institutions of the Third Republic. This report 
stated, first of all, a great imbalance in public revenues, 
which resulted in arrears in salaries, scholarships, student 
allowances, and the inability of the government to pay other 
state expenditures. Then there also was the weight of the 
external debt, estimated at several hundreds of billions of CFA 
francs, and domestic debt, which was estimated at dozens of 
billions of CFA francs. 
  Dear Niger citizens and countrymen, as you know, our country 
has had to cope with many socio-political difficulties within 
the past 12 months. These difficulties include a refusal to 
carry out a democratic change in the government, ethnocentrism, 
regionalism, an armed rebellion, and religious intolerance, 
which caused losses in human lives. [passage omitted] Apart from 
these numerous difficulties we have to cope with, it should be 
admitted that the bottom line of the situation we are dealing 
with is that there is an unprecedented financial crisis, a loss 
of working hours due to the intransigence and impatience of 
social partners, rallies and demonstrations which are often 
marked by violence, acts of vandalism, and organized 
insubordination. These, dear countrymen, are some of the many 
dangers which threatened our young democracy, social peace, and 
national cohesion throughout the year. Therefore, in order that 
the democratic process, so dearly acquired, is not perverted or 
spoiled, it is important to emphasize once and for all that 
democracy does not mean anarchy, a license to do whatever one 
likes, or apathy towards the state. [passage omitted] 
  Fellow Niger citizens and dear countrymen, the difficult 
situation, we inherited as well as the numerous obstacles we 
have encountered, have at no moment shaken our firm and 
irreversible will to successfully implement our program. Our 
members of parliament were conscious of this indispensable 
reality, when they courageously and massively approved the 
government's general policy statement, after detailed study. 
Our action program gives priority to the settlement of social 
issues, and that was why high priority was given to the 
settlement of the problems affecting the university and other 
schools, notably the payment of arrears in scholarships, 
allowances, and registration fees. On the health scene, 
considerable efforts were made to provide our health centers 
with adequate personnel and essential medical supplies. This 
shows that the aspect of human development constitutes a very 
high priority for us. 
  The government attempted to tackle the painful issue of 
armed rebels as soon it took office, following several meetings 
and with mediation of friendly countries. We were then able to 
embark on the first stage of negotiations in the search for 
lasting peace. The frame of reference given to us by the 
Coordinating Committee of Armed Resistance at the last 
Ouagadougou meeting was analyzed by all the various groups. All 
the information we received was compiled into source documents 
for the government to be used in its negotiations with the 
rebels. We have often solemnly reiterated that the Niger 
Republic is one and indivisible. It is a democratic and social 
country. We sincerely hope that at the forthcoming meeting in 
Paris, we will find a quick solution to the tragedy which is 
tearing our people apart. [passage omitted] 
  Our efforts at solving the socioeconomic crisis, which has 
seriously affected our country, would have been even more 
successful had it not been for the devaluation of the CFA franc 
which forced us to realign our strategy. We are fully aware 
that a country as poor as Niger needs foreign financial 
assistance to achieve economic and social recovery. The 
government of the Third Republic therefore renewed contacts with 
leading bilateral and multilateral financial backers as soon as 
it took office to establish an atmosphere of trust and serenity 
which is indispensable [words indistinct] for acquiring foreign 
aid. The ensuing results are highly encouraging and bode well 
for a better future. However, no matter what aid we receive and 
how much it is, foreign aid is subject to several restrictions 
and conditions. It cannot therefore be the sole answer to all 
our problems if there is no true national awakening. [passage 
omitted] 
  The past year has been enlightening in more ways than one. 
We have learned many lessons from being in power. The phase we 
are about to embark upon will not be very easy. At a time when 
we are trying to solve our problems on our own, we are faced 
with the additional problem of social tension brought about by 
opposition parliamentarians' desertion of the National Assembly. 
Regarding the recommendations the National Assembly made to the 
government in January following the debate on discrimination in 
the various institutions, some people have the impression that 
we have overlooked the pertinent measures contained in our 29 
January parliamentary resolution on human resources management. 
This is not so. 
  We would like to reassure you all that we will personally 
see 
to it that technical skill, moral values, and loyalty are 
considered above all other factors and are used as the only 
criteria for appointing people to any position of authority. I 
give you my solemn pledge on this as guarantor of the 
Constitution and head of state. We therefore call on the 
opposition parliamentarians to forget all bitterness, show 
high-mindedness and a sense of true love for their country, and 
join their colleagues from the majority group at the National 
Assembly in order that the first regular session of the year 
might proceed unhampered. 
  My dear compatriots, the time has come for forgiveness and 
consensus. We should all do our utmost so that there will be 
peace, social harmony, union of hearts and minds, and tolerance 
in our country once and for all. We should not lose our 
legendary values of fraternity, harmony, serenity, and national 
solidarity as a result of insidious political intrigues. All 
sons and daughters of this country should accept the principle 
of dialogue to solve all our differences in order to participate 
actively in building a new Niger. [passage omitted including 
indistinct portions] 
  May the Almighty God assist us and reward us with bountiful 
rains. Long live democracy! Long live the Republic! Long live 
Niger!

  [Text] The Federal Government is to announce its political 
agenda in January next year. The minister of information, 
Professor Jerry Gana, made this known yesterday while briefing 
newsmen in Lagos. Prof. Gana explained that January was chosen 
to give the delegates at the national constitutional conference 
enough time to finish their deliberations. The announcement, 
according to him, will be the climax of phase two of the 
government's political agenda, which started with the 
constitutional conference. The minister said the government 
would not want to give a specific date for the handover because 
it did not know the regulations or the structure the conference 
would want the nation to take. Prof. Gana, however, noted that 
the constitutional conference, which was the first phase of the 
political agenda, would not go beyond December this year. He 
said the election of delegates to the conference will start in 
the first week of June, while the conference will convene on 27 
June in Abuja.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers met today. The object of 
the meeting was to strengthen peace and security in Bujumbura. 
Here is Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, speaking with by 
Celcius Nsengiyunva. 
  [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] Everyone recalls that the 
government asked the population to maintain peace and security 
to honor the memory of our dead president of the Republic, the 
late Ntaryamira and Ministers Cyriaque Simbizi and Bernard Ciza. 
Unfortunately, the peace and tranquillity which had been 
observed, particularly after the tragic night of 6 April, was 
shattered over the last two days in some suburbs of Bujumbura. 
It has been clear that the state of security in the entire 
territory is dependent mainly on the security situation in the 
capital. 
  For this reason, the Council of Ministers, in the short 
term, 
has set the following three objectives: First, to restore 
security and trust in all the suburbs of the town. Second, to 
resettle the displaced people and refugees in their respective 
homes. Third, to make the people and armed groups surrender 
their arms. In order to attain these objectives, the government 
will carry out the following actions: First, it will do 
everything possible to ensure that political and administrative 
officials in zones and suburbs are men and women who are 
acceptable to all sections of the population. The officials 
must be open to dialogue with the cooperation of the security 
forces, be impartial, and must not show leniency to wrongdoers. 
Second, we shall invite members of the MIOB, the OAU 
observation mission to Burundi, to go to the spot and work with 
civilian and military officials, whether in the framework of 
territorial administration or in the framework of the security 
forces. This will bring about more trust and objectivity in 
what is happening on the ground. Third, we shall broaden the 
composition of the proposing committee for officials in matters 
of security at the level of zones, so as to extend members of 
the committee to sub-divisions and streets. [Words indistinct] 
by appointing people there who are known for their integrity and 
who strive for the return of peace and security. 
  Before ending the session, the Council of Ministers 
recommended that government members immediately join other 
members of the proposing committees in all the zones. This has 
been in effect since 1100. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It looks as if the log jam in Liberia's peace 
process has been eased. The factions that signed last year's 
Cotonou accord have been deadlocked over the appointment of 
ministers in the transitional council. Charles Taylor has been 
rejecting the selection of four cabinet ministers -- justice, 
finance, defense, and foreign -- and has been refusing to seat 
to his NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] nominees who 
have been appointed. The NPFL has also been refusing to attend 
nomination hearings. But now, agreement has been reached over 
who should have three of the four ministries and it looks like 
quite a breakthrough. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed 
this report: 
  Liberia's five-member transitional council today announced 
new heads for the ministries of justice, finance, and defense. 
A statement from the office of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor 
said a minister of foreign affairs will be named shortly. The 
council appointed Laveli Supuwood of the NPFL to head the 
Justice Ministry. Sande Ware, of the defunct interim government 
of Amos Sawyer, retains the post of defense minister, and Banker 
Wilson Tarpeh got the finance portfolio on the ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] ticket. 
  The statement said the parties to the Cotonou accord made 
the 
nominations for three of the four disputed portfolios, leaving 
the State Council with a free hand to appoint a foreign 
minister. It said the new appointees and cabinet nominees of 
the National Patriotic Front of Liberia were expected to go to 
the confirmation hearings today. NPFL cabinet nominees expected 
for today's confirmation hearings include Joe Mulbah of 
information, Tom Woewiyu of labor, and Samuel Dhokie, internal 
affairs. 
  A Nigerian diplomat said this is the best piece of news for 
ages and an editorial article today in the Monrovia DAILY NEWS 
declared: At last a dove of peace is apparently flying over this 
troubled nation of ours. 
  Charles Taylor of the NPFL in Liberia has just called us up 
to say that the agreement on the appointment of cabinet 
ministers does not have his blessing. He said if Laveli 
Supuwood has accepted the appointment as justice minister, he is 
a defector from the NPFL.

  [Text] Abidjan, 20 Apr (AFP) -- A French aid agency has 
denied a UN report that five of its employees in Liberia had 
been kidnapped by one the country's armed factions. 
International Action Against Hunger said in a statement here 
that two Liberian nationals working for the group had been "held 
up for several hours last week at Kanweikan," about 200 
kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital Monrovia. "They were 
held up by local military security officials on grounds that 
authorities had not been informed that the two employees had 
been transferred," the group said. It noted that the transfer 
had in fact been initiated by "the highest local civilian 
authority." A United Nations spokesman in Monrovia said Monday 
[18 April] that militants from the National Patriotic Front had 
seized five workers from the French agency, accusing them of 
backing a rival militia, the Liberia Peace Council.

  [Excerpt] After four days of negotiations between the 
Azaouads and the Malian Government in Tamanrasset, which were 
initially marked by optimism by the parties to the dispute, on 
the implementation of the Bamako agreement and the reintegration 
of the Azaouads in various aspects of life in their country of 
origin, the dialogue between the two sides has been postponed 
until a later date. We review the reasons for this postponement 
with our correspondent from Hoggar. 
  [Correspondent] We reviewed the contents of the latest talks 
held last night with (Abderrahmane Guella), general coordinator 
of the Azaouad movement. 
  [Begin (Guella) recording] Thanks to the efforts of the 
mediator, we reached an agreement on holding another meeting in 
Algeria in the next few days. By then the [Malian] government 
side will have discussed the fronts' points of view and made a 
final decision regarding them, because the government delegation 
has asked for consultations with its government, and God 
willing, the minutes of the meeting could be signed. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] Talks were marked by intransigence in some 
positions, despite the Algerian mediator's efforts. The last 
phase lasted until late last night and was marked by differences 
in principle regarding the implementation of the agreement on 
integration as a main point in the final solution to the crisis. 
  The Malian Government delegation raised several problems 
which its government was facing and which would not allow the 
total acceptance of the demands of the Azaouads regarding the 
number of those to be integrated in various economic, political, 
and military sectors. The delegation justified this by the 
reforms currently under way in Mali within the framework of its 
program with the International Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the nonparliamentary opposition in </F>
Niamey on 20 April; read by unidentified person -- recorded] 
  [Text] The implementation of a parliamentary opposition 
call for civil disobedience, and the government's reaction it, 
have led to events which seriously threaten the democratic 
process in our country. In the face of this danger to the 
democratic process, and in the face of a real risk of an upsurge 
in violence, the signatory parties to this present statement 
reaffirm their commitment to the protection of democracy in our 
country. They appeal to the people of Niger not to yield to the 
temptation to engage in violence, but to instead work toward 
achieving the main objective of fighting to initiate true 
democracy. 
  They call on the government to put an end to an escalating 
cycle of actions, and to bring its actions in line with the 
requirements of the democratic process. They call on 
parliamentary opposition members to discontinue violence, so as 
not to strengthen the government's authoritarian tendencies. 
They demand the unconditional release of the arrested persons 
in order to create the conditions for true democratic dialogue, 
and extend their condolences to the victim's family. 
  The signatory parties are: the (?ADC-Zoumonki), 
(?MDP-Alaholi), (?ORDN-Parmamoua), PMT-Albarka, (?UPR-Zebano) 
[expansions unknown]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou with </F>
foreign and domestic correspondents in Niamey on 18 April-- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Voix du Sahel corresponedent 
Braimah Fadoumouchi] Prime Minister, you recently declared that 
financial folly is over in Niger and that all citizens must pay 
taxes. How does the government intend to organize the 
collection of national taxes. 
  [Issoufou] Following a working session with the major 
revenue 
collecting services at the Ministry of Finance, I said that our 
financial vacation is over. This is justified because we have 
witnessed a progressive reduction in taxation in our economy 
since 1987. This has led to a drastic fall in the state's tax 
revenues. As I have often emphasized, this has led to a fall in 
taxes collected compared with the total revenue, the gross 
domestic product, generated in the country. In the early 
eighties, taxes amounted to 13 percent of the gross domestic 
product. When we took over the management of the country, taxes 
hardly made up 7 percent of the gross domestic product. 
  In my general policy statement, I made clear that one of the 
government's priorities was to streamline the public finance and 
to boost our economy. The streamlining of the public finance 
must be accomplished in two phases. The first phase bears 
regards the increase in revenues earned from taxes and the 
second concerns the sound management of the state's expenditure. 
Your question concerns the first phase related to increasing 
revenue earned from taxation. We plan to increase our fiscal 
revenue from 7 percent to 15 percent. In the stabilization and 
economic reform program which we have signed with the 
IMF...[pauses] in the confirmation agreement which we have 
signed with the IMF and in the program which we intend to sign 
to facilitate a strong structural adjustment program, our 
objective is to be able to collect taxes making 11 percent of 
the gross domestic product in 1996. 
  How does the government intend to reach this goal? As you 
know, the government has been able to identify the obstacles 
that caused the fall in fiscal revenues. One of the greatest 
obstacles is the domination of our economy by the unofficial 
sector. We will fight against this. The decision to devalue the 
CFA franc on 12 January also falls under this category. The 
devaluation was aimed at effectively reducing fraud which is 
most commonly used by the informal sector. We will take 
particular steps to fight fraud. We will also provide the 
services with the necessary human and material resources 
accomplish this goal, because, as you know, unfortunately, our 
fiscal administration organ is understaffed, both the Central 
Revenue Department and the Customs Service. All these 
departments are understaffed. The government's objective is to 
increase the human resources of these departments. There is 
also the problem of transportation. We cannot control, for 
example, the long border which we have with Nigeria without 
vehicles to enable the Customs Service to accomplish this 
mission. These are therefore the measures to be taken by the 
government to achieve this goal. 
  [Fadoumouchi] How far have the Niger authorities gotten on 
negotiations with our mining partners concerning the new price 
of uranium? 
  [Issoufou] As you know, every year the Government of Niger 
meets with buyers who are also shareholders in the uranium 
mining companies, the Akouta Mining Company and the Air Mining 
Company. Negotiations began at the end of 1993 resulting in a 
fixed uranium price for 1994. It was fixed at 14,440 CFA per 
kilogram. These negotiations also led to the fixed levels of 
production. The level for 1994 was set at 3,000 tonnes. The 
decision to devalue the CFA franc was made on 12 January. 
Considering the fact that these mining companies import a great 
quantity of other materials, they were obliged to review their 
production costs. Generally, the price of uranium is [word 
indistinct] price which is fixed according to the production 
cost of the mining companies. So, as the production costs have 
changed, the price must also change. Consequently, we have 
decided to meet with the buyers again to hold fresh discussions 
in order to fix a final price for uranium considering the 
devaluation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Soon after the devaluation of 
the CFA franc, the government took a number of steps to exempt 
some goods from customs duties. This measure must end in April. 
Have you already thought of the end of April? Have some 
measures already been taken to prevent the situation from 
worsening? 
  [Issoufou] You have asked an important question concerning 
the CFA devaluation. Before answering your question, I would 
like to remind you of the arguments on which this devaluation 
decision was founded. Our governments had outlined a program of 
stabilization and economic reforms. These programs were 
intended to streamline the public finances and boost the economy 
through internal adjustment measures. This is why, from the 
beginning, the program was drawn up on a number of factors, 
based first on the rate of growth of the gross domestic product 
which was fixed at around 4 percent. [passage omitted] This is 
why we have decided to reflect on the issue of devaluation. 
This is why we have analyzed the positive and negative effects 
of devaluation. Among these effects is the fall in the 
purchasing power of the people. This in turn is linked to the 
subsequent increase in inflation which we estimated to be a 
level which, fortunately, was not attained. All the analyses 
made and all the information received from the statistics 
department have shown that the average inflation is currently 
around 22 percent. As a first step, we reacted by freezing the 
prices of essential goods because we felt that the stocks of 
these commodities were in the stores; they were acquired before 
the devaluation. So there was no reason for increasing their 
prices. This is the reason for the government's first decision 
to freeze prices, but the government cannot keep prices frozen 
forever. This means that imports must continue under new 
post-devaluation conditions. This is why we have envisaged a 
second phase of regulation and administration of prices, and it 
is this new phase that we are currently in. 
  As you know, the Ministry of Commerce is charged with fixing 
prices of essential goods to protect consumers and avoid 
penalizing businessmen. We have also envisaged that at the 
local level, committees should fix prices as in traditional 
markets. All this has helped to contain inflation. We know 
that during the month of Ramadan fasting the inflation was high. 
We are now witnessing a readjustment of the market and an 
effective reduction in the rate of inflation. This reduction in 
the rate of inflation was also obtained because the government 
has taken a number of fiscal steps to reduce the effects of 
imported inflation and it is in so doing that the government has 
reviewed taxes on goods and services. For example, customs 
duties have been reduced by half. All this was done, not only 
to protect consumers, but also to protect our enterprises which 
have a relatively large quantity of intermediary goods to 
import. These are the measures taken by the government and 
these measures have yielded extremely positive results because, 
as I have said, they have helped to contain inflation. [passage

  [Text] In Liberia, 1,532 armed men have so far been 
demobilized and encamped in the disarmament process which began 
last month. The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major 
General John Inienger, disclosed this today in Lagos while 
briefing airport correspondents on the latest developments in 
Liberia. Pius Egbohon has a report: 
  [Begin Egbohon recording] Gen. Inienger said a number of 
weapons and over 6,000 rounds of assorted ammunition had also 
been recovered. He was, however, not happy with the slow pace 
at which the factions were turning in their men for disarmament 
and encampment. The ECOMOG field commander attributed this 
situation to the lack of faith among the factions. He stated 
that there was a high degree of distrust among the factions 
culminating in a situation whereby each faction suspects the 
other of having a hidden agenda. [passage indistinct] 
  Gen. Inienger said that apart from the low level of trust 
prevalent among the factions, the internal rift within ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the 
fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] of Charles Taylor had not 
worked in favor of the peace process. He gave an assurance that 
the problem would be resolved soon to ensure that the general 
elections scheduled for 7 December this year became a reality.

  [Text] Monrovia, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Soldiers of one of 
Liberia's armed factions have detained five local employees of a 
French aid organisation, the UN bureau announced here Monday [18 
April]. The five, employed by International Action Against 
Hunger, were being held in the port city of Harper, 400 
kilometers (240 miles) southeast of here, by the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL]. They were detained last week 
on suspicion of supporting the Liberia Peace Council, a rival 
militia set up in September, a UN spokesman said. 
  Fighting broke out last week between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
and the Liberia Peace Council in Rivercess, 160 kilometers (90 
miles) southeast of here, prompting people to flee to Buchanan 
where some 80,000 people are now being taken care of by 
humanitarian organisations, the spokesman said. Because of 
increased insecurity in southeastern Liberia, the American 
Catholic Relief Services have announced they were suspending 
operations in the region.

  [Excerpts] The tripartite meeting on the implementation of 
the national pact has been in progress in Tamanrasset, Algeria, 
since 16 April. The meeting, attended by Mali, the Unified 
Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria -- the 
mediating country -- is reviewing the progress made in the 
implementation of the national pact since it was signed. From 
Tamanrasset, our special correspondent Oumar Toure reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] The Tamanrasset meeting closely 
follows the second anniversary of the signing of the national 
pact on 11 April 1992 by Mali and the rebel Tuareg movements to 
consecrate the return of peace, security, and national 
reconciliation in Mali. The meeting is aimed at taking stock of 
the pact's implementation and at defining future priorities in 
line with the spirit of the pact. Already the pact has led to 
the creation of a peaceful atmosphere. What remains to be done 
now is to tackle the developmental aspect of the pact because, 
in reality, apart from its political nature, the pact is a real 
action program for development and integration and a real answer 
to the problem of exclusion, abandonment, and underdevelopment 
of our country's northern regions which sparked off the 
rebellion. 
  Opening the Tamanrasset session, the Algerian representative 
restated his country's solidarity with the efforts to 
consolidate the gains of the national pact. He hailed the 
efforts that have so far been made since 11 April 1992. 
  In his address, Sada Samake, the territorial administration 
and security minister who led the national delegation, said the 
Tamanrasset meeting is aimed at taking an objective look at the 
progress made in the implementation of the national pact. 
  [Samake] Today, the national pact represents an important 
gain which we all need to preserve and consolidate. It is a 
mark of the return of peace even though acts of banditry 
continue to create an atmosphere of insecurity in our country's 
northern regions. From the military and security standpoint, 
decisive progress has been made with the integration of 640 
fighters into the regular Army while special security units are 
being set up despite delays in the effective takeoff of the 
exercise. The present meeting will afford us another 
opportunity to give new impetus to the implementation of the 
national pact. It will enable us to take an objective look at 
the progress made and to identify existing shortcomings so as to 
work out ways and means of overcoming them. 
  [Toure] The MFUA representative, (Sidi Mohamed Ould Zaibi), 
pointed out that the movements did not come to Tamanrasset to 
renegotiate the national pact because it is clear enough as it 
stands. 
  [(Zaibi)] [passage omitted] We do not see ourselves as 
attending a renegotiation session of the national pact as it is 
clear. There is nothing to renegotiate. We only have to 
implement what has been agreed on by the two sides. The pact 
forms the historical yardstick for judging all sides. 
  [Toure] All the movements are represented at the Tamanrasset 
meeting including the ministerial departments involved in 
handling the northern problem. Since 16 April, the 
deliberations have been going on behind closed doors and no 
information has filtered out. However, according to informed 
sources, MFUA representatives have demonstrated a lot of 
flexibility in their appreciation of the progress made so far in 
the implementation of the national pact. [end recording]

  [Text] Representatives of the Malian Government and the 
Azaouad united movements and fronts meeting in Tamanrasset 
agreed yesterday evening to postpone discussion of the issue of 
the enumeration of Azaouad combatants who are to be integrated 
into the Malian security forces. It should be recalled that 
this issue has remained a thorny point of disagreement between 
the two sides. 
  In the opinion of observers in Tamanrasset, Algerian 
diplomatic intervention has allowed the proceedings of the 
committee to follow up implementation of the Bamako agreement, 
which is currently taking place in Tamanrasset in the far south 
of Algeria, to get under way.

  [Text] The situation is calm in Niamey today after the 
weekend's clashes between security forces and opposition 
supporters. According to a NIGER PRESS AGENCY dispatch, a 
precarious calm reigns today over the capital Niamey. The 
report adds, however, that the large teams of policemen deployed 
yesterday are still patrolling major crossroads. 
  Also, the interior minister whom we contacted by telephone 
this afternoon has confirmed that about 50 people who had been 
arrested were freed between yesterday and this morning. Mr. 
Ousmane Oumarou also disclosed that preliminary investigations 
show that no charges have been brought against the 50 persons 
released. The interior minister further added that five key 
opposition leaders and two members of parliament are still under 
arrest.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou received the heads 
of diplomatic and consular missions in Niger and representatives 
of international organizations this afternoon to brief them on 
the political situation prevailing in our country. 
  The prime minister summoned the diplomats as observers of 
the 
Niger political scene and witnesses to the government efforts 
made on economic, social, and political levels. During the 
meeting, Mr. Issoufou recalled the progress recorded in our 
country since the new political authorities came to power. The 
head of government reassured the members of the diplomatic corps 
that today, despite the crisis prevailing in Niger, one can 
nonetheless note improvements both in the democratic ideals and 
socioeconomic issues. The progress was acheived thanks to the 
assistance from friendly countries and international 
institutions. 
  Tackling the main issue at stake during the meeting, Mr. 
Issoufou indicated that unfortunately in this era full of hope, 
a new hotbed of tension (?bore a burden) on the nation and 
tension was brought about by the opposition political parties' 
refusal to respect the democratic and republican laws the Niger 
people had enacted for themselves through the 26 December 1992 
Constitution. To safeguard national unity and revamp the 
economy, the government reacted in order to preserve the 
Constitution, the laws and regulations as well as human rights 
principle. Niger authorities will continue to strive to save 
Niger from risky ventures and useless sufferings seen in other 
countries. 
  Mr. Issoufou also said that the government remains open to 
all initiatives from the civil society and friendly countries 
that will enable Niger to strengthen its young democracy, 
restore security and peace, and respect constitutional values. 
After this brief introduction, the prime minister gave the 
floor to his interlocutors. The Moroccan ambassador to Niger, 
Mr. Tahar Nejjar, also dean of the diploamtic corps, took the 
floor and asked the prime minister to use parliamentarian 
immunity since several parliamentarians were arrested. In 
response, the head of government explained that the 
parliamentarians who were arrested were caught in the act. 
  Asked about what kind of initiatives the government was open 
to, Mr. Issoufou said that the authorities of the Third Republic 
are in favor of any action susceptible to help Niger advance on 
the path of social, economic, and political progress.

  [Text] In Niger, the government is going to call for the 
lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the arrested deputies. 
Moreover, the 50 people who were taken in for questioning in 
Niamey have been released. However, the opposition leaders are 
still in prison. 
  The National Movement for the Society of DevelopmenT, the 
former single party, is quite determined to try to have them 
released at any cost. Listen to what one of its leaders, Hama 
Amadou, had to say on the subject. He spoke to Chantal Lorho: 
  [Begin recording] [Amadou] The various grassroot structures 
are mobilizing and, really, if our leaders are not released, 
there may be some really hot days over the next few days. 
  [Lorho] Does this mean that you are going to call for 
demonstrations in the streets? 
  [Amadou] Absolutely. 
  [Lorho] Have you already set a precise calendar for your 
actions? 
  [Amadou] Well, when the time comes, everyone will be 
informed 
about what will happen. 
  [Lorho] When will that be? 
  [Amadou] Very soon. 
  [Lorho] May I ask you why you are in Ouagadougou? 
  [Amadou] For a particular mission in the framework of the 
party, but it has nothing to do with what the authorities in 
Niamey are saying. 
  [Lorho] That is? 
  [Amadou, laughing] That I have fled and that I have gone to 
recruit mercenaries. 
  [Lorho] Is this what the government in Niamey is saying? 
  [Amadou] Absolutely, and I find this totally ridiculous. We 
have always carried out our actions within the framework of the 
normal workings of democracy, not by recruiting mercenaries or 
killing anyone. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Inter-ethnic clashes last 
week between two communities on opposite sides of the border 
between Cross River and Benue States in southeast Nigeria 
reportedly have left 10 persons dead and more than 15 seriously 
wounded, the independent daily newspapers GUARDIAN and TRIBUNE 
reported today. 
  These same sources point out that, during the clashes 
between 
the Obudus of Cross River State and the Vandeikya of Benue 
State, more than 550 houses were burned and some 2,000 Obudu 
villagers fled for fear of new attacks from their neighbors. 
  Most of the wounded suffer from wounds inflicted by firearms 
and machetes. The military administrators of the two states, 
Captains Joshua Obademi of Benue State and Ibrahim Kefas of 
Cross River State, held a meeting over the weekend, after which 
they sent a strong warning to anyone who is found responsible 
for new outbreaks trouble between the two communities. 
  Funds have been allocated by the two administrators to come 
to the aid of the victims. The drawing of the border between 
the two states at the time of the British protectorate, which is 
contested by the Vandeikya, is said to be the cause of the 
clashes between the Obudus and Vandeikya, according to evidence 
collected by the GUARDIAN.

  [Text] Lagos, April 19 (AFP) -- Seventy-four persons 
appeared in court in connection with demonstrations in the 
central town of Jos in which five persons reportedly died and 
many were injured, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported 
Tuesday [19 April]. The suspects were charged Monday in a Jos 
magistrate's court with unlawful assembly, rioting, causing 
mischief with fire and possessing arms, NAN said. 
  The demonstration last Tuesday in Jos, capital of the 
central 
Plateau state, was over the controversial appointment of a 
Moslem as the head of a local government council in 
mainly-Christian Jos. The Christian population expressed its 
opposition to the appointment, a step which made the government 
suspend the move, but this triggered off the protest by the 
Moslem population. 
  The demonstrators set ablaze the main market in the city, 
two 
mosques and a church and some cars, eyewitnesses said. 
  The state military administrator, Colonel Mohammed Mana, 
swiftly imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city and nearby 
Bukuru town, and deployed soldiers on the main roads to restore 
order. 
  The government later relaxed the curfew, according to NAN.

  [Text] Nairobi, April 19 (AFP) -- The Somali Patriotic 
Movement (SPM) and the Somali National Alliance (SNA) have 
pledged to cooperate with all foreign humanitarian missions 
operating in southwest Somalia and to contribute towards a 
peaceful atmosphere in the region. 
  A statement, released here on Tuesday [19 April] and signed 
by SPM chairman Omar Jays, was reacting to Monday's attack on a 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) relief plane at the 
southwestern Somali town of Afmado, in which a Gambian UNHCR 
employee was killed. 
  In the statement, the two factions which control southern 
and 
southwestern Somalia also pledged that they would carry out 
investigations to determine who were responsible for the tragedy. 
  Alhadji Keba Sanneh, 53, was in an UNHCR plane arriving in 
the southwestern town from Nairobi when unidentified armed men 
opened fire, killing him, but four other people inside the 
aircraft escaped unhurt. 
  Sanneh was nominated last week by UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees, Sadako Ogata, as head of the cross border aid 
operations organised from Kenya since September 1992. 
  In her reaction to the death on Monday, Ogata said in Geneva 
that "the death will remind Somali leaders of the tragedy into 
which Somalia has been plunged and encourage them to renew their 
determination to find peace".

  [Text] In the battlefield in N'dalatando, the troops of 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos' involved in the offensive are not able 
to move or receive supplies. The circle is closing tighter and 
tighter. Yesterday, in a vain attempt to break out, the Futungo 
de Belas adventurers left 10 dead soldiers, 11 60-mm mortar 
shells, and a considerable assortment of war materiel along the 
Beira Alta road. The Luanda air force has not been indifferent 
to this. Yesterday, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' combat aircraft 
raided civilian villages, destroying their farms. Four 
civilians were killed and five others seriously wounded. 
Moreover, Sergeant Antonio Tunguno, who was captured during 
clashes, revealed to the military information services of the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] that South 
African, Portuguese, and Katanga mercenaries are directly 
assisting Luanda in these attacks. 
  Antonio Tunguno said that in the Angolan capital, Luanda, 
Eduardo dos Santos' terrorists are involved in a campaign to 
force the youths to join the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola ranks. To conclude, our reporter Morais 
Abel, who reported this, notes that the FALA Military Command in 
N'dalatando says that N'dalatando will never fall, to either 
land or air offensives.

  [Text] The dishonesty of the men led by Eduardo dos Santos 
is finding an echo in the international media, which are 
broadcasting unfounded and false reports about the real 
situation in Angola at large, and Uige Province in particular. 
Augusto Salupula, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
correspondent in Uige, reports: 
  [Begin Salupula recording] The report carried by London BBC 
last night that the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] forces are attacking neighboring 
Negage Air Base and advancing in the direction of the city of 
Uige, the provincial capital is false. According to the BBC 
correspondent in Luanda, the MPLA-PT forces were some 30 km from 
Uige. 
  First [as heard], the Luanda regime's forces will never get 
past the defensive line of the brave Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola, FALA, at N'dalatando, the capital of 
Cuanza Norte Province. [end recording]

  [Text] Blantyre, April 17 (AFP) -- Malawi's independent 
electoral commission on Sunday [17 April] named President 
Hastings Kamuzu Banda's ruling party as the main violator of 
electoral law. 
  In a press statement the commission, headed by High Court 
Judge Anastazia Msosa, charged that Malawi Congress Party 
officials had been seizing or buying voter registration 
certificates, to be used in presidential and parliamentary 
elections on May 17. The commission said it had gathered its 
own evidence that the party had been doing this in nine of 
Malawi's 24 districts. It said chiefs -- who play an 
influential role in rural politics -- and MCP officials were the 
main culprits in snatching voter certificates. 
  "Voters have either been told to surrender their 
certificates 
and come to a central location on election day to retrieve them 
so that everyone votes for the same candidate, or they have 
simply been taken without promise of return," the commission 
said. 
  The commission also reported two cases of opposition parties 
violating the electoral law. It said an official of the 
Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) was apprehended while attempting 
to seize registration certificates and another official of the 
Malawi National Democratic Party bought voter certificates to 
secure the election of presidential candidate Tim Mangwazu. 
  The commission, which has pledged to prosecute violators of 
the electoral law, said campaign violence and intimidation had 
been noted in several districts. "Tit-for-tat campaign meeting 
disruptions resulting in a number of injuries have occurred 
between the opposition United Democratic Front and the ruling 
party," the commission said. 
  This was the first time that the commission, set up by 
parliament had openly accused Banda's party of breaking the 
electoral law. 
  If convicted, offenders face up to two years imprisonment or 
a maximum fine of 5,000 kwacha (800 US dollars).

  [Excerpts] Maputo this morning saw the opening of the first 
national meeting of structures connected with the electoral 
process. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking at the opening of that meeting this morning, Dr. 
Brazao Mazula, National Elections Commission [CNE] chairman, 
said that the government and the Mozambique National Resistance, 
Renamo, had accelerated the [words indistinct] of territorial 
administration. Dr. Mazula said that all people are invited to 
take part in the process. 
  In his speech, CNE Chairman Dr. Mazula noted that it was 
crucial that the media help provide civic education to the 
people and disseminate information concerning electoral 
mechanisms. He added that the Electoral Law and the General 
Peace Accord are the working tools for the holding of elections. 
  In turn, UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello said that the 
international community hopes the democratization process will 
be a success in this country. Ajello also told those present 
that the UN Security Council will meet soon to approve an 
extension of the UN Operations in Mozambique's mandate until 
October. The UN special representative also noted that delays 
in the implementation of the General Peace Accord should not be 
seen as time wasted but, rather, quote, as time that helped 
consolidate those things that had been approved, unquote.

  [Text] Manuel Tome, Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] 
secretary for mobilization and propaganda, said in Lisbon that 
his party believes that the formation of a government of 
national unity should only be considered after the multiparty 
elections scheduled for October of this year. 
  Manuel Tome is responsible for Frelimo's electoral campaign. 
Speaking in that capacity, Tome said that Frelimo's posture 
after the elections will follow internationally acceptable 
standards. He added that the winning party should not be forced 
to form a government of national unity, even after elections 
have been held. 
  Lately, many Mozambican opposition parties -- including the 
Mozambique National Resistance -- have defended the formation of 
a government of national unity, but the Mozambican Government 
has rejected those views.

  [Text] The Swazi police have shed some light on rumors that 
South African right-wingers are undergoing military training in 
the Lufufa Mountains of north-western Swaziland. A police 
spokesman said locals in the remote area could have mistaken 
South African policemen conducting a joint air and ground 
anti-dagga operation in February for a foreign military force. 
In addition, South African mining engineers have been 
prospecting in the area and moving heavy mining equipment that 
could have been mistaken for armored vehicles. he said all 
rumors have been thoroughly investigated.

  [Text] A member of Parliament has described as selfish 
political motives suggestions by some opposition members that 
Zambia should change electoral rules to provide for two voters' 
rolls, one for the rich and another for the poor. 
  Kafulu member of parliament Dr. (Yusuf Dadat) said yesterday 
that the proposed idea was pathetic and [word indistinct] on 
some political figures trying to fulfill their selfish 
ambitions. Dr. (Dadat), who is on a tour of his constituency, 
told a public meeting that it was surprising that when the 
concept of one man, one vote was acceptable the world over, some 
people wanted change only to suit their selfish interests. 
  He said the MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] 
government should not allow a situation whereby the privileged 
determined the destiny of the majority.

  [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has acted to 
defuse a growing land-grab scandal involving his government by 
announcing that all leases of state land to individuals would be 
canceled. His move follows widespread allegations of corruption 
in land reforms meant to redress injustices of the colonial past 
by redistributing white-owned land to landless blacks. Entire 
farms had been leased to individual government ministers, senior 
civil servants, and top members of the military, instead of 
being used to resettle peasants. 
  Mr. Mugabe told his ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National 
Union-Patriotic Front] party newspaper, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that 
the land should not have been leased out in the first place 
because it had been acquired for the purpose of resettling 
peasant farmers. He said in future land should be leased after 
proper procedures had been followed, and the Land Acquisition 
Act would continue to be used for the resettlement of landless 
peasants.

districts of the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, last night. 
Details of casualties were not known by this morning. 
Meanwhile, sporadic shooting was heard in Kamenge and Cibitoke 
districts, which are Hutu-dominated. However, according to 
External Relations Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, the situation 
is not alarming. The government has asked the 15-member OAU 
international observer mission to undertake joint patrols with 
Burundi soldiers in order to obtain objective reports on the 
cause of these disturbances.

  [Text] In Burundi, press agencies report clashes in the 
suburbs of Bujumbura. Apparently, these are incidents between 
part of the population and gangs of attackers. The situation is 
not alarming, according to the UN representative in Bujumbura. 
This is also confirmed by the interim head of state, Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] There is absolutely no 
reason why we should make this situation out to be more tragic 
than it is. In any case, all those here in Bujumbura can 
testify to this situation. It is a situation we are trying to 
bring under control for good. In that respect, I have announced 
some measures which we will take to bring under control [words 
indistinct] of violence which can still be found in Bujumbura. 
  [Correspondent Assane Diop] What are these measures, Mr. 
President? 
  [Ntibantunganya] First of all, we intend to establish a 
functional and efficient administration, a bold administration 
which agrees to collaborate -- and has the means to do so -- 
with all the forces on the ground, police forces, the judiciary, 
and the political parties. We are doing all this in order to 
involve everyone in solving all the problems that could prevent 
the total restoration of peace and security in the country.

  [Text] Burundi interim president and chairman of the 
National Assembly yesterday addressed the nation. Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya centered his address on the major issues that are 
facing our country following the crisis and have paralyzed the 
country since October last year. Matthias Ndahirigije has gone 
into this address, here is his report: 
  [Ndahirigije] Peace seems to prevail on the whole country, 
but insecurity and suspicion are not mainly uprooted yet because 
mutual hatred still haunts the population and lack of confidence 
hasn't been swept away at all. In such state of affairs, the 
population think that evils are intellectuals because it is the 
latter who always create disorders in the country while fighting 
for powers. For the Burundi ad-interim head of state, current 
chairman of the National Assembly, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, 
the population has suffered too much and wants peace now. Time 
has come to come together, work together, and overcome all 
partisan tendencies which can't lead nowhere else than to 
catastrophe. 
  It's true that some provinces have now a state of security 
somehow calm but in some other areas of the country, such as the 
capital Bujumbura, especially the mayorship of Bujumbura, the 
situation is rather deteriorating. Ethnic cleansings have led 
to the creation of ethnic settlements and barbarous acts can no 
more allow free traffic and free circulation of people. For the 
ad- interim president of the Republic, Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, the state can't allow such ethnic settlements 
because the country should serve every citizen. For him, it is 
too deplorable to see quarters like Kinama, Kamenge, and others 
to become Hutulands, and quarters such as Nyakabiga, Ngagara, 
and others become Tutsilands. 
  For Mr. Ntibantunganya, everyone should bear in mind that 
all 
Burundians are all citizens, and therefore should share all 
opportunities offered by the state. It's true that since 21 
October, the country lives a strong crisis but if everyone could 
feel involved in the settlement of it, a lot could be settled 
down. That's why he called upon administration forces, order 
forces, lawmen, and churchmen to feel involved and do whatever 
necessary to restore peace and mutual confidence. 
  Therefore, some activities seem to take priority over 
others. 
First of all, the state should organize the relocation of 
displaced persons and start the reconstruction of all damaged 
equipment or buildings, start quickly the disarming of the civil 
population because this is a prerequisite for the restoration of 
peace in the country. Another priority task would focus mainly 
on the youth (?training) which is becoming more or less 
impossible in the capital Bujumbura. The OAU and UN observers 
are also appealed to backing this mission of restoring peace in 
the country. 
  Earlier he had congratulated all order forces for having 
done 
whatever possible to keep security.

  [Excerpts] The OAU is still concerned about the border 
dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria. An OAU delegation arrived 
in Yaounde yesterday to discuss the Cameroon-Nigeria border 
dispute. According to the Cameroonian Government daily CAMEROON 
TRIBUNE quoting sources close to the Cameroonian Ministry of 
External Relations, this visit follows, and I quote, Nigeria's 
illegal occupation of some areas of Cameroonian national 
territory, including the Bakassi Peninsula, an area in the Gulf 
of Guinea which Cameroon and Nigeria have been disputing since 
December 1993. [no reference to closing of quotation as heard] 
[passage omitted] 
  Well, what is the purpose of the OAU mission to Yaounde? 
Here is the response by Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, 
Cameroonian minister of communication and government spokesman, 
who spoke to Raphael Mbadinga this morning. 
  [Begin Kouomegni recording] It is normal for an OAU mission 
to come to Cameroon. It could also go to Nigeria because 
recently, the OAU's central body for the prevention, management, 
and settlement of conflicts asked the OAU secretary general to 
report on the situation in Bakassi within one month after the 
adoption of the resolution asking Nigeria to leave Cameroonian 
territory. I, therefore, believe that the OAU mission, which 
has come to Cameroon and which could also go to Nigeria, will 
gather the necessary information to enable the OAU secretary 
general to prepare his report. This report will also enable the 
OAU's central body to know whether the two sides have 
implemented the resolution. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba has clarified his 
stand following criticisms that his new government is too large. 
Casimir Oye-Mba appointed 38 persons to this government [words 
indistinct] because those who think this government is too large 
are the very same people who felt that some of the country's 
nine provinces were underrepresented. 
  Regarding the refusal of two appointees to join the 
government, the Gabonese prime minister stressed that such 
refusals are normal in a system that has renounced the one-party 
system and which guarantees freedom of action and expression. 
Listen to Casimir Oye- Mba interviewed by Jean Valere 
Mbinamanza: 
  [Begin recording] [Oye-Mba] Your question assumes people are 
bound to the rules of the one-party system. Previously, people 
were not consulted before being asked to join the government. 
They heard on the radio that they were made ministers. In the 
same way, they heard on the radio that they ceased to be 
ministers. People did not resign, or if they did there was 
little discussion about it. Gabonese must know that we are now 
in a pluralist system. If someone is asked to join the 
government, he is free to accept or refuse. 
  [Mbinamanza] What we do not understand very well in this 
case 
which has already marked the beginning of this government from 
which much is expected, is that these persons were supposed to 
have been consulted first and then to have later declined the 
offer to join the government. 
  [Oye-Mba] This can be attributed to the behavior of 
politicians! 
  [Mbinamanza] In that case do you feel somehow trapped? 
  [Oye-Mba] Not at all! I am not bothered. I am prime 
minister today and as long as I remain so, I will continue to do 
my work with those who are willing. Tomorrow, when I cease to 
be prime minister I will do something else and someone else will 
come to continue. [end recording] 
  I recall that former Minister of State Jean-Francois 
Ntoutoume and Jean-Pierre Bayena, two of the 38 persons called 
upon to join the new Gabonese Government, declined this offer 
with the argument that there was nothing coherent in the 
portfolios they were offered. 
  Finally, Casimir Oye-Mba said he would ask for a vote of 
confidence by the National Assembly at the right time and that 
he did not fear in any way a vote of no confidence.

  [Text] We begin the home news segment of this cast with the 
return to Libreville yesterday morning of Father Paul Mba 
Abessole, leader of the National Lumberjacks Rally, from Paris 
where he stayed for more than a month following the disturbances 
in which nine people died in Libreville in February. The 
opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March -- 
officially, to take a rest and to contact friends -- after four 
days of violence in several Libreville districts from 21-24 
February during which nine people, including two soldiers, were 
killed. The government had then held Father Paul Mba Abessole 
and his supporters responsible for the disturbances which broke 
out when workers embarked on a general strike called by the 
pro-opposition General Confederation of Free Labor Unions. 
Father Paul Mba Abessole, who was welcomed at the airport by 
over 100 supporters, made no statement on arrival.

  [Text] Libreville, 15 Apr (AFP) -- The Gabonese opposition 
"will not allow anyone to annihilate it and will continue to act 
democratically," its leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, assured a 
news conference in Libreville today. 
  Speaking one day after his return from a visit to Paris, 
which lasted more than one month, the chairman of the 
opposition's High Council of Resistance [HCR] said that "if we 
must resort to demonstrations to express our point of view, we 
will do so." "Demonstrations and rallies are part of the HCR's 
program, and no one can ask us to halt them. We will not allow 
anyone to annihilate us and we will continue to act 
democratically. We avoid violence and we will not take up 
arms," Father Abessole added. 
  The opposition leader also made "an urgent appeal to the 
government for the immediate release of those arrested in 
February" during unrest in Libreville. According to Father 
Abessole, "at least 80" supporters of his party, the National 
Lumberjacks Rally [RNB], were arrested. 
  The government has blamed the opposition leader and his 
party 
for the violence which resulted in nine deaths, according to 
official figures, which also reported that 77 people were 
arrested, although some were released immediately. 
  Meanwhile, HCR Deputy Chairman Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe 
stated that the negotiations with the government to defuse the 
crisis that emerged after President Omar Bongo's reelection in 
December 1993, which was rejected by the opposition, "have not 
started yet." According to the HCR, the negotiations depend on 
the revision of the electoral code, because "if a true 
law-abiding state is not established, we will no longer 
participate in elections," Agondjo- Okawe added. He rejected 
the government's scheduling of local elections for August 
because the date "was not negotiated."

  [Excerpts] The clique of killers continues its work in our 
country. Now they have turned their attention to the country's 
Armed Forces. Currently, government soldiers who oppose the 
clique of killers, those who are unhappy about the continuing 
deaths of innocent people, are being killed while others are 
being hunted. It is said that many have been killed since 16 
April. 
  The Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines [RTLM] tried 
to hide it by saying that some soldiers were planning to kill 
their superiors. The clique needed a pretext for these deaths. 
RTLM also said some soldiers had committed suicide. This is 
their way of explaining the deaths of innocent people. 
  All these explanations are meant to hide the truth. Some 
government soldiers are being killed because their goals do not 
coincide with the clique of killers who want to kill innocent 
people. The killings of innocent soldiers started when Colonel 
Augustin Bizimungu was appointed chief of staff of the 
government's Army. One can say that the current killings in the 
government's Army was the objective when he was appointed to 
that position by the clique that took power after removing those 
already there. Col. Augustin Bizimungu's aims were the reason 
he replaced Col. Gatsinzi, since the clique was not sure the 
latter would do things in the same way as Col. Bizimungu. Col. 
Bizimungu is well known for his wrongdoings. [passage omitted] 
  This should be a lesson even to the Interahamwe [militia] 
and 
the Impuzamugambi [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic 
youth wing members] who agreed to follow blindly by becoming a 
tool for killings. As the dictatorship (?is exposed), those who 
supported it now begin to suspect it. The dictatorship then 
loses trust in them and starts killing them. That is how things 
go with dictatorships; the other day it was the Tutsis and 
opposition members who were and still are being killed. Now it 
is the government soldiers who are being killed by the clique, 
even though some were fighting for it. Soon, it will be the 
Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi themselves who will be 
targeted by the clique. That is certain, because that is the 
reality of the dictatorship. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, April 19 (AFP) -- At least 25 civilians 
were killed and nearly 60 wounded when Rwandan Government forces 
shelled a Kigali stadium sheltering thousands of displaced 
people Tuesday [19 April], a UN official said. Most of those 
killed were members of the minority Tutsi tribe which dominates 
the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front. They had abandoned their 
homes and fled to the Amahoro stadium in a rebel-held 
northeastern neighbourhood to escape Hutu killing squads roaming 
the streets, UN spokesman Moctar Gueye said by telephone from 
Kigali. 
  Fighting between rebels and government soldiers battling for 
control of the capital for nearly two weeks intensified Tuesday 
morning before a lull in the afternoon, Gueye said. UN efforts 
to broker a truce have so far failed as the two sides have 
rejected each other's demands. But UN officials are continuing 
to shuttle between rebel and army commanders in an effort to 
bring them back to the negotiating table. [passage omitted] 
  The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] lodged a "very 
strong protest" with the military after four or five shells hit 
the stadium, where a battalion of Bangladeshi peacekeepers is 
based, Gueye said. 
  With no sign of progress towards a ceasefire, tribal clashes 
appeared to be spreading to Burundi, which shares the same 
ethnic composition and blood-steeped history of tribal feuding 
as Rwanda. Fighting between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and 
armed Hutu militants has erupted in several mainly Hutu areas on 
the outskirts of Burundi's capital Bujumbura since the weekend, 
officials said. It was unknown whether anyone was hurt. 
  Burundi, still reeling from ethnic massacres that claimed 
tens of thousands of lives last year after its first Hutu 
president was assassinated, had remained relatively calm since 
its President Cyprien Ntaryamira and Rwanda's Juvenal 
Habyarimana, both Hutus, were killed in what the Rwandan 
military said was a rocket attack on their plane. [passage 
omitted] 
  A Ugandan journalist from the government daily NEW VISION 
described how reporters had helped pull 10 survivors from a pit 
where they had been thrown with the corpses of about 800 people, 
mostly Tutsis, hacked to death by government troops in Kaziguro, 
northeastern Rwanda. 
  UN special envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said 
Monday that the world body would not abandon Rwanda but could be 
forced to pull its personnel from the country if the fighting 
did not stop. 
  Tanzania, which mediated a peace accord signed in August to 
end nearly three years of civil war in Rwanda, announced new 
peace talks for this weekend, but it was unclear whether rebel 
or government representatives would attend. 
  The International Red Cross meanwhile resumed distributing 
food in Kigali on Tuesday. It had suspended relief operations 
after six wounded people were shot dead while being taken to 
hospital in a Red Cross vehicle last week. 
  Some 30 aid workers from the Red Cross and the French 
medical 
agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) are 
tending to hundreds of wounded people in Kigali, where drugs and 
supplies are running desperately low.

  [Text] Widespread acts of violence continue in Rwanda. 
Massacres are presently being committed in Gitarama, Butare, 
Gikongoro, and Kibuye prefectures. Calls for extermination are 
made unceasingly by those in power in Kigali, calls for the 
extermination of Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] supporters, or 
presumed RPF supporters, and members of opposition political 
parties. The national radio has increasingly become the 
propaganda tool for this cause. That's why Gitarama, Butare, 
Gikongoro and Kibuye prefectures have now fallen victim to the 
massacres as is the case for the capital, Kigali, and other 
regions like [word indistinct]. 
  The horde of killers continues to hunt down their victims, 
even in places where the latter have taken refuge. The 
government Army today fired shells at (Amohoro) stadium of 
Kigali where more than 4,000 people who escaped the massacres 
have taken refuge. There are 20 dead and more than 50 wounded. 
  The strong men of the tottering regime of Kigali are thus 
determined to exterminate sections of the population. [passage 
indistinct] They have been asking that RPF stop fighting while 
they continue to orchestrate the massacres. 
  Before ending this news bulletin, we inform you that Mr. 
Marc 
Rugenera, finance minister of the decapitated government, has 
survived the massacre. He has been found by RPF combatants 
during their operations aimed at rescuing the victims of the 
Presidential Guards and of the Interahamwe [Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development militias]

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Army and the Rwandan 
Government forces held an informal joint meeting under the 
auspices of UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] at the 
Meridien Hotel, Kigali, on 15 April 1994 to explore the 
possibility of holding further negotiations between the two 
forces to discuss the cessation of hostilities and the 
restoration of peace to the country. The military leadership of 
the Rwandan Government forces has reportedly now responded to 
the conditions for negotiation which are advanced by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]. Whereas the RPF appreciates that there 
are significant sections of the Rwandan Government forces who 
detest the atrocities which have been committed over the iast 
two weeks by Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development [MRND] and its allies, the conduct of the Rwandan 
Government forces during the current national crisis leaves a 
lot to be desired. [passage omitted] 
  The RPF regrets that the response of the Rwandan Government 
forces to the above conditions, which are entirely reasonable, 
has been disappointing. The Rwandan Government forces have only 
accepted two terms. First, they promised to start apprehending 
the people who have been involved in the conduct of the 
violence. Second, they agree to the conduct of joint patrols 
with RPF for the pacification of the country. The Rwandan 
Government forces have rejected outright calls by RPF for the 
disbanding of the Presidential Guard and the so-called 
provisional government, both of which are largely responsible 
for the atrocities which have been committed. The RPF finds the 
attitude of the Rwandan Government forces not only unacceptable, 
but most disturbing. [passage omitted] 
  The RPF cannot and shall not agree to negotiate peace with 
the Rwandan Government forces while that gang of war criminals 
(?represented by) the provisional government still enjoys the 
recognition of the Rwandan Government forces. [passage omitted] 
In view of the foregoing [word indistinct] the RPF wishes to 
reaffirm the following. One, the RPF reaffirms its strong 
resolve to fight and destroy the MRND and Coalition for the 
Defense of the Republic regime of murderers that is responsible 
for the unprecedented genocide and destruction our country has 
been subjected to. Two, the RPF further reaffirms its 
commitment and patriotic obligation to continue its mission of 
liberating all Rwandan people who are still under the threat of 
genocide and calls upon all the citizens of our country who are 
still outside the [word indistinct] areas so far liberated by 
RPF, to stand up in unity and to resist the murderers while they 
await rescue by the RPF. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 17 April, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
president, Alexis Kanyarengwe, held an interview with foreign 
journalists. They asked him questions about the current 
situation, especially questions related to the war and the 
killings. A journalist said everybody thought the RPF would 
conquer Kigali in a few hours. Now a week has gone by. He 
asked whether it was a difficult task. 
  President Kanyarengwe answered by saying that our first 
objective was to rescue the innocent people being killed and to 
reinforce the RPF battalion in the parliament building. He also 
added that the war against the clique continued. Saying that 
Kigali could be overrun in two days was an exaggeration in view 
of the distance and the heavy weapons that first had to be taken 
there. The journalist was not satisfied with the answer and 
asked when Kigali would be captured: days or weeks. President 
Kanyarengwe said it was not easy to be precise but up to now we 
were in control of some areas which allowed us to control the 
town. We also had other positions in the center of town. 
  The journalist asked whether the government's strength was 
unexpectedly high or low. Kanyarengwe said that up to now we 
had not found any unpredictable strength in the government 
troops. He said our priority was first to rescue those who are 
being killed. He said that capturing Kigali would not be a 
problem. 
  Concerning the killings, the journalists asked how they 
could 
stop since there were so many. President Kanyarengwe said that 
the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
[MRND] party had prepared the Interahamwe [MRND militia] by 
giving them weapons and awaited any pretext to kill the 
innocent. He said that with the death of President Habyarimana, 
the bloodsuckers had implemented their evil plan. He said many 
soldiers had now realized this. Those who saw the truth would 
help the RPF, he said, but even if they did not, the RPF would 
soon fulfill its mission. As to whether the RPF would kill the 
murderers, President Kanyarengwe said that the priority was to 
stop the killings and secondly to arrest the criminals and hand 
them over to courts so that everyone could defend himself and be 
punished according to his crime. 
  President Kanyarengwe told them that some killers had fled 
the country. He asked the world to help us arrest the people so 
that they are brought to book, as the killings were crimes 
against humanity, which is an international crime. He said that 
some of the killers had fled outside the country. But there are 
others still in the country who use the country's radio to 
divide the people. He said there was also the Radio Television 
Libre des Milles Collines radio which divided Rwandans. He said 
all these questions would be followed up. 
  The journalist asked whether the killers would not have 
pretexts so that they were not punished. President Kanyarengwe 
said no one was allowed to kill, to loot, and torture people. 
He said that our country had laws to punish the concerned 
people. He also said that even other foreign countries pursued 
such people. 
  A reporter said they were among the first journalists who 
had 
been in Kiziguro and witnessed a very high level of killings. 
He asked to be told about the situation in the entire country. 
President Kanyarengwe said that what was happening in the 
country was not just killings, but genocide. He said there were 
many killings in Kigali. The government troops finished off 
hospital patients, took injured people from the Red Cross and 
finish them off too. Almost all the opposition leadership was 
killed. President Kanyarengwe said that [words indistinct] win 
and that peace return in the country, we shall meet with other 
political leaders of the country so as to install a government 
wanted by the people. Those were some of the questions answered 
by President Alexis Kanyarengwe the day before yesterday.

  [Excerpt] At Kanombe Airport in Kigali yesterday, where 
Belgian troops have been getting ready to return home, handover 
ceremonies were held between Belgian troops and the Ghanaian 
troops who had previously been in the neutral zone between the 
two sides. They came to replace the departing Belgian troops at 
the airport. One of the departing Belgian soldiers, after 
recalling the 10 colleagues who had been killed by government 
troops, said they could not remain in Rwanda as part of UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] because they were 
mistreated, and in some cases killed. They could not defend 
themselves because of the instructions given to UNAMIR. The 
soldier went so far as to say that Belgium will no longer send 
its troops to the United Nations. Although the job of the 
Belgians was rendered impossible and they were obliged to leave 
Rwanda, they continued to show that they were willing to help 
Rwanda. During the ceremonies yesterday, Belgian troops left 
the Ghanaians all their equipment so that they could continue to 
carry out the job previously done by Belgians without too many 
problems. 
  The United Nations is still faced with the important problem 
of replacing the Belgian troops within UNAMIR, as the country 
was UNAMIR's most important component due to the skill of its 
troops. It is said that even though they left their equipment, 
their skills to use it are also needed. Apart from the skills, 
they had the third biggest force, after Bangladesh which has 940 
men and Ghana which has 840 men. 
  Therefore it is clear that the withdrawal of the Belgian 
troops complicates the work of UNAMIR in Rwanda. [passage

  [Text] Sao Tome, 19 Apr (AFP) -- The Sao Tomean Parliament 
today began examining a draft bill on autonomy status for 
Principe Island whose 6,000 inhabitants consider themselves 
abandoned by the central power installed on the other island, 
the Sao Tome Archipelago, which is 150 km away from it. 
  The draft bill provides for the creation of a regional 
assembly in Principe and a five-member regional government under 
the authority of a minister appointed by the president of the 
Republic. The bill also authorizes Principe to have bonds of 
cooperation with foreign local governments. 
  This volcanic island, which measures 128 square km, is 
located 300 km off the Gabonese coast. It has only one town, 
San-Antonio, with 1,000 inhabitants. The people of Principe 
believe they have been neglected by the Sao Tome Government 
since they gained independence in 1975, so they are now asking 
for "balanced development" of the archipelago.

  [Text] At the High Council of the Republic-Transitional 
Parliament [HCR-PT], we are a day away from D-day: In principle, 
tomorrow is the deadline set by the HCR-PT for the political 
group opposed to President Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko to decide 
and nominate the prime minister who will head a 15-month 
national union government in accordance with the new 
constitution act promulgated on 9 April by Marshal Mobutu. On 
the eve of this deadline, the atmosphere is far from positive. 
Yesterday, we broadcast a few statements on the issue. Now we 
bring you that of Lawyer Kamanda wa Kamanda, chairman of the 
Nationalist Common Front and of the Union for the Republic and 
Democracy [URD] subplatform. 
  [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] the Sacred Union of the 
Radical Opposition [USOR]. But in view of the confusion created 
by Mende's statement and by some articles published in the 
newspapers which we consider inappropriate, on behalf of URD 
members I would like to make a few clarifications that would 
enable the national and international community to judge for 
themselves. 
  On 13 April, at the People's Palace, USOR members of the URD 
who took part in the political consultations of the People's 
Palace turned up for the USOR executive committee meeting, which 
featured a single item on its agenda: examination of the problem 
posed by Article 78, paragraph 2, of the Interim Constitutional 
Act [ACT], in light of the HCR-PT executive organ's statement on 
12 April 1994. At this meeting, the URD members, through me, 
their chairman, put forward a strategy and requested the others 
to let us examine how best to organize the consultations 
concerning Article 78 of the Constitutional Act and the HCR-PT 
executive organ's statement. We discussed how to tackle item by 
item a number of crucial issues, particularly the composition of 
the USOR delegation to the consultations with members of the 
Political Forces of the Conclave, the timing [preceding word in 
English] and procedure of consultations with the other 
components of USOR and Allies [USORAL]. 
  3. [as heard] The signing of the protocol agreement which 
concluded the political consultations of the People's Palace and 
of the special disposition by those who had not yet signed it 
and by the prime minister who would be presented at the end of 
the consultations. 
  4. The position of the prime minister elected by the 
Sovereign National Conference on this problem, on the protocol 
agreement, on the special disposition, as well as on the ACT. 
  6. [as heard] The management of subsequent candidacies and 
of 
ambitions within USOR first, and then within USORAL, taking into 
account the deadline problem for filing candidacies within USOR 
to achieve a joint presentation of the prime minister to the 
other members of the political class. 
  The USOR presidium on that day categorically refused to open 
a debate on the issues I have just recalled and on the strategy 
we put forward, declaring that everything had already been 
settled at (?IMET) [expansion unknown] during the 6 April USOR 
plenary session and that there was no longer anything to 
discuss. The presidium had read the report which was prepared 
at (?IMET) at the 6 April plenary session which was not attended 
by URD members because they were uninformed, and at which 
suspension measures or disciplinary actions were taken against 
members of the URD for reasons we do not know. 
  Faced with this refusal to hold discussion and with the will 
of the presidium to impose the fait accompli, the URD members 
pulled out after having recorded their disapproval in the 
meeting's report. Thus, they did not take part in the 
resource-pooling meeting between USOR, the civil society, and 
the Allies on 13 April at the People's Palace. 
  I would like to add that the URD members did not take part 
in 
any vote during this meeting, because no vote was conducted in 
their presence, let alone in their absence, since only one group 
stayed back at the meeting place and sought to impose its view. 
After all, in relation to whom and to what other viewpoint 
could any vote have taken place? This is why members of the URD 
refute and rebut the shameless lies that were published in the 
newspapers. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- A sticker with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] name, initials and emblem will be 
affixed to the bottom of national and regional ballot papers, 
the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Tuesday [19 
April]. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a press 
conference in Johannesburg the procedure was flawed but all 
parties had agreed to it in Pretoria on Tuesday. 
  The stickers will be affixed at individual polling stations 
before the ballot papers are brought to the issuing desk and 
handed to voters. Mr Justice Kriegler said the IEC had awarded 
the contract for printing the stickers to one firm after 
considering four possibilities. 
  IFP candidate lists would be vetted no later than Friday and 
published no later than the weekend, he said. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said the procedure was flawed because 
parties did not appear in alphabetical order. The IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] stickers, which also showed a colour picture of 
IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, would look different because 
they were printed on a white background. The ballot paper was 
marked. 
  If the IFP sticker crossed the line of the political party 
above it, the ballot paper would be spoilt, he said. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler could not say if this system would 
increase the number of spoilt votes, but said the complicated 
process left room for human error. 
  The stickers would not necessarily increase the number of 
election result disputes, he said. Each party had accepted the 
system and Mr Justice Kriegler believed this agreement would 
lessen the prospect of such disputes. 
  He congratulated the government, the African National 
Congress and the IFP on their agreement. It would make the 
IEC's talk of declaring the elections free and fair "infinitely 
easier" because all major political role players took part, he 
said. 
  The IFP's participation would reduce violence caused by 
political frustration and resistance to the electoral process in 
Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler predicted. 
  He would not disclose whose idea the stickers was. "It may 
even have been mine. I think it was," he joked, saying the idea 
had been thrown around on Saturday when he and the IEC chief 
director met the three political parties. 
  IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said a team had already 
been sent to kwaZulu/Natal to investigate setting up an 
addi4ional 700 voting stations. Security at the stations was a 
concern and talks were being held with security forces in the 
area.

  [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] must submit its list 
of election candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] today. IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler says the commission 
will approve the lists by Friday so that they can be published 
by the weekend. Mr. Justice Kriegler said the IFP's decision to 
take part in the elections could cost millions of rands. An 
additional 700 polling stations have to be established in 
kwaZulu-Natal. Earlier it was reported that the state of 
emergency in kwaZulu-Natal would stay in force until the 
situation had improved.

  [Text] Durban April 19 SAPA -- King Goodwill Zwelithini 
made an impassioned plea for an end to violence on Tuesday [19 
April] after a political breakthrough saw the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] joining the election process, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. Speaking at his 
royal house at Nongoma, he thanked all parties involved in 
negotiations which he said had led to his demands on a Zulu 
monarchy being met. 
  A carnival atmosphere erupted at the kwaZulu capital, 
Ulundi, 
on Tuesday afternoon when the news was made known, with 
mot?rists hooting, women ululating, men bursting into tribal 
singing and dancing and youths toyi-toying [political dancing] 
in the streets. 
  Thousands of civil servants joined in the celebrations 
outside the Legislative Assembly buildings. Earlier a protest 
march by thousands ?f Zulus at Denny Dalton turned into an 
election campaign when the news was announced. 
  King Goodwill said he was above party politics and would not 
be supporting any particular party. He also expressed the hope 
that tensions which led to violence would now ease.

  [Text] The demonstration against the election turned into a 
celebration near Ulundi today. There was jubilation in the area 
when thousands of people realized they will be able to vote. In 
an exclusive interview with the SABC, King Zwelithini said all 
Zulus should go to the polls next week. Gary Alfonso compiled 
this report. 
  [Zwelithini] A process has begun which will address the 
serious concerns of the Zulu nation and of the Zulu monarch, and 
that the Zulu nation should now fully support this process, 
including participation of the election in the hope that our 
claims and demands will be finally fulfilled [sentence as heard]. 
  [Alfonso] Earlier in the day near Ulundi a Zulu and IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] crowd came to the area to demonstrate. 
They had previously been told not to vote, and to ignore the 
state of emergency, and to continue their defiance campaign 
until the IFP's demands were met. But when the large crowd 
heard the news that the IFP was in the election fold, 
demonstrators turned into supporters and toyi-toyed [political 
dancing] in celebration. 
  In probably the party's first election address, IFP Central 
Committee member Albert Mxwango said his party's performance in 
the elections would surprise friend and foe. By late afternoon 
many people in towns around Ulundi had not heard the news. 
Those who had were carefully optimistic. 
  While most people in the Nongoma/Ulundi area appear positive 
about their new option, there is still a feeling of pessimism in 
party ranks that there may not be enough time left to canvas 
votes, and they says pol?tical activity in the area had been 
sadly lacking and voter education had suffered directly as a 
result of that. We just heard that thousands of IFP supporters 
have converged on Durban city center in what appears to be a 
spontaneous celebration of their party's participation in the 
election. It's understood the IFP supporters are to hold a 
victory march in central Durban in a short while.

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning South Africa" program; italicized </F>
passage in English] 
  [Text] Soon after the announcement yesterday that the 
Inkatha Freedom Party was to participate in the election, Gary 
Alfonso spoke to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on his call to 
the Zulus to vote, and the possibility that violence would now 
begin to decline. 
  [Begin recording] [Zwelithini] The king doesn't 
particpate in politics, in political party politics, so I don't 
think it would be good for a king to dictate to the people who 
must they vote for, and who must they not vote for, because I 
don't think by doing that, that wouldn't mean that the king now 
stands with other political parties. [sentence as heard] So I 
think the Zulus, as I know that they are affiliated in all 
different political aparties, so it's not the duty for the king, 
actually, to tell them who must they vote for, who must they not 
vote for. 
  [Alfonso] Your Majesty, do you think all people in 
South Africa, or most people in South Africa, the overwhelming 
majority now going to the polls and voting, do you think that's 
enough to stop the violence? 
  [Zwelithini] Actually, it's something that needs to be 
looked at. It's not the throne, or the Zul? throne, that has 
caused violence in this country. The king has been there as a 
symbol of unity of his people, so the king was very much 
surprised to see that people are killing each other because of 
their differences in politics. So now, as far as I am 
concerned, the tension that has been increasing in between the 
political parties needs to come down, especially from the 
followers themselves, because the political leaders have been 
pleading to the people to stop this violence. But it means to 
me that it has never been actually addressed so much to the 
grass-root level, because those are the people who need actually 
to be addressed and to be reminded about peaceful structures 
which need to be put in practise most of the time. So I hope 
that with the announcements today in kwaZulu-Natal, the violence 
that has erupted in this province, it needs to come to an end 
today, and tomorrow. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Office of the President of KwaZulu </F>
on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 19 April] 
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Central Committee 
decided at a meeting held on Sunday the 17th April 1994 that it 
would contest the elections at the national and provincial 
levels if amendments to the constitution could be made to secure 
the Kingdom of KwaZulu and the future role of His Majesty, the 
king of the Zulus as a constitutional monarch. 
  The decision of the Central Committee was further made 
conditional upon the final formulations for provisions for the 
existence of the Zulu Kingdom and the role of His Majesty being 
agreed to through mediation. 
  In a series of meetings which took place on Sunday, Monday 
and today final agreement was reached securing the Kingdom of 
KwaZulu and the role of His Majesty. I therefore am pleased to 
announce that the Inkatha Freedom Party will contest elections 
at the national and the provincial levels. 
  The entry of the IFP into national and regional levels will 
be made possible by suitable amendments to ballot papers and 
there will be certain relaxations to the procedures laid down 
for the registration of parties and the publication of electoral 
lists. I am pleased to announce that the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] and the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] have promised their full co-operation to make the 
IFP's entry into elections possible. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party has decided to make the kind of 
compromises which will make its entry into elections possible in 
order to avoid a great deal more bloodshed and carnage which we 
have been witness to in recent months. 
  Only the IFP held firm to principles right until the very 
last moment and did everything in its power to eliminate the 
very worst elements of the 1993 constitution. The best in the 
constitution can be attributed to the IFP's interventions and 
the long struggle it waged to ensure that the country benefited 
from a constitution which will lay the foundations for a 
democratic future. 
  Central to the IFP's concerns were the need to ensure viable 
regional government with the minimum interference by the state. 
It is to this end that the IFP finally managed to negotiate a 
secure role for His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the 
guarantee of the future existence of the Zulu Kingdom. 
  In securing these things the IFP has guaranteed that 
provincialism in the kwaZulu-Natal province will set standards 
which other provinces will be encouraged to adopt in their own 
search for their provincial constitutional futures. 
  The IFP had previously succeeded in securing amendments to 
the 1993 constitution which will enable provinces to adopt 
constitutions of their own choice. The IFP also secured the 
right of provinces to adopt constitutions which will not be 
confined by the structures laid down for provinces in the 1993 
constitution. 
  The IFP's negotiation victory in securing the role of His 
Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the continued existence 
of the Kingdom of kwaZulu is therefore a victory for the 
principle of self- determination from which the whole country 
will benefit. 
  I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Professor Washington 
Okumu for the role he played in making it possible to reach the 
agreement which will result in the IFP entering elections. He 
was an additional appointment as adviser to the international 
mediating team and remained on in South Africa when the other 
mediators left for their various international destinations. It 
was his personal intervention which made the final negotiation 
breakthrough possible. 
  When my spirits were down after the international mediation 
had been aborted, and I was leaving Johannesburg for Ulundi on 
Friday, April 15, I received a message at the airport from 
Professor Washington Okumu that he wanted to meet me at the 
airport and would be there in 20 minutes. 
  I have known Professor Okumu for more than 20 years having 
met him at a prayer breakfast in Washington and we have kept in 
touch on the basis of Christian fellowship. 
  I waited at Lanseria Airport for as long as I could on the 
morning of April 15th for Professor Okumu but as two of my 
colleagues had an appointment with His Majesty the king I had to 
leave. However, the aircraft has been air-borne for only a few 
minutes when I was told there was a problem and we had to turn 
back. 
  Fortunately Professor Okumu was still there and I said that 
it was as though God has prevented me from leaving, and I was 
there like Jonah brought back. I told Professor Okumu that my 
forced return was a God-send. 
  He insisted that everything should be done to try and see if 
lost mediation could be retrieved and that I should do 
everything I could to negotiate even at this late hour the IFP's 
participation in elections. 
  I shared with Professor Okumu the IFP's problems--the fact 
that the IFP took a decision not to participate because of its 
serious concerns regarding His Majesty the king which had not 
been met, and that I could not disregard that. If I did so, I 
would be committing treason. 
  Professor Okumu said that everything notwithstanding, he was 
going to see Mr Mandela, whom he has known a long time as well 
as President de Klerk. 
  I had hardly arrived back in Ulundi on Friday when Professor 
Okumu telephoned and said he had been in touch with the 
government who said they were quite prepared to look at the 
concerns I expressed. Professor Okumu was very firm and said I 
should telephone the state president at 3 o'clock that afternoon. 
  Before I did so, the state president telephoned and asked me 
what it was I wanted to say to him. I said that I gathered from 
Professor Okumu that he wanted to talk to me and I gave him the 
background. The state president told me that the issue of the 
IFP's participation was sympathetically looked at by the 
government. They were prepared to look at participation on a 
regional level but I told the state president that there was no 
way the IFP would participate at regional level only--the IFP 
had support all over South Africa. The state president said he 
was quite prepared to look at the possibilities. 
  I said the only way this could be done was if the issue of 
His Majesty the king was addressed. The state president said a 
special session of Parliament could be called to effect 
amendments to the 1993 constitution. I reminded the state 
president that His Majesty said he wanted matters dealt with 
before elections. 
  On Saturday Professor Okumu telephoned again. On Sunday we 
met in Durban where we both were attending the Jesus rally 
organised by Africa Enterprise. Professor Okumu gave me a draft 
of a proposed agreement which could be entered into between 
myself, the president of the ANC and the South African 
Government. The draft incorporated many of the answers to our 
needs and I gave my provisional approval to it. 
  Professor Okumu said he was flying to Cape Town to talk to 
Mr 
Mandela. I showed the draft to Mr Jacob Zuma and Minister Danie 
Schutte who were also at the rally, before I put it before the 
Central Committee&amp;because that is the way I exercise my 
leadership--referring all crucial matters to the Central 
Committee which is the final decision-making body between 
general conferences. 
  By arrangement with the state president I met him in 
Pretoria 
yesterday the 18th April. I was pleasantly surprised to find 
the draft agreement had been shown to Mr Mandela who said he 
wanted to study it for clarification. 
  After further negotiations the draft agreement with the 
necessary amendments was accepted by myself, Mr Mandela and Mr 
de Klerk. 
  I wish to pay tribute to Professor Okumu. He is a really 
remarkable man who studied under Dr Kissinger at Harvard. I pay 
tribute to the shuttle diplomacy he initiated and what has been 
achieved through it. 
  I wish also to pay tribute to both President FW de Klerk and 
Mr Mandela for the fact that they were receptive to the 
suggestions made to the three of us by Professor Okumu. 
  I believe that as a result of the signing of this memorandum 
of understanding, South Africa may well have been saved from 
disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions and has been 
put on a course which I hope will lead to longlasting peace, 
democracy and meaningful federalism.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP spokesman Dr. Ziba Jiyane by Leslie </F>
Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program in the Johannesburg studio -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] We are now being joined by Dr. Ziba 
Jiyane of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Good evening to you, 
Dr. Jiyane. 
  [Jiyane] Good evening to you, Leslie. 
  [Mashokwe] Many people are now happy with your 
participation. 
It almost presupposes that people were concerned about your 
exclusion? 
  [Jiyane] Yes, many thoughtful South Africans were concerned. 
But, indeed, God is able. We are now able to be in the election 
and give our people a chance to make a choice. 
  [Mashokwe] What happened? Why all this sudden change of 
heart? 
  [Jiyane] There are several reasons. Of course you know about 
the very special gentleman from Kenya who came here, who is a 
man of God, and who was able to relate to the chief minister and 
president of the IFP, and the president of the African National 
Congress, and you know we were just there on the brink, and we 
saw the abyss, and fortunately the last minute we all shrunk 
back. So many corpses would have gone by, people would have 
died, but we are Christians, and nobody would ever benefit from 
that, and I'm glad we shrunk back from the abyss. 
  [Mashokwe] What did he say to you that was so special. I 
mean, we talk here of a tough proposal that he presented to 
Inkatha and the ANC in Durban on Sunday. What was contained in 
it? 
  [Jiyane] Well, the draft proposal I've shown you at the 
beginning here, it contains a possibility of Parliament coming 
together to make an amendment that satisfies what his majesty, 
the king of the Zulus, has asked for -- that is, an entrenchment 
and protection for the kingdom, plus which says something 
definite about the constitutional issues that are outstanding, 
that they will be resolved through mediation after the election. 
But now, particularly the coming together of Parliament, and 
putting this in the constitution of 1993, was a major point that 
enabled us to say we could go in. 
  [Mashokwe] What is different that you were offered in 
Johannesburg as opposed to what was being offered at Skukuza, 
the Kruger National Park, a week or so ago? 
  [Jiyane] Well, at Skukuza obviously, for one thing, there 
was 
no agreement -- there wasn't. It merely actually frustrated the 
whole thing. The other side, I wouldn't mention which one, was 
reluctant to allow Parliament to come and make this on black and 
white in the constitution. That possibility was not there at 
Skukuza. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly what was so 
special today, because seemingly the positions of say the ANC 
and the government, vis-a-vis the proposal in Skukuza, has not 
changed. It's only the entrenchment of the writing in of this 
agreement about the king, that has changed the whole atmosphere? 
  [Jirs?] Yes, of course, but you remember, Leslie, that one 
of 
the fundamental problems of the whole process is lack of tr?st, 
given the animosity and the killings. Now because of this lack 
of trust, for example, we, the IFP, couldn't go in knowing that 
there was no assurance that after elections there would in fact 
be consideration to his majesty's call for the recognition of 
the Zulu kingdom. I mean commitments on paper without any legal 
commitment, something that would be justiciable in a court of 
law for example, and something that the whole world would say, 
if you renege on, you would be actually saying you're no longer 
for the rule of law. Now its a matter of trust that does not 
exist, that will be built over time. But at least this action 
of going to call Parliament goes a long way to assure us that we 
are not going to be taken for a ride. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, we're talking about say something like 
Article 54 here, because we've had now something like Article 
53, which entrenches self-determination in a way. What is 
different from that article? 
  [Jiyane] Well that principle, like all principles, is just a 
general principle. We were talking of a specific case of the 
Zulu kingdom with a lot of people in support of that view, and 
history behind us, which we needed to be there in the 
constitution, because if it was not there, there wasn't going to 
be a way of living in South Africa with the understanding that 
all the uniqueness of South Africa is taken into consideration. 
The Zulu kingdom is a special case. Even the president of the 
African National Congress has recognized this, but we knew 
because of the depth of feeling among Zulus, particularly in 
kwaZulu/Natal, that if that question was left unresolved after 
the constitution, because of this general principle, because for 
example there is no assurance that the issue of a volkstaat 
[homeland] will be resolved just because there is that 
principle. [sentence as heard] But on the question of the Zulu 
kingdom, we couldn't take a risk in terms of not committing 
people legally, you see, to the....[pauses] But of course we 
know that the greatest guarantee is not the legal and what [as 
heard]. It is the political muscle which we are going to show 
electorally, and the fact that the Zulu kingdom and the Zulu 
people will still be there after elections, and God forbid any 
politician who would try to play tricks with that. Of course 
they would be responsible. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you going to be able to persuade your 
followers to accept that you've now changed your mind, you're 
now into elections? Is it not too late? 
  [Jiyane] Well, our followers have been fighting for the 
interests that the IFP has articulated, plus the fact that 
because the IFP historically has the bulk of its membership in 
Zulu, the fact that the Zulu king, his majesty, had to be 
catered for. Now they have agreed. They will call Parliament. 
Everybody will see on the screens that they are going there to 
meet about the issue of his majesty, the Zulu king. Now anybody 
who didn't know--I mean, it would only be people who didn't know 
why we were out of elections. That was one of the important 
issues, and the other one--that is, the constitutional 
differences, will be addressed through mediation. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you going to accept the outcome of the 
elections without any hesitation. Won't you say you came in 
late, therefore you will not accept the outcome? 
  [Jiyane] Well, it's difficult for anybody to say they would 
accept the outcome of the elections unless they are asked: Will 
you accept the outcome of free and fair elections. 
  [Mashokwe] Will you call them free and fair? 
  [Jiyane] Well free and fair elections, yes. 
  [Mashokwe] No doubt? 
  [Jiyane] Why should there be doubt. But if they are not free 
and fair, no politician can say they will accept such. 
  [Mashokwe] In your region, in kwaZulu/Natal, you have not 
been electioneering; you have not being electioneering anywhere 
else. Is that not putting you in a disadvantage. Won't you use 
that as an excuse to say we fared badly because we were not 
electioneering? 
  [Jiyane] Well, you yourself know it wouldn't be an excuse; 
it's a fact. We know it now that we're at a huge disadvantage; 
we haven't educated our people as much as other people on voter 
education and we haven't had funds. I mean, we know all those 
disadvantages, but to us what counted more than anything was 
when we saw the (?possibility) of this abyss and the corpses 
that would go with it, and we said no we would not be held 
responsible, even if as a party we will suffer so many 
disadvantages. If we've saved lives, to us that was more 
important. 
  [Mashokwe] What about the fact that some cynics are saying 
you are going to disappear into oblivion come the 27th of April 
anyway? 
  [Jiyane] That's laughable. The Zulu nation would never 
disappear? 
  [Mashokwe] No, no, the politicians in kwaZulu at Ulundi. We 
have a new order coming into place, and you would disappear? 
  [Jiyane] Yes, those are people who think we are there 
because 
of kwaZulu government, as we always say the Zulu nation is 
there, irrespective of the Bantustan structure. In fact, we 
went there knowing it was an apartheid structure, but which we 
wanted to use to avert, to divert, the course of other Bantustan 
leaders who wanted to take independence. That's why we grafted 
in a legitimate Zulu kingdom structure there, and now if that 
goes, that doesn't mean that the people who deliberately with 
wide open eyes went into it to use it, and we've used it 
successfully to stop the apartheid system of separate 
development and negotiations, and the (?tricameral) constitution 
without Mandela, and so on and so forth. Now if that goes, that 
does not mean that the people of that area will go. They will be 
there, and they have a king. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, talk to me about this Zulu kingdom. 
If it comes into being, does that assure Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi of a position as premier or adviser to the king, as he 
is now? 
  [Jiyane] Well, that's the wrong way to ask the question, 
because this is a problem even with the king. The problem is 
not ?positions and assurances; the problem is the kingdom of 
kwaZulu, a historical reality. Now Chief Buthelezi, our leader, 
is the president of the IFP; he is a politician, a hardbitten 
politician, and that's why he is going through an election, 
which you know, ironically, Leslie, people have said we are 
afraid, we are afraid of elections, but very few politicians 
would have been as brave as Dr. Buthelezi, to go into an 
election with so few days. I mean such a short time, They will 
be scared, but he's not scared because the support is there. So 
he depends on that, he has the support and he's not scared of 
elections. Few politicians would take that as he has done. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, thanks for your time and for talking 
to us.

Desmond Tutu said on Tuesday [19 April] the sun was shining over 
South Africa at news the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] would take 
part in the elections. "It is just like a dream. I am just 
over the moon. This new dawn was going to be one that was 
overcast but now the sun is shining," he said in a statement 
from Cape Town. "We are not going to cease giving thanks to 
God. We have a God of surprises, who performs miracles all the 
time."

  [Text] The historic agreement paving the way for the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the elections has 
been widely acclaimed both locally and internationally, and Dr. 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi received a hero's welcome on his return to 
Ulundi. He was welcomed at the airport by cabinet ministers, 
members of the legislative assembly, tribal leaders and 
thousands of IFP supporters. In Durban hundreds of IFP 
supporters gathered at the party's information office in a 
festive mood last night to celebrate the decision. 
  American President Bill Clinton welcomed the agreement, 
reconfirmed his support for South Africa during the transition 
period. He said South Africa had potential to reverse the world 
trend to toward greater ethnic division by establishing a 
powerful model for democratic reform and national 
reconciliation. The UN Security Council welcomed the agreement, 
and Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said he was thrilled. 
  The South African Chamber of Business [SACOB] says the IFP's 
decision to participate is a significant development for the 
economy. SACOB said the inclusivity would encourage foreign and 
domestic perceptions of stability in the country.

  [Text] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says that 
despite the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to take part 
in the election, conflict between Zulus and Xhosas is 
inevitable, which will cause South Africa to become another 
Rwanda. The organization said it was not surprised at what it 
called the Zulu leadership's pathetic capitulation to the 
Xhosa-led ANC in view of its betrayal by the government.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- There will be no mass 
action by the Witwatersrand branch of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] Youth Brigade in central Johannesburg until after the 
election, Branch Publicity Secretary Mandlakayise Magubane said 
on Tuesday [19 April] night. 
  Speaking after a meeting of the group's leaders in 
Johannesburg, he said the organisation would now dedicate itself 
to campaigning for the election "right up to the last minute". 
"Although we are not happy with the fact that the poll date 
will not be postponed, we are going to do our best to win the 
election," he said. 
  He appealed to all former IFP supporters who had joined 
other 
political parties "just so they could take part in the voting 
process" to come back into the IFP fold. 
  Businessmen and workers in central Johannesburg have been 
concerned since last week that there would be an IFP march 
though the centre of Johannesburg coupled with stayaways 
threatened by the Youth Brigade. "We have stopped all rolling 
mass action to concentrate on the election," Mr Magubane said.

<F P=106> [By Jono Waters] </F>
  [Excerpts] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- At least five 
people were killed and more than 40 were injured in running 
battles between hostel dwellers and Thokoza township residents 
on Tuesday [19 April]. But by mid-afternoon calm had returned 
to the strife-torn East Rand township as the SA [South African] 
Defence Force [SADF] helped the National Peacekeeping Force 
[NPKF] restore order. 
  In the morning, groups of African National Congress 
supporters, some armed and others waving party posters, led 
several charges on the hostel but were rebuffed by handgun and 
automatic fire. SAPA reporters on the scene saw at least five 
vehicles ferry wounded victims to Natalspruit Hospital. 
  Hospital officials told SAPA that by 6PM five people had 
died. Police said four people had been killed and reported on 
Tuesday morning they had found the bodies of two people in East 
Rand townships. 
  Wits Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said the army was 
lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the NPKF's 
request. At least a dozen SADF troop carriers rolled down lower 
Khumalo Street -- the centre of Tuesday's fighting near the 
"Angola" Hostel -- around lunchtime. [passage omitted] 
  Referring to the IFP's decision to participate in the 
election, Mr [Tokyo] Sexwale [ANC official] said it was 
regrettable that only after all the deaths in East Rand 
townships, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had 
finally "capitulated". Mr Sexwale said he did not think 
violence would end instantly. "He (Mr Buthelezi) started 
something that will take a long time to control." 
  He also accused Mr Buthelezi of misleading the Zulu people 
by 
telling them they could now participate in the elections after 
maintaining the opposite for so long. Hostel dwellers should 
take note of that. 
  Mr Sexwale vowed to turn the hostels into family units. 
"There is seven days left and then we will come to power and 
turn them into places where human beings can live." 
  After his address late on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Sexwale went 
to the NPKF headquarters in Thokoza to put forward the ANC's 
demands. After more than two hours of negotiations with NPKF 
officials he addressed about 300 residents, calling on them to 
support the peacekeeping force in the township. 
  The IFP -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- had 
called for the NPKF's withdrawal from the East Rand townships by 
5PM on Tuesday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- African National 
Congress PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] leader Tokyo 
Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] strongly criticised the National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] commander in Thokoza, Col Quinton 
Painter. 
  Addressing journalists at the NPKF's Thokoza base camp, 
after 
a day of raging gun battles between hostel dwellers and 
residents in the East Rand township, Mr Sexwale said Col Painter 
was restraining the unit from effectively keeping the peace. 
"He is restricting them to patrols and when they are shot at 
they are not allowed to return fire." 
  Officers and troops were frustrated, he said. They disarmed 
many township residents and wished to do the same in the hostels 
but were prevented from doing so by their commanding officer, 
who was operating under the direction of someone above him in 
the NPKF. NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said he would 
respond to Mr Sexwale's allegations when he had gained more 
information about the matter. 
  Both the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the NPKF 
were 
deployed on Tuesday in an attempt to quell the latest violence 
on the East Rand. "We came here to look at the situation, to 
talk to the people and to find out from the NPKF what the 
essence of the problem was. We learned from their officers they 
are operating under extreme difficulties which makes it very 
difficult for them to execute their tasks," said Mr Sexwale. 
  The force had not been deployed in the same numbers as its 
SADF counterpart, he said. The army had operated in Thokoza 
with 2,500 men, while the NPKF had only 1,000 in the area. Two 
battalions at De Brug, the NPKF base in Bloemfontein, were 
supposed to be in Thokoza. Mr Sexwale said the peacekeeping 
force's equipment was of an inferior standard and it had fewer 
vehicles. 
  The SADF had pulled out of Thokoza without providing the 
NPKF 
with information about flashpoints and areas that needed 
patrolling. "They have had to learn as they go along," said Mr 
Sexwale. 
  The controversial SA Police Internal Stability Unit had been 
redeployed in Thokoza without the NPKF being informed and "a 
very volatile atmosphere exists between the various security 
forces". 
  Mr Sexwale said a structure had been established for contact 
between the NPKF and the community to build up confidence in the 
force. 
  Asked whether the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] late entry 
into the election race would help defuse the tension in Thokoza, 
Mr Sexwale said: "We want the elections to take place on the 
East Rand and we are very happy (IFP leader) Mr (Mangosuthu) 
Buthelezi capitulated from his stubborn position of not letting 
people vote. But he has left a terrible legacy of hate between 
residents and hostel dwellers." 
  The ANC would be working closely with the IFP to pacify the 
situation so that "our members and their members can vote". He 
urged Thokoza residents to support the NPKF as its job was to 
ensure the election took place.

<F P=106> [Statement by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 20 </F>
April] 
  [Text] ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
region premier-elect Tokyo Sexwale and two officials, Paul 
Mashatile -- secretary general and Obed Bapela -- deputy 
secretary general, came under heavy gunfire today, Tuesday, 19 
April, after addressing residents at the National Peacekeeping 
Force (NPKF) base in Thokoza. 
  Sexwale had earlier led a delegation of ANC PWV regional 
leaders and local leadership of Thokoza on a fact-finding 
mission and to address residents of the trouble-torn township. 
After addressing residents at about 16h00, the entourage moved 
to the NPKF base to verify residents allegations that the 
force's image was no longer credible. 
  The entourage, led by Mr Sexwale held a meeting with the 
second in command of the force and discussed the problems raised 
by the community. Soon thereafter, Mr Sexwale addressed 
residents inside the base and seconds after this address, heavy 
gun-fire was heard from the direction of the hostel next to the 
base. Officials, including Mr Sexwale, were forced to take 
cover and swiftly went to their cars to get out of the area. 
  The ANC PWV region condemns this senseless attacks on its 
leadership, whose sole purpose in the area was to difuse the 
volatile situation in the area. Our visit in the area was also 
to call for joint co-operation of forces now in the area -- SADF 
[South African Defense Force] and NPKF -- and to listen to the 
grievances of both the community and the NPKF personnel. 
  The ANC will pursue, with all means at its disposal, to find 
resolution to the carnage that has engulfed the area and to 
ensure that free and fair elections takes place. 
  The ANC PWV region will release a statement tomorrow, 20 
April 1994, on its plans and intervention to stop the carnage in 
the East Rand.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- Thokoza was quiet on 
Wednesday [20 April] morning following two days of violence 
between residents of the East Rand township and hostel dwellers. 
  An National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] spokesman said there 
had been no shooting overnight. Five people died and more than 
40 were wounded in Tuesday's running battles between the two 
groups. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], which demanded the 
withdrawal of the NPKF by 5 PM on Tuesday, was sticking to their 
demand despite the political settlement reached on Tuesday for 
the IFP's participation in next week's election. 
  IFP Transvaal Political Director Themba Khoza said the NPKF 
must be removed "as quickly as possible" and replaced with the 
Internal Stability Unit. "This is a confrontational situation, 
they definitely have to remove the NPKF." 
  The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday 
cancelled their planned "Operation Access" tour of East Rand 
townships "due to the excessive violence and unrest". The IEC 
established "Operation Access" to help those parties promote 
their election manifestos in townships that feel they cannot 
campaign freely.

  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] has denied 
reports that it is confined to barracks in Thokoza on the East 
Rand, but defense force troops are still in the township. An 
NPKF spokesman said the defense force had not assumed the role 
of the peacekeeping troops. The area is reported to be quiet 
today after yesterday's fierce gun battles between hostel 
dwellers and self- defense units. Five people were killed and 
about 40 wounded. 
  Earlier the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] repeated its demand 
that the peacekeeping force should be replaced by the Internal 
Stability Unit as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the police are 
investigating reports that NPKF troops fired on police officers 
in Thokoza.

<F P=106> [Report by D. Isaacson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The National Party 
[NP] could enter into a post election alliance with two parties 
to gain control of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha said 
on Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, he said the 
NP stood a good chance of winning the region on its own or 
through an alliance with two parties which had similar policies. 
Mr Botha declined to name the parties, saying it would be 
improper to do so because they were presently opponents. 
  NP PWV premier designate Oulaas van Zyl said he had received 
a report by a reputable company showing the African National 
Congress' support in the region had dropped to less than 50 
percent. 
  If the ANC and Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] received less 
than 50 percent combined, the NP and other parties would work 
together anyway, he added. 
  Mr van Zyl dismissed reports that Johannesburg's old city 
council offices would house the new regional parliament, saying 
the venue would be decided after proper investigation. Minister 
of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer added Soweto as a 
possibility. 
  Mr Botha suggested PWV was not a sufficiently romantic name 
for a province, and suggested the new region be entitled 
Transvaal. 
  Mr Meyer highlighted the importance of the province, saying 
it was the financial powerhouse of South Africa which, in turn, 
was the powerhouse of Africa.

  [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] on Tuesday [19 April] reaffirmed its 
decision not to take part in next week's election, AVF leader Dr 
Ferdi Hartzenberg said in a statement. This final decision was 
taken at an AVF executive board meeting in Pretoria. 
  In a separate statement the AVF said it was surprised at the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to take part in the April 26 to 
28 poll. 
  The AVF called for an indefinite postponement of the 
election 
until a proper and inclusive solution was found. Dr Hartzenberg 
said the AVF had been unable to reach agreement with the Freedom 
Front on participation in the election and called on AVF 
supporters not to vote.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Thomson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Nineteen parties 
contesting next week's elections on Tuesday [19 April] handed a 
memorandum to the European Community's election unit in 
Johannesburg, requesting election campaign funds allocated by 
the EEC be provided directly to them and not through the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. 
  The request was made after a proposal tabled by the Federal 
Party at a meeting of the IEC's party liaison committee on 
Tuesday morning was carried by 14 votes to five. The proposal 
was that the EEC be approached to distribute the funds among the 
parties "in an equal manner". 
  A joint statement by the 19 parties said: "Due to the time 
constraints between now and the elections we feel an urgent 
decision on this matter is needed to ensure free and fair 
elections and a multiparty democracy." 
  The parties are the South African Women's Party, Green 
Party, 
Western Cape Federalist Party, Islamic Party, Africa Muslim 
Party, African Democratic Movement, Workers International, 
African Moderates Congress Party, Federal Party, Merit Party, 
Workers List Party, Right Party, Ximoko Progressive Party, 
Soccer Party, Luso-South African Party, Minority Front, United 
People's Front, Dikwankwetla Party and Women's Rights Peace 
Party. 
  South African Women's Party leader Sue Millard told SAPA: 
"The way in which the state electoral fund is administered 
completely sidelines the smaller parties and is not in the 
interests of the public. "The required signatures and opinion 
polls (required to qualify for funds) are not ideal ways of 
determining support. For example, a lot of people have to deal 
with intimidation." 
  Ms Millard said most of the parties opposing the proposal 
were those with ample funds, and it was clear who they were.

  [Text] The deposed leader of the Islamic Party, [IP], Dr. 
Abdulah Gamieldien, has announced his resignation from the 
party. Dr. Gamieldien, who was ordered by the Cape Town Supreme 
Court last week to repay election funds, said he had decided to 
hold onto the funds until the IP's leadership problems had been 
resolved. He told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news it was his intention to hand over the funds to a 
properly functioning body and not to a party that was in 
disarray. Dr. Gamieldien said he would not vote in the coming 
election and called on Muslims to think carefully before voting 
for a Muslim-oriented party.

<F P=106> [By Mark Gevisser] </F>
  [Text] Pigs in police-hats, Hernus Kriel with a 
Pinocchio-nose, Winnie Mandela blown up big. The National Party 
[NP, Nats] asks blacks if they could look a doe-eyed rape-victim 
"in the eye and tell her you're giving a rapist the vote?" The 
Democratic Party [DP] asks coloureds if they could look a 
steely-eyed Helen Suzman "in the eye and say you're voting for 
the Nats?" "A better life for all"; "Be sure of a better life"; 
"Jobs, peace, freedom" -- hype, hype, hype. 
  Look beyond the pig in the hat, though, and you'll find 
intricately devised campaigns. Millions have been spent by the 
ANC, NP and DP on print and radio advertisement. If it's hype, 
it's carefully managed. On the surface, the strategies 
governing the campaigns are: 

  -  The ANC wishes to assure potential voters that it is well- 
prepared to assume government, and that current NP policies have 
bankrupted the country and plunged it into violence: "We cannot 
afford more of this." 
  -  The NP wishes to make it clear that is has "made the change" 
to 
being truly multiracial and that black voters, too, have made 
the change and have come on board to support it. 
  -  The DP wishes to emphasise that it alone can be entrusted 
with 
providing effective opposition to an ANC-led government; that 
the NP and the ANC, both corrupt, are in cahoots, and that only 
the DP can protect South Africans "from the abuse of power". 

    You could call the ANC's campaign dry, the NP's campaign 
dirty, and the DP's campaign elitist. But none of this is 
unintentional. This is advertising -- applied psychology. The 
parties are products that need to be sold. Behind these surface 
images and words, there are a whole lot of subliminal messages 
and unspoken assumptions. And there are mounds and mounds of 
research. To begin with, both ANC and the NP have determined 
that the other is the only serious contender. And so, even 
though the DP's campaign is clever, witty and intentionally 
strident to dispel the party's namby-pamby image, it has been 
all but ignored by the two major players. 
  As in all ad campaigns, there are carefully-planned phases. 
The ANC's first phase, last year, was the people's forums, to 
give the impression of wide consultation. Then there was the 
"Our Plan" phase, which laid out, in simple terms, the basic 
tenets of the party's Reconstruction and Development Programme, 
accompanied by poetic-images of roses growing out of barbed wire 
or microphones attached to mops. Then there was the "contrast" 
phase, where the ANC compared its plan for the future with 
current NP government policy, accompanied this time by gritty 
snapshots of unemployed men and weeping women. The ANC is now 
moving into a "reassurance" phase: expect to see many 
comforting images of Nelson Mandela in the last week of the 
campaign. Strikingly absent from the ANC campaign has been 
hard-hitting negativity: no archival photos dredged up of 
Sharpeville or Soweto, or forced removals from District Six or 
Sophiatown. "It would be patronising to tell black South 
Africans that they've had a bad life under apartheid," says Ken 
Modise, responsible for the ANC account at Applied Marketing and 
Communications (AM&amp;C), a division of Hunt Lascaris. "They 
don't 
need to be reminded." 
  ANC media man Joel Netshitenzhe gives another reason: "We 
have to acknowledge that the National Party has been successful 
in presenting itself as a transformed multiracial party. F.W. 
is not P.W.. So rather than going back to the evils of 
apartheid, we have to show that, even now, under the new 
transformed F.W., policies still discriminate against black 
people." 
  Modise notes that "everybody knows the ANC was a highly 
effective liberation movement. But will it be an effective 
government? South Africans look to the ANC as the incumbent. 
We had to be substantial; we had to be serious, to show people 
that we had the where-withal to govern." 
  Eldad Louw is Modise's counterpart at the NP's ad agency, 
Optimum (a division of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi). He believes that 
by 
mounting "a campaign of promises", the ANC dug itself into a 
difficult ditch. "Our research showed that there came a point 
when people could no longer believe all the ANC's promises; that 
they said, "that's very nice, but can they deliver?" 
  Enter the NP, setting out with the avowed intention of 
proving to voters -- and particularly black voters -- that the 
ANC is not capable of governing. "What we would have liked to 
say," says Paris Pitsilledes, a member of the Optimum team, "is 
the following: 'Look how good life was for the whites, now you 
can take part in it as well.'" As one NP ad puts it; "South 
Africa works, so why change it?" 
  From the very beginning of its campaign, the NP targeted 
African voters. This presented the party -- and its advertisers 
-- with a problem: "We treat the party as a product," says 
Pitsilledes. "And in the eye of the consumer, this particular 
product had a major fault. So we had to go about changing 
perceptions of it." This meant -- in blunt terms -- blackening 
it up. 
  Given that the NP cannot organise effectively in black areas 
because of intimidation, advertising has assumed an immense 
significance. Just as De Klerk's staged events with traditional 
leaders and cheering black NP supporters were calculated to beam 
the message into the living-rooms of unsure black voters, that 
there are black NP supporters, the NP's advertising campaign -- 
particularly its latest series of straight-talk endorsements 
from black NP members -- is calculated, according to Louw, to 
show potential supporters that "they are not alone, that there 
are others who feel the same way as they do." 
  Pitsilledes says: "We've been knocked for taking the 
emotional approach, but advertising is not about logic, it's 
about emotion". Precisely because the ANC is making an 
emotionally-charged call for the allegiance of black voters, "we 
have to take the emotional approach to negate this". And so, in 
an NP ad, one finds the textbook hear-tug image: the chubby 
soft-focus shot of a cute beribboned girl: "Vote ANC. And 
break her heart." Other NP ads, however, demand serious 
attention and have come in for fiery criticism. 
  Like the ad, flighted last week, showing slain Inkatha 
supporters outside ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, above a 
quote from THE SOWETAN saying: "We are sick and tired of the 
cynical use of ordinary folk who are also misinformed about the 
real causes for marches, for rallies and for the politics of 
today." Or like the series of ads attacking the ANC and the 
DP's call to give prisoners the vote. Most controversial was 
the ad featuring an identikit of the Station Strangler: "Can 
you imagine the Cape Strangler having the vote? The ANC and DP 
can." 
  The ANC and DP attacked it as playing on the racist fears of 
coloured people, because the identikit is of a man more black 
than brown, but NP executive director Olaus van Zyl rejects this 
outright: "It wouldn't matter if the strangler was blue or 
white! He's a strangler! A murderer! The issue is, should he 
have the vote?" 
  Racist or not, Pitsilledes said the ad had immense effect 
among coloureds in the Western Cape, at whom it was targeted. 
And he answers criticism that it was cynical and manipulative 
by saying: "So what? It worked." 
  Therein lies a major difference of style between the two 
teams doing the ANC and NP campaigns. While Pitsilledes talks 
of selling a product, for example, AM&amp;C copywriter Steve Shaw 
highmindedly explains why the ANC has not used catchy jingles -- 
as the NP has -- in its radio advertisements: "We're not 
selling dish-washing detergents, we're talking about the future 
of this country." 
  There's a moral righteousness to the team at AM&amp;C; talk 
of 
"nation-building" abounds. Down the road at Optimum, however, 
the mood is hard-boiled: "Sure, the ANC campaign is efficient," 
says Louw. "But we're looking for effectiveness." 
  Their respective attitudes reproduce, almost exactly, the 
moods of the campaigns they are working for. Van Zyl goes out 
of his way to show that the NP campaign is not a negative one, 
citing research figures that show that black people do not go 
for negative campaigning. According, to Van Zyl, the NP's 
"sheep in wolf's clothing" ad, which hit the ANC on the number 
of communists on its list, did not go down well among black 
voters. Nevertheless, the reality is the NP is the challenger 
in this campaign and, as the challenger, it has mounted a far 
more robust and strident attack against the ANC than vice-versa. 
  Whether this tactic has worked will only be known after the 
elections. One thing is certain, though: all three parties' 
professional and fine-tuned campaigns will change South African 
electoral politics for ever. For better or for worse, commerce 
has become an integral and indivisible part of election 
campaigning.

<F P=106> [Full-page advertisments by the National Party accompanied </F>
by large photos of the people being quoted] 
  [Text][First advertisement] I'm a car mechanic and I'm 
voting National Party [NP]. 
  My name is Darius Mokori, I am a car mechanic and I am going 
to vote for the National Party. 
  So are hundreds of other young, self-employed people like 
me, 
who are struggling to keep their small businesses going. 
  I work with my brother Aron, who is also going to vote NP -- 
and we specialise in panel beating and respray jobs. 
  I worked for other people for 14 years -- mostly in big 
garages -- and I saw the damage that the ANC and their friends 
do to businesses, particularly the car business. There were 
strikes and stay aways and sanctions -- and now hardly any cars 
are made in this country, and many good repairing firms have 
gone out of business. 
  Finally I was made redundant last year and I decided to set 
up on my own. It is a struggle -- but I know it will be easier 
for me if the NP win, than if the ANC do. 
  You see, the NP believe in business -- the ANC do not. 
  The NP want people to succeed -- because that way they will 
make money and jobs for people and then we can all afford the 
things this country needs -- like schools and hospitals. 
  The ANC do not want people to be successful -- they want 
strikes and stay-aways. If you make any money, they will want 
try to take it away from you with heavy taxes. They will be 
corrupt like the rest of Africa. 
  The fact is they are not ready for power. They are promising 
too much -- and they know they can't deliver. And they are 
trying to bully people and force everyone into line. Step out 
of line and they persecute you and threaten you and beat you up. 
  I know hundreds of people who are going to vote for the NP, 
but are just too scared to say so. As soon as the comrades find 
out, they approach you in the street and say they will necklace 
you. 
  But the vote is secret -- so threats won't stop us voting 
for 
the NP. 
  I have big dreams for the future. I want to educate myself 
more. I want to study more about paint technology. I want to 
build up my business. These are the sort of dreams many young 
men have for the future. 
  So I ask myself: Who is best for education -- the NP who 
will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it for black 
people? 
  And I ask myself: Who is best for business -- the NP who 
will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it? 
  The only answer I can come up with to help me make my dreams 
come true -- is the NP. 
  BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE 
  Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party 
  We've made the change 
  [Second advertisement]I am a teacher and I'm voting National 
Party. 
  My name is Winnie and I'm going to vote for the National 
Party. So are hundreds of other black teachers like me. We 
will not be intimidated. 
  Now we have the vote, we must put aside the past, and vote 
on 
one thing: Who will give us -- all of us -- the best future? 
  The answer is the NP. 
  I am a mother of two young boys; and like all mothers, I 
wonder what the future will bring for them. 
  I know for certain that their future will be a lot better 
under the National Party, than it ever would be under the ANC. 
  Only the NP has the strength and experience to run the 
country. The ANC can't. They just don't have the experience. 
  I have been teaching in a High School in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region for 17 years and, in that 
time I have seen the ANC and their friends destroy the education 
of a whole generation of township children. 
  It makes me so angry, because children are the future of 
this 
country. 
  The ANC are promising that everyone will have free education 
-- but how on earth are they going to afford it? They have no 
hope of delivering on their promises. 
  The NP has a proper plan to get the money to build factories 
and businesses, so that the jobs will come -- and then we will 
be able to build the schools and hospitals we need. 
  That way ALL our children will get the best affordable 
education, and we will be able to make the most of their gifts. 
  Also the ANC don't understand democracy -- to them there is 
only their point of view. No one else is allowed an opinion. 
They are autocrats. 
  I try to teach my children to think for themselves. This is 
vital if we are to have a proper democracy in this country. 
  A lot of people say that their hearts are telling them to 
vote for the ANC. I tell them that their hearts are for 
emotion. This election is not about emotion. It is about the 
future, our future. Our children's future. 
  And only one party can deliver that: The NP. 
  BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE 
  Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party 
  We've made the change.

<H5>  I am a pensioner and I'm voting National Party. </H5>
  My name is Molly Mndungwana. I'm a grandmother, and I'm 
going to vote for the National Party. 
  The ANC's thugs threatened to burn my house down; but 
nothing 
will stop me -- or hundreds like me -- from voting NP. 
  I have three very good reasons: 
  First, my husband and I are on sickness pensions. 
  With the NP I feel my pension is safe; but I wouldn't trust 
the ANC. They promise everything to everyone. But where is the 
money coming from? They will run out of money -- then where 
will my pension be? 
  Second, my son was stabbed to death in the street in 1987. I 
believe the violence in the townships has been encouraged by the 
ANC. 
  So if we vote for them I am sure the violence will get 
worse. 
  But if we vote for the NP, then the violence will get 
better. 
They believe in the law. 
  Third, because of my son's death, I am bringing up his two 
children who are 9 and 10 years old. 
  We live in a small two room house, and we all sleep in one 
room. We would like another room -- and, in a few years, the 
children will need houses too. 
  The ANC promise houses for everyone. But where's the money 
coming from? They won't have the money. 
  I'm much more likely to get my extra room, if I vote for the 
NP. And my grandchildren are much more likely to get a house too. 
  Mr. de Klerk tells the truth. He has a plan to make the 
country rich -- so we can afford the houses and to make our 
streets look nice. 
  He has the experience and the strength. He will not run out 
of money. 
  The ANC is full of ideas and dreams -- but they have no 
experience. 
  The National Party has changed. Now we have the new NP and 
its got everyone in it of all colours. Mr. de Klerk is working 
for all of us. He is listening to all of us. 
  And the ANC can't bear it. They deny it. But it is true. 
They just want to kill people who disagree. 
  They came to me and said they were going to burn my house 
down. Let them kill me. 
  There will always be someone else who stands up for the NP 
-- 
then they will have to kill them too. How can you vote for a 
party like that? 
  But you can vote for the NP. I know you will be safe with 
them. 
  I shall be at the polling station on the 27th with a badge 
with Mr. de Klerk's face on it. So everyone will know who I'm 
voting for. 
  BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE 
  Vote for F.W. de Klerk and the New National Party 
  We've made the change 
[Second ad] 
<H5>  I was with the unions, now I'm with the National Party. </H5>
  My name is Honest Shamase and I, like many other workers, 
will be voting National Party. 
  From 1986, I was strongly involved in COSATU'S [Congress of 
South African Trade Unions] activities. My task as a shop 
steward at Pep Stores was to represent the workers when they had 
a problem with management. I used to negotiate with management 
to reinstate those members that were fired or whatsoever. 
  My other task was to organise for strikes, boycotts or 
whatever was needed. I was also in support committees which 
helped to organise strikes at other companies. 
  After 2nd February 1990, after the State President announced 
that apartheid was no longer, that each and every one was free 
in South Africa, I thought it wasn't necessary for us to keep on 
striking, boycotting and so on. I thought now was the time to 
sit and negotiate with all parties involved. 
  What I didn't like about COSATU was that they used to call 
boycotts and strikes, especially when the ANC and the Government 
were in dispute. So whenever the ANC was not satisfied with 
Government they used to use the workers to protest against them. 
  But the ANC never asked the workers if they would support 
that boycott or stay-away. 
  And that action has cost millions of workers their jobs. 
They ended up in the street. So, I didn't like that action. 
  And then in 1993, at a COSATU special congress in Soweto, 
Mandela was addressing the workers, in fact, not addressing the 
workers but telling them to vote for the ANC. I didn't like 
that because not all the members of COSATU were ANC members, but 
we were being forced to vote ANC. The workers too should be 
free to vote for who they want. 
  As soon as I walked out of that meeting I went straight to 
the National Party and joined them. Since then, I've recruited 
many COSATU members to the NP and they were very willing to join 
because they also disliked the way the ANC was using them. It 
is the workers who suffer when their employers deduct from their 
salaries or fire them for not coming to work. But all this time 
Jay Naidoo is sitting in his office, doing his work, getting his 
salary, you know. 
  We can see that foreign investors don't like communists so 
we 
should not vote ANC. The NP is the only party that can create 
the economy to provide jobs. Even after the election we will 
still need to work to support our families, to give our children 
education, to pay our bonds and so on. 
  I have always looked after the workers and I can tell them 
now that voting NP is in their interest. 
  BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE 
  Vote for F.W. de Klerk and the New National Party 
  We've made the change

<H5>  After April 27 there will be something more important than </H5>
the ANC government. You. 
  The time for casting blame is over. 
  Now, more than ever, it is the responsibility of every 
person 
and every organisation -- including the ANC -- to ensure that we 
put an end to violence and get on with building a nation. 
  Our plan for a better life for all gives hope because it 
puts 
people first. It will create jobs, give every child 10 years of 
free, quality education, and provide the homes and 
infrastructure our people and country need. 
  The ANC wants you to feel secure in your rights. To feel 
free to express your views. To be secure in your homes. To be 
confident about the quality of education and the flourishing of 
your language and culture. 
  Above all, the ANC wants every South African to know that 
all 
our children will have the opportunity to realise their 
God-given potential, secure in family life in a peaceful and 
thriving society. 
  On April 27, use your vote to elect a government that is 
ready to take responsibility for the task ahead. 
  Let our respect and concern for one another be the very 
thing 
that pulls us together, so that we can at last work together as 
one nation. Then we will surely realise our goal of a better 
life for all." 
  A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and 
freedom.

<H5>  WHEN THE NATS GET INTO BED WITH THE ANC, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS </H5>
TO YOU? 
  We know what you're thinking. The "new" Nats [National Party 
members] would never get into bed with the ANC, right? 
  Wrong. Because if you read on, you'll see that the Nats have 
already become the ANC's junior partners. 
  After the rioting in Johannesburg two weeks ago, FW de 
Klerk's government gave in to an outrageous ANC request not to 
search their headquarters. (This means the people who shot 
protesters, or perhaps innocent bystanders, from this building 
may never be identified.) 
  In the past few months the NP and ANC also agreed to keep 
Detention without Trail. 
  And their deals go back even further than this. 
  At negotiations last year, the Nats even caved in on the 
issue of Federalism, so we're now faced with a possible civil 
war. 
  These examples all show one thing: you can't trust FW and 
his 
"new" Nats to be an effective opposition. 
  Make no mistake, if you want your rights and interests to be 
protected after the election, you'll need a party that will 
stand up to the ANC, not give in to them. 
  So vote for the Democratic Party. 
  Then when the ANC and the Nats get into bed together, you 
won't have to take it lying down." 
  DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER.

<H5>  We've done our duty. </H5>
  One week ago to the day, after weeks of exhaustive 
negotiations, the IFP and the ANC agreed on the terms of 
reference for international mediation. It was a solemn contract 
between us and was submitted to the mediators. 
  On the basis of this, some of the most eminent men in the 
world arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, to start mediation the 
following day. 
  The ANC however, tore up the Sunday agreement which had been 
made by national chairman Mr Thabo Mbeki. If the ANC can tear 
up a covenant like that, what value can be attached to its word? 
  Our fellow South Africans, we know you will now understand 
why we cannot accept the ANC's word and why we insist that your 
rights can only be safeguarded in cast-iron constitutional 
guarantees. 
  We negotiated in good faith for more than 15 long years 
before the National Party recognised the wrongness of its ways 
and decided to break with apartheid. We have done so since 
February 2 1990. 
  The ANC showed bad faith at CODESA and then held the country 
to ransom through violent mass action. The Government buckled 
and has negotiated in bad faith in the Multi-Party Negotiating 
Forum. It is this that has brought our country to the brink of 
disaster.

  Peace can only come as a result of repentance, forgiveness

  The ACDP believes in government by the people, so that 
individuals and communities can take charge of their own lives. 
Local government should enjoy real power over all aspects of 
public responsibility. Social services should be funded by the 
State and the Region, but THEY MUST BE CONTROLLED BY THE 
COMMUNITY. For the first time communities should be given the 
authority to prioritise their own needs, without State 
interference. This is real empowerment of the people. 
  The ACDP believes that via local referendums, you should be 
able to vote regularly on a single issue, without having to wait 
for five years for another election. YOU should decide whether 
you want to build schools, clinics, houses or training centres. 
YOU should decide on job creation priorities. 
  YOU should be able to decide your own future, without having 
self appointed leaders thrust upon you. Too much power leads to 
corruption. Vote for yourself. Vote ACDP. It's time for 
Christians to stand up and be counted.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Monday [18 April] established a Public Service 
Forum to ease civil servants into post-election administrations. 
  Members of the TEC's management committee made the 
announcement after a day long meeting with public servants from 
central government, the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, 
Ciskei] states and the self-governing territories. Public 
sector unions were also represented. 
  The forum was formed to "ensure that in all matters relating 
to the public service during the transition period there will be 
transparency, consultation and employee participation". The 
forum would deal with issues like promotions, pensions and 
salary parity, TEC Management Committee Member Pravin Gordhan 
said. 
  He was speaking after a plenary session which followed 11 
separate meetings of public sector workers in Pretoria. The 
meetings were held following continuing discontent among public 
sector workers, in particular in the homelands where vital 
sectors of public service provision have broken down by striking 
workers demanding their pensions and job security in future 
administrative arrangements. 
  The TEC's task force on the public service, comprising trade 
unionist Philip Dexter and Administration Minister Sam de Beer, 
was mandated to attend to a number of issues in which disputes 
have arisen, among them the threatened breakdown in health 
services and outstanding allowances. 
  The forum will meet for the first time on Wednesday this 
week. 
  Speaking after the plenary session, Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the reorganisation of 
South Africa's civil service structure was going to require hard 
work. "The transition is going to require rationalisation of 
the various administrations into one central and nine provincial 
governments. It is going to require good management. We all have 
to work hard to achieve these goals," Mr Meyer said. 
  He said the TEC was the one body that was in a position to 
give civil servants valid reassurances on their future. 
  African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
said civil servants would be in the forefront of a new 
government. 
  "The new government of national unity will be able to rely 
on 
the civil service of our country serving under a new flag and a 
new constitution," he said. 
  He said South Africa was entering a "very trying period". 
  "The election is really going to have to rely on you if it 
is 
going to succeed," Mr Ramaphosa said.

  [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel should address police members' grievances instead 
of accusing them of radicalism, the SA [South African] Police 
Union [SAPU] said on Monday [18 April]. 
  SAPU National Organiser Gerhard van der Merwe was reacting 
to 
Mr Kriel's response to a vote of no-confidence in him, passed at 
a SAPU meeting in Cape Town on April 15. The vote of 
no-confidence was accepted after Mr Kriel's office denied the 
SAP [South African Police] had morale problems, said Mr van der 
Merwe. "His response to the vote was that SAPU should stop 
trying to overtake Popcru (the Police and Prisons Civil Rights 
Union) in radicalism. The obvious thing to do would be to 
effectively address these grievances rather than accuse SAPU of 
radicalism," he said. 
  Mr Kriel's attitude aggravated the already volatile 
situation 
at grassroots level and was not in the interests of the police 
or South Africa.

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Chandler] </F>
  [Text] The South African Defence Force [SADF] says the 
integration of various military forces in the country into a 
national defence force is progressing well. It has denied 
outright that it is "dragging its feet" over the matter, as 
alleged by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC 
military wing] (MK) commander Joe Modise in Bloemfontein at the 
weekend. 
  The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) comes into 
being next Wednesday as a successor to the SADF. It will 
comprise MK, members of the Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei and 
Transkei defence forces and, later, APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army] forces. 
  General Georg Meiring, Chief of the SADF, told THE STAR 
yesterday that Modise's allegation was not true. The SADF had 
presented a comprehensive proposal regarding integration in 
October but this had been rejected. Subsequently it was decided 
to form a multiparty team to plan and facilitate integration and 
this had only recently got off the ground. 
  "This team went through a planning process aimed at 
accommodating people in the assembly areas, the end result being 
the same plan that w?s originally rejeited," Meiring added. 
  He said he was confident that the integration process was 
progressing well. "Planning is a joint effort and cannot be 
laid only at the defence force's door. We are adamant that 
integration should be a success." 
  Modise said he suspected the SADF had "its own agenda" and 
wanted to delay the integration process in the hope it could 
stay in command and determine who joined the SANDF. "This we 
will not allow. We are very worried about it ... but we are 
going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new 
government comes in". He said the SADF had previously had 
facilities for Citizen Force intakes of up to 20,000 new 
recruits but had now "reluctantly identified three of its bases 
where MK members could assemble".

<F P=106> [Interview with Lafras Luitingh, founder of Executive </F>
Outcomes security firm, by announcer Max du Preez on the 
"Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] I have with me Lafras Luitingh, one of 
the founders of Executive Outcomes. Good evening, Mr. Luitingh. 
  [Luitingh] Good evening, Mr. du Preez. 
  [Du Preez] Dogs of War [preceding words in English] -- why 
do 
you romanticize war? 
  [Luitingh] I think that was a name given to us by the press, 
and that is how we arrived at Dogs of War. 
  [Du Preez] But what is it? What I am trying to determine 
what makes people like you move from one war to another? Does 
it have to do with a type of personality? Is that what you do? 
Are you addicted to war? 
  [Luitingh] I was trained in the South African Defense Force 
[SADF], and I served in some or other state department, until 
the closure of the CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau], after which I 
found myself jobless. With my qualifications, relating to war 
techniques, I tried to find work, but it was difficult until an 
opportunity presented itself. We were first trained by the 
South African Defense Force, then Executive Outcomes, Military 
Intelligence [MI], and thereafter the Angolan army trained us. 
  [Du Preez] Tell us about Executive Outcomes. Who heads this 
organization? Who belongs to it? 
  [Luitingh] Executive Outcomes was established in 1989 by 
Eben 
Barlow to train the SADF. This training, as I have said, was 
for MI and several courses were offered to those people. 
  [Du Preez] Eben Barlow is himself a South African and a 
former member of the Force? 
  [Luitingh] Eben Barlow is a former member of 32 
Reconnaissance Wing, and he is also a former member of the 
Force. Last year at Soyo, Executive Outcomes was offered a 
contract to secure oil installations inside Soyo, and I was one 
of the members hired by Executive Outcomes to do this work. 
Thereafter, I became part of Executive Outcomes, and along with 
Mr. (Nico Palim) of Executive Outcomes we made a proposal to the 
Angolan Government to train their soldiers and restructure their 
army. 
  [Du Preez] Who are the men who were recruited. Are these men 
former CCB, Koevoet [former Namibian police counterinsurgency 
unit], 32 Battalion forces? 
  [Luitingh] Yes, we recruited former CCB members, former 
special force members, Koevoet members, 32 Battalion members, 
paratroopers, and several other Defense Force division members 
to assist us in training operations in certain areas. 
  [Du Preez] Excuse me, but I find it strange -- former 
soldiers, people like you who have a proud record, as I have 
heard, in the reconnaissance commando, people who have fought 
against communism and who have a long history of this -- how did 
it come about that when you became unemployed in the new army, 
that you turned to this side? Wouldn't it have been more 
predictable for you to align yourselves with the right-wing, 
because I understand that there are people who have joined the 
right-wing? 
  [Luitingh] That is possible. I don't know about this. The 
reason we are in Angola....[pauses] As you will remember, UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] is 
comprised of freedom fighters who fought for democracy within 
Angola, and at that stage when we helped them we fought against 
communism and for democracy in Angola. An election took place 
in Angola, won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola] and lost by UNITA. They are the democratically 
elected government inside Angola, and they are recognized by, 
among others, our government and the Americans. The UN declared 
this election free and fair. We are now working with the 
Angolans, still for the freedom of Angola. 
  [Du Preez] Don't you find it strange to first fight 
alongside 
a unit and then against it? 
  [Luitingh] For me, not at all. I did not enjoy working with 
UNITA. I regarded them as a lot of crooks and liars. So I do 
not feel strange. I can't say how others feel. 
  [Du Preez] Why do you say crooks and liars? 
  [Luitingh] Because I think Colonel Breytenbach summed it up 
very well approximately two years ago, when he said they were 
poor soldiers, that they were smuggling ivory and diamonds. 
Jonas Savimbi murdered more of his own people -- more Angolans 
that anyone else -- those who rebelled against him. He also, 
among other things, during the time he lived in Luanda during 
the elections, shot policemen and buried them in his garden. I 
saw this happening. UNITA is a terrorist organization at this 
stage and their leader is a criminal. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Breytenbach says you are fighting for 
communists against an old ally. 
  [Luitingh] Yes, I do not know what the reasons are for Mr. 
Jan Breytenbach's statements. I don't think there are emotional 
connections with UNITA. I think he probably has a double agenda 
in this case. 
  [Du Preez] What motivates you to put your lives in danger in 
Angola? Is it money? 
  [Luitingh] As I told you, we have to work to stay alive. 
Angola is one of the places inside Africa where there is work 
for people like us. In South Africa, at this stage, there are 
10,000 soldiers deployed in kwaZulu. I believe this is a way of 
life in Africa, and it is something we are good at. 
  [Du Preez] What is your relationship with the ANC? I 
understand Col. Breytenbach also alleged that you are training 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] hit 
squads [preceding two words in English]. 
  [Luitingh] I think this is romanticizing by Col. 
Breytenbach. 
We are not training anyone within the ANC. I do not have a 
problem with that though. Personally, if the ANC or General 
Constand Viljoen....[pauses] To work under any new 
government....[pauses] If I should be asked to train anyone, I 
will give that training as long as it is within the law. 
  [Du Preez] Excuse me, I want to try again: I did try hard to 
telephone Col. Breytenbach and he was unreachable today, but he 
also says the plan, this fighting strategy or whatever plan you 
have there -- I know little of what you are doing in Angola -- 
is a stupid plan and a life-threatening plan, and he is trying 
to persuade families of South Africans who have joined you, to 
bring their people back. What do you say about this? 
  [Luitingh] I question Col. Breytenbach's motive behind this. 
I also questions his methods -- trying to intimidate women and 
children. It reminds me of the beginning of the century. If he 
had any reason to be concerned about the people in Angola, then 
he -- and I know him personally -- would have come to me to tell 
me that our plan is stupid, that we will lose people, that we 
shouldn't do it. He did not do this. I know that the plan he 
is talking about is not one of our plans. The information he is 
getting, I think, is being fed to him for certain objectives. 
  [Du Preez] What are you doing in Angola? 
  [Luitingh] At this stage we are busy with training. We are 
involved in humanitarian work. We are also busy with community 
projects, and we are acting as advisers to the MPLA. 
  [Du Preez] Did you ever come into direct conflict with 
UNITA? 
  [Luitingh] There were several incidents in which UNITA 
attacked our people. Yes, there were incidents of direct 
conflict with UNITA. 
  [Du Preez] And the result? 
  [Luitingh] I don't believe that this is of interest right 
now. 
  [Du Preez] Did you come off second best? 
  [Luitingh] No, definitely not. I think we are making a huge 
difference inside Angola. If you can remember, approximately a 
year back UNITA occupied approximately 80 percent of Angola, and 
if we look at the map of Angola now, I think it I closer to 
50-50. The Angolans are achieving tremendous victories. I don't 
want to say this is as a result of us, but I want to believe 
that we are playing an important role in helping the MPLA to 
drive out the terrorist UNITA organization from Angola. 
  [Du Preez] Today we tried to invite the Defense Force to 
come 
here, but they would not. Why is it that MI, as I understand 
it, and other elements of the Defense Force, and also apparently 
Foreign Affairs, is unhappy about the work done by Executive 
Outcomes in Angola? 
  [Luitingh] I think there are individuals inside the Defense 
Force who are possibly jealous. I know there are certain 
elements within the Defense Force who tried to get this 
contract. There could also be an emotional connection between 
members of the Defense Force and members of UNITA. 
  [Du Preez] People have been killed in Angola and there are 
people missing. 
  [Luitingh] Yes. 
  [Du Preez] Why is it being kept secret? 
  [Luitingh] I just want to say that we are very sorry about 
the people who have been killed or who are missing. That was 
definitely not our plan when we went in. However, our contract 
does say that people could possibly be killed. We try to 
protect the families. We also try to protect individuals who are 
possibly still alive. Concerning those missing -- we try to 
protect them. We would like UNITA to declare publicly who these 
people are, and then they could fall under the Geneva 
Convention. If we announce places and names of people, then it 
makes it easier for UNITA and certain people to use propaganda 
against us. 
  [Du Preez] The fact that you are fighting as old South 
African soldiers in Angola -- is this not in contravention of 
the defense act? 
  [Luitingh] The defense act says that hired 
soldiers....[pauses] Although they do not describe mercenaries 
within the defense act.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Aren't you mercenaries? 
  [Luitingh] I would like to read from the Afrikaans language 
dictionary the definition of the term mercenary, and then we can 
discuss the issue, because I think there is a lot of 
romanticizing about mercenaries: a soldier who is hired, 
fighting only for the money and not for an ideal. If we look at 
it this way, then I want to say that our work inside Angola 
concerns the ideal of a free Angola, so I do not believe we can 
be classified as mercenaries. It is true that we are being paid. 
  [Du Preez] And a good salary at that, I understand. 
  [Luitingh] Yes, that its correct. I want to add that I do 
not 
believe the SADF has an ideal for which they are fighting. I 
think most of them are doing it for the money or because they 
have no other choice. Maybe we should regard more than half of 
the SADF as mercenaries. 
  [Du Preez] Are you trying to say there are no professional 
soldiers in South Africa who believe in the democratization 
process in the new South Africa? 
  [Luitingh] I'm sure there are professional soldiers who 
believe that. I just doubt if all of them do. 
  [Du Preez] You are in a position where you still have close 
contact with the security forces, especially the Defense Force. 
What is your opinion of the morale in the Defense Force in South 
Africa? 
  [Luitingh] I don't understand what you are saying. 
  [Du Preez] ?o you think there is still that old spirit of 
being a team with a task to perform? 
  [Luitingh] For sure there is. The Defense Force is a very 
strong organization where the morale still runs high. In the 
years I have been in the Defense Force I experienced this, 
qspecially in mid-level management. 
  [Du Preez] What about the quest for adventure? I'm now 
referring to your promotion; again that is romanticizing. Is 
there something like that spirit of adventure that also attracts 
you? If I asked you to do office work for the same amount of 
money you earn fighting in Angola, what would you choose? 
  [Luitingh] I think the answer is obvious. I would surely not 
be able to sit in an office and do paperwork. It is not in my 
nature and my character. I also believe none of the people 
working for us would be able to do that type of work. 
  [Du Preez] When you see a corpse -- you must have seen many 
corpses in your lifetime? 
  [Luitingh] I don't think that is repulsive enough to make me 
prefer sitting in an office. I thin? my people experience more 
of life than people who sit in an office all day. I think we 
get the chance to experience and appreciate life. 
  [Du Preez] In which parts of Angola are you involved? Around 
diamond and oil fields mostly? 
  [Luitingh] I don't think it's tactically very good to tell 
you where we are involved. It might just make us more open to 
attacks by.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] We have also seen in the media.... 
  [Luitingh, interrupting] But that is not all correct, and 
I'm 
also not going to tell you what is correct and what is not. I'm 
sorry I can't answer that question. 
  [Du Preez] You have recently been in Angola, and I 
understand 
you are once again on your way back there? 
  [Luitingh] Yes. 
  [Du Preez] Could you give us an idea of what the situation 
in 
Angola is like on the ground -- the people, the government, the 
civil administration, UNITA's strength? 
  [Luitingh] The problem in Angola was that the Russans 
withdrew from Angola and left a big vacuum in all facets of 
society. The Angolan Government is presently trying very hard 
to reconstruct Angola. The society there is normal, just like 
in some of our townships in South Africa. The people suffer 
from hunger in Angola, especially in those areas under UNITA 
control, because food distributed by the United Nations is used 
by UNITA for its military ends. In Luanda itself, and in areas 
where the government is in control, the local population is 
relatively happy because the government is working hard to 
create job opportunities and at least to feed every Angolan. 
There are many foreign companies involved in development inside 
Angola, and the free market system is flourishing, at least in 
those areas I visited. The problem, of course, is that there is 
a civil war going on, that UNITA wants to take Angola over 
through a military victory, and that Savimbi wants to be a 
dictator. 
  [Du Preez] Are there indications in your experience that 
UNITA is still being supported by elements from South Africa? 
  [Luitingh] Yes, there are elements in South Africa that 
support UNITA, but I cannot tell you who they are. I have 
already tried to communicate this information to the relevant 
people in South Africa, but my plan is -- as soon as the 
elections are over -- to furnish this information to the new 
government -- regardless of who that government is -- and to see 
if it can tackle it effectively, because there are several South 
Africans who are smuggling weapons to South Africa. 
  [Du Preez] From Angola to South Africa? 
  [Luitingh] From Angola -- from UNITA -- to South Africa. The 
weapons are being smuggled for Inkatha, for right-wing elements. 
The company involved is Trans-Namib Trading, being run by Mr. 
Ben van Heerden, and I believe after this program we can see if 
there is someone serious enough to stop that. 
  [Du Preez] It's a very dangerous allegation that you are 
making. Have you approached the person concerned about this? 
Is there anything else you have done regarding this 
information, because arms smuggling to South Africa is one of 
our biggest problems. 
  [Luitingh] I have evidence -- I will testify that he has 
done 
it. 
  [Du Preez] Will you be prepared to testify before the 
Goldstone Commission? 
  [Luitingh] To tell you the truth, last year I approached the 
Goldstone Commission and told them that they were very welcome 
to look at any information I had. They were welcome to subject 
us to investigations. They were welcome to investigate our 
planes, our people. It is our company's policy not to allow any 
criminal acts, and I have no problem with an investigation. 
  [Du Preez] How big is your force? 
  [Luitingh] Again I cannot tell you that, but the media says 
in the region of 500 people. 
  [Du Preez] And that estimate is not very far off? 
  [Luitingh] They are close. 
  [Du Preez] Now these people -- as we have already said -- 
are 
made up of former members of Koevoet, 32 Battalion, and 
reconnaissance commandos. We ordinary South Africans know those 
people as being hard soldiers and tenacious fighters. What is 
to become of them? What is their future -- and that of those 
who are still in the force -- in the new South Africa? 
  [Luitingh] Many of those people were lucky to get retirement 
packages from the Police and the Defense Force. Unfortunately 
such packages do not last a lifetime, and these people have to 
look for work. The problem is that these people are not trained 
for any other job, and that is a pity for the government not to 
have taken the initiative to train these people in other 
directions. MK members also receive packages, but they are also 
being sent to the streets. Thy are also not being trained, and 
I think there is going to be a real problem in South Africa if 
those people do not get jobs. Unfortunately these people are 
susceptible to criminal acts and are open to all radical 
elements. 
  [Du Preez] So you are saying that an unemployed, trained 
soldier spells trouble? 
  [Luitingh] I wouldn't say all of them, but I am saying that 
they are indeed susceptible to radical groups. 
  [Du Preez] How do your people there in Angola feel about 
South Africa's future and the coming election? What are they 
going to do when they return? 
  [Luitingh] Most of them -- at least those that I spoke to -- 
are very positive about the new South Africa. We feel that if 
the people can steer away from a civil war, then we can attain 
many things in South Africa. I believe that within the new 
South Africa a place can be made for these former soldiers, and 
if there is place for them, I am convinced we can flourish, 
especially in community projects. 
  [Du Preez] Tell me in conclusion, what are you and your men 
going to when your mission in Angola has been completed? Where 
are you going to? Look for another war? 
  [Luitingh] I hope our time in Angola will not end; we are 
looking at the total development of Angola after the civil war. 
Perhaps we can bring about economic progress there, not only for 
Angola but also for South Africa, which would create many job 
opportunities. South Africa and Angola could play a significant 
role in the development of the subcontinent.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  IFP Election Decision `Turning Point' in ANC-IFP 
Relationship 
-- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 20 April in a page-18 
editorial says Inkatha's decision to participate in the election 
"means, at a minimum, a drastic diminution in the prospects of 
kwaZulu/Natal's polling booths becoming a war zone. It means 
having that super-thorny political question -- where does Zulu 
support reside? -- at last answered in the only true way it 
could ever be answered, with potentially immense implications 
for understanding kwaZulu/Natal and thereby stabilising the 
province. It means Inkatha brought into parliament, as opposed 
to standing outside looking in aggrieved and dangerous." The 
agreement also "contains at least the seeds of a lasting turning 
point by which the ANC-IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] relationship 
may grow away from brutal enmity into constitutional rivalry." 
However, it is "all too easy to expect too much. We will not 
all of a sudden find doves and peace songs in the bullet-split 
air around, for instance, the Thokoza hostels." But THE STAR 
believes a process has been started that may lead to "a steady 
cooling of the conflicts, led by a downscaling of the slanging 
matches from political leaders." 
  Peacekeeping Force in Townships `Major Mistake' -- A second 
editorial on the same page declares that the decision to deploy 
the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in East Rand townships 
"was a major mistake." "Within days of its taking over from the 
SADF [South African Defense Force], Thokoza, Katlehong and 
Vosloorus once again became killing fields." "The TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council], which was responsible for the 
establishment of the NPKF, must bear a heavy share of 
responsibility. By pressing for the deployment of hastily 
trained soldiers in an area notoriously difficult to police, the 
TEC has exhibited classic symptoms of political conceit and 
myopia." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  IFP Election Decision `Fairly Balanced' Deal -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 April in its page-6 editorial 
believes the country owes Kenyan Professor Washington Okumu "a 
great debt for pushing his way into a mediation process that 
Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington and five others had already 
given up on." However, "no one should be naive enough to 
believe what the agreement reached yesterday guarantees peace. 
Angola provides a stark warning that an election does not mean 
that all participants will abide by its results." BUSINESS DAY 
says the election deal "provides only a framework for overcoming 
constitutional differences. It does not resolve them. In the 
end, Buthelezi blinked first. He had to. He did not abandon 
(or perhaps he returned to) the realm of reason and strategic 
thinking. He chose the better of two bad options." But "the 
ANC too, has been forced to give ground, and for good reason. 
While some of its leaders may have believed Buthelezi could be 
vanquished by brute force and financial deprivation, others, 
knowing well the classical theories of guerrilla warfare, 
realised that the process would be debilitating and that success 
was far from guaranteed." Although the ANC's concession is "not 
as stark as those made by Buthelezi," the ANC had to agree "to 
postelection mediation." The ANC has "effectively removed from 
the ambit of the Constitutional Assembly that forum's powers in 
the most crucial constitutional area--regionalism. This, after 
all, was Inkatha's main objective in the first place. It looks 
like a fairly balanced and therefore workable, deal." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  IFP Election Decision `Last-Minute Reprieve' -- Referring to 
the IFP decision to participate in the April election, 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 April says in a page-8 
editorial "the last-minute reprieve comes at a time when some 
were squaring up for a civil war that would have brought untold 
damage to this country and its people." "It has been a long 
haul but our final word is to congratulate Mr de Klerk, Mr 
Mandela and Dr Buthelezi."

  [Text] Praia, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Dissidents of Cape Verde's 
ruling Movement for Democracy [MPD] today announced the 
formation of a new political party that will be led by former 
Justice and Labor Minister Eurico Monteiro and former Foreign 
Minister Jorge Carlo Fonseca. The membership of the new party, 
whose name was not disclosed, is drawn from the MPD, the ruling 
party since January 1991 when the first free parliamentary 
elections were held in Cape Verde to end 17 years of one-party 
rule. 
  Dissension within the MPD led by Prime Minister Carlos Veiga 
was first noted in late 1993 when the Cape Verdian ambassador to 
Portugal was retained in office in spite of accusations of 
diverting government funds to personal use. Monteiro, Fonseca, 
and Health Minister Rui Figuiredo resigned over the issue thus 
forcing a cabinet reshuffle on 4 March. 
  The prime minister was reelected MPD chairman on 21 February 
which brought about the resignation of several senior officers 
including Mr. Monteiro, the party's former second in command. 
The MPD has 56 seats in the National Assembly as against 22 for 
the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde the former 
single ruling party.

  [Text] The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Idrissu, 
today assured Ghanaians of the safety of Ghanaian troops serving 
with the UN force in Rwanda. He was speaking in an interview 
with the GBC [Ghana Broadcasting Corporation] on the changing 
situation in the Rwandan crisis: 
  [Begin recording] [Idrissu] [Words indistinct] generally 
worried about the wounded soldier, but what I would like to tell 
you is that, I mean, that was accidental. It was not a firing 
at our troops which caused this injury. It was purely 
accidental. He was hit by a stray bullet. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Many people would think that 
Ghana should be getting ready to withdraw our contingent from 
Rwanda. This is because other foreign troops, especially 
Belgium, is reported to have withdrawn completely. Why are we 
still in Rwanda? Are there steps to get our troops withdrawn 
and if not, why? 
  [Idrissu] Quite honestly, I don't know the circumstances 
under which the Belgians withdrew, and we are there under UN 
auspices, and I don't think we will be taking a unilateral 
decision to pull out. We have faith in the Organization of the 
UN, and we hope that the interest of our troops would be 
paramount and they would be protected. 
  [Correspondent] What would you say is the exact situation of 
our troops in the city, especially as it is reported to have 
been encircled? 
  [Idrissu] Well, right now our troops are in Kigali. They 
are around the airport area and most of the key places. But let 
me assure you that all our troops, with the exception of this 
one injured soldier, are healthy. They are all in good health. 
They are not under any attack. So we don't have any fears 
about their present situation. 
  [Correspondent] The situation in Kigali (?also looks) like 
the peacekeeping role of the UN: It is not working. It is not 
likely that our troops may end up fighting in self-defense, and 
if that happens, are they well equipped to handle such a 
situation? 
  [Idrissu] Well, that is a little bit difficult for me, but 
we rely on the judgment of the force commander of the UN and the 
secretary general's representative in the area to take good 
decisions so that we are not engulfed in any such situation.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Liberian Peace Council, LPC, which has been 
fighting Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] in the region south of Buchanan since the Cotonou peace 
accord last year, came out yesterday to demand a place on the 
National Transitional Council. LPC leader Octavius Walker 
claimed that he controlled six counties and should be allowed to 
represent them in the Council, but the demand has been rejected. 
On the line to Monrovia, Robin White asked the acting minister 
of information, Milton T. Jay, why they were turning down the 
LPC: 
  [Begin recording] [Jay] Well, basically, Robin, we have to 
put this whole thing in perspective. The configuration of the 
Liberian National State Council was not done as a result of 
territorial gains that the factions have made, and so if Mr. 
Walker is making a claim on the basis of territories, I think he 
has missed the point. And you see we want to make sure that we 
are not sending any message out there to any warring faction 
that as soon as you can claim a territory then you should come 
and claim on the State Council to have a seat. 
  [White] So, there is absolutely no chance of renegotiating 
the Cotonou accord to let in the Peace Council you are saying? 
  [Jay] Absolutely, the National Transitional Government of 
Liberia is not going to accommodate another warring faction on 
the State Council, because to do that will be to create an 
opportunity for other warring factions to begin to spark off 
around here. You have the Lofa Defense Force, which is a 
warring faction that is fighting the NPFL. You have the Bong 
Defense Force, which is also a warring faction. If you begin to 
allot seats on the Council for every warring faction we are not 
going to go anywhere, and we can be sitting down here, 
accommodating every warring faction, because they claim one or 
two territories around here. 
  [White] But what happens if the Peace Council carries on 
fighting? How will you deal with them? 
  [Jay] Well, basically if they carry on fighting, that will 
be 
the modus operandi of most of the warring factions around here. 
The Council of State is prepared to accommodate the Peace 
Council in some nominal area just to make sure that they have a 
political voice. And what do I mean by that? For instance, 
there are some subcabinet positions here; there are advisory 
positions in which they can be accommodated. 
  [White] So, you are prepared to make some concessions toward 
them? 
  [Jay] Well, indeed we are prepared to politically 
accommodate 
the factions in the Liberian crisis who have the potential to 
delay the process, and we want to do that so the that Liberian 
people have the opportunity to have a free country. 
  [White] In fact, how is this new Interim Council working out 
in your view? 
  [Jay] Well I think, Robin, the Council is working out very 
well. Over the last few days, the Council was able to 
inaugurate the cabinet. The cabinet has been inducted into 
office. We have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now under the 
leadership of the coordinator. You have the Ministry of Justice 
also under coordinator, the Ministry of Finance. Everything is 
going well. The Council is on track. We are looking forward to 
having elections in September this year if everything goes well. 
  [White] But as I understand it, not everybody is taking up 
their ministerial post. 
  [Jay] No, I mean almost everybody has done that except for 
those on the NPFL side. The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia] nominees have all gone through the 
confirmation process. They have been confirmed by the 
Transitional Legislative Assembly and they have all taken their 
offices. Those on the side of the Interim Government, including 
myself, have also taken their offices. The only presence in the 
Liberian peace construct who have not taken their offices are 
those from the National Patriotic Front, and again I want to 
send out this message, Robin, it is important for institutions 
like the BBC to help us to try to have these people understand 
they cannot go about keeping the people of this country hostage 
only because of political reasons, especially when all of the 
concessions that could be made have made. [end recording] 
  [The "African News" segment of the same cast adds: "A leader 
of the former Liberian Army whose members are now grouped in the 
Armed Forces of Liberia, the AFL, says he would not disarm all 
his fighters. The chief of staff said the AFL could not be 
considered one of Liberia's factions and would maintain his 
forces at what he called peacetime levels. The AFL began 
disarming earlier this year under a peace agreement reached with 
other factions, but clashes have continued."]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] has become 
something of a thorn in the flesh of the Transitional Council 
which took power last month. The LPC was formed last year to 
oppose Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] faction, one of the three signatories to the Cotonou 
Peace Accord, and over the last few days there have been reports 
that the LPC is demanding a seat on the Transitional Council as 
a price for laying down its arms. Well, the LPC's leader, 
George Burly, is passing through Freetown at the moment. On the 
line, Robin White asked him exactly what their position was. 
  [Begin recording] [Burly] Robin, we've made it categorically 
clear, unequivocally clear, that we have never sought any seat 
on the Transitional Government, the Transitional Council. We 
have never sought any seat and we have never requested for any 
seat on the council. It is not our desire. That's not our 
ambition. 
  [White] So what is your ambition? What do you want? 
  [Burly] The Liberian Peace Council is a resistance movement 
to the atrocities hit upon our people by the NPFL, and as a 
resistance movement we've ensured first of all that we stay 
alive. We have done that and we have done so successfully. We 
have done so to the extent where we now control or have managed 
to repel the NPFL from 60 percent of the landmass of Liberia, 
six counties. Let me tell you another thing. We have been told 
that we are no party to Cotonou and we wish to inform you and 
everyone else that while we may not be a party to Cotonou or any 
accord intended to broker peace in Liberia, we are a party to 
the Republic of Liberia and its interests. 
  [White] So what kind of political solution do you want for 
Liberia yourself? 
  [Burly] Robin, we would like to see a political 
configuration 
that would take into consideration the interests of all the 
parties, particularly our security. 
  [White] So, you are looking for some kind of new government. 
  [Burly] Whatever you wish to call it. We insist that there 
must be something that takes our security into consideration. 
  [White] But surely the only way you can guarantee your 
security is to be in government in some shape or form. 
  [Burly] Robin, there is a lot that one can do outside of 
government, you know that. 
  [White] But what would guarantee your security then? 
  [Burly] We made proposals to ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-fire Monitoring Group] and we've made 
proposals to the UN, the people that are responsible for what 
should be happening on the ground. 
  [White] And have you had any response? 
  [Burly] Not as yet. 
  [White] You claim that you control 60 percent of Liberia? 
  [Burly] Robin, we control Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, 
Grand 
Kru, Rivercess, and Grand Bassa counties, and more. 
  [White] But Mr. Taylor claims to control 60 percent of 
Liberia. 
  [Burly] Robin, that's Mr. Taylor's problem. [end recording]

  [Text] Clear evidence has emerged of direct ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] support for the so-called LPC [Liberian Peace Council]. 
A captured LPC soldier told LPN [expansion unknown] News that 
it received direct supply of fresh and ammunition from ECOMOG in 
River Cess, where they used canoes to take delivery. 
  The LPC prisoner of war said the head of their group, Dr. 
(George Bulley), is in direct contact with ECOMOG. He said he 
was sent on a mission along with a group of others to map out 
strategic locations in the southeast for possible attack. The 
LPC POW was arrested recently in Sinoe County by the NPFL task 
force commander for the southeast, Lieutenant General Joseph 
Bako, and the deputy chief of operations, Colonel Lawrence 
Young, when they went on an inspection of the frontline.

  [Text] In Liberia, 1,532 armed men have so far been 
demobilized and encamped in the disarmament process which began 
last month. The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major 
General John Inienger, disclosed this today in Lagos while 
briefing airport correspondents on the latest developments in 
Liberia. Pius Egbohon has a report: 
  [Begin Egbohon recording] Gen. Inienger said a number of 
weapons and over 6,000 rounds of assorted ammunition had also 
been recovered. He was, however, not happy with the slow pace 
at which the factions were turning in their men for disarmament 
and encampment. The ECOMOG field commander attributed this 
situation to the lack of faith among the factions. He stated 
that there was a high degree of distrust among the factions 
culminating in a situation whereby each faction suspects the 
other of having a hidden agenda. [passage indistinct] 
  Gen. Inienger said that apart from the low level of trust 
prevalent among the factions, the internal rift within ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the 
fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] of Charles Taylor had not 
worked in favor of the peace process. He gave an assurance that 
the problem would be resolved soon to ensure that the general 
elections scheduled for 7 December this year became a reality.

  [Text] Monrovia, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Soldiers of one of 
Liberia's armed factions have detained five local employees of a 
French aid organisation, the UN bureau announced here Monday [18 
April]. The five, employed by International Action Against 
Hunger, were being held in the port city of Harper, 400 
kilometers (240 miles) southeast of here, by the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL]. They were detained last week 
on suspicion of supporting the Liberia Peace Council, a rival 
militia set up in September, a UN spokesman said. 
  Fighting broke out last week between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
and the Liberia Peace Council in Rivercess, 160 kilometers (90 
miles) southeast of here, prompting people to flee to Buchanan 
where some 80,000 people are now being taken care of by 
humanitarian organisations, the spokesman said. Because of 
increased insecurity in southeastern Liberia, the American 
Catholic Relief Services have announced they were suspending 
operations in the region.

  [Excerpts] The tripartite meeting on the implementation of 
the national pact has been in progress in Tamanrasset, Algeria, 
since 16 April. The meeting, attended by Mali, the Unified 
Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria -- the 
mediating country -- is reviewing the progress made in the 
implementation of the national pact since it was signed. From 
Tamanrasset, our special correspondent Oumar Toure reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] The Tamanrasset meeting closely 
follows the second anniversary of the signing of the national 
pact on 11 April 1992 by Mali and the rebel Tuareg movements to 
consecrate the return of peace, security, and national 
reconciliation in Mali. The meeting is aimed at taking stock of 
the pact's implementation and at defining future priorities in 
line with the spirit of the pact. Already the pact has led to 
the creation of a peaceful atmosphere. What remains to be done 
now is to tackle the developmental aspect of the pact because, 
in reality, apart from its political nature, the pact is a real 
action program for development and integration and a real answer 
to the problem of exclusion, abandonment, and underdevelopment 
of our country's northern regions which sparked off the 
rebellion. 
  Opening the Tamanrasset session, the Algerian representative 
restated his country's solidarity with the efforts to 
consolidate the gains of the national pact. He hailed the 
efforts that have so far been made since 11 April 1992. 
  In his address, Sada Samake, the territorial administration 
and security minister who led the national delegation, said the 
Tamanrasset meeting is aimed at taking an objective look at the 
progress made in the implementation of the national pact. 
  [Samake] Today, the national pact represents an important 
gain which we all need to preserve and consolidate. It is a 
mark of the return of peace even though acts of banditry 
continue to create an atmosphere of insecurity in our country's 
northern regions. From the military and security standpoint, 
decisive progress has been made with the integration of 640 
fighters into the regular Army while special security units are 
being set up despite delays in the effective takeoff of the 
exercise. The present meeting will afford us another 
opportunity to give new impetus to the implementation of the 
national pact. It will enable us to take an objective look at 
the progress made and to identify existing shortcomings so as to 
work out ways and means of overcoming them. 
  [Toure] The MFUA representative, (Sidi Mohamed Ould Zaibi), 
pointed out that the movements did not come to Tamanrasset to 
renegotiate the national pact because it is clear enough as it 
stands. 
  [(Zaibi)] [passage omitted] We do not see ourselves as 
attending a renegotiation session of the national pact as it is 
clear. There is nothing to renegotiate. We only have to 
implement what has been agreed on by the two sides. The pact 
forms the historical yardstick for judging all sides. 
  [Toure] All the movements are represented at the Tamanrasset 
meeting including the ministerial departments involved in 
handling the northern problem. Since 16 April, the 
deliberations have been going on behind closed doors and no 
information has filtered out. However, according to informed 
sources, MFUA representatives have demonstrated a lot of 
flexibility in their appreciation of the progress made so far in 
the implementation of the national pact. [end recording]

  [Text] Representatives of the Malian Government and the 
Azaouad united movements and fronts meeting in Tamanrasset 
agreed yesterday evening to postpone discussion of the issue of 
the enumeration of Azaouad combatants who are to be integrated 
into the Malian security forces. It should be recalled that 
this issue has remained a thorny point of disagreement between 
the two sides. 
  In the opinion of observers in Tamanrasset, Algerian 
diplomatic intervention has allowed the proceedings of the 
committee to follow up implementation of the Bamako agreement, 
which is currently taking place in Tamanrasset in the far south 
of Algeria, to get under way.

supporters. According to a NIGER PRESS AGENCY dispatch, a 
precarious calm reigns today over the capital Niamey. The 
report adds, however, that the large teams of policemen deployed 
yesterday are still patrolling major crossroads. 
  Also, the interior minister whom we contacted by telephone 
this afternoon has confirmed that about 50 people who had been 
arrested were freed between yesterday and this morning. Mr. 
Ousmane Oumarou also disclosed that preliminary investigations 
show that no charges have been brought against the 50 persons 
released. The interior minister further added that five key

  [Text] Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou received the heads 
of diplomatic and consular missions in Niger and representatives 
of international organizations this afternoon to brief them on 
the political situation prevailing in our country. 
  The prime minister summoned the diplomats as observers of 
the 
Niger political scene and witnesses to the government efforts 
made on economic, social, and political levels. During the 
meeting, Mr. Issoufou recalled the progress recorded in our 
country since the new political authorities came to power. The 
head of government reassured the members of the diplomatic corps 
that today, despite the crisis prevailing in Niger, one can 
nonetheless note improvements both in the democratic ideals and 
socioeconomic issues. The progress was acheived thanks to the 
assistance from friendly countries and international 
institutions. 
  Tackling the main issue at stake during the meeting, Mr. 
Issoufou indicated that unfortunately in this era full of hope, 
a new hotbed of tension (?bore a burden) on the nation and 
tension was brought about by the opposition political parties' 
refusal to respect the democratic and republican laws the Niger 
people had enacted for themselves through the 26 December 1992 
Constitution. To safeguard national unity and revamp the 
economy, the government reacted in order to preserve the 
Constitution, the laws and regulations as well as human rights 
principle. Niger authorities will continue to strive to save 
Niger from risky ventures and useless sufferings seen in other 
countries. 
  Mr. Issoufou also said that the government remains open to 
all initiatives from the civil society and friendly countries 
that will enable Niger to strengthen its young democracy, 
restore security and peace, and respect constitutional values. 
After this brief introduction, the prime minister gave the 
floor to his interlocutors. The Moroccan ambassador to Niger, 
Mr. Tahar Nejjar, also dean of the diploamtic corps, took the 
floor and asked the prime minister to use parliamentarian 
immunity since several parliamentarians were arrested. In 
response, the head of government explained that the 
parliamentarians who were arrested were caught in the act. 
  Asked about what kind of initiatives the government was open 
to, Mr. Issoufou said that the authorities of the Third Republic 
are in favor of any action susceptible to help Niger advance on 
the path of social, economic, and political progress.

  [Text] In Niger, the government is going to call for the 
lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the arrested deputies. 
Moreover, the 50 people who were taken in for questioning in 
Niamey have been released. However, the opposition leaders are 
still in prison. 
  The National Movement for the Society of DevelopmenT, the 
former single party, is quite determined to try to have them 
released at any cost. Listen to what one of its leaders, Hama 
Amadou, had to say on the subject. He spoke to Chantal Lorho: 
  [Begin recording] [Amadou] The various grassroot structures 
are mobilizing and, really, if our leaders are not released, 
there may be some really hot days over the next few days. 
  [Lorho] Does this mean that you are going to call for 
demonstrations in the streets? 
  [Amadou] Absolutely. 
  [Lorho] Have you already set a precise calendar for your 
actions? 
  [Amadou] Well, when the time comes, everyone will be 
informed 
about what will happen. 
  [Lorho] When will that be? 
  [Amadou] Very soon. 
  [Lorho] May I ask you why you are in Ouagadougou? 
  [Amadou] For a particular mission in the framework of the 
party, but it has nothing to do with what the authorities in 
Niamey are saying. 
  [Lorho] That is? 
  [Amadou, laughing] That I have fled and that I have gone to 
recruit mercenaries. 
  [Lorho] Is this what the government in Niamey is saying? 
  [Amadou] Absolutely, and I find this totally ridiculous. We 
have always carried out our actions within the framework of the 
normal workings of democracy, not by recruiting mercenaries or 
killing anyone. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Inter-ethnic clashes last 
week between two communities on opposite sides of the border 
between Cross River and Benue States in southeast Nigeria 
reportedly have left 10 persons dead and more than 15 seriously 
wounded, the independent daily newspapers GUARDIAN and TRIBUNE 
reported today. 
  These same sources point out that, during the clashes 
between 
the Obudus of Cross River State and the Vandeikya of Benue 
State, more than 550 houses were burned and some 2,000 Obudu 
villagers fled for fear of new attacks from their neighbors. 
  Most of the wounded suffer from wounds inflicted by firearms 
and machetes. The military administrators of the two states, 
Captains Joshua Obademi of Benue State and Ibrahim Kefas of 
Cross River State, held a meeting over the weekend, after which 
they sent a strong warning to anyone who is found responsible 
for new outbreaks trouble between the two communities. 
  Funds have been allocated by the two administrators to come 
to the aid of the victims. The drawing of the border between 
the two states at the time of the British protectorate, which is 
contested by the Vandeikya, is said to be the cause of the 
clashes between the Obudus and Vandeikya, according to evidence 
collected by the GUARDIAN.

  [Text] Lagos, April 19 (AFP) -- Seventy-four persons 
appeared in court in connection with demonstrations in the 
central town of Jos in which five persons reportedly died and 
many were injured, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported 
Tuesday [19 April]. The suspects were charged Monday in a Jos 
magistrate's court with unlawful assembly, rioting, causing 
mischief with fire and possessing arms, NAN said. 
  The demonstration last Tuesday in Jos, capital of the 
central 
Plateau state, was over the controversial appointment of a 
Moslem as the head of a local government council in 
mainly-Christian Jos. The Christian population expressed its 
opposition to the appointment, a step which made the government 
suspend the move, but this triggered off the protest by the 
Moslem population. 
  The demonstrators set ablaze the main market in the city, 
two 
mosques and a church and some cars, eyewitnesses said. 
  The state military administrator, Colonel Mohammed Mana, 
swiftly imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city and nearby 
Bukuru town, and deployed soldiers on the main roads to restore 
order. 
  The government later relaxed the curfew, according to NAN.

  [Text] Nairobi, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Somali gunmen kidnapped 
Sudan's ambassador in Mogadishu and threatened to kill him 
unless a 100,000-dollar ransom was paid by Thursday [21 April], 
diplomats said here. 'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad Hasan was abducted 
Tuesday by four men, who said they were from the Hawadle clan, 
as he walked across the road to his office from the hotel where 
he has lived since he was posted to Mogadishu a year ago. They 
sent a note to the embassy office on Tuesday vowing to kill the 
ambassador if the ransom was not paid within 48 hours. 
  A Sudanese diplomat went to Mogadishu on Wednesday to 
negotiate with the kidnappers, the diplomats said. Several 
foreigners including a United Nations official, a Red Cross 
worker and employees of a catering firm have been kidnapped in 
the past two months amid a mounting wave of lawlessness as U.S. 
and other Western troops pulled out. All were freed after 
negotiations through clan elders. In some cases the abductors 
dropped or drastically reduced their initial ransom demands, and 
none of the kidnappings seemed politically motivated.

  [Text] Bujumbura, April 19 (AFP) -- New clashes erupted on 
the outskirts of Bujumbura Tuesday [19 April] between 
Tutsi-dominated army forces and Hutu militants, shattering 
several weeks of relative calm, official sources said. The 
clashes broke out in Hutu-dominated areas of the city, the 
sources said. A government statement said Prime Minister 
Anatole Kanyenkiko had taken measures to "make those who are 
armed lay down their weapons." 
  Unrest has mounted in some areas on the outskirts of the 
city 
for the last few days. Sources said sporadic small arms fire 
had been reported in the areas for the last few days. 
  The government called on observers from the Organization of 
African Unity (OAU) to be deployed in the areas "to work with 
civilian and military officials to create confidence between the 
different ethnic groups." 
  The fresh unrest came two weeks after the death of Burundian 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6 in a plane crash in 
neighbouring Rwanda, which also killed Rwandan head of state 
Juvenal Habyarimana. 
  Inter-ethnic unrest in Rwanda is reported to have killed 
thousands in the two weeks since the plane crash.

  [Excerpt] A new political party was created today. The 
Union of Social Forces [Union des Forces Sociales], UFOS, 
announced its formation this morning at the People's Palace 
press center during a news conference. 
  The new party intends to find solutions to the nation's 
problems. It springs from the ashes of civil society. This 
group has been set up to guide society's actions because civil 
society, which was supposed to be the product of the people's 
aspirations, is disconnected and resembles a 36-headed monster. 
This party, which is coordinated by Martin Kavundza, includes 
the following associations: trade unions, cultural circles, 
athletic clubs, nongovernmental organizations, student 
movements, and friendly societies. 
  The UFOS is therefore in solidarity with all these 
associations. It wants politicians to help defuse the situation. 
Martin Kavundza stressed that the party proclaims its 
independence from the other forces. It also strongly supports 
the gains of the national sovereign conference. [passage

pursue their objectives by peaceful means.

  [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen welcomed the 
announcement that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] will 
participate in the election. General Viljoen said in Tzaneen he 
believed that an election, which included all the parties, was 
necessary. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen 
addressed a group of people consisting of community leaders, 
businessmen, and farmers in the town. He said the Afrikaner and 
the Zulu both believed in self-determination and that an 
alliance with the Zulus was a possibility after the election. 
  [Viljoen] I am very happy that it will now be possible for 
us 
to join hands in the future when it comes to negotiating on 
principles such as self-determination, and also when it comes to 
the improvement of the constitution. 
  [Theron] The Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to participate 
in the election will apparently have an effect on right-wing 
groups, which up to now did not want to take part in the 
election. The signing of an agreement later this week between 
the Freedom Front, the ANC, and the government concerning 
self-determination will also probably influence certain 
right-wing leaders to support participation in the election.

Drivers, performing artists, fishermen, and investors came 
together to create a platform for consultation and for the 
defense of their interests. In his opening speech, Mr. Basile 
Noukpliguidi, chairman of the party's preparatory committee,

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The government and National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] teams to the Lusaka peace talks 
were scheduled to meet today, but that did not happen because it 
was only today that the mediators delivered the intermediate 
document on specific principles, modalities for their 
implementation, and the conclusion of the electoral process. 
  UNITA handed its proposal over to the mediators on 15 April. 
The government did the same the next day. This morning, UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye held separate 
meetings -- first with the government team and then with the 
UNITA delegation. The observers attended both meetings, where 
Blondin Beye delivered a document reflecting the mediators' 
views regarding the proposals advanced by the government and by 
UNITA. 
  No meetings were held this afternoon. The negotiating teams 
took time off to reflect on the document and suggest possible 
amendments. The UN special representative is scheduled to meet 
with the two sides tomorrow to get their responses. Should 
there not be too many differences, Blondin Beye is likely to 
call for a face-to-face meeting between the government and UNITA 
teams.

  [Text] Through Information Secretary Joao Lourenco, the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, MPLA, has said 
that the Lusaka peace talks are evolving at a snail's pace. The 
MPLA information secretary said so during a party visit to 
Lubango, the capital of Huila Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The view is that the talks are 
taking much too long and that it is high time a solution is 
found to the conflict in this country. We believe that the 
Angolan people have reached the limits of their suffering, so 
there is every need for the government, the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], and the international 
community in Lusaka to make every effort to ensure that a peace 
accord is signed as soon as possible. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you believe that such an 
accord will be the solution to the Angolan conflict? 
  [Lourenco] I think so. I believe so. It is common to say 
that hope is the last thing to go, so we are still keeping alive 
the hope that peace will be achieved in Lusaka. 
  [Correspondent] UNITA has said that the government has asked 
for a deadline at the talks so that it can continue its 
offensive on the ground. Would you care to comment? 
  [Lourenco] That is an absurd point of view. If we are asking 
for a deadline, it is because we want to achieve peace as soon 
as possible. In doing so, we are making it clear that we are 
the only ones interested in having the war end immediately and 
in achieving peace that will last. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] in the direction of the principal 
positions occupied by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] in oil-rich Soyo District, in 
northern Zaire Province. As expectable in a climate of war, the 
rebel sources have not shown any signs that their forces have 
been withdrawing from positions they have held in northern 
Angola. Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, reports: 
  Independent observers in the Angolan capital are 
increasingly 
convinced that a qualitative change in the correlation of forces 
is occurring on the battlefield and that the government forces 
are enjoying a clear upper hand. [Words indistinct] confirming 
these unofficial reports doing the rounds among Luanda-based 
international journalists. The government is said to be placing 
the UNITA forces in northern under unprecedented military 
pressure and to be making some noteworthy advances concerning 
the implementation of its strategy which, curiously, carries the 
official name of active defense. Angolan media reports that 
last week the UNITA forces in Soyo were reinforced with 2,000 
special forces from Zaire, including Zairian and Angolan 
soldiers, in addition to other reports, can only confirm that 
increasingly fierce clashes are under way between the two sides 
and that they are using all available conventional war weapons, 
including the navy and the air force. 
  In fact, various sources in Luanda said today that, when it 
comes to the evolution of the military situation in this 
country, the great novelty is likely to come precisely from 
oil-rich Soyo area. Other reasonably reliable sources have 
reported that the government forces are increasing their 
military pressure on neighboring Uige Province, notably around 
the provincial capital and strategic Negage Air Base, some 30 km 
from the city of Uige. 
  Clashes for the more easterly area of Cafunfo, in 
diamond-rich Lunda Norte Province, also seem to providing the 
government with successes. However, today we received reports 
that UNITA launched a successful counterattack that is said to 
have alleviated the intense pressure the government forces had 
been applying on the area. However, UNITA official sources have 
accused the government of using South African mercenaries in 
Lunda Norte Province and other areas. They have already reported 
the deaths of more than 12 South African mercenaries, and this 
appears to be confirmed by the letter that -- we have learned 
from diplomatic sources -- the South African representative in 
the Angolan capital has just sent to the Angolan Foreign Affairs 
Ministry asking for information concerning the whereabouts of at 
least seven South African citizens whose families believe they 
are in Angola. 
  Observers in Luanda believe that fighting in Angola could 
reach unprecedented levels now that international attention is 
centered on South Africa and its upcoming elections. 
  Meanwhile, Portugal's LUSA news agency quotes an Angolan 
Government source as saying that N'dalatando has been under the 
control of government for the last week. It also reports that 
clashes in Cuanza Norte Province are now occurring between 
Malange and N'dalatando. The government forces are trying to 
take Lucala.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerald L'Ange] </F>
  [Text] For the past five months Angola's MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government and the UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] movement 
have been engaging in peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, that have 
every appearance of being serious, but may well be largely sham. 
The really serious business is being conducted on the 
battlefield in Angola -- where South Africa mercenaries are now 
fighting in a bizarre change of sides. 
  While the United Nations-brokered negotiations have made 
some 
progress, they have failed to reach any agreement that would end 
the fighting. Neither side has yet reached a point where it 
would see its interests best served by a political solution. 
Though ordinary Angolans continue to suffer horribly, neither 
political party is hurting badly enough to settle. 
  The MPLA at present has the advantage politically through 
the 
international support that followed its declared victory in the 
1992 election. It is trying now to seize the military advantage 
as well. 
  UNITA, increasingly friendless in the world, is now 
dependent 
on military successes to give it bargaining power in the 
negotiations or, alternatively, to fulfill what some analysts 
believe is the continuing ambition of its leader, Jonas Savimbi, 
for a partition that would give him control of a new republic in 
the south. 
  Undismayed by their long history of failure to smash UNITA, 
the hawks in the MPLA see in the present situation yet another 
chance to win total victory, even without Cuba's help. They are 
going all out for a military solution, pushing the doves for the 
moment into the background. The hardliners were emboldened by 
the United States' decision to recognise the MPLA government and 
by the international sanctions imposed against UNITA. While the 
sanctions have made it difficult for UNITA to get munitions and 
petrol, the MPLA has been spending millions of dollars of its 
oil revenue on strengthening its armed forces. 
  More than R3,500 million [rand] is reportedly being spent on 
buying weaponry from Europe, Brazil and China. The Lisbon 
newspaper O INDEPENDENTE says the MPLA is in addition buying 
R330 million worth of missiles and armoured assault vehicles 
from North Korea. 
  According to the London newsletter AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, R140 
million of the MPLA's military expenditure has gone on a 
contract with the Pretoria-based firm Executive Outcomes to help 
train commando units in counter-insurgency warfare. It is 
presumably under this contract that the firm has hired the 500 
former SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers who are now 
reported to be serving with the MPLA in Angola. 
  When the South Africans first appeared on the MPLA side they 
were said to have been engaged only as security guards to 
protect strategic points such as the oil installations at Soyo 
(which has since been captured by UNITA) and Cabinda, and they 
certainly were once involved in this way. However, some have 
recently been reported killed in action in areas far removed 
from known security points. 
  UNITA said, for instance, that 12 South African mercenaries 
were killed on March 16 in an action in Lunda Norte province, 
between the Lovige and Luxa rivers, an area far from Soyo or 
Luanda. This claim, if true, would indicate the involvement of 
South African mercenaries in the MPLA's current efforts to drive 
UNITA out of the diamond-mining area of Kafunfo in Lunda Norte. 
  UNITA says the South Africans are also being used in an 
offensive against Soyo and that in both areas they are using 
North Korean weapons, among others. It puts the number of South 
African mercenaries at 2,000, but this could include Angolans 
who formerly served with the SADF's 32 Battalion and with 
Koevoet [crowbar; former South-West African police 
counterinsurgency units] in Namibia. 
  Executive Outcomes' manager, Lafras Luitingh, was recently 
quoted as saying: "The successes that the government soldiers 
in Angola have had against UNITA are undoubtedly due to the 
South Africans who are involved there." He may have been 
referring to training, but the deaths of the South Africans 
indicate that they are doing more than that. 
  It seems clear that former SADF soldiers who once fought 
alongside UNITA against the MPLA and the Cubans are now fighting 
against UNITA for the MPLA in a combat as well as a training 
role. In effect, they are doing for the MPLA what the Cubans 
once did, but on a smaller scale. 
  AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL says the new MPLA commando units, 2,000 
men strong, are being used "in a an aggressive strategy, 
employing long- range reconnaissance and self-sustaining 
platoons reminiscent of the Rhodesian Selous Scouts'. It might 
have added that these are equally reminiscent of the SADF Recce 
units that operated with conspicuous success against the MPLA 
and Cuban forces in Angola. 
  The MPLA's current offensive appears to have two main 
objectives in the north: first, to drive UNITA out of the 
Kafunfo diamond area and so deprive it of what is now its main 
source of revenue; second, to cut or restrict UNITA's supply 
lines from Zaire. And in the centre, the aim is to drive UNITA 
out of Huambo, to where it has moved its capital from its former 
headquarters in the bush at Jamba near the Caprivi Strip. 
  UNITA's diamond mining and military operations in Lunda 
Norte 
province are at present beyond effective range of MPLA aircraft, 
and to overcome this disadvantage the MPLA has reportedly been 
improving the airfield at Saurimo. 
  While UNITA is believed to have enough weaponry to wage a 
guerilla war for several more years, it will find it 
increasingly difficult to take on the MPLA in conventional 
warfare or to hold the few cities it now controls. The MPLA 
probably aims at least to drive its enemy back into the bush, 
lessening its political clout and its ability to demand 
concessions in the negotiations. The new commando units might 
be especially useful at this stage. 
  So far, the MPLA offensive has produced no substantial 
gains. 
Nevertheless, UNITA's vulnerability to the MPLA tactics may have 
been exposed when it made important concessions in the 
negotiations, beginning with an acceptance of the fact, if not 
the manner, of its defeat in the 1992 elections. Concessions 
have been made by both sides in the Lusaka talks, and 
significant progress has been made on military and political 
issues. But the MPLA has steadfastly rejected UNITA's demand 
for the governorship of the provinces in which it won the 
majority of votes in the election. Since these include the 
southern provinces of Huambo, Benguela and Cuando Cubango, the 
MPLA understandably fears that control of them would enable 
UNITA to secede. 
  Never far from the centre of the negotiations is the old 
problem of how to fit the ambitious and strong-willed Dr Savimbi 
into a new dispensation that must inevitably be built around a 
government dominated by the MPLA. But that, too, will probably 
have to await the outcome of the struggle now being waged on the 
battlefield.

Mozambique that there will be no general strike within the 
Mozambican Police force. He was reacting to a letter sent to 
him by members of the police force. In a letter published by 
the weekly SAVANA newspaper, police agents said they would be 
going on general strike as of 1 May and presented demands such 
as salary increases and promotions. 
  Interior Minister Manuel Antonio said the letter had been 
written by an opportunistic group, including some officers, that 
have infiltrated the police force. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Four accords concerning the creation of the new 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, were signed in Maputo 
yesterday by General Tobias Dai, on behalf of the government, 
and General Edmundo de Morais, of the Mozambique National 
Resistance. 
  Those documents dealt with hierarchical structure, general 
organization, and the organization and training of the battalion 
of special forces and of air force personnel. 
  Aldo Ajello, head of the UN Operations in Mozambique, said 
that the signing of those documents is a step forward toward 
pacifying the country.

  [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Mozambique, says he was not aware that $17 
million had been earmarked for the Trust Fund [preceding two 
words in English] for political parties, including the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], as was reported in 
today's NOTICIAS. The newspaper was citing a source from the 
United Nations in New York. 
  The top UN official in Mozambique said he doubts whether the 
source can make available $17 million, when [words indistinct] 
requires such assistance. Ajello said the UN Operations in 
Mozambique [Unomoz] had a draft document drawn up in New York, 
which has taken into account Unomoz's recommendations in Maputo. 
Ajello said this document cannot fix the value of the Trust Fund 
because it is established on the basis of voluntary 
contributions from donor countries. 
  Aldo Ajello said on the basis of information collected by 
Unomoz, a minimum amount of $2.8 million has been established 
for the Trust Fund. 
  The UN representative in Maputo also spoke about the return 
of the Italian contingent. He said that these troops were 
expected to return by the end of this month. 
  [Begin Ajello recording, in English fading into Portuguese 
translation] We expect that this operation will be completed by 
the end of this month. Regarding the Beira Corridor's security, 
we are deploying other available forces along the corridor and a 
new plan has almost been concluded. The withdrawal of the 
Italian contingent was announced a long time ago, and, 
unfortunately, it cannot be renegotiated because there is no 
government in Italy. Thus, the battalion has begun its 
withdrawal in phases. Ajello said a plan has already been drawn 
up to face the situation, because the UN Security Council had 
already requested that the UN reduce its forces in Mozambique. 
So, it is not the only contingent that will leave Mozambique. 
Other forces to be withdrawn from Mozambique will be announced 
in due time. The reduction of military contingents will not, 
however, affect Unomoz's operational capacity. Some forces will 
be reduced, but the country will not receive new UN battalions 
[words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Regarding the confinement and demobilization of government 
and Renamo forces, Ajello said the numbers are encouraging. On 
the government side, only 55 percent of troops have been 
confined, while Renamo has already confined 80 percent of its 
troops. The government has, however, promised to confine 100 
percent of its troops by next week. Regarding the 
demobilization process, the opposite is true. The government is 
demobilizing a greater percentage of troops than Renamo.

<F P=106> [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk, IFP </F>
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC President Nelson Mandela 
at the Union Buildings in Pretoria--live] 
  [Text] [De Klerk] Ladies and gentlemen, before I make the 
statement as political leader, let me just, as host, say that 
logistically you will be provided with a short press statement 
before you leave. It is being duplicated at the moment, to 
which there will be an addendum which sets out in detail the 
agreement reached which will after these statements be formally 
signed here by the three principals and Professor Okuru, who is 
a professor from Kenya and to whom recognition is given in the 
statement which will be issued with regard to the constructive 
and positive role, a very helpful role he has played in bringing 
us to this moment of this agreement. Part of the agreement will 
refer also to an addendum B, which will not be ready now. It 
will be distributed later in the day because certain details 
still have to be decided. That's just on the logistical side. 
  Now may I say, as state president and as leader of the 
National Party [NP], that I am extremely pleased that after 
months of negotiation, after the intensive talks of the past 
week and more, but specifically after the intensive interaction 
and negotiation of the past days, we have reached agreement this 
morning between the government of the National Party, the 
KwaZulu Government and Inkatha, and the African National 
Congress which will result in the participation in the election 
on the scheduled dates from 26 to 28 April of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] throughout the country. 
  The agreement also encompasses the amendment of the 
constitution in two respects with regard to the Kingdom of 
kwaZulu, and Parliament will be called together in all 
probability on Monday [25 April] to consider those amendments. 
The agreement farther entails that there will be a mediation 
process after the election. 
  This agreement, I believe, removes one of the last main 
causes for tension and violence in the Republic of South Africa, 
and it is my deepest hope that this agreement will bring to an 
end the violence in our country, and that all South Africans, 
whatever party they support, will now take hands, exercise their 
free and democratic right to vote for the party of their choice, 
so that we can bring our country to the great moment for which 
all of us have been working for so long -- that of having a 
government of national unity. The great moment of launching our 
nation on the road of reconciliation, the great moment of all 
the significant leaders in this country starting to cooperate to 
work for a better life for all our people. I thank God that we 
have even, at this late stage, reached this agreement, and I say 
to my opponents, to both sides of them, that it is my sincere 
hope that our supporters will follow the lead of their leaders 
and will ensure that this election will be free and fair, will 
be a triumph for the South African nation. I would like to 
express my thanks to all those who have contributed over the 
weeks and months to also help us cross this last and important 
bridge. 
  [Buthelezi] Ladies and gentlemen, the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's Central Committee decided at a meeting on Sunday 17 
April to contest the elections at the national... [brief break 
in transmission] to the constitution to be made to secure the 
kingdom of KwaZulu and the future of His Majesty the King of the 
Zulus, as a constitutional monarch. The decision of the Central 
Committee was further made conditional upon the final 
formulations for provisions for the existence of the Zulu 
kingdom and the role of His Majesty being agreed to through 
mediation. 
  In a series of meetings which took place on Sunday, Monday, 
and today, final agreement was reached securing the kingdom of 
KwaZulu and the role of His Majesty. I spoke to His Majesty, 
and the president, President de Klerk, spoke to His Majesty, and 
also the president of the ANC. I, therefore, am pleased to 
announce that the Inkatha Freedom Party will contest elections 
in the national and provincial levels, even though it's so late 
in the day. The entry of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] into 
the national and regional levels will be made possible by 
suitable amendments to ballot papers, and there will be certain 
relations in the procedures laid down for the registration of 
parties and the publication of electoral lists. I'm pleased to 
announce that the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] have promised their full 
cooperation to make the IFP's entry into elections possible. 
The Inkatha Freedom Party has decided to make the kind of 
compromise which make...would make its entry into elections 
possible in order to avoid a great deal more bloodshed and 
carnage which we have been witness to in the last nine years and 
even more intensely in the last...in the recent months. 
  Only the IFP held the firm two principles right until the 
very last moment and we did everything in our power to eliminate 
the very worst elements of the 1993 constitution. The best in 
the constitution can be attributed to the IFP's interventions 
and the long struggle it waged to ensure that the country as a 
whole benefited from a constitution which would lay the 
foundations for a democratic future. 
  Central to the IFP's concerns were the need to ensure viable 
regional government with the minimum interference by the state. 
It is to this end that the IFP finally managed to negotiate a 
secure role for his majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the 
guarantee of the future existence of the Zulu kingdom. In 
securing these things, the IFP has guaranteed that provincialism 
in the kwaZulu-Natal province will set standards which other 
provinces will be encouraged to adopt in their own search for 
provincial constitutional futures. 
  The IFP previously succeeded in securing amendments in the 
1993 constitution which will enable provinces to adopt 
constitutions of their own choice. The IFP also secured the 
right of provinces to adopt constitutions which will not be 
confined to the structures laid down for the provinces in the 
1993 constitution. The IFP's negotiation victory in securing 
the role of his majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the 
continued existence of the kingdom of KwaZulu is, therefore, a 
victory for the principle of self-determination from which the 
whole country will benefit. 
  I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Professor Washington 
Okumu for the role he played in making it possible to reach the 
agreement which will result in the IFP entering elections. He 
was an additional appointment as adviser to the international 
mediating team and remained on in South Africa when other 
mediators left for their various international destinations. It 
was his personal intervention which made the final negotiation 
breakthrough possible. When my spirits were down, ladies and 
gentlemen, after the international mediation had been aborted, 
and I was leaving Johannesburg for Ulundi on Friday 15 April, I 
received a message at the airport from Professor Washington 
Okumu, that he wanted to meet me at the airport and would be 
there in 20 minutes' time. I just want to say, to give you a 
background that I've known Professor Okumu for more than 20 
years. I even met him at a prayer breakfast in Washington, and 
we have kept...been kept in touch purely on the basis of 
Christian fellowship. I waited at the air...Lanseria Airport 
for as long as I could in the morning of 15 April for Prof. 
Okumu but as two of my colleagues had appointments with his 
majesty the king that day I had to leave before he arrived. 
However, the aircraft had hardly been airborne when I was told 
that there was a problem and that we had to turn back. 
Fortunately, Professor Okumu was still there, and I said that 
it was as though God had prevented me from leaving and I was 
there like Jonah was brought back through the whale. I told 
Professor Okumu that my forced return was a godsend. He 
insisted that everything should be done to try and see if lost 
mediation could be retrieved and that I should do everything I 
could to negotiate, even at this late hour, the IFP's 
participation in the election. I shared with Professor Okumu 
the IFP's problems, the fact that the IFP took a decision not to 
participate, because of its serious concerns regarding his 
majesty the king -- which had not been met and that I could not 
disregard that. If I did so, I would be committing treason. 
  Professor Okumu said that everything, notwithstanding, he 
was 
going to see Mr. Mandela, whom he has known, I must say, for a 
long time and that he was also going to see President de Klerk. 
I had hardly arrived back in Ulundi on Friday when Professor 
Okumu telephoned and said that he had been in touch with the 
govern...[pauses] with government who said they were quite 
prepared to look at the concerns that I expressed. 
  Professor Okumu was very firm and said I should telephone 
the state president at 3 o'clock that afternoon. Before I did 
so, the state president telephoned me and asked me what it was I 
wanted to say to him. I said that I gathered from Professor 
Okumu that he wanted to talk to me, and I gave him the 
background. 
  The state president told me that the issue of the IFP's 
participation was sympathetically looked at by the government, 
that they were prepared to look at participation on a regional 
level, but I told the state president that there was no way the 
IFP would participate at regional level only, because the IFP 
has support all over South Africa. The state president said he 
was quite prepared to look at the possibilities. I said the 
only way this could be done was if the issue of his majesty the 
king was addressed. The state president said a special session 
of parliament could be called to effect amendments to the 1993 
constitution, and I reminded the state president that His 
Majesty said he wanted matters dealt with before elections. 
  On Saturday, Professor Okumu telephoned again, and on Sunday 
we met in Durban where we both were attending a Jesus rally 
organized by Africa Enterprise, but Professor Okumu had to leave 
immediately without attending the Jesus rally, and he gave me a 
draft on a proposed agreement which could be entered into 
between myself, the president of the ANC and the South African 
Government. The draft incorporated many of the answers to our 
needs and I gave my provisional approval to it. Professor Okumu 
said he was flying to Cape Town to talk to Mr. Mandela, and I 
showed the draft to Mr. Jacob Zuma and Mr. Jan Schutte who were 
with me at the Jesus rally, before I put it before the Central 
Committee that afternoon, because that is the way I exercise my 
leadership, referring all crucial matters to Central Committee 
which is the final decision-making body between (?direct) 
conferences. 
  By arrangement with the president, I met him in Pretoria 
yesterday, 18 April. I was presently surprised to find that the 
draft agreement had been shown to Mr. Mandela, the president of 
the ANC, who said he wanted to study it for clarification but by 
and large he had no problem with it. After further negotiations 
the draft agreement with the necessary amendments were accepted 
by myself, Mr. Mandela, and Mr. de Klerk, and I must add that 
there was a meeting also with the secretary general of the ANC, 
Mr. Ramaphosa, and Mr. Joe Slovo. 
  I wish to pay tribute to Professor Okumu. He is really a 
remarkable man who had studied under Dr. Kissinger at Harvard. 
I paid tribute to the shuttle diplomacy initiated and what has 
been achieved through it. I'll never forget the picture of him 
as I returned after our plane had problems, waiting for me at 
the airport, larger than life. [laughter] I will also pay 
tribute to both President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, for the 
fact that they were receptive to the suggestions that were made 
to the three of us by Professor Okumu. I believe that as a 
result of the signing of this memorandum of agreement that South 
Africa may well have been saved from disastrous consequences of 
unimaginable proportions and has been put on a course which I 
hope will lead to long-lasting peace, democracy, and meaningful 
federalism. As I said, we phoned his majesty the king, and 
Prince Gideon will read just a short statement which his majesty 
the king has issued today. 
  [Prince Gideon] A statement by His Majesty Zwelithini 
Goodwill kaBhekuZulu, king of the Zulu nation, on 19 April 1994: 
I have been informed of the progress made in the deputations 
between the Inkatha Freedom Party, the KwaZulu government, the 
African National Congress, and the National Party, South African 
Government, with respect to the definition of outstanding 
constitutional issues in matters related to the claims and 
demands of the Zulu nation for the restoration of the Kingdom of 
KwaZulu. 
  Arrangements have been made for the calling of a special 
session of the South African Parliament to pass an agreed set of 
constitutional amendments related to the status and position of 
the Zulu monarch. Furthermore, it has been agreed that all 
other outstanding issues related to the claims and demands of 
the Zulu nation with respect of the restoration of the sovereign 
Kingdom of KwaZulu will be addressed by way of international 
mediation which will commence as soon as possible. For this 
reason, I think that a process has begun which addresses the 
serious concerns of the Zulu nation and of the Zulu monarchy, 
and that the Zulu nation should now freely support this process, 
including participation in the elections, in the hope that our 
claims and demands will be finally fulfilled. 
  [Mandela] I am sorry to displace you. [laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] It's a bad omen. [laughter] 
  [Mandela] Firstly, I would like to express my deepest 
sympathy to the family of Ken Oosterbroek, the photographer who 
was killed yesterday under very tragic circumstances. I 
sincerely hope that he will be the last journalist to die in our 
country as a result of this senseless violence. 
  Turning to the agreement, I want to say, this agreement is a 
leap forward for peace, reconciliation, nation building, and an 
inclusive election process. Nothing is more precious than 
saving lives of human beings. Nothing is more urgent than the 
possibility that by making this process all inclusive, to get 
all political parties to take part in this election, that is 
something which deserves the support of all leaders and of all 
those who love South Africa at heart. The 26th, 27th and 28th 
April are dates which are sacrosanct, and the election must take 
place on that day [as heard]. The whole country, including the 
overwhelming majority of Zulus, of our Zulu communities, want to 
participate in this election, because this election is what we 
have been fighting for throughout the years. 
  All of us have been in this fight in various ways. Some 
became more prominent than others in the cause of the fight, but 
what we must accept is that this was a collective effort, 
because for the one man in the frontline, you need 10 to help 
him. All of us, as we sit here, are responsible for the fight 
to make democracy a reality in our country. The people, 
therefore, look to us to give the leadership, worthy of their 
hard work and their sacrifices. Once again the African National 
Conference has bent backward to make sure that there is a 
peaceful solution, that we accommodate those who have been 
outside this process, for whatever reason. A solemn 
responsibility rests upon us, and that responsibility is not 
going to be discharged through finger pointing. It is for all 
of us, each, to take responsibility, to roll up his sleeves, and 
to honor the human spirit by ensuring that there is 
reconciliation, that is nation building. 
  A bright future awaits our country, and the reports that we 
see in the press about people stockpiling, fearing that after 27 
April there are going to be riots, the minorities in this 
country are going to be attacked -- these are mischievous 
statements which have no foundation whatsoever. One understands 
that in the course of a transition the minotiries in particular 
immediately become concerned. I have said before, and I want to 
repeat it on this important occasion, that the African National 
Congress is aware that when there is a transformation, everyone 
becomes concerned, wants to know -- what is going to happen to 
my family, to myself, to the national values in which I believe, 
have I got a future in this country? The fact that there are 
organizations outside the process who are not participating, and 
the escalating violence has been a source of great concern to 
many innocent people in this country, and through this 
agreement, we hope we will allay the fears which have made some 
of our talented people to leave the country with their skills, 
with their knowledge, with their expertise, and we hope that 
through this settlement they will regard it as an invitation to 
them to come back to their country and serve it, and that those 
who are on the verge of leaving will now realize that they have 
nothing to fear in the future. 
  The entire people of South Africa, or our country, have 
gained through this initiative, and we would like to reassure 
everybody that we are concerned about our state of economy. From 
the moment we came out of prison, returned from exile, one of 
the strategies we have adopted is to involve business in 
discussions as to how to address the problems of our country, 
both political and economic. We have done that because we 
realize the critical role of business, if we are going to get 
our economy to grow, to generate wealth, to offer employment. 
Not only did we make this move, but we made sure that we have 
it in an organized manner, in the form of the National Economic 
Forum which brings together workers, employers and the 
government, so that the problems between workers, between labor 
and capital, can be resolved without disrupting the economy of 
the country. These are steps which we have taken because we 
want to reassure everybody that we have the interest of the 
country at heart. And I sincerely hope that through this 
arrangement, this agreement, we will be able to bring about 
stability, confidence -- both from the point of view of our 
business and from the point of view of foreign investors. 
  I must indicate that I have traveled widely throughout the 
various continents, and I have spoken to heads of states, heads 
of government, to organizations like the International Monetary 
Fund, the World Bank, appealing to them to come to our 
assistance as far as resources are concerned. Doing so because 
I know that everybody wants to lead a better life. I stand firm 
once again in my belief that we are one country, we are one 
people, Africans, coloreds, Indians, and whites, and it is in 
that spirit that I have taken part in this initiative. I thank 
you.

  [Text] In Maringue, Afonso Dhlakama has been reelected 
president of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] and 
chosen to run for the October presidential elections. The 
decision was made at Renamo's special congress, which closed 
yesterday. 
  About 400 delegates and guests to the congress, which began 
on 12 April, also adopted the electoral strategy and adapted 
Renamo's structures to the ongoing political situation, some six 
months before the first multiparty elections are due to be held. 
  Speaking at a rally in Maringue yesterday afternoon, 
Dhlakama 
said Renamo has definitely made the transition from an armed to 
an unarmed party. Dhlakama urged the whole world to stop 
regarding Renamo as an armed movement as of yesterday. He 
pointed out: We no longer have arms and I have been demobilized. 
  He said it was against his will that he was reelected Renamo 
president and candidate to the presidential elections. He 
added: I am very tired. I wanted to take a break. He said his 
continued leadership is a vote of confidence on the part of his 
colleagues in his political ability. 
  Dhlakama revealed that Renamo's electoral strategy will be 
based on two principles -- namely, the massive registration of 
voters and the education of sympathizers so that they may vote 
for his movement in the October elections. 
  Renamo's electoral campaign will be run by a foreign 
enterprise whose name he declined to reveal. He admitted, 
however, that it is Portuguese and includes experts from other 
nationalities. The Renamo leader said he felt surrounded by 
powerful adversaries, but is convinced of a victory for him and 
his movement. 
  The Renamo leader once again accused the government of 
transferring thousands of troops into the police force, and of 
training youths in Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Niassa to fight 
his movement should it win the elections. He said private 
security companies are specifically designed to intimidate the 
people. He added: those problems pose a threat to peace in 
Mozambique. 
  Also a threat was what he described as the continual support 
for Frelimo by several neighboring countries which he did not 
identify. He said such countries plan to send about 500,000 of 
their citizens to vote for Frelimo in the October elections. 
Dhlakama said he believes Mozambicans will know how to make the 
best choice. 
  He said those problems could be resolved at the negotiating 
table between President Joaquim Chissano and himself. He said: 
I need to talk to Frelimo to guarantee that there will never be 
war in Mozambique. He urged neighboring countries to assist in 
Mozambique's democratization process. 
  At its special congress, Renamo adopted a new flag. In 
addition to the old colors, the new flag shows a guinea fowl and 
three arrows, though these are displayed horizontally. 
According to Dhlakama, the arrows stand for passive resistance. 
The guinea fowl is a bird that refuses to be tamed, and once in 
captivity commits suicide. 
  A resolution adopted by the congress says Renamo now has 
provincial, district, and location councils. The National 
Council remains. New tasks have been allocated to all delegates 
and to advisers serving with provincial governors. It appears 
that Afonso Dhlakama and his followers have bet on the influence 
that former traditional leaders may have among the rural 
electorate, in view of the large number of chiefs who attended 
the congress. 
  Dhlakama introduced to newsmen the ministers of Renamo's 
shadow cabinet. He said if it wins the elections, Renamo's 
cabinet will include members of other political parties, 
including one from Frelimo.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulgar] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The Multiparty Negotiating 
Council [MPNC] will convene at the World Trade Centre on 
Wednesday [20 April] to draw up legislative amendments to 
include the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in the elections. 
  Parliament will sit in Cape Town on Monday to pass the 
amendments, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer told 
Tuesday's meeting of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. 
  The MPNC session follows Tuesday's historic agreement in 
Pretoria between President F W de Klerk, African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The agreement was hailed as an 
"historic breakthrough" by Mr Meyer and ANC Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa. 
  They said it would contribute towards the goal of an 
all-inclusive constitutional settlement and would help bring 
peace and stability. 
  The TEC will meet after the MPNC session to ratify the 
legislative amendments. The amendments include changes to the 
Electoral Act, the Interim Constitution and the 13th 
constitutional principle providing for the future position of 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Political leaders struck an upbeat tone at the TEC meeting 
which was delayed for several hours because key members were 
involved in the talks at the Union Buildings. "This agreement 
could make a major contribution to reducing the violence in the 
country," Mr Meyer said. 
  He said it would reduce tension. The parties viewed the 
agreement as a "major achievement" which would bring joy to all 
South Africans. He said the agreement did not resolve all the 
outstanding problems but for the moment it was a major 
contribution. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said it was an agreement of "great and 
historical significance" and that it had laid the foundation for 
a peaceful transition. He described it as "the mother of all 
breakthroughs" and said people could "heave a sigh of relief" 
that it had been reached. He urged all parties to accept the 
agreement so that it could have a rapid passage through the MPNC. 
  Mr Meyer said Parliament had to be recalled because it was 
not possible to change constitutional principles after the 
election. 
  He said that in terms of Section 74 of the constitution, 
changes to constitutional principles could only be made before 
the elections. 
  In terms of the "agreement for reconciliation and peace", 
Section 160 of the constitution dealing with the powers and 
functions of provinces would be amended to "provide for the 
institution, role, authority and status of a traditional monarch 
in the province, and shall make such provision for the Zulu 
monarch in the case of the province of kwaZulu/Natal". 
  Constitutional principle 13 will be amended by the addition 
of the paragraph: "Provisions in a provincial constitution 
relating to the institution, role, authority and status of a 
traditional monarch shall be recognised and protected in the 
constitution." 
  The amendments will satisfy the IFP and the Zulu royalists 
for the time being until they are further elaborated upon in 
international mediation after the elections. 
  Apart from the constitutional amendments, there are also 
amendments to the Electoral Act to allow the IFP to take part in 
the election after its provisional registration lapsed when it 
failed to submit lists of candidates last month. 
  Mr Meyer said the IFP's registration would be "reopened" and 
that it would be given time to file candidate lists. He added 
that this concession was only in respect of the IFP. 
  He said the negotiators had agreed that the IFP's name, logo 
and the picture of its party leader would be printed on adhesive 
strips which would be attached to the bottom of ballot papers by 
electoral officers. A proposal that it be added to the back of 
ballot papers had not been acceptable to the IFP, he said. 
  He said the Independent Electoral Commission's task of 
arranging the election had to be kept in mind and that it would 
not be possible for other parties to change their candidate 
lists.

<F P=106> ["Final communique" issued by the Fourth Session of the </F>
Frelimo Party Central Committee in Matola on 28 March] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  1. The Fourth Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party 
Central Committee Ordinary Session was held at the Party Central 
School in the city of Matola from 21 to 28 March 1994 under the 
chairmanship of Frelimo Party Chairman Comrade Joaquim Alberto 
Chissano. 
  2. The event took place a few months before general 
multiparty elections and at a time when Mozambicans are involved 
in the consolidation of peace and deepening of democracy. 
  3. This session was characterized by a profound debate on 
the 
Mozambican nation and its future, and the life of our party. 
<H5>  Quorum </H5>
  4. The fourth session of the Frelimo Party Central Committee 
was attended by 143 permanent members and 15 candidate members, 
with the absence of 33 permanent members for justified reasons. 
<H5>  Agenda </H5>
  5. The committee unanimously approved the proposed working 
agenda, which included the following themes: 
1. Report on activities carried out by the party between 
the third and fourth sessions of the Central Committee; 
2. Report from the Audit Committee; 
3. Report from the Elections Office; 
4. The situation of the peace process; 
5. Criteria for selecting deputy candidates; 
6. Proposal of the government's program for the 
post-electoral period. 
<H5>  Opening speech </H5>
  6. In the opening speech, the comrade chairman of the 
Frelimo 
Party began by greeting the members of the Central Committee, 
and through them, all members and sympathizers of the Frelimo 
Party, who, in the most difficult circumstances and throughout 
the country have unselfishly and militantly been carrying out 
the task of continually establishing our party among all the 
Mozambican people, so as to identify themselves with its most 
noble ideals, by participating in the process for deepening 
democracy and in the effort to consolidate peace, to normalize 
life, and to achieve reconciliation and national unity. 
  7. The comrade chairman made a positive assessment of 
developments relating to the implementation of the General Peace 
Accord, having referred to the major efforts made by the 
government in that regard. 
  8. The comrade chairman expressed his pleasure with the 
significant growth of the Frelimo Party membership between the 
third and fourth sessions, with 359,700 new members joining the 
party. 
  9. Noting the great commitment, courage, and resolve of the 
militants in the fulfillment of tasks, the comrade chairman 
spoke of the need for them to double their efforts in view of 
the challenges they are faced with as Frelimo members and 
sympathizers in this period of multiparty democracy. 
  10. The comrade chairman urged all Frelimo militants to 
actively and effectively intervene in the search for innovative 
solutions to the problems faced by our society. 
  11. He noted the need for greater support for the 
government's programs at all levels, as well as for strengthened 
coordination between the party and the government with a view to 
promoting a society of peace, democracy, unity, justice, and 
progress for all Mozambicans. 
  12. In his speech, Comrade Chairman Joaquim Alberto Chissano 
stressed the role and historical responsibility of members and 
sympathizers, as well as society in general, to ensure an 
overwhelming Frelimo Party victory in the first general 
multiparty elections, to guarantee peace and normalization, and 
to consolidate democracy, national unity, progress, and social 
justice in the Mozambican fatherland. 
  13. The comrade chairman saluted the positive role played by 
the international community in the implementation of the General 
Peace Accord. 
  14. Finally, he reviewed the latest developments in southern 
Africa. 
  15. The session observed a minute of silence in memory of 
Comrade Luciano Kuling Katambalale, candidate member of the 
Frelimo Party Central Committee, who passed away in Tete 
Province's Angonia District on 10 December 1992. 
<H5>  Report on Activities Carried Out Between the Third and </H5>
Fourth Sessions of the Central Committee 
  16. In assessing activities carried out by the Frelimo Party 
between the third and fourth sessions, the Central Committee 
made important decisions to improve the functioning of party 
organs at this stage of important political, economic, social, 
and cultural transformations promoted by the Frelimo Party. 
  17. Thus, the Frelimo Central Committee decided to 
systematically and suitably upgrade the party's working methods 
in all echelons. 
  18. It recommended the continued adoption of working 
mechanisms and methods at all levels of party structures to 
guarantee that individual members produce a better collective 
work, leading to a more active intervention, permanently 
affecting each militant and sympathizer, as well as all social 
layers, so that they may join Frelimo and actively participate 
in the building of a society of peace, justice, and progress. 
  19. The session stated the need for improved vertical and 
horizontal communication among all party organs. 
  20. Taking into account the need to train Frelimo Party 
members and sympathizers for a more effective and mobilizing 
role in the implementation of its tasks in the community, the 
Central Committee decided to take measures to increase 
production and timely dissemination of study material, 
information, and propaganda. 
  21. The demand for a greater coordination between the party 
and the government at all levels was strengthened with a view to 
improving the operation and effectiveness of party and 
government activities in society. 
  22. In view of demands posed by the electoral campaign and 
the need to increase the party's ability to respond to ongoing 
challenges, the Central Committee decided that it was urgent and 
fundamental to strengthen the Central Committee Secretariat and 
the Provincial Committee Secretariats, recommending the 
Political Commission and provincial committees adopt appropriate 
measures. 
  23. The Frelimo Party Central Committee noted with 
satisfaction the significant growth in members who joined the 
party ranks since its last session as a unequivocal sign of the 
mobilizing capacity of its members and the prestige Frelimo 
enjoys among the Mozambican people. 
  24. The Central Committee urged all its members to redouble 
their efforts and actively participate in each cell, in working 
places, and in residences to ensure the continued popularity of 
the party and a convincing victory in the October 1994 elections. 
  25. The fourth session also recommended the intensification 
of cadre training activities in a pragmatic way, taking into 
account the aims, needs, and priorities of the party. 
  26. Taking into account the necessary funds for the success 
of Frelimo's electoral campaign, the Central Committee: 
A. Recommended all party cells and committees at various 
levels immediately begin fund raising campaigns; 
B. Urged all party members to pay their fees as stated in 
the directive on payment of fees; 
C. Encouraged all party organs to use and manage party 
property in an austere manner. 
  27. Taking into account the level of relationship, 
friendship, cooperation, and solidarity with friendly parties, 
the Central Committee recommended the strengthening of such 
relations, and the mobilization of assistance for the holding of 
our party's electoral campaign. 
  28. Taking into account the domestic and foreign factors 
affecting Mozambique's socioeconomic development, the Frelimo 
Party Central Committee saluted the achievements of the 
Mozambican Government in the fulfillment of the main activities 
provided for in the government's program of action since the 
holding of the Third Frelimo Party Central Committee Session. 
  29. The Central Committee urged the government to continue 
its efforts to implement the General Peace Accord, and the 
activities planned for national reconstruction and normalization 
of life in the country. 
  30. The Frelimo Party Central Committee also urged the 
government to speed up the implementation of measures to ease 
the hardships resulting from the implementation of the Economic 
and Social Rehabilitation Program, particularly among the lower 
income brackets. 
  31. The Central Committee assessed the land problem and 
decided that the government should define mechanisms and 
activities which permit: 
A. Expediting the allocation of land to applicants, 
particularly demobilized soldiers, displaced persons, and 
returnees; 
B. Expediting the process for the legalization of the use 
of land by peasants; 
C. Establishment of mechanisms leading to improved 
management and use of land, and the speedy solution of land 
disputes. 
  32. The Central Committee saluted the government's actions 
in 
assisting in the social reintegration of demobilized soldiers, 
displaced persons, and returnees, and called for greater 
involvement of all national and foreign nongovernmental 
organizations, and concerted action between the latter and local 
government organs. 
  33. The Central Committee also saluted the initiatives of 
the people in support of demobilized soldiers and returnees, 
particularly their integration into social and economic 
structures. 
  34. The Central Committee noted that the people responded 
positively to the appeal for an increase in agricultural 
production during the 1992-93 season, though the problems they 
faced in the bartering of products did not permit the surplus of 
a number of regions to reduce the shortages of others. 
  35. The Central Committee urged the government to take 
measures and adopt mechanisms that will lead to the timely 
intervention of businessmen in the bartering of products to 
encourage agricultural production. 
  36. The Central Committee assessed the situation of 
education 
and recommended the government continue making efforts to: 
A. Continue to speed up the reconstruction of the school 
network, particularly in rural areas; 
B. Guarantee the expansion and maintenance of the school 
network; 
C. Increase the quality of education at all levels; 
D. Promote the expansion of medium and higher education in 
all regions of the country, involving private institutions where 
the state lacks the technical and financial capacity; 
E. Promote in each province the establishment of 
elementary, basic, and medium-level professional training, aimed 
in particular at demobilized soldiers, the unemployed, and 
displaced persons. 
  37. The Central Committee recommended the government take 
measures to promote the professional and social enhancement of 
teachers. 
  38. The session reviewed health issues and recommended the 
government: 
A. Continue efforts to renovate health units, particularly 
in rural areas; 
B. Guarantee the continuation of the program for expanding 
the health network; 
C. Improve assistance to patients; 
D. Define mechanisms leading to an improved supply of 
medicines and hospital equipment. 
  39. The Central Committee recommended the government take 
measures to promote the professional and social enhancement of 
physicians, nurses, and other health technicians. 
  40. The Central Committee decided to recommend the 
government 
define mechanisms and actions to minimize shortcomings in the 
transport services rendered by public enterprises. 
  41. Regarding housing, the Central Committee decided to 
recommend the government: 
A. Speed up the process of the selling houses in line 
with the existing laws; 
B. Encourage the building of housing; 
C. Define mechanisms to facilitate access to construction 
materials. 
  42. Regarding the protection of the environment sector, the 
Central Committee recommended the government continue actions to: 
A. Adopt and implement a master intervention plan to 
reduce the effects of erosion and pollution in the country, 
particularly in the main cities and along the coast; 
B. Protect species in danger of extinction and guarantee 
the effective management of our wildlife and forest 
resources. 
  43. The Central Committee recommended the government speed 
up 
the implementation of water programs, paying particular 
attention to the opening of wells and fountains in suburban and 
rural areas. 
<H5>  Report From the Elections Office </H5>
  44. With a view to the Frelimo Party's preparations for the 
campaign for the first general multiparty legislative and 
presidential elections in October 1994, the Central Committee 
reviewed and saluted the activities carried out by the Elections 
Office and decided to: 
A. Direct the Elections Office to adopt mechanisms and 
methods to enhance the effectiveness of its operation; 
B. Recommend the Elections Office speed up the 
organization of its activities; 
C. Actively and closely continue with preparations for the 
electoral campaign at grassroots level, taking into account the 
complexity of the voters' interests; 
D. Continue with actions to mobilize resources for the 
success of the campaign. 
  45. The Central Committee saluted the local initiatives of 
the people in assisting the Frelimo Party, particularly in the 
preparation of the electoral campaign, and urged them to 
continue with their activities in coordination with the party's 
grassroots organizations. 
<H5>  The Current Situation of the Peace Process </H5>
  46. The Central Committee assessed the report on the current 
situation of the peace process and noted that: 
A. The Mozambican Government continues to strictly 
implement the General Peace Accord. 
B. Although the international community has been assisting 
in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and in the 
democratization of Mozambican society, the Frelimo Central 
Committee noted with concern a number of patronizing attitudes 
toward Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] by some members 
of the international community, as well as actions likely to 
downplay the seriousness of the violations of the General Peace 
Accord, and to underestimate maneuvers for the nonimplementation 
of agreed timetables by that armed movement. 
C. In open contradiction with its public statements on the 
upholding of democracy and rights, Renamo continues to: 

  -  Ban the movement of citizens in areas under its control, 
thus violating the General Peace Accord and the Constitution of 
the Republic; 
  -  Prohibit the carrying out of economic activities -- namely, 
hunting, fishing, and logging in areas under its control, 
violating the letter and spirit of the General Peace Accord and 
the Constitution of the Republic; 
  -  Assault and detain citizens, intimidating people with threats 
of violence both in areas under its control and in other parts 
of the country, in violation of the fundamental freedom and 
rights of citizens. 
  E. [as published] Renamo has been confining mostly 
children, elderly, and disabled people in assembly areas, with 
no clear-cut explanation about the destination and purpose of 
its men who are really physically and militarily fit to wage 
war. 
F. The Frelimo Central Committee has observed with concern 
that the weapons delivered by Renamo to Unomoz [UN Operations in 
Mozambique] are not only old and obsolete, but do not correspond 
to the principle of one man one weapon. 
  48. [as published] Aware of the need and the imperative for 
peace, the Central Committee salutes all efforts made by the 
government in the search for mechanisms and actions leading to 
the maintenance of an atmosphere of peace, the upholding of 
sovereignty and interests of the Mozambican people within the 
framework of the implementation of the General Peace Accord. 
  49. The Central Committee cautions against maneuvers likely 
to prevent legislative and presidential elections from taking 
place in our country as scheduled in October 1994. Reiterating 
the need for strictly adhering to that date, the Central 
Committee urged the government to define measures to: 
A. Speed up the process of troop confinement; 
B. Guarantee a real and effective disarmament of all 
forces; 
C. Ensure the agreed demobilization of military personnel 
and promote their reintegration; 
D. Actively participate in the formation of the new 
Mozambique defense forces; 
E. Speed up the minesweeping operation, giving priority to 
areas to where people are returning; 
F. Intensify actions to combat crime. 
  50. The Central Committee salutes the international 
community's contribution toward the implementation of the 
General Peace Accord and the deepening of democracy in the 
country, and appeals for continued actions to ensure the success 
of its mission in Mozambique, and a more positive Renamo role in 
the implementation of the General Peace Accord. 
  51. The Central Committee urges the government to speed up 
the effective integration of areas under Renamo control in the 
administration of the Mozambican state, a fact that will 
contribute to real stability and will permit all parties to 
carry out their political activities in those areas. 
<H5>  Situation in Southern Africa </H5>
  52. The Frelimo Central Committee expresses its total 
support 
of the efforts made by the ANC and other progressive parties in 
South Africa to hold the first general multiracial elections in 
an atmosphere of peace and stability in South Africa. Only if 
the democratic forces representing the true aspirations of the 
South African people come into power will South Africa become 
stable and participate effectively in regional cooperation. 
  53. The Frelimo Party Central Committee salutes the spirit 
of tolerance shown by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola] and the Angolan Government in the search 
for solutions leading to the establishment of a lasting peace 
for Angola and its martyred people. The Central Committee urges 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to 
adopt a similar attitude to minimize the suffering of the 
Angolan people. 
  54. The Central Committee expresses the hope that the 
current Malawian political process, characterized by dialogue 
among the different political forces will produce great 
achievements, and that that dialogue may lead to the best ways 
of upholding the interests of the Malawian people. 
<H5>  Criterion For Selecting Candidates to Parliament </H5>
  55. The Frelimo Central Committee reviewed the proposed 
criterion for the selection of candidates for the Assembly of 
the Republic for the October 1994 elections and salutes the 
efforts made by the Electoral Office in the drafting of that 
document. 
  56. Taking into account the need to select the finest sons 
of 
the Mozambican people to uphold their best aspirations, the 
Central Committee decided to: 
A. Accept the registration of people who volunteer as 
candidates at their committees; 
B. Ensure the selection of candidates to Frelimo lists in 
the party's provincial committees. 
  57. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to give priority 
to 
the following people in the composition of its lists: 

  -  Mozambican women 
  -  Youth 
  -  Workers from public and private institutions 
  -  Peasants 
  The Frelimo Central Committee also decided to give special 
importance to the following people in the composition of its 
lists: 

  -  Businessmen 
  -  Intellectuals 
  -  Combatants 
  -  Members of social associations and institutions. 
  58. In line with Frelimo's tradition of rallying the 
support of leading sectors of society in the search for the best 
future for the country, and, in the current circumstances, for 
the consolidation of peace, the strengthening of national unity, 
and the promotion of democracy and progress, the Central 
Committee decided to hold a national meeting of cadres in June 
1994. 
  59. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to hold a special 
session of the Central Committee in June to assess the level of 
readiness of the October 1994 campaign. 
<H5>  Proposal for the Government's Program for the Post Electoral </H5>
Period 
  60. The Frelimo Central Committee assessed the Government's 
Draft Program for the Post Electoral Period. The draft program 
will be reviewed, taking into account the contributions made 
during the current session. The draft program will be submitted 
to the upcoming special session of the Central Committee. 
  61. The Central Committee decided to take part in the 
October 
1994 multiparty elections. 
  62. The Fourth Session of the Central Committee, expressing 
the highest aspirations and the unequivocal will of all Frelimo 
members and sympathizers, decided to declare Frelimo Chairman 
Comrade Joaquim Chissano as a candidate for the post of 
president of the Republic in the presidential elections to be 
held in October 1994. 
  63. The Frelimo Central Committee affectionately salutes all 
the Mozambican people for their commitment to the various tasks 
of national reconstruction. 
  The people have given magnificent lessons in reconciliation 
and building of social harmony in the various parts of the 
country, of which the reception and social reintegration of 
displaced persons and returnees, and the tenderness in 
sheltering orphans and abandoned children are singled out. 
  The Central Committee salutes in particular the youth and 
women for the enthusiastic manner in which they have taken part 
in the consolidation of peace, national unity, and in the 
process of normalization of life. 
  64. The Central Committee salutes the residents of Matola 
for 
the affectionate manner in which they welcome the members of 
that organ, and for the solidarity expressed in messages 
addressed to Frelimo. 
  65. The Central Committee gives thanks for the gifts from 
the 
residents of this city in support of the Fourth Session of the 
Central Committee and the Frelimo electoral campaign. 
  Mozambican people, Frelimo members and sympathizers, women 
and youth, peasants and workers employed by public and private 
institutions, soldiers, intellectuals and combatants, teachers 
and nurses, entrepreneurs, and members of social associations 
and organizations, the Frelimo Central Committee urges everyone 
to take part in large numbers in the first general multiparty 
elections in our country, which we all want to be free and fair. 
  The Frelimo Central Committee urges all Mozambicans to unite 
around Frelimo for the upholding of peace, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, the strengthening of national unity, and 
the building of a democratic society based on progress and 
social justice. 
  Peace, unity, justice, and progress 
  [Dated] Matola, 28 March 1994

about members of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] 
apparently being trained in the north of the territory. This 
follows allegations by a Swazi chief that Volksfront members 
were receiving training in the area. The deputy commissioner of 
the Swazi police, Mr. Esau Dube, said that an investigation in 
this regard had proved fruitless.

  [Text] Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen has 
called on all Afrikaners to vote. He told a business community 
in Krugersdorp that this was a better way of achieving 
self-determination than through an armed struggle. This report 
from Danie Hefers. 
  [Begin recording] [Hefers] Addressing members of the 
Krugersdorp business community in a game park outside the town, 
Gen. Viljoen said he was calling on all Afrikaners to vote. He 
said it would be wrong to lead his people back to the days of 
apartheid when South Africa was seen as the polecat of the 
international community. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] And for that reason I am calling on 
everyone, especially the Afrikaners, to please support us in the 
Freedom Front because all the votes brought out for the Freedom 
Front at provincial level will be yes votes for 
self-determination. 
  [Hefers] Gen. Viljoen also said it would be wrong to ignore 
the Zulu nation in the coming election. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] It has been a big mistake to leave 
out the Zulus in this manner. It is a big mistake to refuse to 
postpone the election. The Freedom Front is involved in 
attempts to have the election postponed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by E. H. Kemp] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town April 18 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] is prepared to enter a coalition with the African 
National Congress to prevent the National Party [NP] gaining 
power in the Western Cape, PAC National Executive Committee 
member Barney Desai said on Monday [18 April]. Speaking at a 
press conference in Kenilworth, Cape Town, he said such an 
alliance was possible only after the elections because the PAC 
wanted to test its support at the polls. 
  "The fate of the Western Cape cannot be left in the hands of 
a minister whose generals are involved in gun-running," he said. 
  Mr Desai questioned the ANC's commitment to its 
Reconstruction and Development Programme and claimed the party 
had given the International Monetary Fund an undertaking to 
restrict the national budget deficit to six percent of gross 
domestic product. 
  Social reconstruction and development would require much 
more 
state spending, he said. 
  "We must not make false promises to our people. They will 
reap the whirlwind when people see that the promises are not 
being met." 
  Mr Desai said South Africa had to create wealth to finance 
social development, instead of borrowing from the IMF and World 
Bank. 
  PAC Western Cape premiership candidate Patricia de Lille 
appealed to the state attorney to charge and bring to trial PAC 
officials detained in connection with the St James' Church and 
Heidelberg Tavern massacres. "Although the PAC and the Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] condemned these atrocities, it 
suited the state and the media to create the impression that the 
PAC and APLA were responsible." 
  She questioned the perception that coloured people held the 
balance of power in the Western Cape. She said a census of the 
region's black population was based on aerial surveys, not a 
proper count. 
  Mrs de Lille accused the ANC and NP in the Western Cape of 
"exploiting for their own selfish political gain deep-rooted 
racism and prejudices which had been created over many years".

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
18 April] 
  [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] met today 
with all security structures to finalise plans for securing 
voting stations. The final number of venues for voting stations 
will be approximately 8,200, because there can be more than one 
voting station at a single venue. The SAP [South African 
Police] have conveyed that they will be able to secure this 
number of venues. 
  Certain problem areas remain, such as Lebowa, Ciskei, Soweto 
and Athlone in the Cape. The IEC has planned specific meetings 
with the regional offices of the SAP, and SADF [South African 
Defense Force], and local police forces where relevant. It is 
hoped to resolve these issues by Wednesday. 
  The SADF will act as support to the SAP, and where the 
deployment of SAP forces is insufficient, the SADF presence will 
become more visible. 
  The Transkei police force will be patrolling voting stations 
in the Transkei.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe has 
expressed concern that security force manpower levels will be 
inadequate unless the planned number of polling stations is 
reduced. Van der Merwe said the SAP's [South African Police] 
assessment was that the levels would suffice only for about 
7,000 stations -- 2,000 fewer than the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC) is planning to set up. 
  Police are responsible for security at polling stations and 
will be able to draw on members of the homeland security forces, 
the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the National 
Peacekeeping Force. But Van der Merwe said even the combined 
forces would be able to handle only 7,000 polling stations. 
  All the necessary security arrangements had been made for 
the 
stations already identified by the IEC, although the commission 
still had to identify where many of these would be situated. 
  "We can attend to these problems, if we can agree on a 
reasonable number," Van der Merwe said. 
  The number of security force members at each station would 
vary depending on the security needs, but on average only five 
security force members could be stationed permanently at each 
station during voting. 
  Van der Merwe said outbreaks of violence could affect the 
manpower requirements of the SAP. All available security force 
members, numbering about 93,000, would be used for the election, 
Van der Merwe said, though not all would be deployed at polling 
stations. 
  Of concern was the morale of the security forces in TBVC 
[Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and some 
homelands, where he said normal policing had all but collapsed, 
placing additional strain on the SAP. "We have taken care of 
our commitments, but there are some problems on matters which we 
are not responsible for." 
  IEC members met police yesterday to review security 
arrangements -- their first meeting since the failure of 
negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom Party. IEC members have 
also expressed concern about security requirements, despite the 
additional call-up of citizen force members. Members were due 
to report for duty on Friday and will be active until next 
month, but it is understood that only a small proportion has 
reported.

15 Apr] 
  [Text] Counting of votes for both national and provincial 
ballots is scheduled to begin at 06h00 on Friday 29 April at 
between 800 and 1000 counting centres around the country, each 
of which will serve a number of voting stations. 
  Counting centre officials will communicate the results from 
their centre to the provincial or sub-provincial offices of the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. They will also announce 
the results--stressing that these are provisional--to the local 
media and other interested parties outside the counting centre. 
  Batch tallies of results will then be forwarded by these 
offices to the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters, and from there 
to the IEC's media and communications centre at Gallagher 
Estate, Midrand, and to the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] at Auckland Park. 
  Running totals for the national assembly--in total and by 
province--and for the provincial legislatures--by province--will 
be released by the IEC at Gallagher Estate every hour, but with 
a disclaimer that these are unofficial and provisional. This is 
because of possible data errors, recounts and adjustments 
resulting from objections by registered parties or the IEC 
monitoring directorate. 
  Results will be broken down into total votes counted, total 
votes counted per party, total spoilt ballot papers, total 
disputed but counted ballots, and total disputed not counted 
ballots. 
  After the last of the results have been determined and 
certified, the decision will be made by the IEC on whether or 
not the election can be certified as having been substantially 
free and fair. 
  If this is deemed so, the IEC will announce the final 
results, firstly by province, and ending with the result of the 
national assembly ballot. 
  Official tallies per party will be announced, as will the 
number of seats per party. Parties will be announced in the 
order in which they appear on the ballot paper, and, while the 
names of individuals to fill the seats will not be announced, 
these will be made available.

  [Text] Johannesburg -- The Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] and SA [South African] banks are finalising plans to 
recruit bank tellers to count ballots. An IEC spokesman 
confirmed that meetings between banks and the commission had 
taken place with a view to hiring bank tellers because of their 
counting skills. 
  The commission plans to recruit over 19,000 counters and 
although bank tellers will not make up the total number, the 
commission hopes they will comprise a significant portion. It 
is understood that tellers have been offered R350 [rand] per day 
of counting, plus travel expenses. Counting is expected to take 
two days. 
  Meanwhile, the commission has estimated that 3.5 million 
temporary voter cards have been printed by the Home Affairs 
Department, one million of which have already been issued. The 
commission has changed the registration process for the issuing 
of the cards to avoid the long queues that have occurred due to 
the complicated forms. The commission has pointed out that ID 
documents, reference books and identity cards for temporary 
identity certificates can be used and that people with these 
documents need not apply for temporary voter cards. 
  The IEC has released the total number of eligible voters in 
the different regions. The total number of voters will be 
22,709,152. The approximate number in each of the regions are 
Western Cape (2.4 million), Northern Cape (440,000), Eastern 
Cape (3.2 million), [Orange] Free State (1.6 million), Natal 
(4.6 million), the Northern West (1.7 million), the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] (4.9 million), the 
Eastern Transvaal (1.6 million) and the Northern Transvaal (2.3 
million).

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
18 April] 
  [Text] Each of the approximately 10,000 voting stations in 
the country will be surrounded by an area with controlled 
entrances and exits. This "inner perimeter" as it is known, 
will be opened at 07h00 on each of April 27 and 28, and will 
close at 19h00. Voters who have entered the inner perimeter 
before the closing time on either day will be allowed to 
continue to vote. Strict security measures will be applied at 
all voting stations, and no member of the public will be allowed 
into the inner perimeter if he or she is in possession a weapon 
of any kind. Bags and/or parcels will be subject to search. 
  An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] official will be 
on 
hand to deal with any general inquiries, to ensure that voters 
are in possession of the correct identity documents, and to help 
the elderly or disabled to the front of the queue. 
  At the entrance to the voting station, a further two IEC 
officials will ensure that the required documentation is ready, 
and will direct each voter via an usher to the ultra-violet (UV) 
scanning table, which is controlled by an IEC official. The 
voter will be asked to place his or her hands, palms down, under 
the blue UV light. 
  If an ink-mark is detected, the voter will be escorted to 
the 
presiding officer's table, where one of three IEC officials will 
again check the voter's hands beneath a UV light, and make a 
ruling on whether to allow the voter to proceed with voting, or 
be escorted from the inner perimeter. If no ink-mark is 
detected, the voter will be directed to the document-checking 
table, where a relevant and valid identity document -- as set 
out by the IEC -- will be requested and checked. 
  If the identity document presented by the voter does not 
comply with the requirements, the voter will be taken to the 
presiding officer's table, where a decision will be made on 
whether or not the voter may continue to vote, or be escorted 
from the inner perimeter. 
  If the document complies with the IEC requirements, it will 
be market with an invisible ink and returned to the voter. 
Temporary voter cards (TVC's) issued to voters for the purpose 
of the election will be retained by the IEC official at the 
document checking table at this stage. 
  The voter will then be directed to the ink-marking table, 
where the back of the fingers of the voter's right hand 
(including the fingers) will be marked with an invisible ink by 
an official. If this should be impractical or impossible, the 
voter will be taken to the presiding officer's table, where his 
or her details will be taken down and kept together with reasons 
for the ink-marking not being possible. 
  Voters will be given a paper towel or tissue with which to 
wipe their ink-marked hand, and will be asked again to put the 
hands under the UV light. If the ink-mark does not show up, the 
marking procedure will be repeated. 
  When ink-marking is completed, the voter will be directed to 
the national ballot paper issue table, which is controlled by 
two IEC officials. The first official will tear a single 
national ballot paper out of the ballot bjok and hand this to 
the second official, who will fold it three times -- in half 
from top to bottom, from right to left in one-third, and from 
right to left in half again. The official voting station stamp 
will then be placed on the paper, which will be handed to the 
voter. 
  The voter will be asked whether he or she requires 
assistance 
in voting because of blindness, illiteracy or disability. If 
so, this will be arranged by the officials at the presiding 
officer's table. 
  If not, the voter will be ushered to the first available 
voting booth, and left alone to make his or her mark on the 
national ballot paper and folding it. On leaving the booth, the 
voter will be taken to the national ballot box table, where an 
IEC official will check the folded ballot paper -- without 
infringing secrecy -- to ensure that it bears the correct voting 
station stamp before the voter is allowed to place the paper in 
the national ballot box. 
  The voter will then be asked if he or she would like to cast 
a vote in the provincial ballot. If yes, he or she proceeds to 
the provincial ballot paper issue table. If no, the voter will 
be escorted to the voting station exit. 
  If the voter does want to vote in the provincial ballot, the 
procedure is identical to that of the national ballot -- a 
ballot paper is issued, folded, stamped, marked and placed in 
the provincial ballot box. 
Note: The presiding officer's table is staffed by officials who 
are available to provide assistance and resolve discrepancies or 
disputes.

<F P=106> [Report by Louise Marsland] </F>
  [Excerpts] A barrage of television cameras and press 
photographers from the world's media will greet politicians as 
they roll up in their limos through the stately marble-and-glass 
entrance to Gallagher Estate on the day or night on which South 
Africa's final election results will be made known. The 
surrounding 14th ha [hectares] of the estate's landscaped 
gardens, with Koi ponds, gazebos and secret pathways, will form 
a magnificent backdrop to the historic event unfolding over the 
next two weeks. 
  It is in these tranquil surroundings that Independent 
Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler 
will have to decide whether all was free and fair and when to 
release the final election results. [passage omitted] 
  A state-of-the-art media centre is being constructed in a 
hall as big as an aircraft hangar. About 800 special pay phones 
will be installed, 150 of which will have modem facilities to 
plug into laptop computers. There will also be about 160 
televisions, computers, fax machines and printing facilities. 
Fastfood outlets and bars set up on the estate will operate 
almost 24 hours. 
  A video wall in the media centre and closed-circuit 
television, linked to IEC offices, will keep everyone informed. 
[passage omitted] 
  The media centre will be operational from Wednesday, when 
the 
IEC will begin press briefings at the estate. The commission 
has been provided with offices between the media centre and the 
main auditorium which will be used for press briefings. 
  Election days -- April 26, 27 and 28 -- will see hourly 
briefings to keep the world's press up to date with events at 
the 9,000 polling stations and around the country. 
  After voting closes at 7 pm on April 28, the all-night 
vigils 
will begin for the results. Counting starts at the about 800 to 
1,000 counting stations across the country at 6 am on Friday 
April 19. 
  Votes will be counted in batches of 3,000 and the 
information 
relayed to the IEC head office in Johannesburg via computer. 
The IEC will then release the information to the SABC, which 
will simultaneously relay it to the huge screens at Gallagher 
Estate and to viewers at home. The provisional "score" for each 
political party in both the national and regional elections, 
will be updated constantly by computer. 
  By law, the IEC has between two and 10 days to take a 
decision on the election and release a final result. It is 
expected that the result will be released sooner rather than 
later, so as not to increase the political tension expected over 
the election. 
  Once the IEC has taken a decision on when to release the 
results, guests and the media will be given about four hours' 
notice to assemble in Gallagher's main ballroom and the 
adjoining media centre. 
  About 1,000 guests will be invited to be present in the 
ballroom where the IEC will announce whether the elections were 
free and fair and how many votes each party achieved in the 
national and regional elections. Each political party will be 
allowed a certain number of guests and the rest will be VIPs and 
foreign dignatories. 
  The SABC, as host broadcaster, is in charge of producing the 
show. It is hoped that the "political stars" such as Nelson 
Mandela and F.W. de Klerk will attend the IEC ceremony to accept 
the election "prizes" and address a press conference. [passage

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
19 April] 
  [Text] A network of observers and monitors will be deployed 
before and on the election days to report on the electoral 
process and to ensure that the elections are free and fair by 
applying the guidelines of the Electoral Code of Conduct, as set 
out in the Electoral Act, 1993. 
  More than 14,000 election monitors will be employed by the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] on the election days to 
report any misconduct or breaches of the code. They have the 
power to intervene in disputes and to mediate between disputing 
parties. Monitors fall under the monitoring directorate, which 
has wide powers to investigate alleged electoral offences. 
  On the election days at least one monitor will be stationed 
at each voting station throughout the country. They will try to 
resolve complaints directly or to intervene in disputes to 
defuse conflict. 
  While monitors are paid employees of the IEC and have legal 
powers of intervention, observers are volunteers who can only 
report findings. 
  The role of the observers, particularly domestic observers, 
is fundamental to the election in order to allow civil society 
to observe and report upon the electoral process. There is a 
commitment from the side of the IEC to working closely with all 
observer organisations -- domestic and foreign -- in order to 
ensure that they are able to fulfil this crucial role in the 
election. 
  There will be three kinds of observers: 
  --domestic observers provided by local NGOs [nongovernmental 
organizations]. To date 26 domestic observer organisations, 
which include the primary umbrella body of domestic observers, 
  --and the National Electoral Observer Network (NEON) have 
been registered by the IEC. A full list will be provided to the 
IEC by domestic observer bodies on 22 April 1994. 
  --foreign observers from international non-governmental 
organisations. 77 foreign observer organisations have been 
accredited by the Monitoring Directorate of the IEC. 
  Observers provided by inter-governmental organisations such 
as the United Nations, the Organisation for African Unity, the 
European Union and the Commonwealth. These observers are not 
registered by the IEC, but by the United Nations Observer 
Mission (UNOMSA). The observer organisations will be 
responsible for accommodation, welfare and transport, but will 
be supplied with observer identification and insignia by the IEC. 
  For further information, please contact the Department of 
Media and Public Relations of the IEC. Pieter Cronje: (011)

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
15 April] 
  [Excerpt] People who wish to vote in the general election 
on April 27th and 28th are reminded that they may not bring 
weapons of any kind into the inner perimeter of the voting 
station, i.e. within a 600m radius of the voting station. 
People who do have weapons should either leave them at home or 
take them to a police station for safekeeping. People entering 
the voting area found in possession of a weapon will not be 
allowed to enter the inner perimeter. 
  Voters are also asked to move out of the inner perimeter as 
soon as possible after casting their votes. 
  Subject to local regulations, street vendors are encouraged 
to set up their stands outside the controlled area, i.e. outside 
of a 1.1 km radius, to sell their wares or foodstuffs to voters 
who may wish to congregate beyond the controlled area. 
  The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] would welcome a 
joyous and peaceful celebration of this extraordinary moment in 
South Africa's history, and believes that the creation of a 
festive atmosphere beyond the controlled areas of the voting 
stations would contribute enormously in this regard. "This is 
an election, the most important and the most hopeful, in our 
history. Nearly one billion people around the world will be 
watching us. Let's give ourselves and them an occasion to 
remember with happiness," said Ben van der Ross, the IEC's

<F P=106> [Text of advertisment by the Independent Forum for Electoral </F>
Education; ad shows a sample ballot and offers the following 
instructions] 
  Many people are under the impression that you can vote for 
the Provincial Legislature of your choice from any voting 
station throughout the country. This is not the case. If you 
want to vote for a specific provincial government, you have to 
go to that province in order to cast your vote. 
<H5>  Different papers </H5>
  The ballot papers for Provincial Legislatures are all 
different. The reason is that not all the parties which are 
standing for elections are standing at both national and 
provincial levels. Some will not stand at the national level. 
They will only stand in one or more regions. Likewise, a party 
standing at national level does not necessarily have to stand in 
each of the 9 regions. 
<H5>  One national ballot </H5>
  The national ballot paper is the only one which will be the 
same irrespective of the region where you are voting. This is 
why it is the only one which will be issued to all the regions. 
<H5>  Home and Away </H5>
  If you vote in Johannesburg but your home is in the Western 
Cape, you will not be able to vote for the Western Cape 
Provincial Legislature. If you want your vote to count in the 
Western Cape province you will have to travel to the Western 
Cape and vote there. 
<H5>  Invisible ink </H5>
  Because invisible ink is applied to the hands of those who 
have already voted, it will not be possible to vote in one place 
for the National Assembly and then vote in another region for 
the Provincial Legislature. The ink will still be visible on 
the hands of voters even after the voting days are over. 
  If you work away from your home but want to vote for the 
regional government in your home province, you must travel home 
to go and vote. 
<H5>  THE VOTING STAGES </H5>
  At the voting station you will go through the following 
steps 
to vote. There will be election officials from the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] to guide you though the 
process. If you need any help, just ask. 
  1. On entering the voting station, your hands are examined 
under ultra-violet light to see if you have already voted. 
  2. Your ID or temporary voters card is checked and if you 
qualify to vote, it will be stamped with an official stamp in 
invisible ink. 
  3. Your hand is marked with invisible ink which can only be 
seen under ultra violet light. The ink is harmless and will 
wash off after seven days. The ink is only put on your hand to 
prevent you from voting more times than you are entitled to in 
the election. 
  4. You are given a ballot paper to vote for the National 
Assembly. 
  5. In secrecy inside a voting booth, you choose one party on 
the ballot paper for the National Assembly. If you make a 
mistake do not scratch it out. Take the spoilt paper to the 
officials and ask for a new paper. Ballot papers with more than 
one mark on them are spoilt papers and will not be counted. 
  6. Place your ballot paper in the ballot box marked 
"National 
Assembly". 
  7. You will then be given a second but different ballot 
paper 
to vote for the Provincial Legislature. This is your vote for 
the regional government. The first vote is for the national 
government. You can choose the same party you voted for in the 
National Assembly, or you can choose a different party. It is 
your choice entirely. 
  8. In secrecy inside a voting booth, choose one party to 
represent you in the Provincial Legislature. You must only mark 
the paper once. Fold the ballot paper so that no one else sees 
how you voted. 
  9. Place your ballot in the ballot box marked 'Provincial 
Legislature'. Now leave the voting station." 
  [Ad concludes with a list of voter education programmes -- 
sponsored by the Democracy Education Broadcast Initiative -- 
scheduled for various radio and television stations from 18 to 
26 April.]

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober and Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has 
submitted a R700-million [rand] budget to the government -- 
R375-million of which will go towards the running of the actual 
election. Election- related spending could reach R1.5-billion 
by the end of May. In a document, "Estimated Expenditure 
December 20 1993- May 31 1994", the IEC outlined the expected 
cost of the election. 
  Appropriations for IEC directorates and departments include 
R154-million for monitoring, R26-million for voter education, 
R29- million for communication and R29-million for election 
adjudication. Salaries take up a chunk of the bill, and at the 
top of the scale are the 16 commissioners who earn up to R25,000 
a month and receive. R2,000 a month entertainment allowance and 
a R50 a day subsistence allowance. 
  During international and local trips, they receive an 
additional allowance of R500 a day. The budget for the 
commissioners' office is R5.5-million. Chief directors of IEC 
departments receive R17,000 a month, while heads of departments 
are earmarked to receive R14,000 a month. Lower grade officials 
are receiving around R58,000 for three-month contracts. 
  The IEC salaries are supposed to be on the same scales as 
those of civil servants, but in practice they are much higher. 
Assistant directors in the civil service receive up to R70,000 
a year, while scales of assistant directors in the IEC start at 
R70,000. 
  South African civil servants working for the IEC complain 
that their salaries are fixed, while those appointed by the IEC 
are linked to what they would have lost had they carried on with 
their normal jobs. A bonus plan for civil servants is being 
worked on to even the pay structure. 
  The IEC has also equipped its headquarters and regional 
offices with modern technology and the commission has purchased 
450 computers. Provision is made for 2,500 cellular telephones, 
which are expected to cost R4.5-million. There is also 
R10.5-million for satellite back-up equipment. Vehicles are 
also on the IEC's shopping list and it is looking for 10 4x4 
vehicles, 100 micro buses and wants to hire 3,000 vehicles at a 
cost of R3,000 a month. 
  Although the budget has yet to be approved, the IEC has had 
to go ahead with many of the purchases. Until the budget is 
approved, the IEC is living off R140-million appropriated by the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC) at the end of last year, 
grants from foreign donors and credit. The government of 
national unity will be committed to picking up the bill for the 
election. 
  The TEC -- which has a budget of R18.9-million -- does not 
have the responsibility of approving the budget, and the final 
appropriation will have to be approved by parliament. In terms 
of the Act setting up the commission, money matters are the 
responsibility of the commission's chief executive -- who has a 
budget of R1.7 million -- although his records will be audited 
by the auditor-general. 
  However, IEC staff point out that until last week, there 
were 
no set guidelines for the requisition of personnel and equipment 
and rules were made as issues cropped up. Although the TEC is 
not responsible for the IEC's budget, it has appropriated money 
for other election related expenses. The council has ordered 
that policemen receive the same pay as members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force for the duration of the election. This will 
add R120-million to the R150-million the police planned to spend 
on election operations. 
  The council also decided to grant the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] R31.5-million to cover debts incurred 
to the corporation by the Democracy Broadcast Education Unit 
(Debi) and to subsidies election coverage. If it is any 
consolation to South Africans, foreign taxpayers are also 
chipping in a fair bit to ensure free and fair elections 
  The European Union Election Unit in South Africa has a 
budget 
of R27-million. This is in addition to the R20-million it 
granted to the Independent Forum for Electoral Education, in 
July 1993, and a further R10-million towards the State Election 
Fund for South African political parties. 
  --The United Nations mission will be spending R129-million 
to 
cover the costs of its observers but will not be funding any 
projects. 
  --The Commonwealth, which will also only be observing, has 
budgeted R2.65-million for its mission. 
  --The Organisation of African Unity, which already has a 
presence in the country, is finalising the size of its mission 
and its budget this week.

  [Text] The European Union, EU, has presented 20.5 million 
rands to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. The head 
of the union's delegation in South Africa, Mr. Erwan Fouere, 
handed the money to the chairman of the IEC, Mr. Justice Johan 
Kriegler, at a ceremony in Johannesburg this morning. Mr. 
Fouere said the donation was proof of the union's commitment to 
transition in South Africa, and its confidence in democracy. 
Just over half of the money will be used for specific 
educational programs. The rest of the money will go to the 
IEC's election fund and will be allocated to parties taking part 
in the election.

  [Text] Shots have been reported from the vicinity of the 
Thokoza hostel on the East Rand, the site of yesterday's gun 
battle between hostel inmates and National Peacekeeping Force 
troops. 
  No injuries have been reported but the peacekeeping force is 
investigating the incident. Road blocks have been set up on all 
roads leading to Thokoza. Well-known newspaper photographer Ken 
Oosterbroek was killed in yesterday's battle. Two journalists 
and two members of the peacekeeping force were also injured in 
the incident. A peace keeping force spokesman, Col. Connie van 
Rensburg, said the possibility that STAR photographer Ken 
Oosterbroek and journalist Greg Marinovich and Juda Ngwenya were 
shot by peacekeeping force members was being investigated. 
Journalists on the scene denied allegations by the police that 
they acted irresponsibly. 
  One of the journalists Joao Silva alleged that a 
peacekeeping 
force soldier panicked and just started shooting.

  [Text] Security forces and the National Peacekeeping Force 
were involved in a heavy gun battle with unknown gunmen near the 
Angola Hostel in Thokoza on the East Rand. Members of a police 
patrol came under fire when they tried to remove a body lying in 
front of the hostel. Reinforcements in an armored vehicle were 
dispatched and a gun battle ensured on their arrival at the 
hostel. So far four people are reported to have been wounded in 
the shooting. 
  The National Hostel Residents Association says that hundreds 
of West Rand hostel residents will be transported to the East 
Rand to reinforce hostels that it claims are under attack by the 
National Peacekeeping Force. An Association spokesman, Mr. 
Thulani Mlotshwa, said 500 hostel residents from the Rand would 
be moved into East Rand hostels. 
  Referring to yesterday's gun battle between Thokoza hostel 
residents and members of the peacekeeping force in which 
photographer Ken Oosterbroek was killed, he said large numbers 
of township residents accompanied by the peacekeeping force had 
attacked the hostel.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Hundreds of West Rand 
hostel residents would be transported to the East Rand to 
reinforce hostels "under attack" by the National Peacekeeping 
Force [NPKF], the National Hostel Residents Association [NHRA] 
said on Tuesday. 
  NHRA spokesman Thulani Mlothshwa said: "Let the world know 
more militants will be deployed on the East Rand and they will 
be told to take no nonsense from the NPKF who, with township 
residents, attacked our hostel yesterday (Monday)." 
  He was referring to a gunfight between NPKF and Thokoza 
hostel residents on Monday which resulted in the death of news 
photographer Ken Oostebroek. 
  Mr Mlotshwa said the deployment of the NPKF had given a 
boost 
to the enemies of hostel residents. "They thought it would now 
be easier to attack the hostels. This was proved yesterday 
(Monday) when township residents came in large numbers, 
accompanied by NPKF members, to attack the Thokoza hostel. As a 
result the hostel inmates were forced to defend themselves." 
  Hostel residents were protected by their own "military" and 
500 reinforcements from West Rand hostels would be brought in to 
protect East Rand hostels from attack. "We would like to warn 
all those who are still prepared to attack the hostels that if 
they think they are militant, they will find us more militant," 
Mr Mlotshwa said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Police on Tuesday said 
the Internal Stability Division [ISD] had not returned to 
Thokoza on the East Rand where soldiers of the National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], hostel and township residents fought 
running gun battles through the day. 
  Police East Rand spokesman Lt Deon Peens told SAPA police 
were not intervening in the conflict. "The ISD was not back 
there. Police are doing normal police work, driving around in 
their bakkies [pickup trucks]," he said. He confirmed the NPKF 
had requested the assistance of the South African Police [SAP], 
and directed all enquiries to the NPKF head office. 
  An NPKF soldier could not confirm a report that the force 
had 
fired a mortar round into Hostel No 2 in the township. He said 
it was "very, very busy" in Thokoza. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party Spokesman Ed Tillet said: "The NKPF 
are totally out of control. They are firing indiscriminately at 
everyone." Mr Tillet said the car in which IFP Transvaal 
Political Director Themba Khoza was travelling in the township 
had been petrol bombed, but this had yet to be confirmed. 
  Police were on Tuesday investigating a rocket-propelled 
grenade attack on No 2 Hostel in Thokoza. A police spokesman 
said the RPG7 attack caused little damage and no one was 
injured. Three people were killed earlier in the day and 
several others injured in crossfire between township residents 
and hostel residents, police said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- The decision to 
withdraw South African Defence Force [SADF] troops from Thokoza 
on the East Rand "was not working", Archbishop Desmond Tutu said 
in a statement on Tuesday. Archbishop Tutu said the conflict in 
Thokoza had been brought under control by the SADF in recent 
months, but it had again intensified since the withdrawal to the 
point when 19 people had died violently since the weekend. 
  The church, said Archbishop Tutu, had supported the 
formation 
of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], but the NPKF was 
being asked to do an impossible job. 
  "Reports from church members indicate there is a strong 
desire that the SADF should return and we call on the 
Transitional Executive Council as a matter of urgency to send 
the soldiers back."

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Thokoza residents and 
residents of Angola Hostel fought running battles with each 
other in the southern section of the East Rand township on 
Tuesday. 
  One National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] soldier was reported 
to have been shot dead, and SAPA reporters at the scene saw at 
least half a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit 
Hospital. Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at 
least 40 wounded in the violence. 
  It also appeared as if SADF [South African Defense Force] 
troops were returning to the township to restore order. By 
2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower Khumalo 
Street by what appeared to be defence force troops, SAPA 
reporters said. 
  A spokesman for the SADF's Wits Command told SAPA the army 
was lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request 
of the NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to 
the East Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits 
Command. 
  NKPF members patrolling Khumalo Street, which was covered 
with stones, tree stumps and burning tyres, came under sporadic 
fire. Township residents repeatedly charged the hostel and took 
many casualties, according to a witness. 
  At 1PM a dozen South African Defence Force Ratel armoured 
vehicles, a fire engine and NPKF armoured vehicles arrived, 
reporters on the scene said. The arrival of SADF troops was 
cheered by those in the hostel. 
  In a statement to SAPA, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] -- 
whose supporters dominate most hostels -- demanded the NPKF 
withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on Tuesday 
(today) "and the immediate return of the SADF". "The IFP also 
delivers an ultimatum to the NPKF command to unconditionally 
return licenced weapons and their registration papers illegally 
dispossessed from their IFP- supporting owners yesterday," said 
the statement issued by Abhraham Mzizi, IFP constituency 
chairman for Thokoza. 
  He also alleged members of African National Congress 
supporting township self defence units (SDUs) had been seen 
among NPKF members during a gunfight with residents of Thokoza 
Hostel No 3 on Monday. Photographs which appeared in Tuesday 
newspapers confirmed this, according to Mr Mzizi. "NPKF members 
allegedly escorted MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; 
ANC military wing] members to the hostel yesterday to retrieve 
weapons they claimed were hidden there. This in itself was a 
provocative gesture. Together with SDU members they then 
proceeded to fire indiscriminately at the hostel," charged Mr 
Mzizi. "This culminated in the crossfire that triggered the 
tragic death of STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek..." 
  NPKF members had also illegally taken away from IFP 
supporters their legal firearms and registration papers on 
Monday, Mr Mzizi alleged. "This was done in the clear knowledge 
that it would leave hostel residents vulnerable to an ANC 
assault... "When confronted by IFP officials, NPKF members 
refused to identify themselves and allegedly threatened IFP 
leaders. When IFP officials challenged them (NPKF) to hand over 
the firearms to police for ballistic testing, they refused to do 
so," according to Mr Mzizi. 
  There was no immediate comment from the NPKF. 
  Mr Mzizi said the decision to send the NPKF into the East 
Rand was a "lethal error of judgement". 
  Returning from a tour of the embattled township, IFP 
Transvaal leader Mr hemba Khoza on Tuesday said law and order 
had broken down and the language of the township was a bullet. 
"They are talking though the barrels of guns," he told 
reporters in Johannesburg. 
  Mr Khoza said he was in an NPKF vehicle when it was 
petrol-bombed and stoned by residents near Buthelezi section. 
"There is serious trouble and people are going to die. I was 
really scared; we're lucky up to now so few people have been 
killed." 
  On the IFP's decision to contest the elections, Mr Khoza 
said 
"it is nice that the leadership has found each other, but they 
have to quell the violence". He said a lot more had to be done 
to end violence or there would be no free and fair elections. 
  Mr Khoza repeated the IFP's demand for the withdrawal of the 
NPKF from Thokoza. He said members of the NPKF were 
undisciplined and blatantly ignoring orders of their commanding 
officers. Mr Khoza said he had seen NPKF members refusing an 
order to disperse a crowd of African National Congress youths 
and swearing at the commanding officer.

  [Text] A spokesman for the National Peacekeeping Force says 
that the situation at Thokoza on the East Rand is still very 
tense following yesterday's gun battle between residents of 
Thokoza Hostel and members of the force. Late yesterday 
security forces cordoned off the area surrounding Thokoza 
Hostel. A well known newspaper photographer, Mr. Ken 
Oosterbroek was killed and two of his colleagues were wounded in 
yesterday's shooting. The two wounded journalists and two 
members of the peace keeping force who were also injured are out 
of danger. 
  Meanwhile there is controversy regarding Mr. Oosterbroek's 
wounds. A doctor at the Natalspruit Hospital says that Mr. 
Oosterbroek's body has no bullet wounds. However, THE STAR 
newspaper says that he died of a bullet wound to the chest. Dr. 
Dimitrius Paguiges said that the photographer's neck had been 
broken. A post mortem is to be held tomorrow. Journalists at 
the scene said that they believe the shots that had struck their 
colleagues had been fired by members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force. 
  Mr. Oosterbroek's death has been widely condemned. The 
National Party, the ANC, the DP [Democratic Party] and the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] have expressed their condolences with 
his family and friends, and have repeated that attacks on 
journalists are unacceptable. The South African Union of 
Journalists and the media worker's union, MWASA [Media Worker 
Association of South Africa], condemned the violence, while the 
police on the East Rand said that they were deeply shocked by 
the tragic news. Newspapers and news agencies, including the 
BBC and REUTERS, have also expressed their condolences.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- ANC premier designate 
for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region Tokyo 
Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] called for the resignation of the 
head of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] on the East Rand. 
  Addressing about 1,000 township residents in the vernacular 
in Thokoza's Khumalo Street he said the NPKF's East Rand chief 
issued ineffectual orders and he usually sent only a handful of 
troops to handle extremely tense situations. 
  Mr Sexwale added the ANC was going to ask for members of the 
SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF] to return to the East 
Rand and act and operate in conjunction with the NPKF. Mr 
Sexwale's comments came against a background of running battles 
Monday and Tuesday between opposing hostel residents and 
township dwellers. 
  On Tuesday, SAPA reporters in the township saw at least half 
a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit Hospital. 
Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at least 40 
wounded in the violence. 
  The ANC leader's comments also follow demands by the Inkatha 
Freedom Party -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- that 
the NPKF withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on 
Tuesday. The IFP also demanded the immediate return of the SADF 
to the East Rand. 
  SAPA reporters in Thokoza said it also appeared as if SADF 
troops were returning to the township to restore order. 
  By 2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower 
Khumalo 
Street by what appeared to be defence force troops. A spokesman 
for the SADF's Wit Command told SAPA the army was lending 
"limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request of the 
NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to the East 
Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits Command.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
18 April] 
  [Text] Re: alleged kidnapping of four people in the ANC PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices 
  The officials of the ANC PWV region met this morning, 
Monday, 
April 18, 1994, after receiving reports in the news about the 
alleged kidnapping of people in our regional offices. Officials 
received information from the security personnel of the region 
which points out the following: 
  1. That it is true that people were brought to the regional 
offices by one of the security personnel employed by the region. 
  2. That the presence of those people in the building had 
nothing to do with organisational matters. The individual 
involved was conducting his own personal investigation after his 
car was broken into. 
  After receiving the report of the incident, ANC PWV regional 
officials convened an urgent meeting to consider our response to 
the situation. 
  It is not ANC policy to hold people against their will no 
matter what their crime is. We believe any individual involved 
in any form of crime, should be handed over to the police. The 
ANC PWV region regrets this incident and condemns it in the 
strongest terms. 
  The following steps have been agreed upon by the officials: 
  1. The security person involved is suspended with immediate 
effect. Internal investigations are continuing, and should any 
other person be found to be implicated in the incident, 
appropriate action will be taken. 
  2. To remain in close liaison with the police and to 
co-operate with investigations in this matter. 
  The ANC response to this incident demonstrates our 
commitment 
to transparent and open government and a clean administration. 
The same cannot be said of the National Party government. To 
date, the present government still fails to account to the 
nation about third force activities, deaths in detention, 
corruption and maladministration. 
  Our chairperson, Tokyo Sexwale, spoke on Saturday at the Zoo 
Lake: "All criminal elements, must know that the new government 
is bad news for them. We believe in a clean government and that 
we will clean up crime in this province and in the whole 
country." 
  No member of the ANC is immune from disciplinary action. 
This 
type of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

  [Text] A state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal has not 
produced the desired results. So says ANC National Chairperson 
Thabo Mbeki. Sisako Nyaka has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Nyaka] Mr. Mbeki told journalists in 
Johannesburg today that violence could be curbed by improved 
intelligence gathering and proper deployment of forces. 
  [Mbeki] We can't deal with the situation simply by 
patrolling 
up and down the streets in military vehicles. Something 
additional has to be done. 
  [Nyaka] He also referred to the build-up of weapons in the 
area and said that most of them had come from Mozambique. He 
told the journalists that there had recently been an increase in 
military training in Natal/kwaZulu. Mr. Mbeki warned against 
the whipping up of panic and fear by forces opposed to the 
election. 
  [Mbeki] We notice that the same forces that are opposed to 
the elections are putting out all sorts of rumors. It's 
happened in other parts of this region before, the elections in 
Zimbabwe, before the elections in Namibia. We must put out that 
in the aftermath of the elections, we will get all sorts of 
trouble [sentence as heard]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Brendon Seery, military correspondent for the </F>
Natal-based SUNDAY TRIBUNE] 
  [Text] Natal's daily death toll is comparable to that of 
Bosnia -- a telling reminder that despite the differences in 
terrain, culture and climate, both have the potential to become 
bloody military morasses. In the hills of the former Yugoslavia 
during World War 2, the partisans of Tito and other leaders tied 
up tens of thousands of Hitler's finest troops, who were backed 
up by sophisticated artillery and aircraft. 
  NATO's commanders, who today are equipped with airborne 
computer- guided weapons of destruction aboard American F-16 
warplanes, know that a ground war against the Serbs would be 
costly and all but unwinnable. 
  Like the Wehrmacht and NATO, the SADF [South African Defence 
Force] has deployed its iron fist in the hills and valleys of 
Zululand. Its men on the ground are backed by the SAAF's [South 
African Air Force] Dakota transport planes, Cessna 185 spotter 
aircraft and Puma and Alouette helicopters. The air force says 
that although no jet strike aircraft -- Impalas or Mirages -- 
are on specific standby for Natal, they are available. 
  Against them is ranged a motley assortment of impis 
[warriors] armed with anything from AK-47s, shotguns, G-3s, 
pistols and revolvers (including homemade items) to spears and 
knobkerries. 
  On paper the SADF should win a battle against them without 
so 
much as working up a sweat. However, the fighting -- if the 
current violence escalates into that -- will not be on a piece 
of paper on some desk in a staff college. 
  An acknowledgement of the seriousness of the situation, in 
military terms, came last week with the report (so far not 
denied) that the SADF was considering deploying one of the 
navy's replenishment ships -- probably the former Russian 
icebreaker SAS Outeniqua -- to Richards Bay to act as a floating 
hospital. 
  The SADF has downplayed the story, but the thinking behind 
the move is illuminating. For one, the ship could be staffed by 
trained medics and doctors of the SA Medical Services, closer to 
the action than hospitals in Durban or elsewhere. A hospital 
ship would also have adequate stocks of "clean" blood. 
  These are important considerations for the morale of men in 
the field if what is essentially a policing exercise turns into 
a war. 
  Richards Bay harbour is also more secure than many other 
centres in Zululand are likely to be if the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's supporters turn to guerilla-type warfare. 
  This is of particular concern when considering use of 10-ton 
Puma helicopters, which will be the primary means of rapid troop 
deployment. They can operate fully loaded for less than three 
hours. If refuelling depots cannot be secured adequately, the 
helicopters will lose their effectiveness, and it will take 
longer to deploy ground troops. 
  Ships like the SAS Drakensberg and Outeniqua -- both around 
20,000 tons displacement -- can carry tens of thousands of 
litres of fuel for helicopters. Both have flight decks that 
will accommodate Pumas as well as Alouettes. 
  Security of the Pumas must be one of the prime areas of 
concern for the SADF planners, particularly in the light of the 
incident in Tembisa last week in which a single 9mm bullet 
downed a civilian helicopter. The SAAF has said only that 
precautions are being taken to protect the aircraft and crews, 
and has not gone into details. 
  These precautions are likely to include measures to diffuse 
the heat of jet turbine engines to reduce the infrared 
"signatures" of aircraft. There have been no indications that 
weapons like the shoulder-launch, head-seeking SAM-7 are common 
in Natal, but police have picked up at least one during 
operations to find illegal weapons along the Mozambique and 
Swaziland borders. 
  Many of the helicopter pilots, from 15 Squadron in Durban 
and 
elsewhere, have years of experience, learning a few tricks about 
avoiding fire during the bush war in Namibia and Angola. But 
sometimes not even experience is enough to cope with weapons 
like the SAM-7 or the RPG-7 grenade launcher. Also a 
shoulder-launch weapon, the RPC-7 is easy to use and extremely 
accurate, even in the hands of a comparative novice. That much 
the U.S. military learnt in Somalia, where the weapons downed a 
number of U.S. Marine Sikorksy Blackhawk helicopters. 
  If the shooting gets serious in Natal, it will be whole new 
ball game, even for veterans of Angola and Namibia. The enemy 
will be ill-defined -- hiding out in crowds of demonstrators, 
slipping down narrow alleys between township houses, moving 
through valleys in the dead of night -- and the "rules of 
engagement" will be far more strictly defined than they were in 
Angola. 
  "Collateral damage" -- the euphemism for the deaths of 
innocent civilians -- is something the peacekeeping SADF will 
have to avoid at all costs. 
  In places like the crowded townships of kwaZulu, Inanda and 
Mbumbulu, near Durban, the heavy 90mm guns mounted on the Ratel 
and Eland armoured cars will be next to useless because of the 
indiscriminate destruction they wreak. Heavy-calibre 0.50 or 
12.7mm machine-guns would also cause heavy destruction if 
levelled against township houses and shanties or hillside huts. 
  Ratels and Elands, despite their fearsome appearance, are 
vulnerable to RPG fire, as such grenades can penetrate armour up 
to 20mm thick. 
  The SADF troops first deployed in the townships of the East 
Rand proved highly effective, not least because they were 
treated with great respect by ANC-aligned self-defence units, 
which discovered that the "brown jobs" would counter-attack 
aggressively, unlike SAP [South African Police] units. 
  Less respectful of the troops have been hostel residents, 
although few have dared to really "mix it" with the soldiers. 
However, the IFP's "R-5 Brigade" made up largely of unemployed 
rural kwaZulu men and imbued with the fighting spirit and 
history of the Zulus, might be a tougher nut to crack. 
  Believing in the divine purpose of their mission to defend 
their kingdom and backed up on occasion by protection from the 
spirits against bullets, the warriors and their Kamikaze 
approach will be difficult to deal with. 
  They will also have the invaluable benefit of being on their 
own turf, knowing their hills and valleys for better than the 
SADF. Indeed, security force members with the most experience in 
the area are to be found in the kwaZulu and SA police forces. 
The kwaZulu Police look set to remain loyal to King Goodwill 
Zwelithini and the kwaZulu government. 
  Despite the markedly better training of the SADF, the 
advantage in bushcraft terms will be even more marked for the 
SADF's adversaries when they are compared with black soldiers 
conscripted from other areas or with white troops doing call-ups. 
  White conscriptions is probably going to provide the biggest 
headache for the SADF in dealing with the Natal problem. After 
April 27, very few white Citizen Force soldiers will be willing 
to give up their time -- and very possibly their lives -- to 
fight in what is in may ways regarded as a black man's war. And 
these white part-time soldiers will definitely be needed to help 
the SADF cope. 
  Military expert Helmoed Romer-Heitman has said that if the 
Natal situation does degenerate into guerilla warfare, the SADF 
will need about 20,000 troops to contain it. These troops are 
simply not available in the regular ranks. 
  The SADF has fewer than 40,000 regular members, about 13,000 
of whom have already been deployed to help stabilise the 
homelands. About 3,000 troops are in Natal, and more will be on 
their way there after units in the East Rand are freed by 
deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. The NPKF 
is generally regarded as inadequate for deployment in really 
"hot" areas, and -- for now, at least -- will be put into only 
those areas already stabilised by the SADF.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The preliminary 
hearing of the Goldstone Commission into the Zulu march through 
Johannesburg on March 28 began at the commission's Sandton 
offices on Monday morning. The march resulted in 53 deaths and 
more than 200 injured. 
  The South African Police [SAP], the Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] and the kwaZulu government will make their submissions to 
the commission on Monday and Tuesday. 
  The SAP, represented by Mr B. Roux, handed in a bulky 
document detailing the police version of events. Mr Roux told 
the commission that, contrary to newspaper reports, the IFP had 
applied to the Johannesburg City Council for permission to hold 
an anti-election meeting at Library Gardens, and not a march. 
Permission for the meeting had been granted. Mr Roux stressed 
the police had had no idea before the meeting that snipers would 
gun down Zulus on city streets. 
  Mr Maurice Basslian is representing the kwaZulu government 
and the IFP, and Mr George Bizos the African National Congress. 
The hearing is being attended by observers from Jamaica, 
Germany, Great Britain and the United States.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- In spite of requesting 
a commission of inquiry into the violence that flared during a 
Zulu march in Johannesburg on March 28, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] was unable to submit evidence to the Goldstone Commission 
on Monday. 
  IFP legal representative Maurice Basslian told the 
commission 
he had been instructed by the IFP only on Wednesday last week. 
  Monday's proposed march by the IFP Youth Brigade, which was 
postponed on Sunday, had apparently made consultations difficult. 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said the IFP's failure to 
submit 
was contemptuous in the light of IFP spokesman Sue Vos' request 
for an urgent hearing. 
  He ordered the IFP to submit reasons by 9AM on Tuesday for 
their failure to make submissions.

Basslian told the commission the IFP had been unable to make 
submissions because of April's public holidays, the lack of 
manpower and records and the problem of finding witnesses. 
  Mr Justice Goldstone dismissed the explanation as 
unacceptable, especially as the IFP had requested the probe as a 
matter of urgency on March 29. He said other parties had made 
their submission in spite of the public holidays. While he 
could understand the difficulty of consulting witnesses, the IFP 
leaders at least could have given instruction, he said. 
  Following the explanation, the IFP made a submission which 
Mr 
Basslian stressed had been prepared in haste.

  [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The South African Police 
[SAP] on Tuesday [19 April] appealed to the public to disregard 
alarmist rumours about impending widespread violence, food 
shortages and similar speculation in the run-up to the elections. 
  It said it was aware of the rumours and a growing number of 
facsimile messages urging the public to take special 
precautions. "It is in our best interest that we remain calm and 
rational. The SAP requests the public to disregard 
irresponsible, inaccurate rumours. There are assurances from 
many companies that the services they provide will continue to 
be provided during the election period."

  [Text] Bloemfontein April 17 SAPA -- Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] Commander Joe 
Modise on Sunday [17 April] accused the SA [South African] 
Defence Force [SADF] of "dragging its feet" over the integration 
of various armed formations into an army for the future. 
  He said he suspected the SADF had its own agenda and wanted 
to delay the integration process in the hope it could stay in 
command and determine who joined a new national defence force. 
"This we will not allow. We are very worried about it...but we 
are going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new 
government comes in." 
  The SADF had in the past had facilities for an intake of up 
to 20,000 new recruits, but had now reluctantly identified three 
of its bases where MK members could assemble. "We have had to 
drag this information out of them," he said, adding that 
allegations of stalling the integration process were being 
raised with the defence force leadership. 
  Mr Modise, who has commanded MK since 1965 and is now a 
candidate on the ANC's national list, said he was resigning from 
the military. "I think it is time for me to rest and give a 
chance for younger people." 
  He hinted that he may get involved in the proposed 
vocational 
training schools which the ANC hopes will absorb the thousands 
of unemployed and militant youths who lack education. 
  He said he thought the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] 
was 
capable of the task assigned to them, but wished they could have 
had more training. The NPKF was, however, better than the 
police's Internal Stability Division, he said.

  [Text] Pretoria April 15 SAPA -- The South African Defence 
Force [SADF] will soon host a one-hour programme on Radio 2000 
to communicate with the public, especially the SADF's part-time 
forces. A statement issued on Friday [15 April] on behalf of the 
SADF by chief director of communication Maj-Gen John Rolt said 
the programme, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday evenings, 
would be first aired within a fortnight, pending finalisation of 
an agreement with the South African Broadcasting Corporation. 
  The statement also said a newspaper and radio advertising 
campaign was in the offing to improve the image of the SADF and 
create a climate favourable to the establishment of a new 
National Defence Force on April 27. Empahasis would be placed on 
communicating with the black community. 
  Four full-page advertisements would be placed 11 times each, 
and 27-second radio spots would be aired 500 times.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Taljaard] </F>
  [Text] The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance 
Movement -- AWB] is gearing up for a last stand in parts of the 
Transvaal. In anticipation of armed conflict, AWB members' wives 
and children were last week sent to "safe havens" on farms in 
the Eastern Transvaal. 
  Apart from stockpiling food, other signs of preparations for 
war include the purchase by rightwingers of at least 30 Saracen 
armoured vehicles at SADF [South African Defense Force] auctions 
over the last month. Sources said the AWB's plans centred on a 
"mini-secession" of certain towns in the Western Transvaal -- 
including Ottosdal and Schweizer-Reneke, which in recent months 
granted their "freedom" to the para-military AWB Wenkommando 
[Victory Commando]. 
  Other sources said there were indications that parts of the 
Eastern Transvaal and Pretoria could be simultaneously declared 
"independent in the week before the election. The AWB allegedly 
has plans to blockade the towns to make the election impossible 
in these areas. Although it is envisaged the secessions will be 
achieved peacefully, sources close to the AWB fear that it will 
provoke the SADF and black inhabitants of the towns to react. 
  Some are pinning their hopes on KwaZulu/Natal erupting into 
anarchy and tying down the security forces to the extent that 
they will not be able to act in the Western Transvaal. Three 
rightwing sources said that women and children have been sent to 
"safe havens" on Eastern Transvaal farms. Of the Saracen 
armoured vehicles bought over the past month, a [Orange] Free 
State rightwinger has bought two, while parties linked to the 
Pretoria Boerehommando [Boer commando] Group and the Akasia Town 
Council have also shown interest.

Volksfront [National Front -- AVF), Mr. Koos Kemp, has denied 
allegations that soldiers from the AVF are undergoing training 
in northern Swaziland. Earlier a tribal chief said he had 
handed information about the alleged training to the Swazi

huge meeting allegedly held by the AVF in the Lubodlwana region 
of Swaziland last week. 
  The leader of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], Mr. 
Eugene Terreblanche, has also denied knowledge of right-wing 
troops being trained in Swaziland. He was not prepared to 
comment on whether the AWB was involved in the training of any 
other groups. However, he did confirm that training of his own 
commandos had been stepped up.

  [Text] A Zululand yachtsman may have been killed in 
connection with alleged "third force" operation to supply 
weapons to the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], SOWETAN's sister 
paper, the SUNDAY TRIBUNE, reported yesterday. 
  Colin Lawrence a Zululand yachtsman killed in a "robbery" in 
Maputo, Mozambique, last week, may have been executed by 
elements within the South African security establishment because 
he knew too much about third force weapons smuggling between 
Natal and Mozambique. Security forces told the TRIBUNE last 
week that Lawrence (45) was a former special forces operator. 
An investigation by the paper alleges he was also recently 
involved in ivory and weapon smuggling. 
  A former Military Intelligence [MI] operative told the 
TRIBUNE that "you should look into the death of Lawrence. 
You'll find it's just like Eugene Riley." Riley was a former 
member of the notorious CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] and MI 
and was a member of the secret Badger unit. He died 
mysteriously in January. Initial reports were suicide. 
However, post-mortem reports have placed doubt on the 
pronouncement. 
  Lawrence and a friend, Ron Mitchell, were accosted in Maputo 
by a group of men while walking back to their yacht from a 
nightclub. The robbers allegedly demanded money but shot 
Lawrence as he was reaching for his wallet. Allegations of 
Lawrence's involvement in shady activities surfaced last year at 
the trial of former Howick yacht owner Mark Cronje, who was 
charged with fraud for deliberately sinking his boat. In 
September, Cronje phoned the TRIBUNE, saying he was still being 
threatened and he wanted to leave the country. He said he had 
information about arms deals and a covert military training base 
in Southern Natal. Afterwards, he disappeared and all efforts 
to find him failed. This week Cronje's parents said he and his 
family left for the United States in November.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and John Grobler] </F>
  [Text] Up to 500 former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] 
members and recces, headed by Lafras Luitingh -- a co-director 
of Executive Outcomes, the company which recruits mercenaries 
for the Angolan government -- have approached the ANC's Tokyo 
Sexwale pledging support for an ANC-led administration in South 
Africa. 
  The move indicates a significant split within the ranks of 
the former Civil Co-operation Bureau, the special forces killer 
commando which has been linked to the deaths of anti-apartheid 
activists. Another group of CCB operatives appears to have 
allied itself to the ultra rightwing. Luitingh told SABC's 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] MONITOR this week his 
group had "no problem with the ANC. Although we won't join the 
new defence force, we will work for the new government if asked." 
  A Uitingh associate said the group knew "we won't have 
problems with the ANC because we are supporting the MPLA 
[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]." Confirming 
the contacts, Sexwale said Luitingh had "come to us in 
confidence, but not in secrecy. I passed them on to our 
intelligence department, which is in contact with them." The 
ANC had been in touch with the Angolan government which had 
"confirmed the group was involved in guarding oil installations 
in Soyo." 
  Asked why he had been approached, Sexwale said: "I am not 
the head of the ANC's cultural department and these are not 
cultural workers. Everyone knows of my military background: I 
suppose they felt I was the right person to talk to." Executive 
Outcomes has denied its employees -- mainly former special 
forces and 32 Batallion soldiers -- have been involved in combat 
against UNITA [Popular Movement for the Total Liberation of 
Angola] forces, but announnced last week that four had been 
killed in reconnaisance missions in northern Angola. Former 
Namibian rugby player and 5 Recce [Reconnaissance] member Steyn 
Marais was killed a week earlier in an operation Executive 
Outcomes termed an "investigation into criminal activities". 
This is understood to mean Marais was involved in military 
activities against illegal diamond mining in the mineral- rich 
Lunda Norte diamond fields controlled by UNITA. Besides the 
Angolan government, De Beers is understood to have shown an 
interest in staunching the flow on to world markets of Angolan 
diamonds beyond its control. 
  UNITA has financed its war against the Angolan government 
through diamond sales since losing the official backing of the 
United States and South Africa in the settlement which led to 
elections last year. Savimbi returned to his bush war after 
losing the elections. As increasing numbers of Luitingh recruits 
appear to be dying in Angola, the war of words with the 
"unreconstructed" faction within the former Recces has heated 
up. Former 32 Batallion commander Colonel Jan Breytenbach 
accused Executive Outcomes of luring people to their death with 
false promises of security work at U$10,000 a month. 
  Sexwale had played a central role in facilitating contracts 
between Luitingh and the Angolan army, charged Breytenbach. 
"That's absolute junk," said Sexwale. "I would be proud to 
help organise the defence of the revolution and of democracy in 
Angola, but the fact is I had nothing to do with it. Luitingh's 
group was involved in Angola before they came to see me." 
  Sexwale said he had been to Angola once and, although he had 
wanted to see what Luitingh's people were doing there because it 
would give an indication of their readiness to serve a new 
South Africa, he had been unable to meet them. "You are seeing 
mercenaries playing another role today. Eventually all these 
people who want to play a role, can. But they must accept the 
principle of reconciliation which is that you cannot forgive 
want you don't know." 
  Sexwale's stance may mean reconciliation is still a long way 
off. Luitingh told MONITOR he would prefer the CCB's criminal 
activities to be forgotted. "Both the ANC and the CCB were 
responsible for terrible things," he said.

  [Text] Seven Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South 
Africa] employees were sent by government to the United States 
to give evidence in a case in which it is alleged that American 
firms and individuals contravened the ban on exporting weapons 
to South Africa and Iraq. The questioning of the seven men 
about their involvement will begin today. The government had 
previously refused to release the men for questioning since it 
was feared that sensitive information on South Africa's atomic 
and missile secrets would be exposed. Observers believe there 
is a strong possibility these men will supply the secret 
information in exchange for a new identity and residence in the 
United States. An offer by Armscor for these men to be 
indemnified and for the payment of their fines was rejected last 
month by American prosecutors. The men are extremely 
dissatisfied with the government's and Armscor's inability to 
arrange indemnity for them.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Prisoners in ANC Offices `Highly Disturbing' -- "Reports 
that 
five men were detained in a cell at the ANC's regional 
headquarters in Johannesburg are highly disturbing," notes a 
page-20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 
April. "They compound fears that the ANC believes it is a law 
unto itself and that a malignant authoritarianism lurks beneath 
its declared love of democracy." The detention of the men in 
ANC regional headquarters "follows the ANC's refusal to allow 
police to search their national headquarters at Shell House 
after eight Zulu royalists were gunned down outside the building 
on March 28. At the time there were allegations that the 
marchers had been killed by snipers operating from rooftops of 
Shell House and nearby buildings." "Doubts have been cast on 
its claim that it was an innocent party in the Shell House 
massacre and that is guards fired only when the marchers tried 
to invade the building. Ballistic tests could have established 
the facts but the ANC chose to thwart the police investigation 
and, arguably, the due process of law. These signs do not augur 
well for the future." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  IEC Spending Public Money -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 19 April says the Independent Electoral Commission's 
(IEC) budget is "commendably frank about how it intends to spend 
R700m [million rand] by the end of May, detailing everything 
from salaries to stationery." However, "taxpayers are entitled 
to know not just where the money is going, but what is being 
done to contain costs and ensure value for money." "Neither the 
IEC, nor the Transitional Executive Council which drew up its 
rules, can regard themselves as too important to cut costs. 
They are dealing with the public purse, not a bottomless pit." 
  Peacekeeping Force To `Provoke Conflict' -- A second 
editorial on the same page says the death of journalist Ken 
Oosterbroek on the East Rand on 18 April is "a shocking reminder 
of the tenuousness of life in South Africa." The shooting 
"could well be put down to a stupidly naive decision of our 
political leaders. The National Peacekeeping Force is the 
product of a legitimate political desire to establish a 
multiparty, politically non-partisan force in the run-up to the 
elections. In principle, a good idea. In practice, as numerous 
experts warned, there was insufficient time to recruit and train 
a force which would be able to carry out that function 
competently. It has been guilty of indiscipline. Worse, with 
Inkatha's non-participation, it was always going to be seen as a 
partisan force, and therefore more likely to provoke conflict in 
some areas than contain it."

  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has urged both parties 
in the Rwandan conflict to implement an immediate cease-fire and 
initiate talks to implement the Arusha Accord, which was 
endorsed last year. 
  President Mwinyi reiterated this advice during separate 
talks 
at State House in Dar es Salaam today, when he met with 
delegations from the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]. 
  He said the meeting, which Tanzania will be convening in 
Arusha on 23 April, seeks to give the warring sides in Rwanda a 
chance to end the civil war and to consider ways for immediately 
implementing the Arusha Accord. 
  Speaking to Rwandan Home Affairs Minister Faustin Munyazesa, 
who was heading his government's delegation, President Mwinyi 
stressed that the delay in the implementation of the Arusha 
Peace Accord had led to the eruption of war and slaughter in 
Rwanda. He said the only solution was for all the parties to 
implement a cease-fire, end the killings, and discuss the 
implementation of the Arusha Accord. 
  President Mwinyi assured the first vice chairman of the RPF, 
Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka, that next Saturday's meeting in Arusha 
did not aim to begin new talks on a peace agreement, but to 
discuss feasible ways of implementing the accord in the context 
of the new political situation in Rwanda. 
  He emphasized that the Rwandan crisis was political, and 
hence called for a political, not a military, solution. 
  Mr. Mazimpaka assured President Mwinyi that the RPF's 
objective was to halt the killings so that the Arusha Accord 
could be implemented, not to take over power through the barrel 
of the gun.

  [Text] The OAU secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, has

of Tanzania to convene a peace conference on Rwanda. 
  In a press statement yesterday, Mr. Salim said the meeting 
in

Rwanda Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front as well as 
representatives of the observer countries and international 
organizations. He said that the government of Tanzania, as 
facilitator, is proposing this conference with two main items on 
the agenda: ceasefire and the implementation of the Arusha 
peace agreement. 
  Mr. Salim called on the UN Security Council to continue to 
provide the necessary support to involve the UN Assistance 
Mission for Rwanda to effectively carry out its mandate. He 
also appealed to the international community, including 
nongovernmental organizations to provide increased and adequate 
resources to cater for the thousands of affected persons in 
Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] Burundi's national judiciary system seems to be 
recovering from a state of lethargy since last October's events 
and various aftereffects. Two commissions have just been set up 
to prepare the different cases in connection with the aborted 
coup which cost life of President Melchior Ndadaye and some of 
his close aides, as well as the bloody killings that followed 
it. Raphael (Njenguye) elaborates: 
  [(Njenguye)] According to an article from the local daily, 
that is, Tuesday 19th [April], the first commission will have to 
try to identify and take action against the putschists and 
murderers of the late head of state and his close aides. The 
second type of commission is at the provincial level. It will 
have to inquire into the political and ethnic massacres which 
followed the aborted coup of last October. [passage omitted] 
  The commission will be back in New York by next week and 
will 
draft a report to be submitted to UN Secretary general who will 
give it the appropriate response.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ambassador to Zaire Etienne </F>
Sengegera by correspondent Ntumba Matulu in Kinshasa; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Sengegera] Well, first we had indirect 
information, but we have also managed to open direct contacts 
with the authorities for information on developments in Rwanda, 
which aids us in our work at the embassy level. So I am in 
contact with those Rwandan authorities who are trying to manage 
this tragic and critical situation into which we were plunged on 
6 April. 
  Obviously, the latest news is that fighting continues, 
notably in Kigali but also at the northern front -- the border 
with Uganda. The so-called Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], I must 
state, is supported by foreign powers, notably Uganda, which 
supplies it with equipment and which gives it logistical 
support. Apart from Uganda's involvement in the war, other 
powers also are involved in this war, and I am not scared of 
citing Belgium in this regard. We have all the evidence now to 
declare this without any conjecture, as Belgian soldiers shot 
down the Rwandan presidential plane on that fatal night of 6 
April. 
  Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission in Rwandan -- 
they belonged to the United Nations Assistance Mission to Rwanda 
[UNAMIR] -- three Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission 
shot down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. First 
they shot a missile that missed the target; the second missile 
slightly touched the aircraft; and the third, unfortunately, hit 
its target. The aircraft exploded, and this resulted in an 
incredible catastrophe that nobody could have imagined. 
Therefore, certain Belgians elements were involved. 
  [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, this is a very serious accusation. 
What reasons could have prompted the Belgians to support the RPF? 
  [Sengegera] The motives of the Belgians or, to be more 
precise, of certain Belgians? You will have to ask these people 
themselves. But the fact is that I am not leveling an 
accusation -- I am only making an observation. This is because 
it was Belgians -- three UNAMIR Belgian soldiers -- who shot 
down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. We do not 
know their motives or interests -- you would have to ask those 
persons themselves -- but we are now convinced that behind the 
war that the RPF is imposing on Rwanda to seize power by force, 
are certain Belgian circles that are involved for reasons 
unknown to us. We might also make a geostrategic analysis of 
the war, saying that Rwanda probably is not the only country 
that has been targeted. So, you might as well question the 
Belgians as to what the rebels' motives are. Everybody knows 
that the rebels are not interested in the democratization of 
Rwanda. They are interested in taking power by force. 
  [Matulu] What prompts you to think that it is the Belgians 
and the Ugandans who are behind the rebels? 
  [Sengegera] The case of Uganda has been proven, because the 
attack on Rwanda on 1 October 1990 was perpetrated by elements 
who illegally came from the Army of President Museveni. They 
attacked us with full logistical support from the Ugandan Army. 
Subsequent attacks were supported by Uganda, sometimes with the 
direct intervention of Ugandan soldiers, which seems to be the 
present case in this current phase of the war. Concerning the 
Belgians, we note the shift in their policy towards Rwanda, to 
the point of undertaking this shameful and ignominious plot 
against the heads of state -- against President Habyrarimana and 
his Burundian counterpart. There may be other interested 
parties in the plot who we have not discovered, but certain 
Belgians -- I repeat certain Belgians -- are involved in the 
current war imposed on Rwanda. I would also like to stress that 
in the current clashes in Kigali there have been found in 
certain localities the dead bodies of some white foreign 
nationals who were killed as they fought alongside the RPF. 
  [Matulu] Yes, but tell me, why do you maintain that it is 
the 
Belgians who shot down the plane, especially three Belgian 
soldiers? And what evidence have you to substantiate this? 
  [Sengegera] The evidence? First there is the place from 
which the missiles were shot. 
  [Matulu] From where were the missiles shot? 
  [Sengegera] They were shot from near the Kanombe Airport, 
from a place called Massaka, near Kanombe Airport. So, we 
spotted where the shots came from, and I can even confirm that 
the three were immediately arrested by UNAMIR police and 
collected by the Rwandan Army. Another fact: Security at 
Kanombe International Airport in Kigali was ensured by the 
Belgian contingent, in line with the UNAMIR peace mission. So, 
you see, at this level there was a lot of complicity. I am also 
telling you that at the landing strip the pilot of the 
presidential plane was told to fly around twice because -- I 
don't know -- the plot was probably still being prepared, but 
the pilot thought that this was for technical reasons, whereas 
it was for other sinister designs. 
  [Matulu] Are the three Belgians soldiers who were arrested 
still alive? 
  [Sengegera] They were immediately shot dead by the angry 
Rwandan soldiers. 
  [Matulu] So, you are saying that they were among the 10 
Belgian UN peacekeepers who were killed a few minutes after the 
assassination -- to repeat your own words -- of the two 
presidents. 
  [Sengegera] Indeed, the three were among the dozen Belgian 
soldiers killed in Kigali during this outburst of violence. It 
seems, I repeat seems, that Belgium organized special funeral 
rights for three soldiers last week, and I think that it was 
these three soldiers who carried out the attack on Presidents 
Habyarimana and Ntaryamira. 
  [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, according to reports, Belgium is 
said to have sold arms to the RPF. As the legal representative 
of the Rwandan Government, do you have this same information? 
  [Sengegera] I have received the same information, but have 
not been able to verify it myself because really it is not this 
piece of information that interests me, as far as my work is 
concerned. However, it seems the RPF has bought huge quantities 
of military equipment from Belgium on credit. This might 
probably explain a certain attitude by Belgium, which considers 
that if the RPF does not come into power, we will be done for, 
if you excuse me the expression, so, we cannot be paid back. 
This may partially explain what has been done. 
  But, as I said, there are probably other objectives that are 
not directed just at Rwanda, as far as the attitude and position 
of the Belgians are concerned. There is also another point that 
does not surprise us. You know, Belgium has just withdrawn its 
contingent from the UNAMIR mission, but the Belgians at first 
strongly insisted that they should be supported on the ground 
with armor, helicopters, and a huge deployment of forces. Kigali 
airport was in their hands and functioning. One wonders whether 
this evacuation plan by land toward Tanzania was not to serve as 
a support operation for the RPF. But obviously, the Rwandan 
Government, which was conscious of the danger, strongly opposed 
this. They left by air as it happened, because we thought the 
worst might happen. Perhaps the Belgians were even planning a 
scenario that is not [word indistinct] from the earlier one -- 
cut the (Rufumo) Bridge, which links us with Tanzania and which 
has since October 1990 virtually been the only land route for 
international trade exchanges for Rwanda and Zaire. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, we have this information -- which 
is 
not a rumor -- that the Belgians are sympathetic to the RPF and 
that this led the Belgians to facilitate the infiltration of RPF 
soldiers into Kigali, the Rwandan capital? Can you confirm this? 
  [Sengegera] Yes I can confirm this. There are many Belgians 
who are married to Rwandans, and this may sometimes explain this 
sympathetic attitude on the part of the Belgians. Apart from 
this, I would like to recall that it was agreed under the Arusha 
Accord that the RPF was authorized to station a contingent of 
600 soldiers in Kigali on the premises of the parliament in 
Kigali. These fighters were supposedly in Rwanda in line with 
the mission to protect and ensure the security of the RPF 
political leaders who were to participate in the transition, in 
both the new government and in parliament. But we realized that 
in fact this battalion was getting bigger and bigger due to 
infiltrations facilitated by the Belgian contingent of the 
UNAMIR. They sent convoys to their headquarters in the north of 
the country near the Ugandan border in Mulindi, supposedly to 
get wood supplies, but in fact they brought back artillery -- or 
rather soldiers -- who were infiltrated into Kigali. This 
occurred to the extent that certain sources reported that the 
RPF did not have 600 fighters in Kigali, but instead more like 
3,000 soldiers. [passage omitted] 
  [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, it seems that on the ground -- I do 
not know if you have some information on this -- the RPF has the 
upper hand? 
  [Sengegera] That is just media publicity. I think that this 
is misinformation to try and demoralize people. This situation 
is different from the presentations in the Western media, 
notably with all the noise and manipulations orchestrated by 
certain Western journalists who favor the RPF. The situation is 
quite different on the ground. The RPF does not control.... 
[pauses] Sometimes, we were even told that the RPF had managed 
to bring down 20,000 soldiers to join their battalion in the 
capital. That is not true. The RPF only controls one strategic 
position in Kigali. We have dislodged them from all the major 
positions which they were able to occupy. Of course, the 
situation is constantly changing, but as we speak now the 
Rwandan Armed Forces control the situation both in Kigali and in 
the north of the country near the Ugandan border. 
  [Matulu] Well, Mr. Ambassador, Tanzanian President Ali 
Hassan 
Mwinyi has just offered to mediate between the interim 
government and the RPF. How do you view prospects for this 
mediation? 
  [Sengegera] The Rwandan authorities will accept any 
arrangements which might contribute to the restoration of peace 
in Rwanda. It is in this context that they are prepared to 
consider whether the proposal made by the Tanzanian leader will 
succeed. We can also think of other political and more 
consistent interventions, notably through the Economic Community 
of Great Lakes Countries. The doors are open, but I would like 
to point out that concerning efforts for a cease-fire, the RPF 
has adopted the strategy of bidding higher every day, even 
refusing cease-fire proposals made by UNAMIR. We, the Rwandan 
authorities, are open to dialogue which would lead to the return 
of peace in Rwanda and the restoration of a true climate of 
peace. So, the Tanzanian offer is welcome in that context 
without excluding other possible mediation offers, which could 
be made at other levels by the true friends of Rwanda. 
  [Matulu, interrupting] Thank you. One last question, please. 
  [Sengegera, interrupting] Concerning efforts to pacify the 
country, I would like to stress that one of the cardinal 
missions assigned to the interim government is to ensure -- 
after this unfortunate criminal plot which decapitated our 
country and the resulted in the tragic death of Prime Minister 
Uwilingiyimana -- a return to peace in Rwanda. A government has 
been formed and the president of the Republic assumed office in 
line with the June 1991 Rwandan Constitution, which legalized 
multiparty politics in our country. The interim government has 
six weeks to work for peace in Rwanda, but of course we cannot 
make the peace by ourselves. We will try to make peace with 
those who are at war with us, and who are fighting with the 
support of Uganda and other foreign powers.

  [Excerpts] As the Rwandese Patriotic Army continues its 
campaign against the forces of dictatorship, the town of Byumba 
has fallen to the Rwandese Patriotic Army [RPA]. The soldiers 
from the government forces have been flushed out and they are 
now fleeing in disarray. 
  The Rwandese Patriotic Army has also liberated the whole of 
Mutara area and part of (Buganza). In this area the Rwandese 
Patriotic Army has taken an important road junction of Kayonza 
and from here the RPA has taken control of the road leading to 
Rusumo in Tanzania and the Kakitumba Road in Uganda. The only 
getaway to the outside world now accessible to the government 
forces comes through Burundi and Zaire. Ruhengeri town has been 
sieged by the Rwandese Patriotic Army and the government forces 
may be flushed out any time. 
  And in Kigali, fighting continues between the RPA and the 
government forces. The Rwandese Patriotic Army has taken a 
number of strategic areas in and around Kigali. The RPA in 
Kigali is mainly preoccupied with rescuing people who are being 
hunted down by the Presidential Guards. [passage omitted] 
  The campaign by the RPA continues.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 21 Apr (AFP) -- The UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) confirmed Thursday [21 April] that 
rebel forces had captured the northern town of Byumba, as 
fighting and ethnic killing continued in the east African 
nation. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had announced the 
capture of Byumba, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of the 
capital Kigali, the Mutura area in the northeast and part of the 
eastern Buganza area in radio reports. Pro-rebel Radio Muhabura 
also claimed that the rebels had made gains in Kigali and 
surrounded the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, where it said 
government troops could be "flushed out any time." 
  A UNAMIR spokesman, contacted by telephone from Nairobi, 
said 
he could confirm the Byumba capture but there was not enough 
information to comment on the other claims. "Yes, I can confirm 
(Byumba), I have seen the reports of our observers," he said, 
adding that there had been sporadic artillery and small arms 
fire in Kigali Thursday morning in the eastern part of the city. 
The spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name, said 
sporadic small arms and mortar fire were continuing in the 
eastern party of the capital Thursday. 
  The official Rwandan Army admitted earlier this week that a 
column of around 1,000 RPF reinforcements passing through the 
Byumba region had managed to link up with the 600 RPF soldiers 
stationed in Kigali under the terms of an earlier peace 
agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In the Central African country of Rwanda, a 
Belgian and a Spanish transport aircraft have evacuated another 
29 Westerners from a mission station near the town of Butare. 
The evacuees were 18 Spanish and French nuns and 11 observers 
of the United Nations. They were airlifted to the Kenyan 
capital, Nairobi. Two Spanish nuns are reported to have refused

  According to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders 
[Medecins Sans Frontieres], Butare is the scene of intense 
bloodshed. Yesterday dozens of injured people were brought to 
the hospital in the center of the town, where a doctor of the 
aid organization is operating. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the repatriation of Belgian Blue Berets who took 
part in the United Nations mission in Rwanda is continuing. All 
soldiers should be back in Belgium by this evening. Currently 
there are still about 300 Belgian Blue Berets in the Kenyan 
capital, Nairobi. [passage omitted] Besides the remaining 
Belgian Blue Berets in Nairobi, our country also has 800 
paratroopers in the Kenyan capital. They will stay in Kenya in 
view of the tense situation in Burundi. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Announcement by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) High </F>
Command to members of the Rwandan Government Armed Forces; 
issued in Mulindi on 18 April] 
  [Excerpts] Members of the Armed Forces of Rwanda, members 
of the national Gendarmerie, fellow countrymen, sons and 
daughters of our common motherland. Following the death of the 
head of state, President Juvenal Habyarimana at the hands of the 
clique opposed to the Arusha peace agreement and determined to 
maintain the grip of dictatorship on our country, that clique, 
using members of the Presidential Guard, Interahamwe and 
Impuzamigambi, the militias of CDR [Coalition for the Defense of 
the Republic] and MRND [Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development] parties, and some members of the 
regular army and gendarmerie, turned against sections of the 
civilian population, considered by MRND and CDR as opponents, 
and tried to completely exterminate them instigating the 
violence with ethnic sectarianism. [passage omitted] 
  We call upon you once again to take very urgent steps to 
preserve yourselves from the imminent destruction towards which 
the clique of murderers is pushing you. Let us join hands, 
instead, in shoving that clique from power. 
  We repeat our assurances that we shall not attack any member 
of the government Armed Forces who do not fight us. 
  We also call upon you members of the Armed Forces of Rwanda 
to stop discarding your uniforms and disguising yourselves in 
civilian population. Come out confidently and rest assured that 
you will be treated honorably as appropriate instructions have 
already been communicated to all the authorities concerned, 
regarding the manner of the reception. Our desire is that we 
shall in due course cooperate in forming a new national army 
responsible for maintaining public security. 
  In order to avoid the recurrent [word indistinct] bloodshed 
in our country, let he who has ears hear, let he who has eyes 
see. We have no doubt whatsoever that the majority amongst you 
have the wisdom and foresight to take the correct decision now. 
Thank you. 
  Signed, Major General Paul Kagame, Chairman, Rwandan 
Patriotic Army High Command. 
  [Dated] 18 April, Mulindi

  [Excerpts] Reports from across the country indicate that 
large-scale massacres of innocent citizens continue unabated. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Republic of Tanzania too has expressed its serious 
concern over the situation in Rwanda and indicated that it is 
planning to convene a meeting between the Rwandese Patriotic 
Army and Rwanda Government forces in Arusha this coming weekend. 
[passage omitted] 
  For the record, the response of the Rwandese Government 
Forces to the above [cease-fire] conditions has been negative. 
Much has [word indistinct] in the outside world may hope from 
negotiations between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and the 
Rwandese Government Forces, it is doubtful that the negotiations 
between the two forces under the current circumstances would be 
of any use, if at all possible. What is the point, some ask, of 
such dialogue with the Rwandese Government Forces when large 
parts of that army have joined hands with the Presidential Guard 
and other murderers in committing acts of genocide. Of what use 
are negotiations with the Rwandese Government forces as long as 
the Rwandese Government Forces still obstinately refuse to agree 
to the disbanding and punishment of the Presidential Guard, 
after all the carnage and destruction which the Presidential 
Guard has caused. Is there any hope of an [word indistinct] 
agreement with the Rwandese Government Forces when they still 
refuse to disassociate themselves and deny legitimacy to the 
self-styled provisional government extremists which (?usurped) 
political power and is masterminding the ongoing atrocities. 
And what moral rights or legal rights does the 
40,000-plus-strong army have to demand negotiations to determine 
the future of this country while they have stood by and still 
stand by on the fence, after two weeks, while hundreds of 
thousands of defenseless (?people) are slaughtered? Is there 
any hope of (?resolving) this conflict with the Rwandese 
Government Forces while they allow free rein to the clique of 
extremist murders who have [words indistinct] power, who use 
government resources, including arms and weapons [words 
indistinct], in exterminating whole sections of the population 
and boast about it in public as Mbonampeka Stanislas, (Donate 
Murego), Justin Mugenzi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse were doing the 
whole of yesterday on state radio.

  [Text] Combat aircraft yesterday parachuted fuel, war 
materiel, and foodstuffs for People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] units besieged in Cuito. Our 
correspondent reports that the seven parachutes fell into Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] defense lines at 
1500. FAPLA units and riot policemen tried in vain to retrieve 
the parachutes, violating the glorious FALA forces' defense 
lines, using intense fire backed by heavy and self-propelled 
artillery pieces. 
  FALA forces had no option but to defend themselves. After an 
intense 40-minute clash, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' adventurers 
were forced to beat a hasty retreat [words indistinct] 
abandoning large quantities of war materiel. The clashes took 
place in (Cambulucuco) Ward and in the former Fermina school. 
The incident occurred 48 hours after the FALA regional command 
warned the Luanda troops not to violate UNITA's defense lines. 
Our correspondent reports that the situation has returned to 
normal.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program presented by Max Gerard] </F>
  [Text] Lesotho is a tiny mountainous state surrounded by 
South Africa, where there seem to be pretty strange things 
happening at present. You may recall the interview at the start 
of the week on Network Africa, with the country's minister of 
natural resources, Monyane Moleleki, who had been briefly 
detained and released along with three other ministers by 
dissident soldiers. They also shot dead the deputy prime 
minister, Selometsi Baholo. Well, it now seems that these 
ministers and others may well have left the country for nearby 
Botswana. Veronique Edwardes is in Lesotho at the moment, and 
on the line to Maseru I asked her what she has been able to find 
out about the ministers' whereabouts. 
  [Begin recording] [Edwardes] The government came out with a 
statement saying these ministers had actually left to go to this 
country on ministerial duties and will be returning back to the 
country as soon as they finish what they were supposed to do. 
  [Gerard] So, you are saying that the government has now 
actually commented on the ministers leaving? 
  [Edwardes] Yes they have, and this leaves a lot of questions 
unanswered, because most people are asking the questions, if 
these ministers were supposed to go out on ministerial duties as 
the government now has now has come out with a statement to this 
effect, why did they leave in such a hurry, and why leave at 
night, and why were the officers not informed? Because I went 
to most of the offices of these ministers, apparently their 
secretaries did not even know that the ministers were out of the 
country, and at some point I even met some of the bodyguards of 
some of these ministers who had dutifully turned up for their 
duties and did not even realize that theirs ministers were not 
available. 
  [Gerard] So, just to clarify, Veronique, are we talking 
about 
five ministers who have gone to Botswana? 
  [Edwardes] I noticed about five or six ministers that are 
unaccounted for, the minister of natural resources, Mr. 
Moleleki; the minister of education, Mr. Mosisili; the minister 
of information and broadcasting, Malie; the minister justice, 
Mr. Albert Malope; and then the minister of trade, industry and 
tourism, who is the brother of the prime minister, Mr. Shakhane 
Mokhehle, and the prime minister is away. The minister of 
health is away, so you have a skeleton of a cabinet left, 
with?three ministers and a junior minister who was just employed 
last week. 
  [Gerard] So, where did the statement from the government 
come 
from? Who actually made it? 
  [Edwardes] The information came from the permanent secretary 
from the Ministry of Information last evening, and it was very 
short, and nobody really expanded more on what he had to say 
other than that these ministers were out on official duties and 
that they will be returning. 
  [Gerard] Can you describe first the atmosphere in Maseru at 
the moment, given these rather strange goings on, and still in 
the aftermath of the shock of the assassination of the deputy 
prime minister? 
  [Edwardes] In the towns and cities people do not care much 
as 
long as they are not directly by it, or if they are not 
personally affected by what is going on. This is what is really 
amazing, because on the surface of it, the people look very 
docile as if they don't care about what is going on, but deep 
down, when you talk to people you would know that they are 
worried, they are afraid, they don't know what is going to 
happen, and there are so many questions that they would like the 
government to answer. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program -- monitored in progress] </F>
  [Text] ...14th of April the deputy prime minister, Mr. 
Baholo, was murdered by soldiers in the Makoanyane Barracks 
outside Maseru and four cabinet ministers taken hostage. The 
circumstances of Mr. Baholo's death are still unclear, although 
we know that his body was riddled with bullets. His funeral 
will take place on Saturday 23 April in Leribe and Friday has 
been declared a day of mourning, with schools and buildings 
closing. 
  There is a strong military presence in the town, but apart 
from sporadic gunshots, everything is quiet at the moment, 
although Friday's public holiday reflects the government's 
concern about possible unrest. Prime Minister Mr. Mokhehle has 
not given any statement as yet on the abrupt departure of half 
his cabinet, but we believe that the ministers of information, 
natural resources, and trade have fled to Botswana, and the 
ministers for education and justice to South Africa. Whether 
the government of Lesotho will be able to overcome the present 
difficulties remains to be seen. This is Sara Hilderbrand for 
Radio Today in Maseru.

  [Text] Two of the six cabinet minister who had fled the 
country this week arrived in Maseru this morning. The principal 
secretary for information and broadcasting, Mr. Seeiso Serutla, 
said six cabinet ministers had fled the country after receiving 
rumors of threats to their lives. He said the rumors alleged 
that members of the Army would not accept their salary checks 
for this month and that the ministers would be killed. He said 
the situation was that the armed forces had accepted their 
checks and that allegations that ministers would be killed were 
not true. 
  Mr. Serutla said the Government of Lesotho has agreed with 
the leaders of the Army on some increase in the salaries of the 
armed forces and the increase will be reflected in their pay 
packets for May. Mr. Serutla further said it was true that some 
ministers were out of the country on official business and they 
are the ministers of foreign affairs, the minister of health, 
and that of labor and employment.

  [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [20 April] he 
would accept the results of South Africa's first all-race 
election next week if they were endorsed by the international 
community. 
  Addressing a short media conference in Ulundi after his 
first 
election rally in the kwaZulu capital, Mr Buthelezi said: "One 
must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be 
it -- whatever one's feelings may be." 
  On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said 
these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would 
head the party list for the National Assembly. "As national 
leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One 
can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on 
whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position. 
  The IFP president was at pains to point out that his party 
had decided to contest the poll just 24 hours earlier and was 
still in the process of preparing its nomination lists.

  [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- The kwaZulu government has 
pledged its full support to ensure an additional 500 voting 
stations are established in the territory before the elections, 
according to Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
Vice-chairman Dikgang Moseneke. 
  Addressing the media after a five-hour meeting with the 
kwaZulu Legislative Assembly in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 April], 
Mr Moseneke said a tough job awaited the IEC in the six days 
remaining before the elections. 
  But he added the IEC would try its "damndest" to ensure it 
was prepared for elections in the region. "It's going to be 
very tough. We are going to have to work very hard. We will 
literally have to camp in kwaZulu/Natal," he said. 
  In contrast to the hostile reception afforded IEC Chairman 
Mr 
Justice Johann Kriegler last month, Mr Moseneke said the IEC had 
been met with "nothing less than co-operation in all areas". 
"We are delighted to serve this region without any 
impediments... We generally reached agreement on all aspects 
pertaining to voter preparation." 
  IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen explained that an extra 500 
polling stations had to be set up to supplement the 1,000 
already planned. Another 13,000 people had to be trained to 
staff the new polling stations. 
  He said there would be intensive training courses at the 
weekend, adding this required "a hell of a degree of commitment". 
  Mr Moseneke added that traditional chiefs had also given 
their full support to the IEC's voter education programme 
provided they were informed of the IEC's presence in their 
areas. This was in stark contrast to the blatant rejection by 
some chiefs in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly of Mr Justice 
Kriegler's request for similar co-operation last month. 
  Mr Moseneke said the kwaZulu government had pledged its full 
co- operation including the use of human resources, transport 
and other logistic requirements. 
  The kwaZulu Police would be involved in securing polling 
stations.

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says the party has no plans to enter into an alliance 
with another party. Speaking to reporters on his arrival at a 
rally outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly at Ulundi, Dr. 
Buthelezi admitted that there was little time left for the IFP 
to campaign. He said this would make it difficult for the party 
to reach out to all its followers and that it could be a 
setback. Tens of thousands of IFP supporters are gathered 
outside the assembly to listen to Dr. Buthelezi.

  [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [20 April] he 
had joined South Africa's electoral process to save the country 
from disaster and to contribute to peace. Interviewed before he 
addressed more than 10,000 jubilant IFP supporters in the 
kwaZulu capital Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said although he did not 
think the IFP's participation in national elections would lead 
to an immediate reduction in violence "the proportion of 
violence will be less". 
  He said it would be naive to believe Inkatha's participation 
in elections would mean an end to violence "but it should 
decrease because tensions are less". "It will be difficult to 
imagine that all tension can vanish in a few days...we would 
hope tension will somehow be decreased." 
  He said he had asked State President F W de Klerk to lift 
the 
state of emergency only to be told that his advisers had 
suggested he impose the emergency in other volatile parts of the 
country. 
  Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's 
elections he said he did not want to "prophesy...that will be 
tested." "Some of our offices can't cope with the number of 
people joining," he added. 
  Mr Buthelezi said his late entry into the election race 
would 
hamper the IFP's performance. He said voter education had not 
reached all of his supporters and "this indicates it could well 
affect the percentage (of support)". 
  Asked why he had entered elections at this late stage, the 
chief minister replied: "I did so to save the country from 
disaster and to contribute to peace." 
  The IFP president was later received by cheering crowds 
outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building.

  [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was received as a hero by about 
10,000 jubilant supporters in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 March] at 
his first rally in support of next week's elections. 
  The mood in the kwaZulu capital throughout Wednesday was one 
of excitement and celebration, following the IFP's decision on 
Tuesday to contest the country's first all-race poll. 
  Thousands of singing and dancing IFP supporters streamed 
through central Ulundi during the day, before gathering outside 
the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building to hear Mr Buthelezi's 
first pro- election address. "Who is the president of South 
Africa?" an official asked the excited crowd, which responded 
with a resounding: "Shenge (Mr Buthelezi's clan name)." 
  The crowd sang, danced and ululated in a jubilant 
celebration 
of the impending election. 
  Despite being three hours late Mr Buthelezi arrived to 
overwhelming cheers. In his address he acknowledged there was 
little time for electioneering, but said: "Miracles may still 
happen." He urged his followers not to be complacent, but to 
face the "biggest hurdle which is the election". 
  The IFP president said he had been serving his people for 40 
years and "now that my dream is coming true, I hope you will 
allow me to complete my job by electing me". 
  The IFP had joined the elections to save the country from 
disaster and to contribute to peace, he said. The IFP's 
participation in national elections would not lead to an 
immediate reduction in violence but the "proportion of violence 
will be less," he added. 
  The party's late entry into the elections would hamper its 
performance because voter education had not reached all his 
supporters. 
  Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's 
elections, Mr Buthelezi said he did not want to predict what 
would happen, but added "that will be tested". "Some of our 
offices can't cope with the number of people joining," Mr 
Buthelezi said. 
  He later told a news conference he would accept the results 
of South Africa's first all-race [passage indistinct]. "One 
must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be 
it -- whatever one's feelings may be." 
  On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said 
these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would 
head the party list for the national assembly. "As national 
leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One 
can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on 
whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP Central Committee member Ben Ngubane, </F>
ANC official Mac Maharaj, and IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross 
by announcer John Bishop in the Johannesburg studio--live] 
  [Text] [Bishop] A very good evening to you. First the big 
news of the day. The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will take part 
in next week's historic election. That momentous agreement was 
reached earlier today at the meeting between the IFP's chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, National Party's F.W. de Klerk, and the 
ANC's Nelson Mandela. Thank you all very much gentlemen for 
coming. 
  Starting with you, Dr. Ngubane. Just briefly, the talks that 
you backed down last week -- the international mediators went 
home -- and here you are in this situation. How did it happen? 
  [Ngubane] Well, fortunately, the negotiations continued 
after 
the mediators had left for their countries. Professor Okumu of 
Kenya carried on negotiations between Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and Dr. Mandela, and President de Klerk; and sooner or later 
consensus emerged as to the way forward. 
  [Bishop] Yes, Mr. Maharaj, how are you reading this now, 
this 
question was put in our new bulletin -- victory or defeat for 
whom? 
  [Maharaj] I think it's an unqualified victory for the people 
of our country -- all our people, black and white across the 
board. I think South Africa today was able to breath a sigh of 
relief at the breakthrough that was made through this agreement. 
I do not think we should look at the matter from the point of 
view of winners and losers. Political commentators will talk 
about strategies, failed strategies, and bad strategies. The 
important thing is that South Africa now is faced with an 
election which is really inclusive. It has been achieved in 
injury time, but still a try scored in injury time is a try. 
  [Bishop] I've heard that somewhere before. Pik Botha said 
it, that's right. Let's move to you, Mr. van der Ross. The 
meat and potatoes, the bread and butter question. Eighteen 
million ballots now to have IFP added to them. How are you 
going to do it? 
  [Van der Ross] Well, with a lot of elbow grease, of course. 
The whole logistics of being able to provide at this very late 
stage for an effective accommodation of a new player is truly 
going to be very problematic and very difficult, but we have 
mobilized immediately a sort of an A-team into the field, they 
are already in kwaZulu working with our local team there. We've 
got a back-up team back in the head office working right at this 
moment on developing strategies for all the different elements 
of the election. On the basis of the work we have done today 
already it does look as if it's possible to put it together. 
  [Bishop] Now sticking physically IFP at the bottom of the 
form, that will probably raise some legal questions there? 
  [Van der Ross] No, the act and the regulations will be 
changed to accommodate all of the necessary. There are a number 
of issues that will need to be changed, but obviously with the 
cooperation of all the parties this is going to be possible. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Maharaj, the amendments that have to be made 
now. What do they look like? 
  [Maharaj] The amendments are being drafted since this 
afternoon. They will be put to the negotiating council 
tomorrow. The amendments to the constitution are fairly straight 
forward. They simply are an amendment to two clauses, one, a 
constitutional principle; and the other one is Section 160 which 
provides that in the case of provincial constitutions, and 
specifically in the case of kwaZulu/Natal, there shall be 
provision for the Zulu monarch. 
  [Bishop] Dr. Ngubane, now what has happened? What is the 
situation with King Zwelithini and the Zulu nation, and how are 
you reading that? 
  [Ngubane] Well, the king was worried when it became clear 
that a federal dispensation will not be achieved in this 
country. So self-determination for his people, for his kingdom 
was going to be totally wiped off the political process. So he 
demanded that the sovereignty of the Zulu Kingdom should be 
restored, and the kingdom itself recognized. We worked hard at 
negotiating this position, and now it is going to be enshrined 
both in the national constitution, and it will be made mandatory 
for the provincial constitution of kwaZulu/Natal -- to enshrine 
that as well. 
  [Bishop] Nevertheless it remains as part of the greater 
whole, doesn't it? 
  [Ngubane] Certainly, it's part of a greater South Africa, 
but 
allowing for the different communities to achieve what we can 
call a fair measure of self-determination. 
  [Bishop] What do you say Mr. Maharaj? 
  [Maharaj] I do not think that the provision speaks in any 
way 
about sovereignty. What the provision says is that the 
constitution of Natal shall provide a place for the Zulu 
monarch. That will be left to the legislature, and it will be 
left to the mediation process to resolve precisely in what form 
and to what extent the matter is dealt with. But I think that 
nonetheless it is important that the provision has led to 
similar space being made in other provinces where there may be a 
monarch. 
  [Bishop] Now back to you, Dr. Ngubane. Now the Zulu 
supporters, the supporters indeed, not just Zulu, of the IFP. 
Are they going to get the message quickly that you are on board 
now? 
  [Ngubane] Well, we've been very much primed for elections 
all 
along. We have an election campaign which has been working 
incessantly. We never opposed election as a matter of just 
opposing it. We wanted to have a dispensation that we could 
live with, that could have meaning to the lives of our people, 
and that has been achieved, and we are ready to go. 
  [Bishop] But when you say ready to go, I mean, only a week 
ago you were saying no go, and I suppose that message got 
through -- all over the place where there are IFP supporters. 
Now you will have to say go, go, go. 
  [Ngubane] Well, our people are highly motivated, highly 
politicized, and they will respond accordingly. 
  [Maharaj] I do think that the public have been faced with 
confused signals coming from the Inkatha Freedom Party, and 
perhaps I would ascribe that to poor tactics and strategy, 
because it is very important that while politicians are seen to 
be people who make glib promises, it is very important as people 
who have fought for freedom that our promises should be real and 
should be consistent. And I believe that that's a crucial 
element in winning voter support. 
  [Bishop] Dr. Ngubane, would you comment there? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I mean, Mac is (?skirting) the whole ball 
game here. He was one of the people who made it impossible for 
us to be part of the process from the word go by the 
intransigence that they adopted in the negotiating process. 
Thank God that sense has prevailed at last. So, we have never 
promised anything that was not attainable. What we wanted was a 
federal dispensation for this country which the negotiation 
process was quite capable of addressing, but it was stopped from 
doing so. 
  [Bishop] Alright, let's move on now, if we may, to violence. 
The whole country, I suppose, is screaming out: Let's stop it, 
stop it, stop it! What steps are both parties, the ANC and the 
IFP taking, like really, to go and stop this now? 
  [Ngubane] Well, the agreement states very clearly that it is 
an agreement for reconciliation and peace in South Africa, and 
all the signatories commit themselves, pledge themselves to work 
for peaceful and free elections. So it is going to have to be a 
truly combined effort. No one party can do it on its own. 
  [Bishop] The mass action now? Inkatha youth, are they going 
to march or not? 
  [Ngubane] Well, the cause for mass action is removed, as far 
as we are concerned? 
  [Bishop] Will the message get through? 
  [Ngubane] Well, it is getting through right now because 
there 
was no mass action yesterday, today, and tomorrow, so the 
message is getting through. 
  [Bishop] Another question for you at the moment, Dr. 
Ngubane... 
  [Maharaj, interrupting] I think that on the question of 
violence the country has certainly gone past the point where the 
threat of violence to the electoral process, which was perceived 
at one time as a very serious and formidable threat, has now 
been reduced, in my estimate by about 75 percent from what it 
was two months ago. The events which brought Bophuthatswana 
fully -- the people of Bophuthatswana into the electoral 
process, the break up of the white right, as well as the coming 
in of the IFP, have reduced that potential for violence 
immensely, and I believe that if we work at it with a will -- 
all parties -- we can, certainly shortly after the elections, 
through national unity establish peace in our country. 
  [Bishop] Right, one more for you before I move on a little 
bit, Dr. Ngubane. The imbizo [meeting], gathering of Zulus 
called by His Majesty the king, will it go ahead? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I don't know yet, but His Majesty has called 
the imbizo to mark a sad moment in our history, where we were 
being stripped of our identity and our possessions and so on -- 
now, I don't know whether that precise condition still exists or 
not. 
  [Maharaj] My understanding of the matter is slightly 
different. We did consult His Majesty in the course of the 
negotiations, and he indicated that the press reports were not 
within his knowledge, that he would be looking into the matter, 
and certainly he has issued a statement now calling upon his 
subjects to participate in the elections. So I believe that 
now, since it was called according to press reports for the 
26th, 27th, 28th, that matter will no longer intrude on the 
electoral process and the elections will go on. 
  [Bishop] Well, let's stay with King Zwelithini. Dr. Ngubane, 
what is his status now? 
  [Ngubane] Well, he is recognized as the constitutional 
monarch in terms of our present kwaZulu constitution. He has a 
function in the Legislative Assembly, he is the head of the 
whole indigenous law system, he is the head of the amakhosi 
[chiefs], and he occupies a position of unity in terms of our 
nation. 
  [Bishop] And the obvious next one, Chief Buthelezi, what's 
his position? 
  [Ngubane] Well, he is the traditional prime minister to the 
king, but he is also the elected head of government of kwaZulu. 
  [Bishop] There has been a news rumor--let's put it no more 
than that--for the last couple of weeks, that Chief Buthelezi 
was offered even a deputy presidency, a cabinet position, even 
if the IFP did not score well at the polls. True or false? 
  [Ngubane] No, I have not heard of such an offer. I think Dr. 
Buthelezi is a democrat. He will work hard to lead out party to 
victory so that they will be no offers, but he will get what is 
his due in terms of the constitutional provisions. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Maharaj? 
  [Maharaj] Certainly no such offer has been made from our 
side. What we have consistently said is, and in promoting the 
idea of a government of national unity, is that on the basis of 
the electoral results, we will do everything to accord all the 
parties a proper place in that government. We believe that the 
next five years centrally require a trust of national unity. We 
are coming from a conflict ridden, hate ridden society, and we 
have an immense job of reconstruction, so we made no such offer, 
except to say that each party believes it is important, has 
immense electoral support. The elections will test that, and on 
the basis of that test each will be accorded a proper place in 
that government of national unity. 
  [Bishop] That means what? 
  [Maharaj] It means if any party wins five percent of seats 
in 
the National Assembly, it qualifies for one seat in the cabinet, 
and in proportion to the higher percentage of number of seats it 
has in the assembly, it will get the requisite seats in the 
cabinet. So that if a party won 60 percent of the seats, it 
will have 60 percent of the cabinet. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Van der Ross, I know you are not going to 
engage, obviously, in the political discourse, but there are 
some more questions for you, very quickly. One concerns the 
safety of your monitors and their ability to get to places. How 
confident are you that this can happen, I don't think in 
particular in Natal/kwaZulu, of course? 
  [Van der Ross] Well, we are certainly looking to the kwaZulu 
authorities to provide both the message and the cover for the 
climate for our people to be able to move freely through the 
territory. If we are to set up machinery we need to, within a 
very short space of time, a few days, if we are to move in with 
massive voter education programs which we are planning, we can 
only do that with complete cooperation from the authorities. 
But we are pretty certain that it is obviously in the interests 
of Inkatha, and through that possibly the kwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly, to give that kind of assistance, and I am sure we will 
get it. 
  [Bishop] They will, Dr. Ngubane? They'll get this support? 
  [Ngubane] They certainly will. We've always pledged support 
for the IEC. 
  [Bishop] What's the situation about the state of emergency, 
or partial state of emergency, the National Peacekeeping Force? 
Couple of questions there in one? What's going to be the 
attitude now? 
  [Ngubane] We have not really addressed that issue. We do 
accept that it's anachronistic to say you're going to have free 
and fair elections while you have a state of emergency. We have 
stated that position. But nevertheless we need to maintain the 
highest levels of law and order and peace during the election 
process. 
  [Bishop] There might be loose canons there outside your 
control. 
  [Ngubane] That's what forces of law and order are there for. 
That is a job really for the security forces. 
  [Bishop] And the National Peacekeeping Force -- is it going 
to be recognized as for what it has been set up there -- to 
maintain peace as a national force? 
  [Ngubane] We've had problems with the constitution of the 
National Peacekeeping Force because it's taken in what I would 
call party-political people and pretended to turn them into a 
national peacekeeping force which will be above prejudice and 
impartial. We doubt that people who have been trained as 
political guerrilla forces can perform such a function. 
  [Maharaj] Let me say this about the state of emergency. It 
was imposed because of the violence and the loss of life. If 
that continues, I believe that this agreement will contribute 
substantially to reducing that violence. But the violence is 
totally unacceptable. Yesterday the death of a leading 
photographer, Ken Oosterbroek, threw South Africa into a shock. 
Any more deaths are unacceptable. So the state of emergency 
has been motivated by that need, and at present, while the 
agreement holds promise, the reality is that the violence is 
ravaging that province, and we need to maintain it in such a way 
that free political activity can take place actively. 
  [Bishop] Thank you very much. Just a reminder that, of 
course we've been talking to Mac Maharaj, Dr. Ben Ngubane, Mr. 
Van der Ross; and we did approach the National Party, 
unfortunately they've have an extremely busy political day and 
we could not get anybody here at this time. That is the reason 
why we don't see the National Party sitting with our other 
guests.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] could not be treated with kid gloves because it was 
now a full participant in the election process, African National 
Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Multiparty 
Negotiating Council [MPNC] at the World Trade Centre on 
Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Mr Ramaphosa welcomed IFP delegates back to the MPNC which 
was sitting to consider constitutional amendments on the future 
of Zulu king goodwill Zwelithini. The amendments were agreed 
upon by IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC President Nelson 
Mandela and President F W de Klerk on Tuesday. 
  While welcoming the IFP back, Mr Ramaphosa said the cost of 
the IFP's return had been high. He said up to 700 people had 
died in political violence since the IFP failed to follow 
through on its electoral registration last month. "The cost of 
bringing back the IFP into the election process has been very 
high for our people," Mr Ramaphosa said. 
  He said a statement by IFP negotiator Walter Felgate that 
the 
IFP had deliberately played hard to get until the latest 
possible moment and had been worth millions of rands, made his 
heart bleed. 
  South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said he 
hoped the IFP was entering the election with a view to accepting 
the results. In a reference to kwaZulu's separatist notions, Mr 
Slovo said a "Savimbi option had no future in South Africa. 
  Mr Felgate said the IFP was not entering the elections on a 
conditional basis and was totally committed to the electoral 
process. He said the IFP would work for peace and for a 
successful election. He said he had been quoted selectively 
about the publicity value of the IFP's strategy.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Multiparty 
Negotiating Council sitting at the World Trade Centre on 
Wednesday [20 April] unanimously accepted constitutional 
amendments enabling the Inkatha Freedom Party's participation in 
next week's election. 
  The amendment will be forwarded to Parliament for inclusion 
in the interim constitution. Parliament will also consider an 
amendment to the 13th constitutional principle on the position 
of the Zulu king. 
  The amendment was accepted together with a resolution 
committing all the parties to accepting the election results. 
  The amendment came about as a result of an agreement on 
Tuesday between President F W de Klerk, IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela. 
  It reads: "A provincial constitution may, where applicable, 
provide for the institution, role, authority and status of a 
traditional monarch in the province, and shall make such 
provision for the Zulu monarch in the case of the Province of 
Natal/kwaZulu". 
  The resolution on the elections committed all the parties to 
"free and fair elections and to doing everything to put a stop 
to the violence in our country". 
  "We will accept the results of the elections and will abide 
by the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission in 
respect of the fairness and freeness of the elections. We will 
not resort to violence under any circumstances in order to 
pursue political objectives," the resolution said. 
  Earlier both Mr Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development 
Minister Roelf Meyer alleged that the IFP had settled for a lot 
less than was originally offered with regard to the Zulu king. 
  Mr Meyer said it was clear that the IFP had hoped to 
postpone 
the elections by its tactics. 
  IFP negotiator Walter Felgate said the IFP had acted not in 
its own narrow interests but in the interests of the entire 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Thursday [21 April] approved a series of 
measures to increase the number of people eligible to vote in 
next week's elections. The council resolved that people who came 
to South Africa before June 13, 1986 but who under old 
legislation were denied the right to permanent reidence and the 
right to vote, would be allowed to vote. 
  The National Union of Mineworkers had pointed out to the 
council that many of its members had been working in South 
Africa for decades but were not allowed to claim permanent 
residence. 
  Now, if they have been in the country for five years and if 
they arrived before June 13, 1986 they will be allowed to vote. 
  South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said the 
amendment put black migrant workers on a par with European 
migrants. 
  A second resolution amended the Electoral Act to allow 
homeland residents who are in possession of travel documents to 
vote. This amendment affects about one million people. 
  The Executive Council also passed amendments to allow the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the elections. 
  The substance of the amendments was agreed in trilateral 
talks involving the IFP, the African National Congress and the 
government earlier this week. 
  The Executive Council agreed to the amendment that will 
allow 
the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to attach IFP 
stickers to ballot papers. 
  Joint executive secretary Mac Maharaj said the IEC was 
subjecting the sticker glue to stringent laboratory tests. 
  These tests would ensure the stickers did not come loose and 
fall off or cover the names of other parties in which case the 
ballot would be regarded as a spoilt vote. 
  The amendments will be proclaimed by President F W de Klerk 
and do not need to come before Parliament when it convenes on 
Monday.

  [Text] In-depth talks between the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] and the Freedom Front could lead 
to both the Conservative Party [CP] and the volksfront taking 
part in the elections. This comes after Freedom Front Leader 
Constand Viljoen approached AVF president and CP leader Ferdie 
Hartzenberg with proposals on participation at provincial level. 
  This morning, Dr. Hartzenberg said he would take part in the 
election only if certain conditions were included in the 
constitution. These include the guarantee of a volkstaat 
[homeland] if more than 800,000 voters cast their ballots in 
favor of as volkstaat at provincial level. The second condition 
is that the volkstaat be granted political independence but 
economic interdependence. If General Viljoen accepts Dr. 
Hartzenberg's proposals, he will approach the government and the 
ANC. Dr. Hartzenberg said Gen. Viljoen should withdraw from the 
election if the government and the ANC refuse to accept the 
proposals.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Quintal] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- Minister of 
Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said on Thursday [21 
April] there was no possibility of amending the constitution and 
that the right-wing had not approached the government in this 
regard. He was commenting in an interview with SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] radio on the possibility of 
the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner 
National Front] participating in the election if certain 
conditions were met. 
  Mr Meyer said the idea of 800,000 votes indicating support 
for a volkstaat [homeland] was not viable because it would not 
be an indication of the locality of a volkstaat. 
  Referring to the right-wing's demand for independence, he 
said the government was not prepared to fragment South Africa. 
Self-determination could be aspired to within the framework of 
the existing constitution. 
  Mr Meyer said the right-wing already had what it wanted, 
which was why Gen Constand Viljoen was taking part in the 
election. 
  He suggested Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg link up with Gen Viljoen.

<F P=106> [Interview with State President F.W. de Klerk by Richard </F>
Steyn, Shaun Johnson, and Chris Whitfield in the president's 
office in the Union Buildings; date not specified] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On whether he is still confident about the future. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I believe, I am confident, that we are going to 
succeed. There is no alternative, and in that sense I think 
this period will be written up as the period beginning a new era 
which launched South Africa as a very successful state and as a 
successful nation. 
<H5>  On the fears of Afrkaners and other groups. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I believe the Afrikaner nation, and the Zulu 
nation and all other nations which form part of the greater 
whole of the South African nation, need not fear for their 
futures as entities. Already, in terms of the transitional 
constitution, there is a sufficient constitutional and legal 
base (to protect them). I believe that as long as there is a 
commitment among Afrikaner to cherish their language and their 
culture and traditions, the Afrikaner nation will continue to 
exist. And it can only exist in interaction with all other 
South Africans. 
<H5>  On the folly of separatism. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I also believe that the new 34th principle (of 
the 
Interim Constitution), in conjunction with the others will lead 
to a dynamic negotiation about the strength of the position of 
the various cultural groups, nations in South Africa...however, 
I don't see the guarantee for the identity of Afrikaners or 
other nations existing in separatism in any way whatsoever. But 
I think there are various possibilities at which we could look 
within the framework of the constitution, as to how we could 
strengthen the security of people who feel strongly about their 
cultural identity. They are struggling with it, but in Belgium 
there are interesting examples as to what can be achieved. 
<H5>  On a volkstaat. [Afrikaner homeland] </H5>
  [De Klerk] Rather than working for a volkstaat which is 
unachievable, I think Afrikaners and the Zulus and others should 
look specifically at other (constitutional) options to maintain 
their identity. 
<H5>  On whether he would do anything differently with the benefit </H5>
of hindsight. 
  [De Klerk] On the major issues and the major decisions, I 
have no regrets. On some specifics, yes. With hindsight one 
would have done certain things differently, approached 
negotiations about a specific issue maybe differently...things 
which wasted time. But on major issues no regrets. I would 
have taken the same decisions, I would have made the same speech 
on the 2nd of February, I would have called the referendum, I 
would have abolished the apartheid laws and I would have worked 
for the type of constitution which we now have. 
<H5>  On the Interim Constitution. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I'm happy with the constitution, basically 
satisfied. It's not perfect, I think it can be improved, but on 
all the goals which we spelt out in the referendum, we have 
basically achieved them. We stated 14 principles, departure 
points, call them what you will. And all 14 are there, in some 
instances to 100 percent satisfaction, in a few instances we got 
120 percent -- we actually started out setting our sight a 
little bit lower but we got more. In other instances maybe 80 
percent, but substantially we have achieved those 14 goals which 
we strove for. The transitional constitution and the 
principles, I think, lay a sound basis for the right type of 
constitution for South Africa. 
<H5>  On whether he has considered stepping down. </H5>
  [De Klerk] No, I don't lie awake at night. Really, I haven't 
thought about it, I have been working so hard. And can I say 
that, honestly, in the government of national unity I will be 
number one, even if I happen to come second in the election. I 
will be number one for the millions of people who are going to 
vote for me. I will be there representing them in my own right, 
I won't be there as anybody's number two man. 
<H5>  On the possibility of being deputy president. </H5>
  [De Klerk] If I was to be number two in the hierarchy after 
the election, I have no problem with that. It will be a 
government of national unity. In a winner-takes-all system it 
happens quite often that a former prime minister becomes the 
leader of the opposition. We are moving into a unique situation 
and I have no compunction about what lies a head. 
<H5>  On how the NP [National Party] will perform next week. </H5>
  [De Klerk] We are fighting to become the biggest party. 
Against even our own expectations and predictions, growing 
support is already showing up in the opinion polls. We didn't 
expect it to show so soon. There is a particular surge of 
support in Natal. And remember, when we talk about being the 
biggest party, we are not talking about having 50 percent or 
more of the vote in terms of our new system. 
<H5>  On the option of staying out of the new Cabinet as an </H5>
opposition party. 
  [De Klerk] Well, that is a constitutional option. Nobody is 
forced into the government of national unity. But such a step 
would militate against what we set out to achieve. We said it 
is our policy that there must be power-sharing. We believe the 
country needs co-operation between the major parties. We need 
at least a period of stability during which political strife is 
put aside and we make a great effort at reconciliation and 
creating stability. And, on the basis of that stability, within 
the framework of wise and frugal economic policies, creating 
dynamic and sustained economic growth. The intensive 
negotiation of the past four years has proved itself to be a 
powerful mechanism, and this is what a government of national 
unity is about, it is a constant process of negotiation. Up 
till now we have been negotiating the constitution. In the 
government of national unity it becomes negotiation about each 
and every important issue which governments have to deal with. 
<H5>  On his experiences on the campaign trail. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I've had no overwhelming problems so far in this 
campaign. The real bitterness of the right wing played itself 
out in 1989. It's still there of course, but it no longer 
impacts on my meetings and day-to-day activities. The last real 
problem I had was at Ventersdorp. Vis-a-vis the intimidation 
from ANC supporters, it has been a regular feature. Where it 
really got out of hand we laid complaints, and as you know big 
fines have been levied now. Those were really bad cases. In 
other instances we lived with it where it didn't get out of 
hand. Politics isn't for sissies. It's robust and I am not 
overly sensitive. You must just see to it that you have a very 
strong microphone and it has, sometimes, a very motivating 
effect on your own supporters when they see you are not 
frightened, and especially when they outnumber the others. 
  One of the good experiences was at one of my roadshows where 
a group of about 80 ANC youths was waving placards, and I think 
we had about 800 or so. So I said: "Why do we wait for the 27th 
of April? Let's vote now. All those of you who vote for the 
National Party put up your hands. It was a sea of hands. And 
then I said: "All those who vote for the ANC?" About 15 hands 
went up, and it created a great spirit. 
<H5>  On how the relationship with the majority party will work. </H5>
  [De Klerk] We'll have to develop procedures for that. I've 
had interesting discussions with European leaders who are in 
similar situations. As a guideline, I would say there must be 
room for public dissension, because parties will retain their 
identity. On day-to-day matters, on immediate matters where 
consensus is reached, obviously we would avoid making the 
original dissension public. But where we do want to express our 
disagreement -- that is what Parliament is there for. You could 
even register your opposition to a decision by taking a vote in 
parliament. But then, as happens with boards of directors in a 
company, you vote against it but you acquiesce in the decision 
of the majority. 
  One would have to limit such things to major policy issues 
where a party needs to say to the public: "If I had the sole 
say, this is how I would have done it." It is possible to marry 
these things. It happens in every practical partnership every 
day. 
<H5>  On whether he will be able to criticise the new Cabinet </H5>
freely. 
  [De Klerk] Absolutely yes, that is why I emphasise that I am 
not there on the basis of anybody doing me a favour. I will be 
there as of right because the constitution says so. Another 
aspect which gives me confidence is that in negotiations we 
looked at the problem of what happens if you don't get along 
well, and we considered whether we should have decision-making 
processes -- increased majorities, a voting procedure for 
Cabinet -- and we agreed not to do so because that would 
militate against the spirit of a government of national unity. 
That says in itself you must seek unity, you must seek 
consensus, and we opted for consensus rule with regard to 
decision-making, without prescribed procedures which introduces 
a guillotine. 
  Because, once you have those, it is so easy to become 
confrontational because there is a decisive method in which to 
get a decision in any event. I want to avoid that and my 
interlocutors agreed with that. So, if the commitment is there 
from all sides, this is what the country needs. 
<H5>  On "no-go" areas for parties. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I'm not a cry baby about the campaign so far. But 
what does bother me is when one is prevented from addressing a 
meeting. That is essentially wrong. A public meeting is a 
public meeting, and other people from other parties have the 
right to attend, as long as they don't get out of hand. One 
must live with it. 
  The fact that there are certain inaccessible areas, or 
virtually inaccessible areas, is a blot on South Africa's 
reputation, and we must work to see that really free and fair 
campaigning, full and open campaigning, can be possible at all 
times. But you can't be too theoretical about this. I don't 
think the DP [Democratic Party] ever held a public meeting 
let's say in Swartruggens -- they don't have supporters there. 
It is a reality. As a party one analyses where your strengths 
lie. The difficulty arises where you really know you can make 
inroads, break into new areas -- this is our position -- and 
then get barricades. 
<H5>  On fears of chaos after election. </H5>
  [De Klerk] I think that is overdone. I don't agree. I think 
there will be euphoria, depending upon the results of course -- 
it will determine who will be euphoric and who will not. But I 
think there will be festivities and activity, and from radicals 
even maybe last gasp sorts of protest. But I think it will die 
down soon. I think the public, almost all South Africans, are a 
bit tired of politics. They want life to return to normal, they 
want their TV and newspapers to become more relaxing and 
entertaining. I think that reflects the mood of the whole 
country; I really think by 11 May things will basically return 
to normal.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>
  [Text] We continue with our interviews with the leaders of 
the main political parties. Siphiwo Mogoda asked ANC President 
Nelson Mandela how he felt about voting for the first time in 
his life. 
  [Begin recording] [Mandela] It is difficult for me to 
imagine 
exactly how I would feel, except that to all of us it would be a 
historic and very exciting moment, because our forebears have 
fought for more than centuries for the day of liberation. To 
make that cross would be the fulfilment of a long-cherished 
dream which would enable us to close a chapter and to start 
laying the foundation stone so that all our people, without 
exception, can have a better life. 
  [Mogoda] Would you say things are more difficult outside 
prison than they were when you were still inside? 
  [Mandela] These are things which are incomparable because in 
prison, although one had time to sit down and to reflect on his 
work and the mistakes that have been committed in the past, and 
how to plan one's program, nevertheless it was not the type of 
life one would like to imagine for himself. Outside one has the 
opportunity to realize his life's ambition, to work with other 
comrades, to meet people, to exchange views, and to be able to 
make a contribution to the struggle for the liberation of our 
people. There have been some positive things which we achieved 
in jail, but in spite of that prison is something that we do not 
wish anybody to go through. Whatever difficulties one faces 
outside, you are facing challenges which are intended to get 
your people to enjoy a better life. 
  [Mogoda] You are described as a former prisoner who came out 
of jail not bitter at all. Have you forgotten how to be bitter? 
  [Mandela] No. One has got feelings, and one is human. There 
are certain things which you feel ought not to have been done to 
you, but when you have got a program to carry out, it is not 
possible to concentrate on the negative aspects of your 
experiences, and in this regard I am not unique. All my 
colleagues who have been in prison, and those who have been in 
exile, those who have been harassed inside, they haven't got 
this feeling of bitterness, and they're concerned with promoting 
the welfare of the people of South Africa and solving problems, 
and therefore there is no time for bitterness, even if they 
wanted to be. 
  [Mogoda] What sort of dream did you have while in prison 
about South Africa and its people? 
  [Mandela] Well, I really wouldn't say that I had any 
specific 
dreams, except the important point of contributing to the 
liberation of our people. I tried in my situation to follow the 
campaigns launched by my colleagues, my comrades outside the 
country under the leadership of Comrade Oliver Tambo, and I was 
tremendously impressed by what they were doing. My only dream 
was to make a contribution to the immortal work which they were 
doing, highly impressive, competent leadership. My ambition, my 
dream, was to do everything in my power and in my situation to 
make their task as easy as possible. 
  [Mogoda] As a man who keeps fit, how much ls left of your 
strength at this stage and how long will you continue to lead 
the ANC? 
  [Mandela] Well, for my age, which now is 75, I feel 
comparatively fit and I'm enjoying life, I'm enjoying the 
challenges which face me. As far as serving as leader of the 
African National Congress, this is not a position I have chosen 
for myself. It's a position given to me by my comrades. I will 
serve as long as they want me to serve. I am prepared to serve 
for another 5 years but of course, as I have said before, I am 
not getting young. At the end of that period of 5 years it will 
be necessary for me to give way to a younger man. 
  [Mogoda] Would we say that there's someone that you are 
grooming for this position? 
  [Mandela] No. It is for the comrades, at the right time, to 
select a leader. All that I can say is that we have highly 
competent comrades who can take the position of leadership, who 
deserve that position, and therefore I do not think in our 
situation it is necessary to groom any particular individual.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
20 April] 
  [Text] The ANC has repeatedly said that the National Party 
[NP] has no programme or plan to place before the South African 
public. It is consequently running a totally negative campaign, 
trying to punch holes through the ANC's own carefully developed 
Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. 
  The NP's media conference of Tuesday 19th April was yet 
another case in point. We do not want to be trapped into a 
sterile argument about figures and estimates. But we think it 
is appropriate to point up that these are the scare tactics used 
in other campaigns in other countries in recent years. In the 
USA, the public relations consultants employed by the NP, 
attempted to use the same ploy against the Clinton/Gore 
presidential campaign. In Britain the very same tactics were 
used against the Labour Party. The executive summary of the 
current document even makes the bizarre observation: "This 
report is based on the costing of the Labour Party policies in 
the 1987 and 1992 UK general elections... "We are at a loss to 
explain its relevance." 
  To its credit, the NP did not conceal that its critique of 
the RDP was initiated by one Mr Tony Karpel, assisted by Mr 
Roelof Botha Jnr of the Rand Afrikaans University. This raises 
the question, do these scary figures derive from serious 
economic analysis, or are they thumb-sucks from manipulative PR 
consultants? 
  We are dealing here with an election ploy, a public 
relations 
exercise that the NP prepared in secrecy. Our RDP is the result 
of serious consultative processes, which were transparent, open 
and involving a wide circle of people outside the ANC and its 
allies. It included consultations with business, parastatals, 
the trade unions, the civics, religious communities and, through 
the people's forums, a host of other economic players. 
  During the short time that was available to us we have come 
up with new economic policies, whereas the NP, in government for 
46 years, has nothing to offer. The people of South Africa have 
endured and suffered under the NP's policies for four decades. 
Those policies have left us with the unenviable legacy of 
massive unemployment, homelessness, economic decline and unequal 
education. Whatever else may be said, it is crystal clear that 
the NP has been an unmitigated disaster for this country. 
  The document prepared for the NP by Karpel completely 
ignores 
the real social and economic imperatives and trade-offs 
associated with reconstruction and development. Instead it 
tries to score political points by exaggerating the costs beyond 
recognition while offering no solutions. Everyone agrees that 
we must make choices in using our limited resources. It is 
equally well-known that the legacy of 46 years of NP misrule 
will weigh heavily on the new government. 
  Taking Tony Karpel's document at its word, it would appear 
that the NP is opposed, among other things, to: 

  -  supervised and hygienic child deliveries; 
  -  equal tax treatment for women; 
  -  ten years of free, quality education for all children; 
  -  upgrading of hostels; 
  -  reduced fiscal drag. 

    The authors, Karpel and Roelof Botha Jnr, appear remarkably 
ignorant of most current policy debates. This is hardly 
surprising, since its principal author is a British consultant 
while his South African junior partner has never been an active 
participant in these. 
  Running like a red thread through the document, are a number 
of groundless assumptions and bald assertions which the public 
are expected to believe merely because they've been pronounced. 
A telling example of this is the claim that: "Upgrading costs 
have been realistically estimated at an average of R16,500 
[rand] per 15 square metres (housing 4 beds)." Firstly, no 
source is given for this astonishing assertion, which implies 
that upgrading one room in a hostel costs about a third as much 
as constructing an average township house. 
  With regard to taxes on women, again the document gives no 
sources for its figures. There appears also to be the 
assumption that women in this society earn as much as men. In 
South Africa, which we all know to be extremely gender biased 
that is a ludicrous assumption. 
  Every study of health care indicates that expenditures in 
these areas repay themselves many times over in savings in other 
areas of the health system. Thus the NP document does not use 
the costs for patients in public hospitals nor does it take into 
account the opportunity costs associated with unsupervised and 
unhygienic child deliveries. These are extensive in economic 
terms, even if we ignore, which we shouldn't, the costs in human 
terms. Adequate prenatal care and birthing facilities 
ultimately prove enormous net savings for the health care system 
as a whole, in addition to the visible social benefits. 
  In another sleight of hand typical of the document, the 
guesstimates it employs when discussing retraining of health 
workers assume six-months of full-time retraining. This is 
certainly not the normal way to upgrade professionals. A 
programme of part-time study and workshops would come closer to 
normal practice. While it does factor in the opportunity costs 
- those of productivity loss based on its exaggerated 
assumptions it ignores the much larger opportunity costs 
entailed in continued neglect of primary health care. The 
social costs of course elude the authors completely. 
  The costing of education is based on the assumption that 
"quality education" requires the current wasteful, racially 
differentiated spending that is at the centre of the NP's 
current practice. The authors consequently argue that South 
Africa cannot hope to achieve quality education for all. In the 
long run, a national education budget of R23 billion should 
suffice, provided the funds are used equally on all pupils and 
the inefficiencies involved in 19 education departments and 
bloated bureaucracy are eliminated. The NP seems to think that 
South Africa cannot accomplish what virtually all other 
countries with similar levels of economic development have 
achieved. 
  When it comes to adult education, the sheer ignorance of the 
authors leads them to make an alarming array of unfounded 
assumptions. Just one example: The guesstimate suggests that 
South Africans who cannot read and write have had no schooling 
whatsoever. Even if that were the case it is a ridiculous 
assumption to make that because a child requires at least four 
years of education to be considered literate, and adult required 
the same time frame to reach the same level. 
  No amount of scare-mongering can conceal the bitter, yet 
incontrovertible truth that the NPs policies, past and present, 
have wrought havoc on this country. By its constant red-baiting 
the NP tries to imply that the ANC's policies are inspired by 
communism. All fair-minded people know they are not. Our 
policies are inspired by common sense. The common sense that 
tells us that in the absence of an effort to address the basic 
needs of our people there can be no stability. And that without 
stability there will be no economic growth. 
  The ANC is convinced that our plan is realisable, workable 
and affordable. What South Africa cannot afford is one day more 
of the NP's misrule, economic mismanagement and continuing 
corruption. 
  The ANC challenges the NP to come forward with its plan. We 
shall not hold our breaths in expectation because the NP has 
more than amply demonstrated its intellectual poverty. The NP 
campaign, run by a party with no ideas of its own to offer, much 
in the manner of a lazy schoolboy, has been content to literally 
crib and copy the ANC's campaign down to our very slogans. 
Perhaps we do however have this one consolation: "Imitation is 
the sincerest form of flattery".

<F P=106> [By Erna van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 20 SAPA -- The descendants of an 
African National Congress co-founder and former president had 
switched allegiances to the National Party [NP] due to the ANC's 
"violence and intimidation", the NP said on Wednesday [20 
April]. Robert Makgatho and his mother Elsie, among at least 11 
members of former ANC President Sefako Mapogo Makgotho's family 
who would vote for the NP, were introduced to the media at an NP 
news conference in Pretoria. 
  A former Mamelodi councillor, Mr Makgotho said he had been a 
member of the United Democratic Front, a front organisation for 
the ANC, until 1990 when its "noble ideas had deteriorated into 
violence". 
  The practices of the ANC and its allies were "atrocious", he 
said, adding that he did not agree with strikes, disruptions of 
education and intimidation. 
  Some of his former colleagues had tried to discourage him 
from voting for the NP and he had received death threats. Three 
dockets had been opened against his intimidators, Mr Makgotho 
said. 
  While still a councillor he had been "intimidated out of his 
job" by ANC-aligned civic organisations that, among other acts, 
twice petrol-bombed his house. 
  Mr Makgotho said he believed if his great-grandfather had 
been alive he too would have voted for the NP because the ANC 
today bore no resemblance to the party he had helped found. "We 
believe he would have been appalled by the destruction of black 
education carried out by the ANC and its comrades in the name of 
revolution. 
  "We believe he would have been ashamed of the violence and 
intimidation carried out by those same people against anyone who 
dares to disagree with them." 
  Mr Makgotho said he had found a political home in the NP 
because of its ideals to create a peaceful and tolerant society. 
Although he was unemployed, his np support did not stem from 
material gain but "comes from my heart and soul". 
  Mr Makgotho's mother Elsie, 62, said she would also cast her 
vote for the NP because ANC comrades had sent people to 
intimidate her at her place of work because of her son's former 
councillorship and NP allegiance. "They also stole my car, and 
when I got another one, they burnt it out." 
  NP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election 
candidate Nana Masango, who organises in the Mamelodi community 
where the Makgothos reside, told the news conference the 
township was a NP "stronghold". 
  ANC supporters had been won over to the NP because of the 
ANC's intimidatory, disruptive and violent tactics and 
lawlessness, she said. "If the comrades, civics and self-defence 
units carry out their activities while they are not in power 
yet, what will they do if they are? 
  "We cannot allow these atrocities to continue. 
  "The ANC is so power-drunk they will drive the country into 
anarchy," she said. 
  ANC President Nelson Mandela had named his second son after 
Mr Sefako Mapogo Makgotho as a sign of respect, his 
great-grandson said. Mr Makgatho founded the African Native 
Political Union in 1906 and the Transvaal African Teachers 
Association shortly thereafter, according to a biographical 
document issued by the NP at the news conference. "He was one of 
the eight-strong caucus which called the conference in 
Bloemfontein in January 1912 out of which the ANC emerged. 
  "He became a senior vice-president at that meeting and 
president of the ANC for a seven-year term in 1917. 
  "He was a close friend of Chief Albert Luthuli (another 
former ANC president) and a father figure to many of the new 
wave of activists that emerged in the 1940s -- among them Mr 
Nelson mandela. 
  "He died in 1951 and is buried in Mamelodi."

  [Text] Transvaal National Party leader Pik Botha says the 
party is considering forming a coalition to gain control of the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] province in next 
week's election. Mr. Botha told a news briefing that it was 
vital that the PWV, as the economic hub of South Africa, had an 
effective government. Conrad Burke reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Burke] The PWV. The National Party says 
there are over 4.5 million voters here, almost 1.5 million in 
Soweto alone, and according to the NP's PWV team, the party has 
a good chance here even as part of a coalition. 
  [Botha] There are other parties with more or less the same 
basic principles, the same policies and objectives. And I would 
have at this stage, that after the elections we would be able to 
form a coalition, partnership, a grouping together -- I don't 
want to give it a name. But it would be improper of me to 
mention it at this stage because at this moment we are opponents. 
  [Burke] Yesterday's breakthrough with the Inkatha Freedom 
Party was described by Mr. Botha as the most day in South 
African history. It was also good news for the PWV election 
campaign. 
  [Botha] Yes, the decision and agreement means that we've now 
had a totally new ball game, particularly in this province -- 
but certainly for Natal-kwaZulu, yes; but also for our province. 
I think that this will assist us to have more calm and an 
orderly election here which we really need. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Shaun Johnson] </F>
  [Text] Sam Shilowa is a big man, big enough to wear two 
hats. He needs to be. The deceptively boyish-looking Congress 
of South African Trade [COSATU] general secretary is in one of 
transitional South Africa's more powerful and finely balanced 
positions. The task at hand is no less than giving birth to a 
new COSATU for a new South Africa. Unfortunately for him, 
that's not all that's occupying his time at the moment, with 
barely a week to go before South Africa's founding democratic 
election. 
  Shilowa -- who took over from Jay Naidoo when the veteran 
unionist accepted nomination to the National Assembly -- is 
tackling two great tasks simultaneously: planning for a strong 
COSATU under fundamentally altered political conditions, and 
campaigning at full filt for the ANC in his Northern Transvaal 
home base. It's not a straightforward role, as is evident from 
recent prickly exchanges with ANC members on the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council]. 
  First, the short-term task: Shilowa says COSATU has sent 
teams into all 14 of the ANC's regions to bring their 
organisational capacities to bear in the final electoral push. 
This started some five weeks ago, it involves senior COSATU 
people, and weak areas are receiving priority. As far as 
possible, COSATU leaders are working in the regions from which 
they hail -- Shilowa is stumping the Northern Transvaal and 
wowing audiences with his home-boy-made-good, rollicking style 
of delivery. How does this dovetail with the ANC? 
  "We agreed that COSATU's not running the election campaign," 
Shilowa says, "but we've got something to offer. We're 
integrating our campaigning." He and other leaders have been 
formally deployed by ANC headquarters. The COSATU teams are 
checking the readiness of specific areas for next week's polling. 
  Shilowa says it's simply a fact that during this key period 
of the transition, normal business is on hold for COSATU. 
"We're totally caught up in the process of transformation, and 
we're shedding leaders to the campaign and later to Parliament 
and the public sector. No normal organisational work is 
possible...The major task right now is to ensure an ANC victory." 
  The COSATU campaign initiative is a final push to translate 
emotional support into actual crosses on ballot papers come next 
Wednesday. Shilowa says it's all very well if other parties are 
weak or non-existent in the region but "no shows" at the polls 
would be tantamount to votes for the opposition. "So we're 
doing all sorts of things, like addressing people on buses as 
they travel from Seshego. It's kind of travelling people's 
forum, where we answer questions. We're not going to just sit 
and hope that people go and vote themselves." The blitz will 
continue right up until the eve of the election, says Shilowa. 
  But that's the election, and much of Shilowa's thinking is 
longer term. "It's not just a case of putting in an ANC 
government. Then we've got to make a difference to people's 
lives in his poor region." 
  All of which raises the really big question: having been 
born in conditions of outright resistance to a hostile State, 
how is COSATU going to relate to a government which it not only 
supports, but has actively helped to shape? Aside from the 
challenge of developing new layers of leadership to replace 
those denuded by the defeat of apartheid (and the attendant 
danger that individual unions' interests will begin to outweigh 
the federation's), this is a profound question for COSATU. It 
has to fit itself in somewhere between an antagonistic 
relationship with a new government, and the sweetheart-union 
syndrome. 
  Shilowa has presented to his organisation a document 
entitled 
"Towards developing a long-term strategy for COSATU", which 
focuses on four key points. 
  -- What are the implications of operating under a 
sympathetic 
government? Shilowa points out that COSATU has been "skilled 
into opposition politics, based on demands rather than joint 
projects with the State. But the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme is a joint document which carries obligations and 
responsibilities for both government and us. We will not be 
there opposing it clause by clause, we'll be working towards its 
implementation." 
  -- How will COSATU's membership be fully serviced in the new 
South Africa? Shilowa says that until now COSATU has attracted 
members on two grounds -- its ability to win bread-and-butter 
gains, and its political position. "The reality is that we'll 
soon have a legitimate, democratic government, openly elected. 
It has the legitimacy to take actions, although obviously in 
consultation with other stakeholders. So the second, political, 
role begins to fall away. We therefore have to concentrate on 
servicing the needs of our membership, and already since 1992 we 
have faced complaints about gaps developing between grassroots 
membership and the various levels of leadership. If we can't 
address that, we're doomed as an organisation." He adds that 
the new COSATU will be confined to one constituency, and "won't 
want to speak out on everything. We'll be alive to broader 
political issues, of course, but it will be a more classical 
trade union role." 
  -- How independent will COSATU be? Shilowa says many people 
misunderstand trade union "independence": "It's not the same as 
non-alignment -- we are aligned, but concerned that programmes 
(to benefit our members) are implemented on their behalf. 
There's a perception that our leadership is more politically 
oriented than trade unionist, and that's unfair. Our political 
involvement has benefited the union movement. COSATU must not 
allow itself to become a conveyor belt or sweetheart. Now we 
have put candidates in the ANC -- we don't take the non-aligned 
view, but ask what they can do to implement the programmes." 
  -- Will COSATU overstretch itself? Shilowa says the 
federation has become involved in "too many forums. That's been 
necessary, but it's not for ever because we don't have the 
capacity and the resources to sustain it. Our priorities are 
the National Economic Forum and the National Manpower 
Commission, and we think they could be combined. There'd be two 
chambers, one macro-economic and the other dealing with labour 
market issues. We'd be represented directly there, but not 
necessarily in all the other forums. COSATU needs to conserve 
and redirect its resources and energies in future." 
  I put the proposition directly: it's not just a new South 
Africa we're going to have to develop, but a new COSATU too. 
Shilowa's in full agreement.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The South African 
Defence Force [SADF] has replaced the National Peacekeeping 
Force [NPKF] in the strife-torn East Rand townships, Wit Command 
spokesman Major Christo Visser confirmed on Wednesday [20 
April]. He said a few platoons were sent in to "stabilise" the 
area where more than 20 people have died since Sunday night in 
fighting between hostel dwellers and Thokoza residents. 
  The decision was taken at a meeting on Tuesday night between 
the SADF and NPKF "to avoid further bloodshed" in the townships, 
Maj Visser said. "Since April 18 the security situation in the 
Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus area deteriorated to such and 
extent that the commander of the NPKF in the area, Lieut Col 
Quentin Painter, requested the assistance of the SADF in the 
area. 
  On Wednesday, the SADF were patrolling "hotspots" while most 
NPKF units had been confined to barracks, he said. Maj Visser 
added: "The NPKF is now busy with a reassessment of the 
situation and will present this to the NPKF Command Council as 
we are going to present our reassessment to the chief of the 
army regarding our involvement in the area from now onwards." 
  Thokoza was quiet on Wednesday.

  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] and the 
defense force will be involved in combined operations on the 
East Rand with immediate effect. This was decided yesterday 
evening at a meeting between the peacekeeping force and the 
defense force. 
  A spokesman for the peacekeeping force, Major. Math 
Anderson, 
has told our Johannesburg news staff that details of the 
combined operations will be released today. This follows heavy 
fighting in Thokoza earlier this week which claimed several 
lives. Reports say that the problem stemmed from a mutiny by 
more than 100 peacekeeping force troops. On Tuesday [19 April] 
the group allegedly refused to obey orders and locked their 
commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Quinton Painter in his 
car.

  [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk says the decision to 
replace the defense force with the National Peacekeeping Force 
[NPKF] in Thokoza was a mistake. On a radio talk show last 
night President De Klerk said he had at one stage tried to stop 
the deployment of the peacekeeping troops in the East Rand 
township, but that it was then already too late. He said the 
government and the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] should 
take responsibility for the blunder.

  [Text] The finance Minister, Derek Keys, says South Africa 
is not interested in an economy which grows at normal rates, as 
this will make no impact on the huge number of unemployed. 
Opening the new Johannesburg Press Club venue in Johannesburg, 
he said he believed that a growth rate of above 6 percent and 
not artificial factors such as a rise in the gold price or 
commodity prices was needed to revive the economy. Mr. Keys 
said 6 percent was critical and that everything had to be done 
to try to achieve such a growth rate.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  ANC Agreement With COSATU on Strike Moratorium -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 April in a page-20 
editorial says the Congress of South African Trade Unions' 
(COSATU) decision to accept a moratorium on strikes until after 
the election "is part of a quid pro quo, in which COSATU 
assented to a moratorium in return for an undertaking by the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] to address the fears and 
grievances of civil servants." The call for a freeze on strikes 
was made by "top ANC leaders," in "response to a crippling 
series of strikes by civil servants" which have now spread to 
"threaten the election process itself." However, if an ANC 
government is to fulfill its "ambitious programme of 
reconstruction and development, more than a moratorium on 
strikes is required. There must be a commitment to general wage 
restraint in the upper echelons of the civil service -- soon to 
be filled by ANC appointees -- as well as by workers generally. 
It will not be enough for the ANC to call on its alliance 
partner, COSATU, to urge the workers to tighten their belts. 
The ANC's leaders will have to show the way." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  COSATU Sets Itself `Coherent Agenda' -- "Though COSATU faces 
difficult times because of the loss of some of its most capable 
leadership to politics, it has set itself a coherent agenda," 
notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 21 April. "COSATU's agenda is not an unimaginative 
one. It will require an alert business (and government) effort 
to ensure that some overly adventurous proposals are moderated. 
COSATU's primary focus is on strengthening centralised 
collective bargaining. This is not, as some argue, an 
inherently flawed approach. If we want an era of industrial 
governance by consensus, it is probably essential." BUSINESS 
DAY also sees "a growing awareness in COSATU of the need to 
encourage small business development and, therefore, a 
willingness to exempt emerging businesses from the more onerous 
conditions of industrial council agreements." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Buthelezi Brinkmanship -- An editorial in the Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 21 April on page 10 looks at "cold facts" 
after the "euphoria of the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] 
participation" in the elections. "Why did the country have to go 
right up to the brink before State President F W de Klerk, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
stopped and turned back?" Was the IFP "playing chicken," as "it 
was pretty obvious to all that the IFP was preparing itself for 
the elections" and "were actually able to pull out posters and 
election material before the ink on the agreement had dried." 
"What does the death of hundreds in Natal and other provinces 
mean to the IFP?" "Now that sanity seems to be restored" a 
"programme to encourage reconciliation has to be pursued, not 
for the sake of the political parties involved, but for that of 
the country as a whole."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] An important step was taken today at the Lusaka 
talks between the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The two delegations 
reached agreement on the general principles of the electoral 
process. The document was signed today by the government and 
UNITA, under the auspices of the mediator and in the presence of 
the observers. 
  The general principles on the completion of the electoral 
process include four points -- namely, reinstatement of state 
administration throughout Angola, guarantees of security, 
freedom of expression for citizens, and resumption of air and 
ground communications throughout Angola to ensure the free 
movement of people and goods. The United Nations will be 
responsible for monitoring, verifying, and declaring whether the 
conditions have been created to hold the second round of 
presidential elections, of which the candidates are Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, 
invited Angolan newsmen to attend the signing ceremony. 
  Tomorrow the delegations will begin discussing the specific 
principles on the electoral process. The government and the 
UNITA negotiating teams have already received the respective 
document.

  [Text] Senior IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members have been 
working nonstop since 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon to prepare 
candidate lists for participation in the election before 6 
o'clock tonight. 
  A Transvaal IFP spokesman, Mr. Hennie Bekker, told the 
Afrikaans radio news program, Monitor, that although provisional 
lists had been drawn up some time ago, numerous candidates had 
to be confirmed before the national and regional lists could be 
finalized. He said Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi would 
head the national list, but that the decision had to be taken 
within the next few hours on whether he would head the 
kwaZulu-Natal regional list. Mr. Bekker suggested that the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] consider installing polling 
booths in what he termed beleaguered hostels in Thokoza.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Marcolino Moco arrived in 
Benguela this morning. He was welcomed at the airport by 
Governor Paulo Jorge, members of the provincial government, and 
traditional and religious leaders. Moco spoke to newsmen at the 
airport about the aim of his visit, noting that peace could be 
achieved soon. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Moco recording] The aim of our visit is of utmost 
importance. I could even say that we are going to make Benguela 
the capital of central and southern Angola. I intend to meet 
the governors of Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Huila, and Bie 
Provinces to discuss the consequences of the war waged against 
the Angolan people throughout the country. The war has had a 
significant impact on this part of the country. 
  At a meeting I held with his excellency the president of the 
Republic we assessed a number of issues that were raised at the 
recent meetings he held with traditional authorities. We 
realize that there are serious problems affecting war-displaced 
persons, and the transport sector. Although most districts are 
in government hands, bandit action prevents free movement to the 
various regions, causing terrible suffering for the people. So, 
that is one of the issues we will discuss. We have brought some 
suggestions. [passage omitted] 
  My visit will serve to convey an important message for the 
residents of Benguela, and obviously for all Angolan people. 
That is, it is possible that we are on the threshold of peace. 
But we, Angolans, have already learned a lot. We ought to 
prepare the ground so that peace will not turn its back on the 
Angolan people again, as is the case right now. Every 
structure, ministries, and provincial organs... [pauses] 
Although it has been reported that ministerial portfolios and 
provinces will be given to UNITA representatives, that should 
not mean a return to confusion, insubordination, disregard for 
human rights as we saw before the elections. But we should not 
be too theoretical. We need to create the necessary conditions. 
During my visit we will discuss this aspect at length with 
officials and even with the people. So, we ought to create 
mechanisms so that peace will never turn its back on the Angolan 
people who have suffered dearly from actions by those who are 
not interested in true peace. Those are the aims of my visit to 
Benguela. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in 
Angola, today met with the negotiating teams. At the Mulungushi 
International Conference Center this morning, Beye met the 
government delegation in the morning and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team in the afternoon. 
No details have been disclosed, though it is believed that the 
mediator wanted to hold separate meetings on outstanding issues 
-- namely, the specific principles and ways of completing the 
presidential elections and national reconciliation. No basic 
document has been issued regarding the specific principles on 
the completion of the presidential elections. A source close to 
the negotiations said that it in view of that, it is not 
possible to make further comments. The mediator is still making 
efforts to bring the government and UNITA negotiators together 
to deal with the outstanding issues. Beye is still optimistic, 
saying he believes the negotiations will end soon. Yesterday 
Beye said Lusaka is about to write its name in the history of 
the Angolan people. Let us wait and see.

  [Text] The Angolan opposition PDP-ANA [Democratic Party for 
the Progress-Angolan National Alliance] party says its leader, 
Mr. Mfulumpinga Landu Victor, has escaped an assassination 
attempt by government security forces in Luanda. PDP-ANA says 
about 20 policemen in a Land Rover had fired on a vehicle 
transporting Mr. Victor in the Angolan capital. The party said 
at least 40 bullets had struck the car shattering all the 
windows. It said that international communities should be aware 
that the government of Angola was slowly destroying all 
opposition in the country. Mr. Victor had earlier called on the 
government to allow an international commission of inquiry to 
investigate the mass involvement of police in the massacre of 
4,000 members of the Bakongo tribe in Luanda's [word indistinct] 
last year.

that partially destroyed the vehicle of Mfulumpinga Victor, 
chairman of the Democratic Party for Progress-Angolan National 
Alliance. Maianga Police Station Commander Jose Alberto says 
that by this afternoon Mfulumpinga Victor had not presented a 
formal complaint, that is why the investigations are stalled. 
  [Begin Alberto recording] Until now we have not received any 
complaint from Mr. Mfulumpinga Landu Victor. We are waiting for 
him to arrive and present a complaint. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] But the police yesterday 
visited 
the place where the incident occurred. 
  [Alberto] It was about 2200 that we learned that a Land

vehicle carrying people dressed in plain clothes stopped in the 
October Revolution Street and shot at Mr. Mfulumpinga's vehicle 
after he had parked it in front of his house. 
  [Correspondent] What measures are the police taking? 
  [Alberto] We have already investigated the case by 
questioning some people who were at the venue of the attack. 
They saw the people who were in the attackers' vehicle, but we 
are still waiting for Mr. Mfulumpinga's complaint. [end

  [Text] A Lesotho cabinet minister, who is in Gaborone on a 
temporary sanctuary, says the present conflict in his country 
came after a government announced a commission of inquiry into 
the January faction fighting within the Lesotho Army. 
  In an interview with BOPA [Botswana Press Agency] today, Mr. 
Monyane Moleleki, who is Lesotho's minister of natural 
resources, said the Lesotho Government intended to have experts 
from Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe in that commission. 
He said the terms of the inquiry had said that the Lesotho 
Government was not going to be represented in the commission. 
He said some opposition members had alleged that some cabinet 
ministers were involved in the disturbances and demanded that 
they resign. He said he does not understand why the present 
disturbances took place just before the commission started its 
work. Mr. Moleleki said the commission should have been allowed 
to take place and establish who was involved in the January 
fighting. 
  Mr. Moleleki said ministers could resign for moral and 
political considerations, and not (?killed) by force by the army 
if ever they had a hand in the disturbances. 
  He described the political situation in Lesotho as stable 
but 
volatile due to the murder of Lesotho's deputy prime minister, 
Mr. Selometsi Baholo, and the abduction of four cabinet 
ministers, including himself, last Thursday. 
  Mr. Moleleki said he intends going back to Lesotho very 
soon. 
He said after his abduction he and the other ministers were 
kept at the army barracks for four days, but later handed over 
to the police. He said once in custody, they were accused of the 
disturbances that took place in January when there was factional 
fighting within the Lesotho Defense Force. Mr. Moleleki said 
the soldiers accused them, saying one of them had gone abroad to 
recruit mercenaries to kill some members of the Lesotho Army. 
He said Mr. Baholo was not in the country during the January 
disturbances as he had gone to Belgium for medical reasons. 
  Meanwhile, the minister for foreign affairs, Dr. Gaositwe 
Chiepe, has confirmed that she met Mr. Moleleki, but not the 
three other ministers who are said to be in Botswana. Dr. 
Chiepe said it is her hope that the ministers would go back to 
Lesotho because they are not refugees. She said Botswana is 
still consulting the Zimbabwean Government on the action to be 
taken.

that the important thing in Mozambique is to attain peace, not 
to attain power. 
  [Announcer] Even if the elections are unfavorable to Renamo 
and it finds itself prevented from attaining power? 
  [Dhlakama] Certainly. My fight has been for democracy in my 
country, not for power. And I am well acquainted with the 
implications of democracy. 
  [Announcer] Be that as it may, you have said on several 
occasions that Renamo has a proposal for the setting up of a 
national unity government, and that you would like to be Joaquim 
Chissano's vice president in the event of Frelimo winning the 
elections, which means that Renamo has designs on power. 
  [Dhlakama] Well. I have a clear idea to put to the 
Mozambican people, recognizing that in Africa the course of 
democracy has been a hard one. I would like there to be neither 
victors nor vanquished. Hence, this idea of mine. As I have 
said before, should it win the elections, Renamo does not wish 
to govern alone, it wishes to govern jointly with the other 
parties. And the other parties, should they win, ought to do 
likewise. 
  [Announcer] In other words, you have just confirmed what I 
said earlier on, that one of your goals is to hold office in the 
future Mozambican Government, regardless of the election results. 
  [Dhlakama] Well, that is in order to avoid problems; in 
order 
to avoid problems. 
  [Announcer] The kind of problems that arose in Angola? 
  [Dhlakama] Not just in Angola, all over Africa, because in 
Africa so far we have been learning about democracy itself. I 
am of the view that democracy must be allowed to develop its own 
history in Africa. In Mozambique, for example, we have the 
history of our independence. That history of our independence 
went wrong, hence the civil war. So, in order to 
avoid...[pauses] So that democracy may develop its own history 
in Mozambique, it is necessary that, regardless of who wins the 
October elections, the victors should invite those also 
represented in parliament to govern together. 
  [Announcer] Yes. What is President Joaquim Chissano's 
reaction to the ideas you advocate, to that kind of proposal? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, so far we have not yet entered into 
negotiations officially. However, I have already been able to 
chat to him about it and I have not yet had a positive response. 
In the newspapers I have read that several government ministers 
seem not to agree to the idea. Nevertheless, I am optimistic, 
because now I am already living in Maputo, and all the 
intellectuals -- professors, economists and engineers -- support 
my position. 
  [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama. You have come to Portugal, you 
arrived in Lisbon today, to ask the Portuguese Government and 
businessmen for greater support. Portugal had already made 
available some $300,000 for a support fund for Renamo, to be 
managed by the United Nations. Is this not enough? What else 
have you come to ask the Portuguese Government? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, the purpose of my visit is not to ask 
Portugal for cash. I have also come to confirm to the 
Portuguese people that the war is over in Mozambique, and also 
to reassure the Portuguese -- because up to now the people have 
been growing disillusioned with the situation in Angola -- to 
reassure the Portuguese that what has happened in Angola will 
not happen in Mozambique. Secondly, indeed, I have come to ask 
for general support for the Mozambican peace process. 
  [Announcer] But what kind of support? More troops, more 
money? What kind of support? Logistical support? 
  [Dhlakama] As you know, even Britain is already withdrawing 
from Mozambique, and I believe that there could indeed be an 
increase in the military presence of the Portuguese in 
Mozambique, even though they are already there training the 
Mozambican Army. Moreover, direct support for Renamo could be 
increased, because Renamo needs infrastructure. The Mozambican 
Government has planes, motorcars, money, and Renamo does not 
even have premises. 
  [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama, thank you very much for coming 
to Telejornal. 
  [Dhlakama] Thank you.

  [Text] When the Liberian factions signed the peace accord 
in Cotonou last July they were not accounting for the emergence 
of a new anti-Charles Taylor movement, the Liberian Peace 
Council, LPC. It's been creating havoc with attacks in the River 
Cess region, south of the port of Buchanan. What its ultimate 
aim was has remained unclear. Now, it has come out into the 
open demanding a piece of the action and a place in the 
transitional government. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison 
telexed this report: 
  The Liberian Peace Council today vowed to continue fighting 
until the Cotonou Accord was amended. The Peace Council's 
spokesman, Octavius Walker, said: We insist on being included 
in the Liberian National Transitional Government. He said: We 
made this clear when we met with the Transitional Council on 13 
March. Mr. Walker said that Isaac Musa, Charles Taylor's 
National Patriotic Front representative, had walked out of that 
meeting when the LPC was putting forward its demands. He added 
that after Mr. Musa had left, the LPC had made it clear that the 
NPFL could not represent areas under LPC control. Mr. Walker 
claims that the LPC is in control of six counties: River Cess, 
Grand Bassa, Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, and Grand Kru. He 
said that the Peace Council is seeking to represent these 
countries on the Interim Council, but the NPFL information 
minister designate, Joe Mulbah, disputed the LPC's claim that it 
controlled six counties. Mulbah said that the NPFL had recently 
dislodged Peace Council fighters from River Cess and Compound 
No. 2, in Grand Bassa County. 
  Meanwhile, the fighting between the LPC and the NPFL 
continues to trigger a large number of refugees in the 
southeastern region. United Nations Shelter officials said that 
in the first six days of April alone 1,200 people had fled to 
the town of Buchanan.

  [Text] Monrovia, 21 Apr (AFP) -- Dissensions emerged today 
within the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main 
armed faction, a day after the announcement of an agreement 
between the different factions on the formation of the future 
transitional government. 
  Last night, four of the six NPFL representatives within the 
transitional government were given "hearings" by the 
Transitional Legislative Assembly, before being officially 
commissioned by David Kpomakpor, the chairman of the Council of 
State (transitional collegiate presidency). The NPFL's mission 
"has been successfully accomplished," new Justice Minister 
Laveli Supuwood said, while his colleague, Labor Minister Tom 
Woewiyu, said that he was "ready to break down factional 
barriers and seek the interest and happiness of all Liberians." 
Interior Minister Samuel Dhokie, who is a top NPFL official, 
promised "to ensure national reconciliation and destroy the 
artificial division of the country." 
  A fourth NPFL representative, Wehyee Dekyee, minister of 
lands, mines, and energy, attended the ceremony, which was 
boycotted by the two other NPFL members in the government, 
Information Minister Joe Mulbah and Agriculture Minister Roland 
Massaquoi. In addition, none of the 13 NPFL representatives in 
the Transitional Legislative Assembly attended the hearings of 
their "brothers-in-arms," an AFP correspondent observed. For 
NPFL leader Charles Taylor, quoted this morning by the Front's 
radio monitored in Monrovia, the NPFL officials who have taken 
office in the government "without a consensus on the issue 
within the movement have not shown solidarity." It is a 
"defection," as far as Taylor is concerned. Since last November, 
the NPFL representatives in the government have refused to take 
office until an agreement is reached on all the ministerial 
posts, particularly on the four remaining key portfolios: 
defense, finance, foreign affairs, and justice. 
  Yesterday morning, the Council of State chairman announced 
that an agreement had been reached between the NPFL, the former 
interim government, and the United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia on three ministries, and that the fourth 
post -- that of foreign affairs -- will be appointed "soon" by 
the Council of State. A few hours later NPFL Information 
Minister Joe Mulbah had already begun expressing some 
reservations, pointing out before journalists that the Front's 
leadership had not been officially informed about these 
nominations and that, consequently, his boss Charles Taylor had 
not endorsed them. 
  In a statement issued late this morning in Monrovia, the 
NPFL 
announced the holding of a congress this weekend in Gbarnga -- 
160 km northeast of Monrovia. At the end of this congress, the 
NPFL "will be able to present serious and adequate proposals 
that will finally enable all the signatories to the Cotonou 
Accord to participate fully in the government," the communique 
said.

  [Text] The head of the main faction in the Liberian 
National Transitional Government [LNTG], the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Gankay Taylor, has 
clarified that the State Council has no hurry of dismissing 
power. Mr. Taylor was addressing a news conference in Gbarnga 
yesterday in the wake of the nomination by the chairman of the 
State Council of certain individuals [word indistinct] as 
coordinators of the disputed ministries, particularly the 
Foreign Ministry, Mr. Taylor said he had introduced a coalition 
government of compromise involving the factions. Mr. Taylor 
said any faction's attempt to seat the LNTG, will not be 
welcomed as anything done half way is not done at all. He said 
it would be a mistake on the part of the NPFL to form a part of 
any such seating of the LNTG. 
  The NPFL leader said that officials of the IGNU [Interim 
Government of National Unity] faction in the transitional 
government have all taken their seats in the government, 
including public operations and deputy ministerial positions. 
Mr. Taylor said if the NPFL allows the IGNU faction to keep a 
deputy minister acting in a foreign minister capacity, then 
individuals will go on holding onto the Foreign Ministry for the 
rest of the transitional period. 
  He stressed that the NPFL is not prepared to tolerate any 
such conditions. The NPFL leader said it would appear that a 
consultation or allocation of cabinet posts has developed into a 
personality clash where some people do not distrust cited 
individuals. Mr. Taylor said he cannot understand why anyone 
would have reservations about a qualified Liberian like 
Counselor Momolu Sirleaf becoming foreign minister of Liberia. 
The NPFL leader said there was an instance where he would have 
preferred swapped-in portofolio between Counselor Sirleaf going 
to the Justice Ministry, while Counselor Laveli Supuwood could 
have taken over the Foreign Ministry. He said this could be 
somewhat only a concession. [Words indistinct] Counselor Sirleaf 
as an individual who has been considered as an obstacle to peace 
in Liberia. 
  The NPFL leader said he does not know where these 
reservations are coming from, but he said that Counselor Sirleaf 
is a qualified Liberian who can ably command the Foreign 
Ministry.

  [Text] The head of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, says there appears to be 
some wavering among some members of the NPFL representation on 
the Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG]. He said 
he does not know what is responsible for some of these 
individuals' behaving like weaklings who have become bought over. 
  Mr. Taylor said some members of his delegation are behaving 
like defectors and said it will not be surprising to the NPFL, 
because it has had a similar experience in Monrovia involving 
Mr. Togba Mackintosh Gewieh. The NPFL leader disclosed that he 
has received information from Monrovia that some NPFL ministers 
are wavering and planning to participate in confirmation hearing 
contrary to the earlier position of the NPFL that it will not 
partially sit on the transitional government. 
  Mr. Taylor said the NPFL will not tolerate any halfway 
seating of the transitional government. Mr. Taylor, however, 
said the NPFL has no intention to withdraw from the peace 
process and will do everything to ensure lasting peace in 
Liberia. Although Mr. Taylor (?did not agree with) officials of 
the NPFL who are wavering, some nominated ministers from the 
NPFL to the LNTG have been confirmed by the Transitional 
Legislative Assembly. 
  Those who have assumed offices are Justice Minister Laveli 
Supuwood, Labor Minister Tom Woewiyu, Internal Affairs Minister 
Samuel Dhokie, and the minister of lands, mines and energy, Z. 
Dehkie.

leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, says the NPFL will be coming 
up with some new proposals about Monday [24 April] to move the 
Liberian peace process forward. 
  During a news conference in Gbarnga, Mr. Taylor said he had 
had conversations with U.S. State Department officials in 
Washington, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and officials of 
the United Nations on the peace process. He said during the 
discussions, he reaffirmed the NPFL's commitment to move the 
process forward. Mr. Taylor said on Monday, he will come up 
with some suggestions which, he hoped, will push the peace

  [Text] The Algerian capital, Algiers, will on 10 May host 
the next tripartite meeting between the Malian Government, the 
United Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria on the 
implementation of the national pact. This is the outcome of the 
deliberations of the tripartite meeting in Tamanrasset, Algeria, 
which was slated to end yesterday afternoon. Oumar Toure, our 
special correspondent in Tamanrasset, filed this report: 
  The Algiers meeting is slated for 10 May. This will enable 
the government delegation to return to Bamako to consult the 
government on the response to be given to the movement on a 
number of demands, since the national delegation has no mandate 
to make decisions on behalf of the Malian people. 
  The national delegation was charged with presenting a report 
on the implementation of the national pact since it was signed 
on 11 April 1992. That was the real purpose of the Tamanrasset 
meeting but against all expectations, MFUA went to Tamanrasset 
with new demands based on the 31 March-9 April Gao meeting. 
These demands include, among others, the integration of 2,360 
combatants into the Army and the representation of MFUA in some 
15 embassies and in a number of government posts. 
  However, the real disagreement lies in the integration of 
2,360 MFUA elements into the Army. The Algerian mediator made 
intense behind-the-scenes efforts to settle the disagreement but 
unfortunately, the Malian national delegation could not act on 
its own and the MFUA representatives were under pressure from 
their headquarters. There was therefore no score after the 
extra play time. Already, all are poised for penalty kicks in 
Algiers.

  [Text] Lome, 21 Apr (AFP) -- Seven people, including three 
from the opposition, have announced their candidacy for 
legislative by-elections, which will be held on 15 and 29 May in 
three Togolese constituencies, it was learned today from the 
Interior Ministry. The results of the February poll were 
invalidated in these three constituencies by the Supreme Court 
as a result of "disturbances" observed during the second round, 
and the "ineligibility" of the deputies' alternates. These 
three polls saw the victory of opposition candidates -- two from 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and one from the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD]. At the end of the elections, the 
opposition had obtained an absolute majority -- 43 out of 81 
seats -- at the National Assembly. 
  The Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] -- the former single 
ruling party -- is presenting a candidate in each of the three 
constituencies, while the Alliance of Democrats for the 
Republic, which did not obtain any seat in February, is 
presenting one candidate in the first constituency of Oti. The 
opposition, after contesting the Supreme Court's decision, 
finally agreed to present candidates "as a safeguard." The UTD 
and the CAR presented single candidates in the three 
constituencies -- one for the UTD and two for the CAR. 
  Since the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the 
election 
of the opposition deputies, there has been an impasse in 
negotiations to select the future prime minister, who, according 
to the Togolese Constitution, must come from the parliamentary 
majority. However, President Eyadema has again met -- twice 
early this week -- with CAR Chairman Yao Agboyibor, as part of 
consultations undertaken since 15 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Rik De Gendt: "OAU Officers in Burundi Await </F>
Green Light From Brussels"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- At the request of the Burundian 
Government, 15 OAU officers are ready to begin an investigation 
into the continuing skirmishes in the northern Hutu quarters of 
the capital Bujumbura. They are being severely hindered from 
carrying out this assignment by their lack of necessary 
communications equipment and transportation. Meanwhile, 30 
Belgian jeeps and radio equipment, which are intended for the 
OAU peace mission, are waiting, unused, in a hangar for a 
definitive "yes" from Brussels. [passage omitted] 
  At the cabinet of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, a spokesman 
for Willy Claes said that "the talks with the OAU concerning the 
specific use of the Belgian equipment had not yet been 
concluded, and that consequently Belgium could not yet release 
the vehicles in question." A final agreement would be reached 
"within a few days, or one week at the latest," he said. 
  "However, we still have high hopes for the OAU mission," 
Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo said, speaking 
yesterday with DE STANDAARD over telephone. "Both the Army and 
the militant elements in the Hutu quarters are accusing each 
other of provocation. There is an urgent need for us to gain an 
objective picture of the situation." 
  In addition, Ngendahayo said that it was a "shame that some 
reports had exaggerated the previously sporadic disturbances in 
some parts of the capital at the very same time that such 
intensive, serious efforts are being made to put them behind 
us." During the weekend, the Burundian Government again took 
measures to strengthen the administration in the tribal areas 
and is seeking possible ways of gradually disarming the 
population. 
  The foreign minister was optimistic about the possibilities 
envisioned Monday by the Constitutional Court regarding the 
succession of country's defunct President Cyprien Ntaryamira. 
He said that "relations with the former part of unity, UPRONA 
[Unity for National Progress], are so good that a solution to 
the menacing constitutional impasse is very close to being 
reached."

  [Text] Brazzaville, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Authorized sources in 
Brazzaville today revealed that the Confederation of Congolese 
Labor Unions [CSTC], which boycotted negotiations between the 
government and the unions in March, finally reached an agreement 
with the authorities on 19 April. 
  The CSTC, one of the country's leading labor unions, signed 
the agreement, which has already been endorsed by four other 
labor unions, but expressed reservations about certain issues, 
especially that of civil servants' salary arrears. 
  This agreement stipulates: A gradual reimbursement of nine 
months' salary arrears to civil servants, which will be 
converted into internal debts and; a social truce which will 
enable the government to implement the social and economic 
redress measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund. 
  The agreement makes no mention of salary increases for the 
public or private sectors, the CSTC's main demand. The CSTC 
organized a "warning" strike from 5 to 7 April, demanding a 70 
percent salary increase, but the strike was not followed. 
  The CSTC also decided to join the ad hoc committee set up by 
the government and the four labor unions which had earlier 
signed the agreement. The committee will examine the 
government's economic adjustment measures, notably the 
privatization of part of public enterprises.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Text] Nairobi, April 21 (AFP) -- Proposed peace talks in 
Tanzania this weekend between Rwandan rebels and their foes in 
the interim government seemed unlikely to stem ethnic 
bloodletting, diplomats and analysts said Thursday [21 April]. 
  The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] told AFP that its 
delegates would go to the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha to 
meet army representatives, but would refuse to talk to members 
of the interim government which they do not recognise. 
  "Our delegation will be essentially military and it will be 
talking to military men, not to the government, which is 
illegitimate," rebel spokesman James Rwego said by telephone 
from Brussels. 
  But Rwanda's ambassador to Kenya said the rebels would have 
to negotiate with the government, formed after the death of 
President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious April 6 plane 
crash plunged the tiny central African nation into tribal 
carnage that has cost tens of thousands of lives. 
  "Our delegation will be a government delegation, not a 
military one," ambassador Cyprien Habimana said. 
  "We have an interim government, and the army is under the 
orders of the government. We are not a military dictatorship," 
Habimana said. 
  African diplomats familiar with the centuries-old tribal 
feud 
between the majority Hutus, who dominate the army, and the 
minority Tutsis who form the backbone of the rebel movement, 
expressed scepticism about the outcome of the Tanzanian-mediated 
talks. 
  "There's too much bitterness after all the bloodshed, and 
neither side is willing to accept the other's conditions," said 
a senior envoy in Nairobi. 
  "If the rebels are saying that they will only talk to the 
military, that could simply mean that they aren't ready to talk 
at all," the diplomat said. 
  Tanzania brokered peace accords signed in August between the 
two sides which were hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to end 
the three-year civil war that erupted when the rebels invaded 
from neighbouring Uganda in October 1990. 
  But the death of Habyarimana, a Hutu, and the army's claim 
that his plane was shot down rekindled the war. 
  The Presidential Guard spearheaded massacres of Tutsis in 
the 
capital Kigali, still littered with bodies more two weeks after 
the killings began. 
  Death squads are still hacking and clubbing to death people 
suspected of being Tutsis or rebel sympathisers. 
  United Nations' efforts to broker a ceasefire have so far 
failed. 
  The government is believed to be unwilling to accept a rebel 
demand for the interim administration to be disbanded. 
  "How can they negotiate anything if one side doesn't even 
recognise the other?" the diplomat said. 
  Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who convened the 
talks, has met separately with the rebel front's vice-chairman 
Patrick Mazimhaka and the home affairs minister in the interim 
government, Faustin Munyazesa. 
  The UN spokesman in Kigali, Moctar Gueye, welcomed the 
Tanzanian initiative and expressed the hope that Rwanda's 
neighbours, worried that the bloodshed could spill over into 
their countries, could find ways of putting pressure on both 
sides to lay down their arms. 
  The slaughter in Rwanda has sparked a regional refugee 
crisis. At least 50,000 Rwandans have streamed into neighbouring 
countries. 
  The UN meanwhile confirmed that rebels had captured the 
northern town of Byumba this week. 
  The rebels have also claimed to have gained ground against 
government forces in Kigali, in the northeastern Mutura region 
and in the Buganza area to the east. 
  They also said they had surrounded Habyarimana's hometown, 
the northern Hutu stronghold of Ruhengeri. 
  UN officials were unable to confirm the claims as the 
fighting on several fronts has made travel impossible in Rwanda, 
a patchwork of rebel-and government-held pockets.

  [Text] We have the first interview with Faustin 
Twagiramungu since he fled his house in Kigali on the morning of 
7 April. He is the prime minister-designate and should lead the 
next transition government in Rwanda. He narrowly escaped 
arrest and death. Today he is at a secure place. He spoke this 
evening for the first time. The extract we chose to broadcast 
tonight is about the possible outcome of the inter-Rwandan peace 
talks scheduled for 23 April in Tanzania. Christophe 
Boisbouvier asked Faustin Twagiramungu what conditions the 
rebels may set before any agreement can be reached: 
  [Begin Twagiramungu recording] There will be no negotiation 
with the interim government. This government has not respected 
the peace agreement, which is the basic law ruling our country 
today. Today we must take a political decision through contacts 
between officers of the General Staff and the RPF. As for the 
government, there can be no contact with them as the government 
does not exist. This solution needs a pre-condition: do the 
military agree to denounce the presidential guard and pacify the 
Rwandan people? Do they agree to demand that the massacre they 
themselves started be stopped in the whole country? 
  If these conditions are accepted and if they take the 
decision of stopping the broadcasts of the famous Milles 
Collines independent radio, then I think that a political 
solution could be found. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with opposition leader Faustin Twagiramungu by </F>
Christophe Boisbouvier; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Our guest this morning is the Rwandan opposition 
leader Faustin Twagiramungu, who is interviewed by Christophe 
Boisbouvier. There has been no news of this key Rwandan figure 
since 7 April. I remind you that he was designated to lead the 
future transitional government in accordance with the Arusha 
agreement. Faustin Twagiramungu succeeded in escaping from the 
soldiers of the Presidential Guard who were looking for him in 
the streets of Kigali. Today he is in a safe place and for the 
first time he gives us his account of the events that followed 
the assassination of President Habyarimana. Christophe 
Boisbouvier spoke to him: 
  [Twangiramungu] The shooting started at 0505 on the morning 
of 7 April. I had a conversation with the prime minister. She 
told me that her house was surrounded and that she wanted to go 
to speak on the radio but could not do so, because it seems that 
the people were very serious and that she feared for her life. 
We talked throughout that morning and we exchanged points of 
view on the situation until 0830. At 0830 the gendarmes 
informed me that the situation was becoming very serious; I 
thank the French ambassador for having communicated with UNAMIR 
[UN Mission in Rwanda]. UNAMIR then sent me an armored vehicle 
which picked me up at around 1230, and at that very moment I 
heard the news of the assassination of the prime minister by the 
Presidential Guard. I remained cut off from the outside world 
from 7 April until I was invited to escape with the UNAMIR 
staff, which is what I did. 
  [Boisbouvier] Was the assassination of opposition leaders 
ordered at the highest level, or was it decided by low-level 
authority in the Presidential Guard? 
  [Twangiramungu] It was not a low-level authority in the 
Presidential Guard which decided that a massacre of opposition 
leaders should be carried out. It seems to me that it had 
already been decided upon a long time before, because the 
political authorities of the [word indistinct] party had decided 
to distribute weapons to the militia of the MRND [National 
Revolutionary Movement for Development]. I don't understand how 
the Presidential Guard could have found everyone in their homes 
and everyone's address. This was done and planned by extremists 
within the army. They are extremists of [word indistinct] who 
are now using other personalities to lead international public 
opinion into thinking that the conflict is of an ethnic nature. 
This is not the case. If this were an interethnic conflict why 
then would all opposition leaders, Tutsi and Hutu alike, have 
been assassinated? 
  [Boisbouvier] Who do you think is behind the attack on 
President Habyarimana's plane? 
  [Twangiramungu] I don't personally think that the president 
was assassinated by the Belgians. What for? Nor do I think 
that this method was used by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. 
I think the president was assassinated by extremist soldiers 
within the Presidential Guard or simply by soldiers within his 
circle, soldiers forming a clan within the army. Why? Because 
extremist soldiers wanted the president to resume war [with the 
RPF]. The president had merely wanted to use delaying tactics 
by refusing the formation of a transitional government. 
Extremist soldiers did not accept these delaying tactics. They 
purely and simply preferred to eliminate him in order to 
continue to enjoy their privileges if, of course, they succeed 
in winning such a war. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, the Patriotic Front still has the 
military intiative on the ground. Kigali is still subject to 
shelling and sporadic gunfire. In the north of the country, the 
Patriotic Front has taken the town of Byumba, an important 
strategic center. This time the news has been confirmed by the 
United Nations. Francois Rijkmans reports: 
  [Rijkmans] [passage omitted] Violence is continuing up 
country. This time it is clear that the Butare region in the 
south, which until now had been miraculously preserved from the 
massacres, is now getting its full dose. People who have taken 
refuge in schools or churches are being killed. The militia are 
barring the roads, which are crowded with thousands of people. 
Militiamen are slaughtering on the spot those who are fleeing. 
  At the frontier, on the road between Butare and Bujumbura, 
people trying to get into Burundi have been killed. Dozens of 
people with machete, bullet, or shrapnel injuries have arrived 
in the hospital of Butare where there is a Medecins Sans 
Frontieres team. There is a large Tutsi minority in the Butare 
area, but traditionally there has been harmonious coexistence 
between the two groups there, to such an extent that certain 
Hutu radicals from the north suspect the southern Hutus of being 
too close to the Tutsis. 
  The day before yesterday the prefect of the region and the 
military commander, two moderates, were replaced by people close 
to the radicals.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan (?killer) Army still continues its 
operation of causing massacres in various parts of the country. 
Thousands of people are returning to their homes around the town 
of Byumba, which is now under RPF control. [passage indistinct] 
Some of the returnees are from (?homes) for the displaced, while 
others are fleeing from government-controlled areas due to 
harassment by government forces. 
  In areas of Rwamagana, thousands of people welcomed the 
Rwandan Patriotic Army forces, which saved many of them who have 
been in hiding for weeks. Rwamagana town is now under RPF 
control after heavy exchange of fire where the commanding 
officer of the government forces in the area was seriously 
injured. 
  In Kigali, also, fighting was reported yesterday between the 
Rwandan Patriotic Army and government forces around [words 
indistinct]. Government forces suffered heavy losses.

  [Text] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] fighters continue 
their campaign to liberate our country. News from the front 
sent to us by Calixte Mugabo says commanders of the government 
forces continue to send soldiers to their deaths at Rebero Hill 
in Kigali, where 100 soldiers, including their commanders, have 
been killed. At Jari Hill, also in Kigali, around 100 also have 
been killed. 
  In Rwamagana in eastern Rwanda, which is in the hands of the 
RPF, a colonel who was commanding the government forces was 
injured. The question now is why soldiers continue to die 
protecting the clique of killers. They should see the truth and 
rather fight the killers who are determined to exterminate the 
whole country. 
  Let us return to war news from the Kigali area. Our 
colleague Calixte Mugabo informs us that currently the RPF 
controls the communes of Gikoro, Gikomero and Bicumbi. In areas 
where government forces are withdrawing, they are leaving behind 
many heavy weapons.

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, fresh fighting broke out today in 
Kigali. [passage omitted] Philippe Gaillard, the ICRC 
representative in the Rwandan capital, spoke to us on the 
telephone about an hour ago: 
  [Begin Gaillard recording] The situation in Kigali is 
extremely tense. Only 15 minutes ago -- it is now exactly 1850 
hours in Kigali -- we had to rush to the ground floor of this 
building because of an exchange of heavy weapons fire between 
the RPF and government troops. Rebero hill was under fire for 
most of the day, and the hotel on top of that hill, occupied by 
the RPF, is now ablaze. 
  The situation in Kigali, as elsewhere in Rwanda, is 
despairing and desperate. This is dialogue by the gun and the 
machete -- nothing else. [passage omitted] I take this 
opportunity to appeal to the international community, and 
especially to the Rwandans listening to RFI, to stop this 
suicide. All are losers in this war. All are losers. [end

  [Text] Nairobi, April 21 (AFP) -- The UN-controlled airport 
in Mogadishu reopened Thursday [21 April] after fighting between 
the city's warring clans died down following talks between UN 
officials and clan leaders, a UN official said. 
  UN Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM) spokesman George Bennett 
told AFP by phone from the Somali capital that following the 
talks an official ceasefire was expected to come into effect 
only on Friday. 
  He said sporadic gunfire during the day had died down 
completely and the airport reopened by mid-day. Arrangements 
for an April 25 meeting of warring clans as agreed in Nairobi 
would go on as planned, he added. 
  Fighting erupted between the Habr Gedir and Hawadle clans on 
Wednesday, with both sides battling for territory around the 
airport. Two UN soldiers, a Malaysian and a Nepali, were 
wounded in crossfire. 
  The fighting prevented UN staff from moving around the city 
and forced them to retreat to the main UN compound in south 
Mogadishu, while staffers living outside it were temporarily 
moved inside. 
  Several flights out of Mogadishu were also cancelled as 
fighters from the Habr Gedir clan of warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid 
battled the Hawadle with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, 
according to the UN spokesman. 
  The Habr Gedir have a long-standing dispute with the Hawadle 
over employment at the airport, controlled by the Hawadle until 
the first US Marines landed there in December 1992. 
  Fighting between them has killed about nine Somalis and 
wounded another 40 over the past five days. 
  Two Nepalis peacekeepers were killed in crossfire and a 
Gambian employee of the UN refugee agency died when gunmen 
opened fire on a UN plane in southwestern Somalia on Monday. 
  More than 80 UN soldiers and several civilian UN officials 
have been killed since the UNOSOM was launched in May last year.

  [Text] Somali National Alliance [SNA] officials recently 
met Ambassador (Atwal Karim), the UN Operation in Somalia 
[UNOSOM] political director. The UNOSOM's responsibilities in 
Somalia and the UNOSOM forces' violation of the Somali people's 
rights were discussed. Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, the United Somali 
Congress secretary general made it clear during the meeting that 
UNOSOM illegally disarms Somali people. He said [words 
indistinct] such acts. SNA proposed to UNOSOM that: 
  1. Given that UNOSOM's duty is confined to safeguarding 
humanitarian aid and maintaining the security of relief 
agencies, it should order its forces to refrain from acts that 
are beyond its jurisdiction. 
  2. It should remove the checkpoints in the city and its 
outskirts where UNOSOM forces disarm people: 
  3. It should increase the meetings between the SNA and 
UNOSOM so to enable the discussion of security issues. 
  For his part, Ambassador (Atwal Karim) promised that the 
issues discussed by the two sides will be conveyed to UNOSOM 
officials. The SNA side was represented by Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali 
and Professor Ise Mohamed Siad, the foreign affairs secretary.

  [Text] A meeting to discuss political, security, and relief 
issues was held in Mogadishu today between Somali National 
Alliance [SNA] members and Ambassador Lansana Kouyate, the UN 
special representative to Somalia. The SNA members included 
Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, the United Somali Congress secretary 
general; Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, the SNA chairman for 
internal affairs; and Lieutenant General Abdirahman Warsame Elmi 
Aare. They made it clear that the SNA is not responsible for 
existing problems such as kidnapping, robbery, and murder, and 
rejected such accusations. They added that these acts are 
perpetrated by groups and individuals opposed to the good of the 
Somali people. They also asked the United Nations not to 
overlook the problems but to assist in solving them, 
particularly the problems of disease and drought which are 
prevalent in the country. 
  Ambassador Lansana Kouyate briefed the meeting on the 
Nairobi 
meetings of Somali organizations and the technical reasons for 
the delay of the expected 15 April Mogadishu meeting. He said 
that God willing, the meeting will be held on 25 April. He also 
reported on meetings he had held in New York and Washington with 
the UN Security Council and donor countries. He welcomed 
improvements in the Somali police force and the start of the 
work of the joint police committee to combat thieves and bandits. 
  The UN force in Somalia was also discussed during the 
meeting 
and Ambassador Lansana Kouyate said that the duty of the UN 
force is to safeguard humanitarian aid adding that it has 
nothing to do with compulsory disarmament. 
  The meeting ended well with understandings reached on the 
agenda. Both sides stressed that joint work between the SNA and 
UN Operation in Somalia should be strengthened and that 
relations should be maintained consistently.

<F P=106> [Report on cabinet meeting by Communication Minister Daniele </F>
Boni-Claverie in Abidjan on 20 April] 
  [Text] At today's cabinet meeting the government examined 
the country's current situation, and expressed satisfaction with 
the international community's reactions to the fact that the 
crisis has been brought under control and properly managed. We 
are also pleased with the increasing interest that financiers 
are steadily showing toward us concerning the way Cote d'Ivoire 
is implementing its structural adjustment program. A number of 
achievements already allow us to assert that the expected 
economic recovery is not a vain hope, that it will become a 
reality in the months ahead. The government is satisfied with 
the regular payment of salaries, the increase in the producer 
prices for cash crops, the payment of students scholarships, and 
the payment of retirement pensions. Other achievements include 
the gradual repayment of national debts, support to financiers 
-- as I have already pointed out -- in funding development 
projects, and the implementation of social welfare programs. 
These are some of the many achiements which, in so short a 
period, have restored hope to our compatriots and the entire 
nation. 
  The government especially wants to praise the determination 
and commitment of our citizens, and thanks them for their 
support, as the efforts demanded from each citizen can only be 
continued with the understanding of all, thanks to the 
continuing social peace. That is why the government is 
astonished by the ill-timed statements, calls for violence, 
disorder, and disturbances orchestrated by a certain portion of 
the media. The only thing that should prevail is national 
solidarity. The government wants to emphatically reassure the 
Ivorian people that no one will be threatened -- neither the 
leader of the Ivorian Popular Front nor its activists. 
  However, since Cote d'Ivoire is a country where the rule of 
law prevails, nobody, whatever his political leaning or 
profession, can be above the law. When citizens violate the 
laws of the country, they have to face the consequences of their 
acts without trying to sow confusion among public opinion. The 
prosecution of Abou Drahamane Sangare, publishing manager of the 
newspaper LA VOIE, and Souleymane Senn, a journalist for that 
same paper -- even if they are influential members of a 
political party -- is only in line with the enforcement of the 
law. Cote d'Ivoire has always defended freedom of speech, as 
well as individual and collective freedoms, on the condition 
that they are exercised legally. 
  It is in this regard that the government warns all those 
making appeals likely to disturb the social peace and law and 
order, and calls on all Ivorians to remain as calm and collected 
as they have always been -- which has so far been a guarantee 
for the harmonious development of our country. 
  In this period of political and social instability in many 
African countries, Cote d'Ivoire will continue to demonstrate 
that disorder is not an unavoidable condition.

  [Text] Bujumbura, April 21 (AFP) -- The attorney general of 
Burundi was shot and killed overnight Wednesday [20 April] on 
the outskirts of the capital, officials said Thursday. 
  Nathan-Audance Nibaruta was killed in Kamenge, an area where 
armed residents have engaged the army in gunbattles that 
continued Thursday. 
  It was not clear how he died. Some sources said he was 
caught in a crossfire, while other sources within the military 
said he had taken the side of the armed civilians and opened 
fire on soldiers. 
  The presidents of Burundi and Rwanda were killed in a plane 
crash on April 6. Rwanda exploded in ethnic bloodletting, but 
Burundi has remained largely calm despite having the same 
rivalry between the same two tribes. 
  The interim Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya met 
with civil and military authorities to discuss how to end the 
violence in Kamenge. 
  "All the rest of the country is calm," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu </F>
Buthelezi by announcer Penny Smythe on the "Agenda" program in 
Johannesburg-- live] 
  [Text] [Smythe] Good evening and welcome to Agenda. The 
Inkatha Freedom Party's 11th hour decision to partake in the 
elections. Was it brinkmanship or a real change of heart? If 
one had to go according to newspaper headlines today, the level 
of violence in the country has plummeted. Has this been as a 
result of the IFP's decision. To answer these and other 
questions is Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Good evening, 
Dr. Buthelezi. 
  Well, you have waited as we say, til the 11th hour -- just 
one week before the election to decide to take part in those 
elections. Why? 
  [Buthelezi] We had decided in January not to participate, 
but 
then we were given some kind of authority as a Central Committee 
to look at what was then ongoing negotiations to see whether in 
fact we could change the decision, and various things took 
place. In the Freedom Alliance we were negotiating with the ANC 
and government, and later on there were trilateral talks in 
December when there was that paper called the yellow paper on 
the 19th of December, which was more or less the bottom line 
paper, and then after that, of course -- since nothing came out 
of it. 
  Then in January the king came out demanding sovereignty of 
the monarchy and so on, which made a completely different ball 
game altogether. So then when the king raised this matter, it 
became very difficult for us, those of us who are IFP and also 
Zulus to move forward because the king said if his concerns were 
not addressed, then he was not prepared to advise his people -- 
his subjects -- to participate in the election. So I mean that 
is the thing then when the king's matter was addressed, then 
there was no excuse for us to go in for elections. 
  [Smythe] Was this not actually addressed two weeks ago 
before 
the mediators came out here? 
  [Buthelezi] By whom? 
  [Smythe] By the NP [National Party], by the ANC and 
negotiations. They didn't offer you what you wanted? 
  [Buthelezi] That was just cheap propaganda by the ANC and 
the 
and the NP because what was discussed at Skukuza were just pacts 
which they were promising the king. They didn't address the 
issue of the kingdom itself. The king was not interested in 
pacts for himself and the family, but he was actually talking 
about the land. He was talking about his people. 
  [Smythe] What have you achieved for the Zulu people in 
general and the IFP in particular that wasn't achievable two 
weeks ago or a month ago. What specifically have you achieved 
for the king as well? 
  [Buthelezi] I think that for the king we've achieved this 
recognition now which is going to be enshrined in the 
constitution of the country, and that was not anywhere near the 
king a few weeks ago, even at Skukuza. But on Monday a special 
session of the Parliament of South Africa has been summoned to 
actually enshrine this in the constitution. 
  [Smythe] But he will be a constitutional monarch, that he 
will have certain... what will he have? What will actually be 
his status in kwaZulu/Natal? 
  [Buthelezi] That will come out now when the constitution of 
kwaZulu/Natal is actually drafted, because the constitution of 
kwaZulu/Natal is not drafted. The constitution that we drafted 
a couple of years ago in fact was never put before the 
negotiation forum, so it was never actually looked at by the 
negotiation forum. 
  [Smythe] So the king wanted specific rights enshrined in a 
constitution. Am I correct in that? He wanted certain status. 
Now what specifically was that? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, because you see, as long as we were 
talking 
about a federation, a possible federation, then the king thought 
that the self-determination of the Zulu people would then be 
addressed through a federal formula, because a federal formula 
does provide for self-rule on a regional basis with devolution 
of power. Whereas in fact once it's a unitary state, then it 
meant that that question would not be addressed, and that is why 
he decided to take it upon himself to go and see the state 
president and had a few meetings subsequent to that with the 
state president. 
  [Smythe] Other than the status of the king, what do you 
feel you have achieved to allow you to take part? 
  [Buthelezi] I think that the recognition that the principle 
of our symmetry which from the very beginning of negotiations we 
tried to persuade the people at the negotiation forum to 
recognize the principle of our symmetry that these regions need 
not necessarily be the same, so the fact that kwaZulu/Natal is 
going to be a kingdom that's accepted right across the board is 
in fact a recognition of the principle of our symmetry that 
kwaZulu/Natal is different and, therefore, it is likely to have 
a constitution different from other regions of South Africa. 
  [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, we've seen a great deal of violence 
in the last few weeks. Do you feel now looking back over these 
last few weeks that it's been worth the cost of lives lost and 
the cost to the economy of that uncertainty by people. 
  [Buthelezi] If I should answer that question I'll be 
implying 
that we are the cause of the violence, whereas the violence has 
been there for 10 years in fact, and has become endemic. And I 
would also say that, therefore, the violence also is of 
different types because there is the sort of violence arising 
from socioeconomic conditions, and then there's violence, of 
course, which is political which goes to incite...[pauses] 
violence which just comes about because of the conflict between 
the ANC and IFP members -- which is the political violence, and 
which members of both these parties, ANC and IFP were involved 
in, are involved in fact because I don't think that we should 
have an illusion that it's over. We should just praise the 
Almighty at present we don't have that; and hope that with God's 
grace that it might last for good. 
  [Smythe] Let's just take that there, you say that there's 
political violence between the two groups, and I think that it's 
an accepted fact that you might have some ANC members living on 
a hill over there and some IFP members living on a hill over 
there, and never the twain shall meet. Now the political 
parties have felt that they weren't safe going into a lot of 
areas to campaign. Are those sort of no go areas now free and 
open? What are you going to do ensure that the people will 
allow that kind of free campaigning? 
  [Buthelezi] I suppose that -- I am hoping myself that the 
agreement that we signed with Mr. Mandela and the president of 
South Africa somehow send some signals. This is just a hope of 
course. They send signals to our followers on the ground that in 
fact we believe that the only road that we should follow is that 
of peace and nonviolence if we want our country to survive and 
to prospwr. 
  [Smythe] You know, I just wanted you to go back on 
something, 
you mentioned the Freedom Alliance earlier on, and of course we 
were watching the news before we came into the studio here this 
evening. Watching Ferdi Hartzenberg there speaking on behalf of 
the CP [Conservative Party] and saying our demands haven't been 
met therefore we cannot take part in the election, words that 
you've said many times. How do you feel now that you decided to 
take part? 
  [Buthelezi] In fact I informed Dr. Hartzenberg about it that 
even before we signed the agreement I sent him a (?call on 
this). I was in Pretoria. I had to show him that in this case 
the issue addressed really more realistically insofar as it was 
going to be enshrined in the constitution on Monday, and that 
therefore we had to undertake to participate in the election as 
a result of that. 
  [Smythe] And of course it's too late for them now? Just you 
made it by a whisker. And I think with all this going on, 
there's been very little time for campaigning on an official 
level. You've been at the center of South African political 
life for many months now without doing any real campaigning. 
Nobody really knows what your manifesto is. Could you give us 
some kind of brief outline on let's say the economic policy of 
the IFP toward kwaZulu/Natal in particular? 
  [Buthelezi] We've always believed in the free market. In 
fact, that has always been the belief of the IFP as far as the 
economy is concerned. We do not know of any economic system 
that is better than the free enterprise system, and therefore 
even when it was not fashionable in African circles to extol the 
virtues of this enterprise system, we did so unashamedly, that 
this enterprise system was the only system that we know that can 
create jobs as quickly as possible, and is the only system that 
is such a potent force for development, which our people need 
very desperately. So we believe that our county can only go 
forward, and we can only address the poverty of our people 
through this enterprise system if it's allowed to flourish. We 
believe that of course it will be necessary for the government 
to intervene on certain issues... 
  [Smythe, interrupting] Where specifically do you see the 
government being very important -- the state? 
  [Buthelezi] I think the state is important as far as 
disparities which will be very much with us for quite a long 
time to come because in this country per capita -- because of 
apartheid and racism -- black people suffered, because in 
education they were rather funded on a racial basis -- a sliding 
basis, on a disparity basis if you like, and therefore we 
believe that those gaps will have to be bridged only through the 
intervention of the government. 
  [Smythe] Does that apply then to something like land 
redistribution and the distribution of wealth which some people 
are saying take from the rich to give to the poor -- just as a 
random example. How do you see that as being dealt with? 
  [Buthelezi] In fact we also believe in the redistribution of 
wealth, but we've always said that redistribution of wealth as 
far as IFP is concerned means only redistribution of 
opportunity. But that is quite separate of course from the 
issue of land, because it is true that our people are land 
hungry, and that is an issue that must be addressed because for 
instance per square meter, I think that kwaZulu as far as 
density is concerned, is the most crowded place in South Africa 
-- dhe most crowded region. Durban, our metropolis, for 
instance, is the fastest growing city in the world -- I'm told 
-- after Mexico. 
  [Smythe] So how do you see that actually happening? How do 
you see that being dealt with as an issue -- the land 
redistribution? 
  [Buthelezi] First of all, there are stretches and stretches 
of land which I call state lands, which of course after our 
conquests was called Crown lands, which I think as a matter of 
urgency should be distributed to our people and to enable our 
people who want to farm for instance to farm. And there is also 
the issue of absentee farming, where there are people who don't 
farm at all but who have stretches and stretches of farms. I 
think that also should be looked at to address that issue. 
  [Smythe] Right, when it comes to...[pauses] You mentioned 
the economic situation as being the free market system, is one 
that you would particularly follow as the IFP, as part of your 
manifesto as being the main driving force behind job creation. 
What about international investment, local investment, do you 
see international investment as being very important? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I think this really very important indeed, 
because our country is in such dire straights at this time 
precisely because of the isolation of South Africa, because of 
the sanctions campaign. I tried to warn, because I was totally 
against that myself. Whereas I was an opponent of apartheid and 
campaigned against apartheid like many other African leaders in 
this country, or opposition politicians here like the DP 
[Democratic Party] and so on. But I warned about it -- going so 
far as to say that because apartheid was such a wicked system, 
let us now penalize whites by destroying the economy -- because 
I said that would devastate the poorest of the poor first. So 
we have a situation now where about 46 percent of the people 
that should be working in this country have no jobs. So I mean 
it is going to take us a long time before we are able to do 
that. So foreign investment is absolutely crucial, it is very 
important in contributing, but also investment by our own 
entrepreneurs is important as well, equally important. 
  [Smythe] Alright, we've spoken about the IFP being a Zulu 
party, as well as for other people, but primarily a party for 
Zulu people. Now I'm not a Zulu person, why would I vote for 
you? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I think that is the propaganda, cheap 
propaganda of our opponents, saying it is a Zulu party. In fact 
there are some journalists that I refuse to speak to because 
they always say it is a Zulu-based party. I don't see them 
doing the same thing saying that the National Party is an 
Afrikaner-based party. I don't see them saying about the DP 
that's an Anglo-Saxon- based, a Judeo-Anglo party. So I think 
that is just cheap propaganda. 
  I must recall that of course when Inkatha was only two 
years, 
I was summoned, you know, to Pretoria by Minister Kruger, you 
know Jimmy Kruger, the famous Jimmy Kruger who talked about 
Steve Biko's death, making [word indistinct]. Now he summoned 
me to threaten me. He said that he sees -- and it was only two 
years -- he said he sees that, you know, membership of Inkatha 
is not confined to Zulus. So I told him that in fact it wasn't. 
Then he said that I was polarizing black and white in the 
country and said that if I didn't stop it he'd take action. I 
said that as long as the National Party takes pride of different 
ethnic groups in the white community, I had the same rights, so 
that stands out as evidence that even when we were two years 
old, through his intelligence services he discovered that it was 
not confined to Zulus only. 
  [Smythe] Alright, but then why would a person vote for the 
IFP. What do you feel you can give to a South African citizen? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I think that our track record in the first 
place, that people know us, and they have every reason to trust 
us, that we have been motivated in everything that we have done, 
by the interest, not just of people in kwaZulu/Natal or black 
people, but the interest of every South African. Because when 
we campaigned for instance against sanctions, we were not doing 
this just for ourselves, but we were doing it in the interest of 
South Africa as a whole because we didn't want South Africa to 
be a wasteland. 
  [Smythe] You've said in press reports that you will accept 
the results of this election provided that the international 
community says, you know, everything was okay and it was free 
and fair. What happens if Inkatha doesn't do well, if you fare 
badly both nationally and on a regional level. How will you 
feel about the election results then? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, as a democrat, you know, I must accept the 
judgment of the people of South Africa. So as far as I am 
concerned, as far as my party is concerned, as far as the 
Central Committee, and my members, we are prepared to accept the 
verdict of the people. But at the same time of course, I must 
add that everyone knows that only an (?insane) politician like 
myself would participate in the election, you know, seven days 
before the election took place. But even that decision should 
make you think about voting for me because I did that in the 
interest of South Africa, because I thought that if in fact we 
did not get the concerns of His Majesty the king addressed, and 
therefore participation in the election, that this country was 
going slide into an abyss, and this would have happened. So 
even there I was concerned about the interest of everyone. 
  So I've been disadvantaged as a leader, and my party is 
disadvantaged in that we haven't had time to campaign really 
like all the other parties. But nevertheless, I could well say, 
and some people would defend me, that you know, we were not 
giving enough time to campaign, and that was not by accident, 
because from the very beginning, the date was actually 
manipulated, because the 27th was described as sacrosanct. I 
don't know why it was sacrosanct. From the very beginning, you 
know, people were actually pushed into accepting the 27th of 
April as cast in granite, and I don't why it should be cast in 
granite. 
  [Smythe] Well, you mentioned that you don't have very much 
time to campaign, and that of course is a fact. But what is 
also a fact is something I mentioned a little earlier, and the 
fact that you actually have been at the center of South African 
politics for the last few months, to some people in the negative 
way, and to your supporters obviously in a very positive way. 
So some people could say that was a rather cynical move on the 
part of the Inkatha Freedom Party to stretch it out. Possibly 
there have reports that maybe you felt that you weren't going to 
be a tremendous success at the polls, that this was one way of 
gaining concessions without having to go through all the 
campaigning that the others parties have done, but have kept 
your name in the forefront of the political field all this time? 
  [Buthelezi] I'll say that I had no script for that. To say 
that it was drawn out deliberately as a strategy is wrong, 
because it was the issues that were not addressed at Codesa 
[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]. Codesa was not 
destroyed by the IFP, it was the ANC and the South African 
Communist Party alliance who destroyed Codesa. And in fact they 
walked out of it, they threatened the whole country with mass 
action, they tried to bring the country to a standstill, they 
terrified Mr. de Klerk and forced him of course to sign the 
Record of Understanding, which messed up the whole process of 
negotiation. 
  So, we are not responsible for all those things, and I would 
say therefore that there's nothing that we didn't do try and 
bring about compromise or some understanding, because even after 
our delegates withdrew from the forum, we then started 
vigorously talking to -- on a bilateral basis with both the ANC 
and the government. And then by December we were in a 
trilateral situation with them discussing on a trilateral, 
because we were desperate, because we wanted to get to the 
electoral. We've never been against going to the electoral 
process. 
  [Smythe] The way you're speaking, you see yourself as an 
honest broker of your beliefs and the beliefs of your party and 
for your king, but you're being described in some local press, 
and indeed in some overseas press, as a demon, as a spoiler, and 
in one as a public relations disaster. Do you feel a little bit 
hard done by the press? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I don't about that. That's a question of 
opinion, because the largest newspaper -- THE SUNDAY TIMES -- I 
think you must have seen that editorial on Easter, which 
completely vindicated my stand, completely the opposite of Mr. 
Ken Owen and his paper who have tried to demonize me, even 
swearing at me, even defaming me in most cases. It is not true 
that... [pauses]. 
  From the beginning the things weren't wrong like th?s, I 
mean 
from the outset. The government and the ANC were supposed to be 
people that must determine our future, so negotiations were made 
by (Pollard) negotiations because the ANC and the government 
were going to do it. In other words if I may use an analogy, 
two cats in the room were enough. When I appeared as the third 
cat somehow I took a knock by the media by other people 
including diplomats as spoiling what could be a good thing if 
the ANC and the government sow it up between themselves. But in 
fact this is what caused the problem. 
  Now of course, then I had to be destroyed, then that's why 
there was this campaign by both the government and the ANC and 
national intelligence, who in fact did their damndest even to 
incite the press, even when we discuss with Mr. de Klerk. 
  It's just unfortunate that he has got that man called Dr. 
Barnard, who was the head of intelligence, because he is the man 
really who has been responsible behind scenes for what has 
happened. Because even some of the discussions between ourselves 
when there was no media, for instance Skukuza, he gave them to 
the press. For example, in Skukuza it was suggested that the 
king should only go in with a few people. But then we had a 
delegation which had legal advisers and so on, and he is the one 
who was arguing with my official, Mr. Stan Armstrong. I mean, 
that took place just between them, in the veranda, but the next 
thing that was in the first page of THE SUNDAY TIMES. I mean 
the water has been muddied by the fact that this man, Dr. 
Barnard, has really been the power behind everything that has 
gone wrong in this country. 
  [Smythe] Just continue with that kind of thought. You stood 
for not making any deals with the present government until 
Nelson Mandela was released, until the ANC was unbanned. So 
there again do you feel that you've had rather the raw end of 
the deal there, as far as the ANC and the NP were concerned? 
  [Buthelezi] I wish you were present at Skukuza, because when 
the issue of the date came up, I said to Dr. Mandela, I said my 
brother, I love you very much, which I do really, because to be 
a friend with someone for more than 40 years is quite something. 
So now I said to him, you know, I waited for years and years 
for you. You mean you can't wait for me even for a few weeks? 
Just for a few weeks? Can't you do that? I put this, you 
know, it was nearly with tears in my eyes. 
  [Smythe] Well, between tears in your eyes and Mr. Mandela 
saying he would go down on his knees, there was obviously a very 
emotional decision that you had to make to actually go into 
these elections. I wonder now what's going to happen. 
  [Buthelezi] His going on the knees was just really cheap 
vilification really, because there was no need for him to use 
the expression that he needs to go on his knees, because I've 
never refused to see Mr. Mandela. Whenever meetings have been 
requested I've never refused, I've never had any problems. And 
in fact, it's strange you know, when we are together, you'll be 
surprised at the affections that we've had for each other and 
the warmth that we've had for each other, and comradeship in the 
ANC surfaces. It comes to the top. 
  [Smythe] Does that mean after the elections when the results 
are out, you're in Parliament, let's assume you get in, this 
involvement there by the IFP for the IFP, you are going to be 
able to work with a government of national unity? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I don't know about that, but that's what 
the constitution says, so therefore I suppose if one is in it, 
one will have to abide by the constitution without necessarily 
saying that I like that arrangement because I would prefer 
myself to be in opposition politics. Or if I can't make it, if 
the people do not elect me, because there are still a few days, 
they can decide to elect me, I stand just as good a chance as 
Mr. de Klerk or Mr. Mandela. But if they don't then I would 
have liked to be in opposition politics. 
  [Smythe] So outside the parliamentary system, basically, you 
would be happy to do that. 
  [Buthelezi] Yes, of course I would be happy to do that, in 
fact, that's what [pauses] You know, a lot of people surprise 
me, because they said to me what will you do if you don't go in 
for elections? What will happen to you? And it amused me 
because for 83 years black people have not been part and parcel 
of the electoral process in this country. We've been out of it 
and we have been in politics outside opposing apartheid, 
opposing segregation, we were doing that outside. So that there 
was nothing traumatic about being outside and actually opposing 
the thing from outside. 
  [Smythe] There has been talk by some of the political 
parties 
of joining up and forming sort of coalitions, or whatever word 
one wants to use, with other parties, either before or after the 
election to gain strength in certain regions. How do you feel 
about that as the IFP? 
  [Buthelezi] I don't think it's feasible as the constitution 
stands to have coalitions as one had in the past. Maybe in 
Parliament we can go on one side by arguing on the same side, 
but to actually form coalitions I thought -- I'm subject to 
correction here -- that the constitution does not make it 
possible. 
  [Smythe] So you don't see yourself joining up? Supposing you 
don't get elected into Parliament, you don't see yourself 
joining up with the right wing to form some kind of guerrilla 
outfit that you would form sort of Vietnam situation where you 
go underground? 
  [Buthelezi] I would say in the first place, I rejected 
violence long ago, and when I went to London in '79 to see Mr. 
Oliver Thambo, it was precisely this issue on which we could not 
agree because I could not agree to the armed struggle, because 
I've always denounced violence, because the founding fathers of 
ANC founded the ANC on the basis that the ANC was going to wage 
a nonviolent struggle through negotiations. So when the ANC 
decided, because of the intransigence of the government, to take 
up arms, I disagreed with them. So therefore I'm not attracted 
really by guerrilla warfare. Even when my people war waged 
against the people who were oppressing us, the South African 
apartheid regime, it was never an option I ever considered. 
  [Smythe] You are minister of police as well, Dr. Buthelezi. 
  [Buthelezi] Absolutely. 
  [Smythe] What is going to happen to the kwaZulu Police? I 
mean, we have seen a lot of IFP supporters who are definitely 
against, for example, the National Peacekeeping Force, seeing it 
as an ANC-, an NP-dominated police force. What is going to 
happen to the kwaZulu Police? Are you going to encourage them 
to join a national police force? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, actually I suppose that is inevitable. I 
mean, I think that the fact that you, I mean we are in (?an 
election), makes it inevitable that they will be merged into a 
national police force. But of course, as I said at (?the 
rallies), I think that is absolutely wrong because the king 
himself has stated, you know, that in his kingdom he would like 
to have his own police force. 
  [Smythe] But that is not going to be annulled, is it? A 
private, a sort of private police forces or private armies or.... 
  [Buthelezi, interrupting] Well, it is not private. I mean, 
America, they have got different police forces in various 
states. They have even a militia. You know, the king wants a 
militia as well because they have a militia in various states in 
America, although you have got the national force, you know, on 
the whole country. So, I mean it is a question of saying it is 
not going to be allowed. It's neither here nor there because, I 
mean, there are so many guns now in South Africa that it's 
really, it's better to regularize this thing and do it properly. 
In other countries like America do it. If you are going to 
have a militia, even the states have the militia, if you are 
going to have the police from the states, have that. 
  [Smythe] But you would encourage the kwaZulu Police as it 
stands to participate in a national police force. 
  [Buthelezi] Yes. You know, as a matter of principle. When 
I was approached by General Meiring and the commissioner of 
police, General van der Merwe, when they came to Ulundi last 
year and suggested that some of our police force should join the 
National Peacekeeping Force, then I said that, well, I couldn't 
because in the first place some of our people have been killed 
by cadres of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC 
military wing]. And there you are saying that we must merge 
with them. 
  Because we saw something very strange in the state president 
because on the 20th of December 1991 you will remember, even on 
television, that he stated that he wanted Umkhonto we Sizwe 
disbanded and that the arms should be (?handed) to the police. 
But he had such a dressing down from Mr. Mandela that he never 
opened his mouth about that later. 
  And the next thing we heard that there was going to be (?a 
merger) into one force, into the National Peace Keeping Force 
and also in the SADF [South African Defense Force]. Now, I am 
very unhappy about that and I think I have been proven right 
because the exchange of fire that took place at Thokoza just two 
days ago, I mean bears testimony to that because it was not only 
the IFP members who complained, but even some members of the ANC 
were not happy with what happened there. 
  [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, what is it going to be like for you 
to make your cross on the ballot paper for the first time? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I think that it's an experience in fact 
which will mean that at long last after a decade that one has 
spent fighting for human rights for our people, fighting for the 
franchise for our black people that at long last, you know, we 
have reached that point. 
  [Smythe] And it will b a very emotional thing? 
  [Buthelezi] It will be a very emotional thing I think for 
all 
of us in the country as black people in particular to put that 
cross on the ballot paper. 
  [Smythe] How are you going to manage? I mean, do you think 
you actually can manage to campaign now over the next few days 
nationally as well as regionally? 
  [Buthelezi] I am trying as much as possible, but if you 
can't 
clone yourself, I cannot clone myself and be everywhere where I 
would like to be, but I mean tomorrow I am going to (?parts) of 
the Transvaal and I think that those who are conducting our 
campaign have scheduled me for Soweto on Sunday. But then the 
days are finished. Then I can't do more than that. I would 
like to do more than that, you know, but unfortunately as I say 
I have not done that because I would like to go to the voters 
myself and to speak for myself with the voters throughout the 
country. 
  [Smythe] What do you see as the most pressing problem to 
face 
the new government? 
  [Buthelezi] I think the most pressing problem is meeting 
the, 
I mean, the unrealistic expectations that have been printed 
because, I mean, the fact that we are going to have a government 
of national unity, or even if it was a black government, will 
not cause these things that we discussed at the beginning of 
this interview -- the poverty -- we are not going to bridge 
those gaps overnight. And therefore I fear myself, I am very 
much scared, maybe it is not wise to be in a government of 
national unity because one will just suffered that blame whether 
one is responsible for it or not. I fear that the expectations 
of young people that have been created, when they have been 
promised that this means that they are going to have housing and 
so, and all the things that have been promised. 
  (?These such things will not) [words indistinct] even if we 
try. They will not have them overnight. I think Mr. Mandela 
made this point -- was it yesterday -- as well as at King 
William's Town that it will take five years or more. But I 
believe myself it is a generation. I think we should prepare 
our people that the real struggle is going to begin on the 28th. 
The real struggle in this country commences after that. We 
have got to roll up our sleeves and work, you know, all of us as 
people of this country. 
  I don't think that we should, even if we have suffered 
because of apartheid, that other people owe us a living. I 
think that we should also have, you know, self-help schemes. I 
have always believed in the IFP. There are twin pillars of our 
philosophy -- self-help and self-reliance. I believe that even 
if the economic growth will go higher, 5 percent or even more, 
we will not be able to create the number of jobs, with the 
democracy we have in the country, we are not going to be able to 
give every young person that has catapulted into the labor 
market with a [words indistinct] job. 
  So, therefore, it is a very uphill struggle. I think that if 
we were more realistic in our approach by not, you know, 
creating expectations that once we are also in charge in this 
country that everything will vanish like mist. I think that it 
would really pay dividends for us because then our people can be 
sober and realize that the real struggle now is going to begin 
on the 28th. 
  [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for joining us 
on 
Agenda tonight. 
  [Buthelezi] Thanks very much.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has ruled 
out the possibility of another party joining the election. The 
chairman of the IEC, Mr. Justice Johann Kriegler, said in 
Johannesburg that if the CP [Conservative Party] reached an 
agreement on entering the election, the IEC would be prepared to 
count votes for the Freedom Front separately in some areas. An 
IEC spokesman added that by four o'clock this afternoon the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] had still not submitted its candidates 
lists.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] and the Conservative Party [CP] would 
not participate in the elections, right-wing leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg told a press conference in Pretoria on Thursday [21 
April]. He said the decision had been taken because the African 
National Congress and the government would not give guarantees 
that a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] would be created if the 
right- wing obtained sufficient support in the elections. He 
added that if the ANC and government reacted positively to the 
right-wing's preconditions, the AVF and CP would be prepared to 
negotiate about the matter. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the ANC's Carl Niehaus had said the 
rightwing would not be granted a volkstaat, whether it 
participated in the elections or not, while Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer's stance had been that he was 
not conversant with the content of possible agreements in this 
regard. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said these developments came after Freedom 
Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen asked the AVF and CP on 
Wednesday to participate in the election on a provincial level 
in order to prove support for the volkstaat. Dr Hartzenberg 
said he had told Gen Viljoen that, with no constitutional 
guarantee of a volkstaat and self-determination being granted if 
sufficient support emerged, it would not be possible to 
participate. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the FF should boycott the elections if 
these guarantees were not written into the constitution. The 
FF, AVF and CP could then put pressure on the government and ANC 
to grant the guarantees. 
  Gen Viljoen's decision to participate without these prior 
guarantees meant that he was signing away his right to 
self-determination and placed it in the hands of the SACP [South 
African Communist Party]/ANC, Dr Hartzenberg said. 
  Gen Viljoen was invited to attend the news conference but 
did 
not. 
  Asked what action the AVF would now take, Dr Hartzenmberg 
said they did not have specific plans, apart from following the 
"route of resistance", because they were not revolutionary. 
"That is why we formed the citizens councils to make our 
demands clear and to force our will on the incoming government." 
  He was unaware of AWB [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement] mobilisation plans to "secure" 
the [Orange] Free State and Transvaal. 
  State President F W de Klerk told a separate news conference 
in Pretoria it was too late for the rightwing to participate in 
the elections unless they did so under the FF's banner. There 
was no time for new constitutional negotiations. 
  Mr de Klerk understood that Dr Hartzenberg's requests were 
subject to preconditions which required further negotiations and 
this was logistically impossible. 
  The FF, in the meantime, said the following CP-controlled 
town councils had declared their support for the FF in the 
election: Ermelo, Middelburg, Secunda, Standerton, Witbank and 
Meyerton. Other councils were expected to follow, the FF's chief 
secretary, Joseph Chiole said.

  [Text] Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer said it is 
too late for the Conservative Party [CP] to participate in the 
elections. He addressed students at the University of 
Stellenbosch today. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Meyer said 
that CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could participate under the 
umbrella of the Freedom Front. 
  [Meyer] The reasons or conditions which he advances for 
participation are not practical. He said 800,000 votes must see 
to it that there is a volkstaat. There is no way that we will 
yield to that sort of condition for a volkstaat. The issue will 
have to be negotiated further. 
  [Van Zyl] In his speech to the students, Meyer castigated 
the 
Inkatha Freedom Party for its decision to join the elections at 
the last moment. 
  [Meyer] The decision by Inkatha to participate in fact came 
at a time when Inkatha realized that the election was not going 
to be postponed. 
  [Van Zyl] Meyer said he believed the election will be 
reasonably free and fair. He was optimistic about the new South 
Africa, and added that white South Africans should not feel 
uneasy, but should rather look forward to the future with 
anticipation and excitement. [end recording] 
  The ANC in its reaction rejected Dr. Hartzenberg's proposal 
that the principle of a volkstaat must be accepted if the right 
wing can attract 800,000 votes in the election. This 
organization's chief negotiator said at a news conference in 
Johannesburg that the interim constitution was already making 
provision for a volkstaat that will be able to make 
recommendations to the constituent assembly. 
  [Ramaphosa, in English] We do not believe that the proposal 
that has been put forward by Ferdi Hartzenberg is a proposal 
that we should take seriously. If Ferdi Hartzenberg wants to 
participate in the election, he is free to do so, and we would 
encourage him to be part of Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front. 
They should contest elections under that name, and we will meet 
them in Parliament. We will then be able to discuss the idea of 
a volkstaat more effectively. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Freedom Front leader General Constand </F>
Viljoen by Chris Whitfield and John Soderlund; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On the Freedom Front's [FF] late entry into the </H5>
election. 
  [Viljoen] Yes, we came in very late and it will certainly 
affect the final result. But we have been surprised by the 
positive reaction we have seen countrywide. People countrywide 
are very reluctant to vote for the NP [National Party] -- just 
about everybody, even the coloureds. Everybody is very 
uncertain about what the ANC is going to do. Somehow they think 
the Freedom Front will be that party which will be able to give 
guidance which might be of better quality than what they've had 
in the World Trade Centre between the NP and the ANC. I think 
everybody opposes the idea that we must give full autonomy to 
those two players. 
  They've worked together in the World Trade Centre, no doubt. 
They are going to work together again and they need a strong 
opposition. 
<H5>  On his party's support. </H5>
  [Viljoen] We were so late in registration that it is 
virtually impossible to make an estimation (but) we have had, so 
far, a very good attendance at our meetings. We attract full 
halls. People are very interested. What is also of great value 
to me is the fact that (when) many Afrikaners who resisted the 
idea of voting attend meetings and hear the explanation we give 
on why we are going for the vote, they accept. 
<H5>  On whether the FF will get 35 percent of the Afrikaner vote. </H5>
  [Viljoen] Sure. 
<H5>  On whether he would take a Cabinet seat if support exceeded </H5>
the required 5 percent. 
  [Viljoen] The FF is more constitutionally oriented than 
governability oriented. I haven't even thought of such a 
possibility. The major contribution we can make it to apply the 
principle of self-determination in order to find a real solution 
for the big problem of South Africa. We have come to the 
conclusion that SA has always had the wrong constitution, the 
only reason why it worked is because of the laws we had which 
put the white people in a position where they could suppress and 
where they could govern with all the means available. 
  We repeated the mistake in 1961 when we had the Republic 
established. We made a mistake with our policy of separate 
development in that. There was nothing wrong in creating a 
separate area for the Tswanas or the Zulus. But we made the 
mistake of forcing these people out of the system, totally on 
their own, without caring for a proper economy. This is the 
danger about the future too. Even in the (new) provincial 
system in SA, you will find that the different provinces will 
not be able to go for independent economies for each province. 
You will have to go for a united SA. And I think this is the 
problem with many of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] people 
too -- those people that think you can take the volkstaat out of 
SA and put a wall around it -- this is not on. So, when you 
think about a volkstaat, you should think about it as an area -- 
say a 10th area -- where you have, based on the principle of 
asymetry, special powers, in order to satisfy the principle of 
self-determination. 
  Economically, there will have to be negotiated agreements on 
how the total economy of SA will be a unitary economy. Not only 
of SA but we favour the idea of southern Africa. So, what do we 
want. We want political stability and satisfaction by 
accommodating the people according to their wishes. Let me 
quote you an example. You know the Zulus as well as I do. 
There's no way that the Zulu people will accept being subjected 
to Mr (Nelson) Mandela, who is regarded by them as a Xhosa. And 
its not good to say we are past that stage and this is racism 
again and ethnicity again. 
  It is a fact, it is a reality in SA, and we have to bear 
that 
in mind. Same thing with the Afrikaner people. Same thing with 
the other people too. Funny, you know, we are now the big 
propagandists for the idea of self-determination. When I 
arrived at the Cape we got this idea about the Cape Republic 
Movement. They approached me and said please, we are also 
looking for self-determination for the Cape, between the 
coloureds and the whites. Because they reckon they have built 
the Cape up to now. And they are being flooded by people being 
bussed in in order to manipulate the voting. Now they say the 
solution is to have self-determination. Even some of the other 
black states are catching on to this idea. 
  The point I am making is we have always had a basically 
wrong 
constitution in South Africa because it never really gave space 
to the accommodation of all people. And we believe, by applying 
the principle of self-determination for political autonomy 
within a territorial base. 
<H5>  On comments by Nelson Mandela that there will be no </H5>
volkstaat. 
  [Viljoen] He is electioneering. (Viljoen shows a 
hand-written letter from Mandela dated December 18 apparently 
giving in-principle support for the concept of 
self-determination). He and his whole national executive find 
acceptable that accord (on a volkstaat) that we never signed. 
That accord did say the concerns of self-determination must be 
addressed and it did say we must have joint teams that will work 
on this. What Mr Mandela is saying in the public is not really 
in line with what happens on a negotiations' level and I 
therefore think Mr Mandela has the wrong idea of a volkstaat. 
  The negotiation is done at the level of Mr (Thabo) Mbeki. 
Maybe he (Mandela) thinks this idea amounts to taking out the 
volkstaat, having its own economy, divorcing the rest of South 
Africa from the assistance that the Afrikaner can give, which is 
not what we have in mind. 
<H5>  On the constitutional principle making provision for a </H5>
volkstaat council. 
  [Viljoen] We negotiated the 34th principal. We are 
negotiating at the moment the accords that will reinforce the 
legislation and I would therefore not say we are not putting our 
faith in the Volkstaat Council, but this is the constitutional 
instrument created for this purpose. 
<H5>  On differences in strategy with other right-wingers. </H5>
  [Viljoen] If they can produce a volkstaat before April 27 
then I will consider leaving the voting. But if there is no 
volkstaat, then I would call on those people to vote for us. I 
have full respect for their views of the emotion of not voting 
in the election. But strategically, there is no other option. 
If we want to get...self-determination as soon as possible 
after April 27, if we want to work with the kwaZulu people in 
regard to the establishment of such an idea of 
self-determination, the best way for us to do it is to climb 
into the system. Because if you are in now you can always get 
out, but if you are out now you can never get in. 
<H5>  On whether IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] participation will </H5>
help the FF cause. 
  [Viljoen] There is one major difference between the Zulu 
people and the Afrikaner people: they have an area, a 
territory, we don't have a territory. The moment we have proved 
substantial support and the moment we have more or less 
identified the most suitable core area for the volkstaat, then 
the whole idea will run parallel and great advantage will exist 
between us. 
<H5>  On how long it may take to establish a volkstaat. </H5>
  [Viljoen] Within a month we will have a volkstaat council, 
(and) there is a constitutional provision for the fact that the 
whole of the provincial boundaries must be completed within 12 
months. 
<H5>  On forms of self-determination not based on territory. </H5>
  [Viljoen] No, we want to have a territory for the Afrikaner. 
We believe that is very important. What we also hope to do is 
supplement the idea of self-determination within the volkstaat 
with that of self-determination outside a volkstaat, not coupled 
to a specific area. 
  The way that we wish to do this is, if we can succeed in 
establishing community councils -- and we have gone a long way 
in the negotiations to get this accepted -- then, let us say 
from the provinces of the country, they can have five delegates 
per province, elected from the community councils and they can 
then be part of an advisory body to the volksraad [Afrikaner 
national council]. The other idea is the idea of cantons. Let 
us say we have a concentration of Afrikaners in the northern 
Cape that would like to be linked to the volkstaat, then maybe 
we can have a conton of them. They can, through a referendum, 
prove their desire for self-determination as a community, and 
they would be allowed to link up constitutionally with the 
volkstaat. So those are the three ideas: self-determination 
within the volkstaat, self-determination outside the volkstaat 
not coupled to the specific area but linked to the volkstaat, 
and then the idea of cantons. 
<H5>  On his future in government. </H5>
  [Viljoen] My main concern is a constitutional solution to 
South Africa. I have always been involved in security, I have 
always been involved with peacemaking. 
<H5>  On being a military man in the political field. </H5>
  [Viljoen] A completely different culture. The one thing that 
is common about this, though, is that if in battle you are given 
an objective, you get totally devoted to capturing that 
objective. The approach is that no matter what the sacrifices, 
you have to achieve your objective. I think the same with 
politics. Having decided on your objective, you get the same 
obsession. I think organisationally, the demands of what we are 
doing at the moment are as big. When you speak to me, you don't 
speak just on the political side. 
<H5>  On whether he believes a military option is still viable. </H5>
  [Viljoen] Of course, yes. Its always an option. I believe 
that strength is important in South Africa and I believe (in) 
self-defence ability, especially if you consider the 
vulnerability of our people within isolated farming areas, and 
so on. Remember the commando system, self-defence has been part 
of our culture ever since we faced the dangers of a new land. 
  I have never back-pedalled on the military option. I have 
always said that I will use all peaceful means available, and I 
have often said that I will have to satisfy my own integrity in 
this regard. I will have to be able to stand before God and say 
that I have tried all the other options. I don't believe that 
our solution can come from war. 
<H5>  On the effect of the toppling of Mangope in Bophuthatswana </H5>
on the Right. 
  [Viljoen] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] made a 
terrible mistake. It's such a pity because what happened to 
them is only discrediting. If you consider the rest of the 
undertaking it would have been a perfect success. As a matter 
of fact Mr (Lucas) Mangope might still today have been in power 
had the mess of the AWB not caused the revolt or the uprising 
(by Bophuthatswana troops). We were not going to make use of the 
AWB, we were specifically requested not to bring the AWB because 
it was mentioned to me that the presence of the AWB might bring 
resistance from inside. 
<H5>  On his present relationship with the AWB. </H5>
  [Viljoen] We have broken the relationship. I have often 
found in the past that whenever we make use of the AWB, for some 
or other reason we land up being discredited. I don't believe 
that we ca have joint operations of great importance. And I am 
referring to, if necessary, military operations. It is very 
important in military operations that we should exercise 
discipline and restraint.

<F P=106> [Report by C Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 21 SAPA -- An upbeat Clarence Makwetu 
took the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] election trail to Durban 
on Thursday [21 April] night, promising free housing and land to 
the deprived masses. Addressing Indian businessmen in 
Shallcross, south of Durban, Mr Makwetu urged business to 
support his organisation in the interests of democracy "unless 
you want to see a one-party state emerge". 
  He said there was no chance of an alliance between the 
African National Congress and the PAC as there were elements in 
the ANC that were not committed to democracy. "We urge an 
attitude of change. We hope to gain material support from you." 
  On perceptions that the PAC was a racist political 
organisation, Mr Makwetu said his party was not against whites 
but against white domination. Membership of the PAC "is and has 
always been open to all human beings. To say it is open to 
(black) Africans only is nonsense". "One's skin colour will not 
buy leadership in our organisation." 
  He reiterated that the PAC stood for the redistribution of 
land from privileged landowners to the rural masses. "The 
problem stems from deprivation of land and from concentration of 
land. Those who control the land control the people." He said 
a programme of restitution had to involve land ownership in 
order to aid suitable rural development, but he cautioned that 
no land reform programme was possible without government 
co-operation. PAC strategy was to utilise land to its optimum. 
Mr Makwetu warned that any other approach would unleash a 
"torrential force the likes of which none of us has seen". 
  Clarifying the PAC's stance on "Africans" Mr Makwetu said 
anyone who owed allegiance to the land and believed in the PAC's 
principles could be regarded as African. "We believe there is 
only one race -- the human race." 
  The slogan "one settler, one bullet" was not PAC policy but 
merely a slogan of the armed struggle which the PAC had 
abandoned. It would take some time for the slogan to disappear. 
He suggested that "settler" was not a PAC word but one derived 
from whites themselves. "In Grahamstown there is the 1820 
settlers monument. The road to Cape Town's airport is called 
Settlers Way and a small town outside Pretoria is called 
Settlers."

<F P=106> [Report by J Rees] </F>
  [Text] Phuthaditjhaba April 21 SAPA -- Thousands of people 
braved icy weather to see African National Congress President 
Nelson Mandela at a waterlogged rally in QwaQwa on Thursday [21 
April]. The ANC president's light aircraft from Bloemfontein to 
Phuthaditjhaba was diverted to Harrismith to avoid the 
cloudburst and hailstorm over QwaQwa. Youths at 
Phuthaditjhaba's T K Mopeli Stadium tore down a brass bust of 
the late Chief Charles N Mopeli -- kicking and stoning it. 
  Mr Mandela made a powerful appeal for reconciliation and 
national unity, telling cheering supporters he would not 
tolerate lawlessness after the election. He guaranteed farmers 
and business people that they would not be the victims of 
violence, looting or dispossession in his lifetime. "I condemn 
the lawlessness and anyone who breaks the law will be dealt with 
harshly." 
  At an earlier meeting in Thaba Nchu, the capital of what was 
once a fragment of Bophuthatswana, Mr Mandela said it was proper 
that the ANC should take the lead in getting people to accept 
the spirit of reconciliation and to work for it. He urged 
people to support the Police and Army in the former homeland of 
Bophuthatswana, saying they were needed to maintain law and 
order. "It is your duty to go to every policeman and soldier 
and say `Let bygones be bygones. Let us work together to build 
our country'." 
  The ANC leader spent the day mobbed by photographers who 
clashed with ANC bodyguards, one of whom threatened to "blow the 
head off" an international news photographer. 
  Mr Mandela urged people to celebrate the ANC's election 
victory next week in a manner that would boost confidence in the 
organisation. He repeated his call for unity throughout the 
day, quoting himself from after his 1963 treason trial: "I have 
fought white domination just as I have fought black domination. 
After 27 years in jail, 20 grandchildren and three 
great-grandchildren, do you think I could come back and allow 
any political party to divide our people." 
  He ordered the crowd not to attack farmers or business 
people. 
  Thursday's weather made Mr Mandela six hours late for a 
fundraising lunch in Phuthaditjhaba, but about 200 business 
people waited patiently until after dark to hear that the 
government gravy train was over. Mr Mandela pledged to take a 
cut in salary and to start paying tax if he was elected 
president. "How can a president commit himself to the 
reconstruction of this country if he doesn't pay tax," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 22 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela interrupted trading activities 
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange [JSE] on Friday [22 April], 
assuring members of the bourse there would be economic stability 
under a new government. "It is our concern to restore economic 
stability in the country," he said in a 15 minute speech. "We 
have called on our people to end mass action." 
  Mr Mandela said the ANC's Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP] would seek to meet the needs of the people, who 
were forced in the past to resort to mass action to ensure their 
demands were attended to. He said the RDP was a massive 
programme but would go a long way towards securing stability. 
Business had a vital role to play in this programme and 
building the country's future strength economically. The 
government would create a legislative environment based on free 
enterprise so commerce could thrive. "The JSE has an important 
role to play in the reconstruction and development of our 
country. We say the economy of the country must be built on 
sound market principles. If you look at our programme there's 
not a single sentence about nationalisation," he told the 300 
brokers on the JSE floor. 
  Mr Mandela's speech was greeted by muted applause from the 
traders, despite his assurance the market was vital to raising 
new and substantial capital. However, on his way to the 
executive offices of the JSE to meet with JSE President Roy 
Andersen, the ANC leader was cheered by brokerage messengers and 
other staff.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>
  [Text] The African National Congress has removed the name 
of Nelson Ramodike, the chief minister of Lebowa, from its list 
of national candidates for next week's election. We approached 
him for his response to this development: 
  [Ramodike] The leader of COSATU [Congress of South African 
Trade Unions], Mr. Sam Shilowa, approached me over the weekend 
and we had a private talk at the ranch hotel, and he requested 
me to withdraw from the national list of the African National 
Congress because the ANC regional executive council under the 
chairmanship of the premier candidate of the African National 
Congress, Mr. Ngoako Ramatlhodi, said their followers are not 
satisfied that my name is placed on the national list. He 
accused me of having allowed my colleague, Mr. Lawrence Mokhudu 
Ledwaba, to register United People's Front [UPF] for election 
purposes. I explained that it is my profound policy, and it is 
on the other hand a democratic right for each and every person, 
each and every political party, to take part in the elections. 
  [Correspondent Angie Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, but at this 
stage, you are apparently going to be taken off the list. What 
are your plans now? 
  [Ramodike] Well, my party, the United People's Front, has 
already demanded that I should come back and we forge ahead 
together for campaigns in the Northern Tranvaal region. 
  [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, I take it then that you intend 
returning to the UPF? 
  [Ramodike] Well, that is a demand and the request by our 
political organization, that if the ANC followers in the 
Northern Transvaal are not satisfied with me for problems that 
are here in the Northern Transvaal, especially administrative 
problems, then they are welcoming me back to United People's 
Front. 
  [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, looking at administrative 
problems, 
the TEC also announced today that it was going to appoint two 
executive directors to govern Lebowa before and during the 
elections. What are your reactions to that? 
  [Ramodike] I rejoice; the people of Lebowa rejoice. The 
cabinet of Lebowa welcome the decision taken by the TEC upon our 
request, and we indeed feel very much gratified that Mr. Fourie 
should pull out of Lebowa and in his place, or in the place of 
task teams, the executive directors be appointed.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] will appoint two executive directors in the 
self-governing territory of Lebowa, it decided on Thursday [21 
April]. African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril 
Ramaphosa said the executive directors would oversee the 
finances, services and rationalisation of the Lebowa 
administration. 
  The executive council said tension and lawlessness were 
mounting in Lebowa and there had been several deaths. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the directors would interact with the 
government of Lebowa Chief Minister Mr Nelson Ramodike. They 
would take over financial control from the Department of 
Regional and Land affairs, he said. The department has been 
running Lebowa's finances since irregularities were uncovered in 
October last year. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the administrations of the self-governing 
territories would lapse on April 27. The Executive Council's 
action would assist the re-integration of Lebowa and its 
administration with the Northern Transvaal region. 
  He rejected criticism that Mr Ramodike was receiving better 
treatment than homeland leaders opposed to the ANC. 
  The Executive Council resolution was backed by the 
government.

  [Text] Our series of interviews with top political party 
leaders continues today with the discussion with the state 
president and leader of the National Party [NP], F.W. de Klerk. 
Shiphiwo Mogoda asked Mr. De Klerk for his thoughts on the 
televised debate which was held last week? 
  [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I feel that overall the debate 
was good for South Africa. It had two sides; the one side was 
the party political side, and I feel that the National Party's 
cause has firstly not been harmed by the debate, I think it has 
been advanced by the debate. But it had another side, which was 
also important, and that is that the two leaders of the two 
biggest parties in South Africa were seen by all South Africans 
and the whole world as being able to debate in a civilized 
manner, and when it came to the interests of the country, that 
they will be capable of rising above their differences and 
working together in a government of national unity in the best 
interests of all the people. 
  [Mogoda] Mr. President, what has caused you to cry, or let 
me 
put is this way, to laugh, if necessary, in all these things 
that have happened during your rule? 
  [De Klerk] What makes me happy, what makes me buoyant, is my 
confidence in the future, is the achievement of what I have set 
out to achieve -- the achievement of free and fair elections for 
all South Africans, the achievement of a new South Africa being 
born, which I worked for from the very moment when I was elected 
as leader of the National Party. I am thankful that I was able 
-- and I am not saying this in a holier than thou attitude -- to 
really keep all the promises that I made. Originally people 
said talk is cheap, but money buys the whisky: Is he really 
going to do it? Is the National Party really going to do all 
these things that it has set out to do? And we've done it! 
  What makes me cry is the violence. It is the one thing which 
I would have liked to see different. I sincerely believed that 
when we reached agreements, when a new constitution was agreed 
upon, when we focused all South Africans on participation in the 
election, that the political violence would abate and would come 
to an end. Maybe the lack of inclusivity, with Inkatha standing 
out until so recently, was one of the main causes why it didn't 
stop or abate. But now they are in and I am praying everyday 
that that will now make a big contribution to really bringing 
the tension and the violence and the confrontation to an end. 
  [Mogoda] President, what do you think is the most exciting 
thing about you since you entered politics? What I mean is 
that, what do you like most about yourself since you entered 
politics? 
  [De Klerk] I am not a vain man. That is the most difficult 
question I've had in this whole election campaign to answer. 
Let me rather say, what do I like most about that which I 
represent in politics? I like the commitment of my party, the 
honesty of my party, the courage which my party had to also 
admit mistakes and to change that which was wrong. I am proud 
of the way in which my party has changed and has become a party 
for all the people of South Africa, representing all the 
population groups, the most nonracial party participating in 
this election. 
  [Mogoda] You refer to your new National Party as somewhat an 
overhauled party. It's not an old one. Now, are you maybe 
trying to convince people that a leopard can change its spots? 
  [De Klerk] Yes. I think it is a very shallow saying that a 
leopard can't change its spots, because we are not dealing with 
the skin. We are dealing with the heart, and too much emphasis 
is being put on skin and color in South Africa. What is in your 
heart is what counts; it is warmth, it is caring for the needs 
of the people, it is that you have succeeded to remove racism 
from your pattern of thinking. Yes, we have a new heart in the 
National Party. 
  [Mogoda] Well, another question. Some of your opponents, I 
would say, have accused you of having intervened to stop your 
son from marrying a colored girl in Cape Town sometime. I have 
never heard you commenting on this. Now is your time. 
  [De Klerk] I have at all times with regard to that taken the 
viewpoint that my son is an adult. He must make a choice, and I 
have no color prejudice in my mind. I am not a racist. Parents 
are concerned about whether the choice of a son or a daughter is 
the right one. In this case my son's decision not to marry was 
his own. 
  [Mogoda] Well, Mr. President, there have also been reports 
that a number of white people are stockpiling for fear of the 
aftermath of elections. What does this indicate to you? 
  [De Klerk] I think many of them have fallen prey to media 
reports and speculations which gave rise to a little bit of 
panic. I don't share the analysis that we will have vast 
disruptions after the election. I think we will have some 
festivity. Some parties might be very quiet and licking their 
wounds, but generally speaking I think apart from the 
festivities we will return very soon to normal. The public is 
tired of politics. They want a little bit of relaxation again 
on their television screens. They don't want to be inundated 
with political propaganda all the time, and I think the whole 
country is really looking forward to get the election behind us 
now so that we can resume our ordinary normal lives and really, 
I see no cause for grave concern. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by S Denny] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- The Federal Party [FP] 
stands for maximum devolution of power, direct democracy and 
entrenched fundamental freedoms. Releasing its election 
manifesto in Johannesburg on Thursday [21 April], the FP said 
devolution forced local governments to compete for investment 
and workers. "Devolution of power will reduce political 
violence, which is caused by centralisation of the past and 
centralisation entrenched in the interim constitution," the 
party's leader Frances Kendall said. The FP believed central 
government should have power only over matters of national 
interest, including national defence, foreign affairs, foreign 
trade, national trade and the protection of entrenched 
fundamental rights. 
  Resolving the land issue was South Africa's toughest 
challenge, Ms Kendall said, adding it was important not to abuse 
property rights further. "A land court should address specific 
claims and compensation. All government-owned land and housing 
should be transferred to private ownership with freehold title. 
Legislation which protects inefficient farmers and prevents 
sub-division of land should be repealed," she said. 
  Calling for voucher systems for the poor and for education, 
the FP manifesto said these would be used to subsidise rent or 
to buy homes or for education. 
  A bill of rights should be entrenched without a "limitation" 
clause and should protect people from an abusive government. 
The current constitution allowed government to suspend the bill 
of rights "when it is needed most -- under a state of emergency". 
  South Africa's new constitutional court was elitist and 
should be abolished, the party said. "Ordinary courts should 
interpret and apply the constitution and every person should 
have the right to trial by jury."

  [Text] Cape Town April 22 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP] 
has predicted a voter turn-out of 80 per cent in the Western 
Cape in next week's elections and that, as of Friday, 30 per 
cent of voters are still undecided on party preference. The 
party's Western Cape premiership candidate Mr Hennie Bester 
released the projections, based on his and his team's 
campaigning in the province over the past months, at a press 
briefing on Friday morning. 
  They had found that up to 40 per cent of voters could be 
affected by intimidation, either on party choice or on whether 
to vote, and that parties had not had free access to up to 30 
per cent of the electorate. Seventy per cent of voters, they 
found, were in a sufficient state of election readiness in terms 
of documentation and knowledge of the electoral process. Forty 
per cent of the province's voters had a general understanding of 
parliamentary democracy and the political system generally, and 
the same percentage was sufficiently informed about manifestos, 
candidates and culture of political parties. The large number 
not sufficiently informed about the latter aspect could lead to 
a significant percentage of misplaced votes, Mr Bester said. 
Insufficient knowlege about voting procedures and systems could 
result in 15 per cent of ballots being spoilt.

  [Text] Pretoria April 22 SAPA -- It was important members 
of the security forces should be able to carry out their duties 
without fear of being prosecuted for political crimes after the 
elections, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela 
said on Friday [22 April]. Mr Mandela was speaking after a 
meeting with President F W de Klerk at the Union Buildings, 
Pretoria, to discuss indemnity for those who committed political 
crimes and the franchise for prisoners. The ANC wanted the 
security services to be committed to their duties without fear 
of facing prosecutions for political crimes after the elections, 
he added. 
  Mr Mandela said he and Mr de Klerk also exchanged views on 
prisoners being allowed to vote. Mr de Klerk said on Thursday 
he would probably decide on the issue on Friday. Mr Mandela 
said: "We are more or less looking at the problem from the same 
angle."

  [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] on Thursday [21 April] said it would 
send 20 mobile stations to dispense temporary voter cards at 
hostels across The Reef on Friday. IEC Chairman Mr Justice 
Johann Kriegler told a press briefing in Johannesburg the 
commission would set up voting stations at hostels on April 27 
and 28. 
  IEC Monitoring Director Peter Harris said an additional 1.2 
million temporary voter cards had been sent to the Transkei for 
voters in outlying areas. About 1.3 million cards had been 
issued so far, he said. 
  Mr Harris said the IEC had held "a successful election dummy 
run" to see if it was ready for the real event. About 11,000 
monitors had been deployed at voting stations countrywide 
between 4AM and 9AM. The aim had been to see if the commission 
could get its monitors in the field, he said. 
  The trial had been successful, although there were some 
transport and telecommunication problems in a few regions. The 
reaction time in Natal had been slow, but would improve. Some 
retraining of monitors was necessary, he added. 
  The IEC has received an additional R1.4 million [rand] from 
the Norwegian Government for voter education programmes in 
Natal, in conjunction with the United States-based South Africa 
Free Election Fund, which has deployed 25,000 [figure as 
received] monitors in the field, at Home Affairs offices and at 
magistrate's courts. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said it was doubtful if voter education 
in Natal would reach the same level as elsewhere in the country.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has 
denied that the ballot papers for the elections next week will 
be numbered. The IEC said in a statement that the counterfoil of 
the ballot paper had a serial number, but that there was no mark 
on the ballot paper itself. It said that no inscription would 
be made on the counterfoil by an electoral officer. The voter 
would have his knuckles sprayed with invisible ink, and his 
document marked with invisible ink to control voting.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] would start "a major voter education 
blitz" in Natal on Thursday [21 April] to reassure voters about 
the voting procedure after agreement on the addition of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party's sticker on ballot papers. IEC Voter 
Education Director Albert Mokoena said that with the exception 
of no-go areas, the commission's voter education programme had 
exposed most people to the voting procedure. 
  "It does not matter how many parties appear on the voting 
paper," he said. 
  IEC electoral administration training division head Kumi 
Naidoo said electoral officers would affix the sticker to ballot 
papers at a "supplies desk" before the papers were handed to 
voters at national and regional "issuing desks". 
  The IEC would require an additional staff member at each 
voting station to cope with putting the stickers on ballot 
papers, but was confident this could be achieved within the 
short time before elections next week. 
  Mr Naidoo said positive feedback had been received from 
Natal, where about 600 electoral officers each with a staff of 
25 were now needed. People who had previously been hesitant to 
come forward, were volunteering, he said. 
  The IEC expected to set up more than 9,000 voting stations 
countrywide, Mr Naidoo added.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
20 April] 
  [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] has 
established a number of counting centres around the country, 
each of which so positioned and allocated to count approximately 
60,000 papers. Naturally, counting centres serving smaller 
rural areas will serve more voting stations than those in 
larger, urban areas. 
  Security--both within and around the counting centres, will 
be of prime importance, and access to counting centres will be 
restricted--against positive identification--to certain IEC 
personnel, IEC monitors, party voting agents, local and 
international observers and one candidate from each registered 
political party. 
  On the morning of April 29 (the day after close of 
voting)--all "packages"--ballot boxes, parcels and other items 
sealed at voting stations--will be delivered to their allocated 
counting centres, accompanied in transit by at least two IEC 
officials, or one IEC official and an official or international 
observer. The additional presence of an IEC monitor where 
possible is being encouraged. 
  The counting officer at the counting centre will, in the 
presence of another IEC official and any other interested 
parties who have access to the station, inspect the seals on the 
packages. 
  The counting officer will then instruct the two designated 
IEC officials to separate the packages into those for provincial 
votes, and those for national. These will then be taken to 
separate national or provincial "bins" or holding areas for each 
voting station, and further separated into the three days of 
voting -- April 26,27 and 28. 
  This procedure will be followed until all of the packages 
from all of the voting stations allocated to a counting centre 
have been received. 
  Eighteen reconciliation tables -- nine for provincial votes, 
and nine for national votes -- will be positioned in each 
counting centre, each group of three tables processing votes for 
each of the three voting days in each category. Each of these 
tables will have an IEC official assigned to it, and a further 
two IEC official will supervise the overall reconciliation 
process. 
  Packages will then be allocated from the bins to available 
reconciliation tables, three voting stations at a time (one for 
each set of three reconciliation tables). The IEC official at 
each table will break the seals on the ballot boxes, and place 
the ballot papers on the table before showing any interested 
parties that the box is empty. He or she will then count and 
record the number of ballot papers on the table, in small 
batches of twenty, clipped together in batches of 100 papers. 
  In any one of the ballot boxes from a particular voting 
station will also be the statement prepared by the voting 
station presiding officer, detailing the number of votes cast on 
a particular voting day at that station. 
  The IEC station reconciliation supervisor will be called 
upon 
to check the presiding officer's statement against that of the 
IEC counting station officer. If the figures do not agree 
(after checking addition calculations on both forms) a recount 
will be ordered and undertaken until the total after two 
identical and consecutive counts agree with each other. 
  If this total differs from the presiding officer's statement 
by less than 0.5 per cent or one vote -- whichever is the 
greater -- the reconciliation will be regarded as being in order. 
  If the margin is greater than this, the supervisor will 
comply with the instructions of the IEC's chief director, 
administration. 
  Any and all irregularities -- no matter how great or small 
-- 
will however be reported to the IEC chief director, 
administration, on completion of the counting process. 
  On completion of the reconciliation, ballot papers will be 
returned to ballot boxes, sealed by the counting supervisor, 
have the reconciliation statement stuck to the boxes and taken 
to a further holding area to await counting. 
  The counting proper -- by political party -- begins at this 
stage. Boxes containing no more than 3,000 papers are delivered 
to a counting table, where the allocated IEC official again 
checks the seals before breaking these and removing the contents 
and proving that the box is empty. 
  All packets containing ballot papers without the relevant 
voting station stamp, those cancelled by the voting station 
presiding officer as being marked by mistake or inadvertently 
spoiled at the voting station, as well as used and 
partially-used ballot books returned by the voting station will 
then be placed in one of the ballot boxes, together with the 
counting station reconciliation form(s), and sealed under 
supervision. 
  The remaining ballot papers left on the counting table are 
then held up -- one at a time -- and shown to the party voting 
agents, monitors and observers present. If the mark on the 
paper is clearly identifiable as being in support of a certain 
party, the official will call out the name of that party, and 
hand the paper to one of the five IEC official controlling the 
party allocation tables, where piles of votes for each party are 
assembled. 
  If the mark is not clearly identifiable as being in support 
of a particular party, it will be put aside and treated as a 
disputed ballot paper after processing the other papers in that 
batch. 
  Disputed papers will then again be held up one at a time to 
party voting agents, monitors and observers, and the supervisor 
will announce his or her decision on whether to accept or reject 
each one. In the case of acceptance, the supervisor will give 
his or her decision on the party selected. 
  If this decision is accepted, the supervisor will hand the 
paper to one of the five party allocation table officials, who 
will add it to the pile for that particular party. If the 
supervisor's decision is rejected by party voting agents, the 
paper will be marked as "disputed and counted/rejected" on its 
reverse and kept separately. 
  Each of the officials at the party allocation tables will 
then count and record the ballots in each of the party piles to 
which they have been allocated -- again in small clips of twenty 
papers collated into batches of 100 papers. 
  "Disputed and counted" and "disputed and rejected" papers 
will also be counted, clipped and batched as above, and a 
separate record kept of these tallies. 
  Officials at each party allocation tables will them swop 
positions under the direction of the supervisor, and the 
counting and recording at each table will be repeated. Finally, 
the official at the counting table who did not participate in 
the previous party allocation counts will again count and record 
the results. 
  This process will be repeated until the results of two 
consecutive counts are identical in every respect. 
  Full results of the count -- including rejected ballots -- 
are recorded on a batch tally form, and the supervisor will read 
out the result and ask any party voting agents present to sign 
this form. 
  Should there be a dispute, and provided the party voting 
agent has solid grounds for the dispute, a re-count may be 
ordered. 
  Once the form is signed by the party voting agents, it will 
be regarded as being accepted, and no further appeal will be 
entertained by the IEC. Copies of the signed batch tally forms 
will be available to all party voting agents. 
  The counting table officials will then assemble the 
different 
categories of ballots into packets, each of which will be sealed 
and returned to empty ballot boxes, together with the batch 
tally forms. The ballot boxes are once again sealed and removed 
to a holding area. 
  The counting officer will convey results of the batch tally 
forms to the IEC media centre in Johannesburg. 
  All material pertaining to the count-ballot papers, stubs 
unused papers, reports and forms -- will them be assembled in a 
holding area at the counting centre. The counting officer will 
request that all people other than the required IEC officers 
leave the centre, and will secure the centre to his or her 
satisfaction until arrangements are made for delivery of the 
material to the IEC's chief director, administration.

  [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] said on Thursday 
[21 April] it had initiated a strategy to secure the Transvaal 
and Orange Free State as a base against a future communist 
government. According to a statement by the AWB's General Staff 
"thousands of members of the AWB are already busy moving into 
the area". 
  This was to ensure sufficient manpower was mustered to ward 
off any persecution or action against right-wingers by a future 
communist government. 
  The generals warned that the "so-called peace" which had 
been 
found between the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African 
National Congress would not last. "The fact that the IFP has 
now been drawn into the elections will definitely be an 
opportunity for conflict and confrontation between the ANC and 
the whole Zulu nation," the statement said. 
  The Zulu population, as the biggest single group in the 
country, would never accept the outcome of the elections when 
the ANC obtained the majority of votes. "The war between the 
IFP and the ANC will then intensify. South Africa will be 
plunged into a bloodbath." 
  The AWB declared that under no circumstances would it be 
part 
of the elections. It still regarded the April 26-28 poll as 
illegal and it therefore had no confidence in the future 
government. "The General Staff and the Executive Council have 
therefore decided to protect members of the organisation and the 
Boervolk [Boer nation] against the chaos, uprising and 
revolution which will follow," said the statement. 
  It defined the territory which it had declared as its "base, 
secure territory" as stretching from "Northern Transvaal to the 
Cape border." Thousands of AWB members were already busy moving 
into the area to ensure that sufficient manpower was mustered 
against a communist threat. 
  Right-wing sources confirmed they were aware of AWB 
mobilisation plans, with most activity centred on the Western 
Transvaal. 
  Neither AWB leader Eugene Terre'blanche nor Gen Nico 
Prinsloo, normally the only people authorised to speak to the 
press from their Ventersdorp headquarters, were available for 
comment on Thursday afternoon. 
  Their Johannesburg-based spokesman, Fred Rundle, was not 
available.

<H5>  INTRODUCTION </H5>
  In the light of a vast number of comments received in many 
forms on the Draft Bill of Rights prepared by the Constitutional 
Committee of the ANC, this new text has been prepared. 
  NOTE:The notes are intended to draw 
attention to controversial areas--they do not form part of the 
text. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 1. EQUALITY </H5>
  (1) All South Africans are born free and equal in 
dignity and rights. 
  (2) No individual or group shall receive privileges or 
be subjected to discrimination, domination or abuse on the 
grounds of race, colour, language, gender, or creed, political 
or other opinion, birth or other status. 
  (3) All men and women shall have equal protection under 
the law. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 2. PERSONAL RIGHTS </H5>
<H5>  The Right to Life </H5>
  (1) Every person has the right to life. 
  (2) No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her 
life. 
  (3) Capital punishment is abolished and no further 
executions shall take place. 
  NOTE:The question has been raised as to 
whether the use of the phrase `right to life' indicates an 
anti-abortion position in the Constitution. In our view, the 
issue is left open in this clause. We feel the matter should be 
left open for legislative action after democratic discussion in 
future. The issue needs sensitive and informed debate with 
extensive participation by all interested parties and a respect 
for differing views. Uninformed debate could be extremely 
divisive and distract attention from the basic question of equal 
political rights. The Constitution should not in any way 
pre-empt proper debate. We regard the issue as of great 
importance and would recommend that it receive high priority as 
soon as democratic institutions are in place. 
<H5>  The Right to Dignity </H5>
  (4) No-one shall be subjected to slavery, servitude or 
forced labour, provided that forced labour shall not include 
work normally required of someone carrying out a sentence of a 
court, nor military service or national service by a 
conscientious objector, nor services required in the case of 
calamity or serious emergency, nor any work which forms part of 
normal civil obligations. 
  (5) The dignity of all persons shall be respected. 
  (6) No-one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
  (7) Everyone shall have the right to appropriate 
protection by law against violence, harassment or abuse, or the 
impairment of his or her dignity. 
<H5>  The Right to a Fair Trial </H5>
  (8) No-one shall be deprived of his or her liberty except 
after due process of law, and the courts shall have the right to 
order the release of any person held without due legal 
authority. 
  (9) There shall be no detention without trial, banishment 
or house-arrest. Legislation may provide for legitimate 
restriction of movement in relation to illegal immigrants and 
persons of unsound mind. 
  (10) No persons shall be arrested or detained for any 
purpose other than that of bringing them to trial on a criminal 
charge. 
  (11) Arrest shall take place according to procedures laid 
down by law, and persons taken into custody shall immediately be 
informed of the charges against them, shall have access to a 
legal representative of their choice, and shall be brought 
before court within 48 hours or, where that would be a Sunday or 
a public holiday, on the first working day thereafter. 
  (12) Bail shall be granted to awaiting-trial persons 
unless a court rules that in the interests of justice they 
should be kept in custody. 
  (13) No-one shall be deprived of liberty or subjected to 
other punishment except after a fair trial by an independent 
court. 
  (14) Trials shall take place within a reasonable time. 
  (15) Everyone shall be presumed innocent until proved 
guilty. 
  (16) No conduct shall be punished if it was not a 
criminal offence at the time of its occurrence, and no penalty 
shall be increased retrospectively. 
  (17) No-one shall be tried or punished twice for the same 
offence. 
  (18) Accused persons shall be informed in writing of the 
nature of the allegations against them, and shall be given 
adequate time to prepare and conduct their defence. 
  (19) Everything that is reasonable shall be done to 
ensure that accused persons understand the nature and the import 
of the charges against them and of the proceedings, that they 
are not prejudiced through illiteracy or lack of understanding, 
and that they receive a fair trial. 
  (20) Accused persons shall have the right to challenge 
all evidence presented against them, to be defended by a legal 
practitioner of their choice, and if in custody, to have access 
to a legal practitioner at all reasonable times. 
  (21) If a person is unable to pay for legal 
representation, and the interests of justice so require, the 
State shall provide or pay for a competent defence. 
  (22) No persons shall be required to give evidence 
against themselves, nor, except in cases of domestic violence or 
abuse, shall persons be required to give evidence against their 
spouses, whether married by civil law or custom, their parents 
or their children. 
  (23) No evidence obtained through torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment shall be admissible in any 
proceedings. 
  (24) Juveniles shall be separated from adult offenders. 
  (25) Punishment imposed by any Court shall be humane and 
any term of imprisonment shall be reviewed periodically. 
<H5>  The Right to Judicial Review </H5>
  (26) Any person adversely affected in his or her rights, 
entitlements or legitimate expectations by an administrative or 
executive act shall be entitled to have the matter reviewed by 
an independent court or tribunal on the grounds of irregularity, 
including abuse of authority, going beyond the powers granted by 
law, bad faith, or such (gross) unreasonableness in relation to 
the procedure or the decision as to amount to manifest 
injustice. 
  NOTE:This clause will in all likelihood have 
to be revised in the light of recommendations of the workshop, 
held in Cape Town early in 1993, on the future of the 
Administrative law and also after further discussions. 
<H5>  The Right to Home Life </H5>
  (27) No-one shall be deprived of or removed from his or 
her home on the grounds of race, colour, language, gender or 
creed. 
  (28) The privacy of the home shall be respected, save 
that reasonable steps shall be permitted to prevent domestic 
violence or abuse. 
  (29) People shall have the right to establish families, 
live together with partners of their choice and to marry. 
  (30) Marriage shall be based upon the free consent of the 
partners, and spouses shall enjoy equal rights at and during the 
marriage and on its dissolution. 
  NOTE:Many people marry by ante-nuptial 
contract, and thereby create separate property regimes for the 
husband and wife. Should this situation be over-ridden by the 
above clause? Should there be specific reference to possible 
legislation on matrimonial property taking into account a just 
distribution on termination of the marriage [union]? 
<H5>  The Right of Privacy </H5>
  (31) No search or entry shall be permitted except for 
reasonable cause, as prescribed by law, and as would be 
acceptable in an open and democratic society. 
  (32) Interference with private communications, spying on 
persons and the compilation and keeping of secret files about 
them without their consent, shall not be permissible save as 
authorised by law in circumstances that would be acceptable in 
an open and democratic society. 
<H5>  The Right of Movement </H5>
  (33) All South Africans shall have the right without 
discrimination to move freely and reside in any part of the 
country, to receive a passport, travel abroad and to emigrate if 
he or she so wishes. 
<H5>  The Right to Conscience </H5>
  (34) The right to conscience shall be inviolate, and 
no-one shall be penalised for his or her beliefs. 
  (35) No-one shall be required to bear arms or perform 
military service against his or her conscientious beliefs. 
  NOTE: The question of whether there should 
be conscription is left open. There are strong arguments for and 
against the concept of serving in the armed forces as a 
constitutionally acceptable duty. In any case, the right of 
conscientious objection should be respected. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 3. POLITICAL RIGHTS </H5>
  (1) South Africa shall be a multi-party democracy in 
which all citizens shall enjoy basic political rights on an 
equal basis. 
  NOTE: Is it necessary to include the word 
`citizens'? Should we not return to the earlier formulation: 
`all men and women'? 
  (2) Government at all levels shall be subject to the 
principles of accountability to the electorate. 
  (3) Elections shall be conducted in accordance with an 
electoral law which shall make no distinction on the grounds of 
race, colour, language, gender or creed. 
  (4) Elections shall be regular, free and fair and based 
on universal franchise and a common voters' roll. 
  (5) All men and women entitled to vote shall be entitled 
to stand for and occupy any position or office in any organ of 
government or administration. 
  (6) All citizens shall have the right to form and join 
political parties and to campaign for social, economic and 
political change, either directly or through freely chosen 
representatives. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 4. FREEDOM OF SPEECH, ASSEMBLY AND INFORMATION </H5>
  (1) There shall be freedom of thought, speech, expression 
and opinion, including a free press, which shall report and 
comment fairly and respect the right to reply. 
  NOTE: Should there be a qualification on 
honest and fair reporting and comment, or would this appear to 
open the way for impinging unduly on freedom of the press? 
  (2) All men and women shall have the right to assemble 
peacefully and without arms, and to submit petitions for the 
redress of grievances and injustices. 
  (3) All men and women shall be entitled to all the 
information necessary to enable them to make effective use of 
their rights as citizens, workers or consumers. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 5. RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION, RELIGION, LANGUAGE AND </H5>
CULTURE 
<H5>  Freedom of Association </H5>
  (1) There shall be freedom of association, including the 
right to form and join trade unions, religious, residents, 
students, and social and cultural bodies, and to form and 
participate in non-governmental organisations. 
  (2) Legislation shall provide for the right of such 
associations to be heard in appropriate cases before any action 
is taken or measures proposed by any public or private body 
which could directly affect the interest of members of the 
association. 
  NOTE: This is an entirely new constitutional 
provision designed to give some measure of protection to organs 
of civil society, such as religious, cultural or language 
bodies, residents' associations or trade unions. 
<H5>  Freedom of Religion </H5>
  (3) There shall be freedom of worship and tolerance of 
all religions, and no State or official religion shall be 
established. 
  (4) The institutions of religion shall be separate from 
the State, but nothing in this Constitution shall prevent them 
from cooperating with the State with a view to furthering the 
objectives of this Constitution, nor from bearing witness and 
commenting on the actions of the State. 
  (5) Places associated with religious observance shall be 
respected, and no-one shall be barred from entering them on 
grounds of race. 
  Language Rights 
  (6) The languages of South Africa are, in alphabetical 
order Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swati, Tsonga, 
Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. 
  NOTE: This proposal has been widely 
commented on. Many countries do not have an official language or 
official languages. In some countries, such as Ireland, the 
official language is hardly ever used, though its existence has 
considerable meaning for the inhabitants. We feel that language 
rights should be general, so that languages presently 
discriminated against shall have a higher status without 
down-grading English and Afrikaans. Sub-section 9 is intended to 
deal in a practical way with the practical difficulties 
associated with multi-lingualism. The essence will be to tailor 
solutions to concrete situations and give great weight to choice 
and voluntary agreement in the context of acknowledging basic 
rights. 
  (7) The State shall act positively to further the 
development of these languages, especially in education, 
literature and the media, to engender the respect for different 
languages and to prevent the use of any language or languages 
for the purpose of domination or division. 
  NOTE: The question of providing proper 
translation services as well as encouraging multi-lingualism 
becomes urgent. 
  (8) When it is reasonable to do so, one or more of these 
languages may be designated by the National Parliament as the 
language to be used for legislation or any other defined 
purposes at the national level or in any region or area where it 
is widely used. 
  (9) Subject to the availability of public and private 
resources, and limitations of reasonableness, primary and 
secondary education should wherever possible be offered on the 
language or languages of preference of the students or their 
parents. 
  (10) The State shall promote respect for all languages 
spoken in South Africa. 
<H5>  Creative Freedom </H5>
  (11) There shall be freedom of artistic activity and 
scientific enquiry, without censorship, subject only to such 
limitations as may be imposed by law in accordance with 
principles generally accepted in open and democratic 
societies. 
<H5>  The Right to Sporting, Recreational and Cultural Activities </H5>
  (12) Sporting, recreational and cultural activities shall 
be encouraged on a non-racial basis, drawing on the talents and 
creative capacities of all South Africans, and autonomous 
organisations may be established to achieve these 
objectives. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 6. WORKERS' RIGHTS </H5>
  (1) Workers shall have the right to form and join trade 
unions and regulate such unions without interference from the 
State. 
  (2) Workers shall be free to join trade unions of their 
choice, subject only to the rules of such unions and to the 
principles of non-discrimination set out in this Constitution, 
and no worker shall be victimised on account of membership of a 
union. 
  (3) The right to organise and to bargain collectively on 
any social, economic or other matter affecting workers' 
interests, shall be guaranteed. 
  (4) In the furtherance of these rights, trade unions 
shall be entitled to reasonable access to the premises of 
enterprises, to receive such information as may be reasonably 
necessary, and to deduct union subscriptions where 
appropriate. 
  (5) No law shall prevent representative trade unions from 
negotiating collective agreements binding on all workers covered 
by such agreements. 
  (6) Workers shall have the right to strike under law in 
pursuance of their social and economic interests subject to 
reasonable limitations in respect of the interruption of 
services such as would endanger the life, health or personal 
safety of the community or any section of the population. 
  (7) Workers shall have the right to peaceful picketing, 
subject only to such reasonable conditions as would be 
acceptable in a democratic society. 
  (8) Trade unions shall have the right to participate in 
lawful political activities. 
  (9) Trade unions shall have the right to form national 
federations and to affiliate to international federations. 
  (10) Employers shall be required by legislation to 
provide a safe and clean work environment that respects the 
dignity of the workers, and to offer reasonable pay and 
holidays. 
  (11) There shall be equal pay for work of equal value, 
and equal access to employment, training and advancement. 
  (12) The State shall make provision by way of legislation 
for compensation to be paid to workers injured in the course of 
their employment and for benefits to be paid to unemployed or 
retired workers. 
  NOTE: It has been argued that a simple 
clause would be better guaranteeing trade union autonomy, the 
right of collective bargaining and the right to strike. By 
putting in extensive clauses, it is said, we are shifting 
workers' rights from their base in industry and from being 
subject to the industrial courts, to the constitutional court, 
which is far more likely to favour pro-employer nineteenth 
century ideas of freedom of contract. While there is obviously 
merit in this argument, we feel it can be addressed by ensuring 
that in industrial questions judges of the Industrial Court 
participate alongside the other judges. The whole question of 
the relationship between workers' rights in the Bill of Rights, 
a Workers' Charter and a possible Industrial Code embodied in 
legislation, needs to be looked at globally. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 7. WOMEN'S RIGHTS </H5>
  (1) Men and women shall enjoy equal rights in all areas 
of public and private life, including employment, education and 
within the family. 
  (2) Legislation may provide for reproductive rights, and 
rights associated with child-birth and child-raising shall be 
respected. 
  NOTE: See Note to Article 2. This is an 
important question that has to be handled in a democratic way, 
recognising a pluralism of opinions, and with as much 
sensitivity as possible. The implication of the above 
formulation is to guarantee child-birth and child-raising 
rights, and to permit but not to require legislation dealing 
with reproductive rights, especially rights relating to the 
control of fertility. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 8. GENDER RIGHTS </H5>
  (1) Discrimination on the grounds of gender, single 
parenthood, legitimacy of birth or sexual orientation shall be 
unlawful. 
  (2) Legislation shall provide remedies for oppression, 
abuse, harassment, or discrimination based on gender or sexual 
orientation. 
  (3) Educational institutions, the media, advertising and 
other social institutions shall be under a duty to discourage 
sexual and other types of stereotyping. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 9. DISABLED PERSONS </H5>
  (1) There shall be no discrimination against disabled 
persons. 
  (2) Legislation shall provide for measures to promote the 
progressive opening up of employment opportunities for disabled 
men and women, the removal of obstacles to the enjoyment by them 
of public amenities and their integration into all areas of 
life. 
  NOTE: This addition is in line with 
recommendations by the Disabled People of South Africa, which is 
actively promoting discussion amongst disabled people on their 
future constitutional rights, and which points out that there 
are nine million disabled persons in our country. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 10. CHILDREN </H5>
  (1) All children shall have the right to a name, to 
health, to security, education and equality of treatment. 
  (2) The State shall, to the maximum of its available 
resources, seek to achieve progressively the full realisation of 
these rights. 
  (3) No child shall suffer discrimination or enjoy 
privileges on the grounds of race, colour, gender, language, 
creed, legitimacy or the status of his or her parents. 
  (4) In all proceedings concerning children, the primary 
consideration shall be the best interests of the child. 
  (5) Children are entitled to be protected from economic 
exploitation and shall not be permitted to perform work that is 
likely to be hazardous or harmful to their education, health or 
moral well-being. 
  (6) It shall be unlawful to oblige children to work or 
perform services for the employers of their parents or other 
family members. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 11 </H5>
  INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES: 
While the basic thinking of the Articles on social, 
economic and property rights remains the same, the formulations 
in these areas have been substantially re-worked. The main 
difference has been to insert an entirely new section on land 
rights. Coupled with this is a formulation on property rights 
which gives greater emphasis to the protection of personal 
possessions. 
  At the same time, the difficult question of how to give 
meaningful protection to social or so-called second generation 
rights, has been dealt with by making their presentation more 
compact, and spelling out in the Enforcement section how they 
should be made effective. 
<H5>  SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND WELFARE RIGHTS </H5>
  (1) All men, women and children have the right to enjoy 
basic social, educational and welfare rights. 
  (2) Legislation shall ensure the creation of a 
progressively expanding floor of minimum rights in the social, 
educational and welfare spheres for all in the country. 
  (3) Such legislation shall take into account national 
priorities, the availability of resources and the capacity of 
the beneficiaries of such rights to contribute towards the costs 
involved. 
  (4) In order to achieve a common floor of rights for the 
whole country, resources may be diverted from richer to poorer 
areas, and timetables may be established for the phased 
extension of legislation and minimum standards from area to 
area. 
<H5>  Freedom From Hunger, the Right to Shelter and the Right to </H5>
Work 
  (5) Special attention shall be paid to securing freedom 
from hunger, reducing and where possible eliminating 
homelessness, unemployment and illiteracy, and to providing 
basic utilities, such as water, electricity and waste disposal 
for all. 
<H5>  Right to Education </H5>
  (6) Education shall be free and compulsory up to the age 
of sixteen, and provision shall be made for facilitating access 
to secondary, vocational and tertiary education on an equal 
basis for all. 
  (7) Education shall be directed towards the development 
of the human personality and a sense of personal dignity, and 
shall aim at strengthening respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and promoting understanding, tolerance and 
friendship amongst South Africans and between nations. 
<H5>  Right to Health </H5>
  (8) A comprehensive national health service shall be 
established linking health workers, community organisations, 
state institutions, private medical schemes and individual 
medical practitioners so as to provide hygiene education, 
preventative medicine and health care delivery to all. 
<H5>  Right to a Minimum Income and Welfare Rights </H5>
  (9) Comprehensive schemes of national insurance, funded 
by general revenue, contributions or such other sources as may 
be appropriate, shall be established to guarantee the furnishing 
of old-age pensions, family income benefits, superannuation 
payments, compensation for industrial injury and disease, 
unemployment benefits, child benefits and such other welfare 
entitlements as citizens in a modern state may expect. 
  NOTE: Normally in a country as developed as 
South Africa, it would not be necessary to spell out the 
different forms of social security that would have to be 
provided. Because the limited forms of welfare started during 
World War II were scrapped by apartheid, we feel it necessary to 
specify the various schemes so that people understand what is 
meant by social security. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 12. LAND AND THE ENVIRONMENT </H5>
  (1) The land, the waters and the sky and all the natural 
assets which they contain, are the common heritage of the people 
of South Africa who are equally entitled to their enjoyment and 
responsible for their conservation. 
  (2) The system of property rights in relation to land 
shall take into account that it is the country's primary asset, 
the basis of life's necessities, and a finite resource. 
<H5>  Rights to Land </H5>
  (3) South Africa belongs to all who live in it. 
  (4) Access to land or other living space is the 
birthright of all South Africans. 
  (5) No-one shall be removed from his or her home except 
by order of a Court, which shall take into account the existence 
of reasonable alternative accommodation. 
  (6) Legislation shall provide that the system of 
administration, ownership, occupation, use and transfer of land 
is equitable, directed at the provision of adequate housing for 
the whole population, promotes productive use of land and 
provides for stable and secure tenure. 
  (7) Legislation shall provide for the establishment of a 
tribunal for land claims which shall have the power to 
adjudicate upon land claims made on legal or equitable grounds, 
and in particular shall have: 
  a)the power to order the restoration of land to people 
dispossessed by forced removals, or where appropriate to direct 
that compensation be paid, or other suitable acknowledgment be 
made, for injury done to them; 
  b) the power to award particular portions of land, or 
rights to land, to such claimants, where there are special 
circumstances arising out of use, occupation or other similar 
grounds, which make it equitable for such an award to be made. 
  (8) Legislation shall also make provision for access to 
affordable land to be given as far as possible, and with due 
regard to financial and other resources available to the state, 
to those historically deprived of land and land rights, or 
deprived of access to land by past statutory discrimination. 
  (9) All such legislation shall guarantee fair procedures 
and be based on the principle of achieving an equitable balance 
between the public interest, including the above objectives, and 
the interests of those whose existing titles might be 
affected. 
  (10) Any redistribution of land or interest in land 
required to achieve the above objectives shall be subject to 
just compensation which shall be determined according to the 
principle of equitable balance between public interest and the 
interest of those whose existing titles might be affected. 
  (11) In the case of a dispute regarding compensation, 
provision shall be made for recourse to an independent tribunal, 
with an appeal to the courts. 
  (12) All natural resources below and above the surface 
area of the land, including the air, and all forms of potential 
energy or minerals in the territorial waters, the continental 
shelf and the exclusive economic zone of South Africa, which are 
not otherwise owned at the time of coming into being of this 
Constitution shall be vested in the state acting as trustee of 
the whole nation. 
  (13) The State shall have the right to regulate the 
exploitation of all natural resources, grant franchises and 
determine royalties subject to payment of just compensation in 
the event of interference with any existing title, mining right 
or concession. 
  NOTE: Do the above provisions cover forced 
removals under Group Areas Legislation? 
<H5>  Environmental Rights </H5>
  (14) All men and women shall have the right to a healthy 
and ecologically balanced environment and the duty to defend 
it. 
  (15) In order to secure this right, the State, acting 
through appropriate agencies and organs shall conserve, protect 
and improve the environment, and in particular: 
  a) prevent and control pollution of the air and waters 
and degradation and erosion of the soil; 
  b) have regard in local, regional and national planning 
to the maintenance or creation of balanced ecological and 
biological areas and to the prevention or minimising of harmful 
effects on the environment; 
  c) promote the rational use of natural resources, 
safeguarding their capacity for renewal and ecological 
stability; 
  d) ensure that long-term damage is not done to the 
environment by industrial or other forms of waste; 
  e) maintain, create and develop natural reserves, parks 
and recreational areas and classify and protect other sites and 
landscapes so as to ensure the preservation and protection of 
areas of outstanding cultural, historic and natural interest. 
  (16) Legislation shall provide for co-operation between 
the State, non-governmental organisations, local communities and 
individuals in seeking to improve the environment and encourage 
ecologically sensible habits in daily life. 
  (17) The law shall provide for appropriate penalties and 
reparation in the case of any damage caused to the environment, 
and permit the interdiction by any interested person or by any 
agency established for the purpose of protecting the 
environment, of any public or private activity or undertaking 
which manifestly and unreasonably causes or threatens to cause 
irreparable damage to the environment. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 13. PROPERTY </H5>
  (1) All South Africans shall, without discrimination, 
have the right to undisturbed enjoyment of their personal 
possessions, and, individually, in association or through 
lawfully constituted bodies, be entitled to acquire, hold or 
dispose of property. 
  (2) The content and limits of these rights and the rights 
to inheritance, shall be determined by law. 
  (3) Property rights impose obligations and their exercise 
should not be in conflict with the public interest. 
  (4) The taking of property shall only be permissible 
according to law and in the public interest, which shall include 
the achievement of the objectives of the Constitution. 
  (5) Any such taking shall be subject to just compensation 
which shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance 
between the public interest and the interest of those 
affected. 
  (6) In the case of a dispute regarding compensation, 
provision shall be made for recourse to a special independent 
tribunal, with an appeal to the Courts. 
  (7) Legislation on economic matters shall be guided by 
the principle of encouraging collaboration between the public, 
private, co-operative, communal and small-scale family sectors 
with a view to reducing inequality, promoting growth and 
providing goods and services for the whole population. 
  NOTE: This kind of clause would fit well 
into a section called Directives of State Policy. For present 
purposes we leave it here. There is much argument about whether 
principles governing economic life should be in a constitution 
at all. If there is strong insistence on having some 
constitutional reference, then we would favour a balanced clause 
such as the above. 
  (8) The above provisions shall not be interpreted as 
impeding legislation such as might be deemed necessary in a 
democratic society with a mixed economy which may be adopted 
with a view to providing for the regulation or control of 
property or for its use or acquisition by public or para-statal 
authorities in accordance with the general interest, or which is 
aimed at preserving the environment, regulating or curtailing 
cartels or monopolies or securing the payment of taxes or other 
contributions or penalties. 
  NOTE: Reference to a mixed economy may be 
unnecessarily provocative both to those who favour an extensive 
free market and those who wish for considerable state 
intervention. It is not normal to have any constitutional 
prescription on either issue. 
  (9) This Article shall be read subject to and in harmony 
with the provisions of Article 12. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 14. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION </H5>
  (1) Nothing in the Constitution shall prevent the 
enactment of legislation, or the adoption by any public or 
private body of special measures of a positive kind designed to 
procure the advancement and the opening up of opportunities, 
including access to education, skills, employment and land, and 
the general advancement in social, economic and cultural 
spheres, of men and women who in the past have been 
disadvantaged by discrimination. 
  (2) Any action taken in terms of the above shall not be 
deemed to contradict the principle of equal rights for all South 
Africans as set out in Article 1. 
  NOTE: The phrasing in the original text was 
interpreted to mean that the principle of affirmative action 
would be so powerful as to override all personal rights and 
freedoms as well as to supersede the specific provisions of the 
property clauses. The new formulation removes any ambiguity on 
the subject, and makes it clear that its ambit is to supplement 
and strengthen the equality clause, not to override other 
provisions in the Bill of Rights. The property clause has 
special provisions dealing with affirmative action in relation 
to land. The following Article deals with special measures that 
have to be taken to remove inequality. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 15. POSITIVE MEASURES </H5>
  NOTE: The word "affirmative action" is used 
in this document only to deal with cases where in order to 
overcome past discrimination special support is given to black 
persons and women. Article 14 makes it clear that such kind of 
intervention aimed at achieving real equality shall not be 
regarded as unconstitutional, even if it expressly takes account 
of race or gender. Article 15 goes beyond merely permitting 
certain kinds of activity. It actually requires the taking of 
steps to overcome the imbalances in our society created by 
apartheid and to promote non-racism and non-sexism. 
  (1) In its activities and functioning, the State shall 
observe the principles of non-racialism and non-sexism, and 
encourage the same in all public and private bodies. 
  (2) All benefits conferred and entitlements granted by 
the State shall be distributed on a non-racist and a non-sexist 
basis. 
  (3) The State and all public and private bodies shall be 
under a duty to prevent any form of incitement to racial, 
religious or linguistic hostility and to dismantle all 
structures and do away with all practices that compulsorily 
divide the population on grounds of race, colour, language, 
gender or creed. 
  (4) With a view to achieving the above, the State may 
enact legislation to prohibit the circulation or possession of 
materials which incite racial, ethnic, religious, gender or 
linguistic hatred, which provoke violence, or which insult, 
degrade, defame or encourage abuse of any racial, ethnic, 
religious, gender or linguistic group. 
  (5) All organs of the State at the national, regional and 
local levels shall pursue policies and programmes aimed at 
redressing the consequences of past discriminatory laws and 
practices, and at the creation of a genuine non-racial democracy 
in South Africa. 
  (6) Such policies shall include the implementation of 
programmes aimed at achieving speedily the balanced structuring 
in non-racial form of the public service, defence and police 
forces and the prison service according to the principles of 
representativity, competence, impartiality and accountability. 
  (7) In taking steps to correct patterns or practices of 
discrimination, special attention shall be paid to rectifying 
the inequalities to which women in South Africa have been 
subjected, and to ensuring their full, equal, effective and 
dignified participation in the political, social, economic and 
cultural life of the nation. 
  (8) Legislation may be enacted requiring non-governmental 
organisations and private bodies to conduct themselves in 
accordance with the above principles. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 16. LIMITATIONS </H5>
  (1) Nothing in the Constitution shall be interpreted as 
implying for any group or person the right to engage in any 
activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of 
the rights and freedoms set forth in the Constitution, or at 
their limitation or suppression to a degree other than is 
authorised by the Constitution itself. 
  (2) Nothing in this Constitution shall be interpreted as 
impeding the right of the State to enact legislation regulating 
the manner in which fundamental rights and freedoms shall be 
exercised, or limiting such rights, provided that such 
regulation or limitation is such as might generally be deemed 
necessary in an open and democratic society. 
  (3) Any restrictions permitted under the Constitution to 
fundamental rights and freedoms shall not be applied to or used 
as a cover for any purpose other than that for which they have 
been expressly or by necessary implication authorised. 
  (4) Any law providing for any regulation or limitation of 
any fundamental right or freedom shall: 
  a) be of general application; 
  b) not negate the essential content of the right, but 
simply qualify the way that right is to be exercised or the 
circumstances in which derogation from the right is permitted; 
  c) as far as practicable, identify the specific clauses 
of the Constitution relied upon for the limitation of the right 
and the specific clauses of the Constitution affected by the 
legislation; 
  d) specify as precisely as possible the exact reach of 
the limitation and the circumstances in which it shall 
apply. 
  NOTE: These provisions follow the basic 
format of limitation clauses used in the European Convention of 
Human Rights and other similar documents. A general clause like 
this is needed so as to avoid cluttering up the Bill of Rights 
with detailed exceptions to each and every clause. Thus, it 
would be inconvenient to have to spell out such generally 
accepted limitations on freedom of speech as restrictions on 
reporting the names of minor in court proceedings, or on speech 
designed to put pressure on judges during a trial. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 17. ENFORCEMENT </H5>
<H5>  General </H5>
  (1) The terms of the Bill of Rights shall be binding upon 
the State and organs of government at all levels, and where 
appropriate, on all social institutions and persons. 
  (2) The fundamental rights and freedoms contained in this 
Bill of Rights shall be guaranteed by the courts. 
  (3) Without interfering with its independence, and with a 
view to ensuring that justice is manifestly seen to be done in a 
non-racial way and that the wisdom, experience and judicial 
skills of all South Africans are represented on the bench, the 
judiciary shall be transformed in such a way as to consist of 
men and women drawn from all sectors of South African society. 
  (4) All persons who claim that rights guaranteed them by 
this Bill of Rights have been infringed or threatened, shall be 
entitled to apply to a competent court for an order for the 
declaration or enforcement of their rights, or for the 
restraining of any act which impedes or threatens such rights. 
  (5) Any law or executive or administrative act which 
violates the terms of this Bill of Rights shall be invalid to 
the extent of such violation, save that the court shall have the 
discretion in appropriate cases to put the relevant body or 
official on terms as to how and within what period to remedy the 
violation. 
<H5>  Constitutional Court </H5>
  (6) Provision shall be made for the establishment of a 
Constitutional Court. 
  NOTE: We favour a Constitutional Court which 
will be representative and newly created. We do not support the 
idea of simply making it a section of the existing Appellate 
Division. Should this point be made here, or does it belong in 
the part of the Constitution dealing with the judiciary? 
<H5>  Human Rights Commission </H5>
  (7) Parliament shall establish by legislation a Human 
Rights Commission to promote general observance of the Bill of 
Rights and in particular to help enforce the right to 
non-discrimination. 
  NOTE: This body is conceived of as having 
the functions similar to those of agencies, boards or 
commissions established in countries like the USA, the UK and 
Australia to secure compliance with anti-discrimination 
legislation. 
  (8) Such Commission shall have the right to establish 
agencies for investigating patterns of violation of any of the 
terms of the Bill of Rights and for receiving complaints, 
attempting conciliation and bringing proceedings in court where 
appropriate, with special attention to violation of the 
principles contained in Article 1. 
  (9) The Commission shall monitor proposed legislation 
with a view to reporting to Parliament on its potential impact 
on the realisation of the rights set out in the Bill of 
Rights. 
  (10) The Commission shall also have the right to create 
agencies to monitor progress being made in the materialisation 
of basic social, educational and welfare rights, report on and 
make proposals for the removal of impediments to their 
achievement, and require the furnishing to Parliament, regional 
and local authorities and to the public at large of all such 
information as would assist in bringing about their 
realisation. 
  (11) The Courts shall enforce such social, education and 
welfare rights as are established by legislation, or identified 
by the Constitutional Court through interpretation of the 
Constitution and shall pay due regard to social, educational and 
welfare rights when considering the interpretation of statutes, 
the validity of subordinate legislation and the reasonableness 
of administrative actions. 
  (12) Where justice and the achievement of the objectives 
of the Bill of Rights so require, the state or any private body 
or individual may be restrained by the Courts from doing 
anything which interferes with or reduces enjoyment of these 
rights or impedes their realisation. 
  NOTE: This is a form of making social rights 
justiciable. The courts are given the power to restrain 
interference with these rights (for example, bulldozing people's 
houses). They are sometimes referred to social rights in the 
negative sense, that is, that nothing may be done to diminish 
them, even though the courts might not have the power to order 
positive rights, say, that homes and jobs be provided. 
  Ombud 
  (13) With a view to ensuring that all functions and 
duties under the Constitution are carried out in a fair way with 
due respect for the rights and sentiments of those affected, the 
office of Ombudsman shall be created. 
  NOTE: In Norway, the country that gave us 
the institution, the person is now called Ombud and not 
Ombudsman and we follow suit. 
  (14) The Ombud shall be appointed by the State President 
subject to confirmation by the Senate. 
  (15) The Ombud shall be appointed for a term to be 
determined by Act of Parliament, and may only be removed by the 
President, acting on the advice of the Senate, on grounds of 
gross misconduct or mental incapacity. 
  (16) The Ombud shall be independent in the carrying out 
of his or her functions and shall serve in a full-time capacity 
and may open offices in different parts of the country. 
  (17) The Ombud shall receive and investigate complaints 
from members of the public concerning abuse of power or unfair, 
insensitive, capricious, harsh, discourteous or unduly delayed 
or discriminatory treatment of any person by any official of 
government at national, regional or local level, or any attempt 
by such official to extort benefits or corruptly to receive 
favours. 
  (18) In accordance with his or her findings, the Ombud 
may initiate legal proceedings, refer the matter for 
prosecution, negotiate a compromise, issue a public 
communication, or make a report to the department or organ 
concerned containing recommendations with a view to remedying 
the improper conduct, preventing repetition, and, where 
appropriate, making amends, including compensation. 
<H5>  Jurisdiction </H5>
  (19) Recourse to the Human Rights Commission or to the 
Ombud shall not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to hear any 
matter. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 18. MEASURES FOR CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY DURING A </H5>
STATE OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR EMERGENCY 
  (1) If there is a threat to the sovereignty of South 
Africa, which in the opinion of the President calls for such a 
declaration to be made, the President may by Proclamation 
declare that a state of national defence exists in South 
Africa. 
  (2) At a time of national disaster, or grave public 
emergency, or danger threatening the life of the nation or the 
democratic constitutional order and if the ordinary laws of the 
land are not sufficient to meet the exigencies of such national 
disaster, public emergency or danger, the President may, by 
Proclamation, declare that a state of emergency exists in South 
Africa. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 19. PROCLAMATION OF DEFENCE AND EMERGENCY MEASURES </H5>
  (1) When a state of national defence or a state of 
emergency exists, the President may, by Proclamation, enact 
defence or emergency measures which are necessary for the 
protection of the sovereignty of South Africa, national 
security, or public safety or for the defence of the 
Constitution. 
  (2) Defence and emergency measures shall have the force 
of law and subject to Articles 20, 21, 22, 23, may repeal, amend 
or suspend the operation of any existing law, including certain 
provisions of Chapter 2 of the Constitution. Such measures may 
be proclaimed for the whole of the country, or for any part of 
it. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 20. SUPERVISORY POWER OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </H5>
  (1) A declaration of a state of national defence or of a 
state of emergency shall cease to have effect if it is not 
ratified within fourteen days by a resolution of the National 
Assembly. If the National Assembly is not in session when such a 
declaration is made, the President shall immediately convene a 
special session of the National Assembly to address this 
issue. 
  (2) A state of national defence that has been ratified by 
the National Assembly under Sub-article (1) shall continue until 
peace has been declared by the President. 
  (3) A state of emergency which has been ratified by the 
National Assembly under sub-article (1) shall continue until 
terminated by the President: provided that if it has endured for 
a period of six months from the date of proclamation, it will 
automatically lapse unless the National Assembly by a resolution 
taken prior to the expiration of the six month period, approves 
its extension for a further six months or a shorter period. Any 
prolongation of the state of emergency thereafter, shall be 
limited to successive periods of not more than six months which 
shall on each occasion require the approval of a resolution of 
the National Assembly passed by a two-thirds majority. 
  (4) During the period of any state of emergency or state 
of national defence - 
  (a) While the National Assembly is in session, the 
President shall report to it at intervals of not more than one 
month about the operation of the special emergency and national 
defence measures and the National Assembly shall receive and 
promptly consider such reports; 
  (b) If the National Assembly is not in session, the 
President shall convene special sessions, of the National 
Assembly at intervals of not more than three months from the 
date of the declaration of the state of emergency or state of 
national defence or from the date on which a report by him on 
the operation of the special emergency measures was last made to 
the National Assembly, for the purpose of receiving and 
considering a report from him about the operation of the special 
emergency measures and to conduct such other business as the 
National Assembly may decide. 
  (5) The National Assembly may at any time by resolution 
revoke the declaration of emergency or state of defence or 
restrict the area of their operation or repeal or amend the 
terms of any emergency measures. 
  (6) During the period of any state of emergency the power 
of the President to dissolve the National Assembly and the 
Senate may not be exercised unless a resolution of the National 
Assembly is passed authorising him to do so. If the President is 
required by the Constitution or the electoral law to call for 
new elections during an emergency, then such elections shall be 
held as expediously as possible in accordance with the 
provisions of the existing law and the new National Assembly 
shall be convened without delay. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 21. NON-DEROGABLE RIGHTS </H5>
  Neither the President nor the National Assembly shall have 
the power to pass a defence or an emergency measure which: 
  (1) derogates from or suspends the rights and freedoms 
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights other than those referred to in 
Articles 2(9) [forbidding detention without trial], (10) [no 
arrest or detention except for trial on criminal charge], (11) 
[informed of charge, right to legal representation and brought 
to court timeously; (12) [right to bail], (13) [right to public 
and fair trial before independent court], (31) [no search or 
entry to property without reasonable cause], (32) [interference 
with private communication, spying, etc.], and (33) [freedom of 
movement, passport, right to leave and enter country], Article 4 
[freedom of speech, assembly and right to information], Article 
13(1) [peaceful possession of property and goods], and Article 
12 (14), (15), (16) and (17) [environmental rights], provided 
that the derogation where permissible shall not be greater than 
is necessary for the purpose of national defence or the 
emergency; or 
  (2) suspends or derogates from the provisions of any 
other chapter of the Constitution; or 
  (3) establishes special courts or tribunals, other than 
the review board referred to in Article 21; or 
  (4) make provision for prospective indemnities; or 
  (5) is contrary to international law or international 
obligations. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 22. DETENTION IN TIMES OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR </H5>
EMERGENCY 
  Where any persons are detained without trial in terms of any 
defence or emergency measure, the following provisions shall 
apply: 
  (1) They shall immediately be informed of the reason for 
their detention, an adult family member or friend nominated by 
the detainee shall promptly be notified of the detention and 
there shall be prompt publication in the Gazette of their names 
and the legal provisions under which they are held; 
  (2) They shall have access to a legal representative of 
their choice at all reasonable times. 
  (3) Their detention shall be reviewed within one month of 
their detention, and thereafter if they remain in detention at 
intervals of not less than three months, by a review board 
presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court, which shall have 
the power to order their release from detention if satisfied 
that it is not reasonably necessary for their detention to be 
continued for the purpose of national defence or the 
emergency. 
  (4) Detainees shall be given opportunity to make 
representations to the review board in such form as the board 
may consider to be desirable in the circumstances, taking into 
account the public interest and their interests, and for that 
purpose shall be given access to such information as the board 
may consider to be necessary, with due regard to such interests, 
and shall also be entitled to be represented before the board at 
the time when their cases are to be considered by the board. 
  (5) The decision of the review board shall be made known 
to the detainee and to the adult family member or friend 
nominated by the detainee. 
  (6) The right of the detainee to question the legality or 
the conditions of detention by recourse to judicial review shall 
not be affected by the provisions hereof. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 23. EXPROPRIATION AND COMMANDEERING OF PROPERTY IN </H5>
TIMES OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR EMERGENCY 
  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 14 (4), (5) 
and (6) hereof, a defence or an emergency measure may authorise 
the expropriation or commandeering of any property for the 
purposes of national defence or the emergency. 
  (2) Such defence or emergency measure shall provide: 
  a)that the property commandeered, unless it has been 
consumed for the purpose for which it was commandeered, be 
restored to the person from whom it was taken when it is no 
longer required for the purpose of national defence or the 
emergency; 
  b) that compensation shall be paid for property that is 
expropriated, or property which, having been commandeered, is 
destroyed or damaged prior to its restoration to the person from 
whom it was taken; and 
  c) that the compensation payable shall be assessed with 
due regard to the needs and interests of the State which were 
served by the expropriation or commandeering, and the interests 
of the person who has suffered loss as a result of the loss of 
or damage to such property. 
  (3) The defence or emergency measures may provide that 
compensation shall not be payable for the temporary loss of the 
use of property which has been commandeered in terms of such 
measures, unless the person from which the property was taken 
used or intended to use the property for the subsistence of his 
or her family, or for the purpose of producing an income, in 
which event the compensation payable shall be assessed in 
accordance with the principles set out in sub-article (2) 
hereof, provided that the compensation shall in no event be more 
than is strictly necessary to compensate the persons concerned 
for the loss they have actually suffered as a result of the 
property having been commandeered.
