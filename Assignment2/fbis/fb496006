  [Text] The DAILY GRAPHIC has an exclusive story on its 
front page about an alleged coup plot. According to the paper, 
its special investigation team has discovered that an alleged 
threat to editors of some private papers is actually a ploy of 
diversion for a coup plot to take place between the 7th and the 
15th of this month. A special report named the editors as that 
of the STATESMAN, Mr. Haruna Atta, and Mr. Eben Quarcoo of the 
FREE PRESS. It also mentioned Major Courage Quashiegah, a 
leading member of the New Patriotic Party, as another target of 
the alleged assassination threat.

  [Text] Accra, 23 Apr (PANA) -- Ghanaian intelligence 
officials have uncovered a coup plot that would have been 
executed in the West African country between 7th-15th April, the 
state-owned [DAILY] GRAPHIC newspaper reported yesterday. In a 
front-page report citing intelligence sources, the GRAPHIC said 
the "attempt to destabilize the country" included threats of 
assassinations of editors of two private newspapers who have 
been critical of President Jerry Rawlings. "Highly placed 
ghanaian intelligence sources have confirmed that they believed 
the reported threats were part of a destabilization plan. The 
attempt had been slated for between 7th and 15th April", the 
newspaper said. 
  The STATESMAN, the newspaper of the opposition center-right 
New Patriotic Party (NPP), said in a story on 17th April that 
its editor, Haruna Attah, the editor of the FREE PRESS, Eben 
Quarcoo, and a former close aide of Rawlings, Major Courage 
Quarshigah, had received death threats. The GRAPHIC said these 
threats were being treated as part of investigations into 
alleged plots to oust the government. 
  The reported threat was either intended to provide a decoy 
or 
a pretext for whatever action had been intended, it quoted 
security officials as saying. 
  "Ghanaian intelligence had become aware of intense efforts 
to 
infiltrate the conflict areas in the north and to use the 
conflict as a cover for an attempt to overthrow the government", 
the GRAPHIC said. 
  The newspaper quoted security documents which stated that 
there were "increased dissident activities designed to take 
advantage of the northern conflict and to link up with 
like-minded forces inside the country". It said attempts to 
oust the government, which ceased following Rawlings' victory at 
the polls in 1992, started again late in 1993. 
  "From January (1994), persistent reports filtered through of 
intense activities along the West African coast by retired 
service personnel and others who remained in exile to renew 
their illegal actions against the government", it said. 
  The GRAPHIC reported that the security sources told it that 
some known dissidents had made attempts to obtain support from 
sources in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. "Contacts had been 
established in Accra with some retired service personnel and 
some politicians. There were meetings in and around Accra and 
Kumasi attended by high- profile politicians", it said. 
  The report did not say whether there have been any arrests.

  [Text] The minister for foreign affairs, Alhaji Babagana 
Kingibe, says the Federal Government is still committed to its 
decision that the controversy over the ownership of the Bakassi 
Peninsula can be resolved in accordance with the Charter of the 
Organization of African Unity, OAU. The minister was speaking 
today in Abuja when he received the OAU fact-finding team on the 
Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute. He pointed out that Cameroon 
has been unwilling to (?resolve) her contention with Nigeria in 
accordance with the provisions of the OAU and UN Charters. The 
minister expressed the hope that the visit would strengthen the 
spirit for a peaceful resolution to the Bakassi dispute. 
  In his response, the leader of the team and assistant 
secretary general of the OAU, Ambassador (M.T. Matunga), said 
the team would not only look for facts but also explore ideas 
from both countries on a peaceful resolution of the dispute.

  [Text] President Eyadema yesterday afternoon received 
separately the two leaders of the democratic opposition, Edem 
Kodjo of the Togolese Union for Democracy and Yaovi Agboyibor of 
the Action Committee for Renewal. After his audience with the 
head of state, Edem Kodjo told correspondents that he had been 
tipped for the post of prime minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Kodjo] The head of state has just honored 
me by naming me prime minister. I express my gratitude not only 
to him but to the Togolese people, and to all those who enabled 
us to win a parliamentary majority in order to build a growing 
force in our national political life. I think it was time to 
settle this problem of premiership. That situation was 
endangering the parliamentary majority and this should not have 
been so. Also, it was necessary to act quickly so that our 
country does fall behind others. We must quickly tackle the 
country's economic revival, national reconciliation, and social 
peace. [Words indistinct] future action of forming a 
government, a task which we must tackle now. We must set up a 
government now. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What is your first message for 
the Togolese people? 
  [Kodjo] I congratulate them. I want to express my gratitude 
to them and to comfort them because they have suffered a lot. We 
must comfort them now. We must [words indistinct] settle down to 
solve the main issues. Our youths have a challenge to meet. 
Our women, farmers, active forces of the nation, and workers 
must all get mobilized. Our employers association must also 
participate in the task of reviving the country and its economic 
development. I think our country now wants to escape the 
situation in which it has found itself to chart a new course 
which must guarantee peace, stability, and security. The people 
must be confident in themselves. They must help us and I think 
we shall move forward. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Gnassingbe Eyadema on appointment of </F>
prime minister in Lome on 22 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Togolese people, with the holding of the 
legislative elections, we have ended the transitional phase 
provided by the Constitution. The establishment of major 
institutions of the Fourth Republic marks the end of the 
activities of the transition government. I want to pay tribute 
to all Togolese people for the courage and high sense of duty 
demonstrated during this transition period and, in particular, 
during the legislative elections. Let me congratulate the 
outgoing prime minister and his ministers as well as all 
political leaders and administrative officials who have had the 
arduous task of running our country's government at this 
difficult time. [Words indistinct] to seek hours of compromise 
which enabled us to conclude the transition. When the nation 
was faced with a serious threat of being torn apart, each one of 
you made it a point to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and 
love for our country by placing national interests above 
personal interests or that of one's party. To you, my dear 
countrymen, parliamentarians whom the people have freely and in 
a sovereign manner elected to represent them and to defend their 
interests at the National Assembly, I express my warm 
congratulations. [passage omitted] 
  I promised you, even before the holding of the legislative 
elections, that I will ensure a broad-based government is set 
up. The legislative elections reflected the desire of the 
people. The results of these elections have demonstrated your 
wish for a renewal and your desire for continuity. They also 
demonstrated your concern for level-headedness because, after 
these elections, none of the parties that contested them was in 
a position to claim parliamentary majority. We must see this 
situation in a positive manner. It must encourage each one of 
us to be moderate and to adopt dialogue, taking into account the 
situation as well as the (?needs) and aspirations of the people. 
You know the country's (?situation) and needs. Your 
aspirations are clear. Do you want to live in a truly 
independent and free country? Are you tired of experiencing the 
consequences of these political rivalries? This is why 
immediately after the legislative elections, as I pledged to do 
even before being elected as president, I started consultations 
to appoint a new prime minister. I acted so because I took into 
account your desire for change and renewal. I have paved the 
way for the formation of a national union government. 
  The naming of the government must be in conformity with the 
provisions of Article 66 of our Constitution. The article says 
the president names the prime minister from within the 
parliamentary majority group. The Constitution confers on the 
head of state the sole responsibility of choosing a prime 
minister. I made it a point of consulting with leaders of the 
political parties to know their preferences and their 
aspirations. In the aftermath of the legislative elections, an 
alliance was formed between two parties, the Action Committee 
for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy, to form a 
parliamentary majority. I held several working sessions with the 
chairmen of these two parties. I asked them to suggest to me 
several names from which I could choose a prime minister. 
Indeed, it is necessary to respect the constitutional 
prerogative of the president of the Republic. It is also 
necessary to take into account the aptitude of the person chosen 
to assume that post and to restore confidence and national 
harmony. Up till today, I had not received any proposal. The 
legislative elections were completed several weeks ago. The 
country can wait no longer. 
  As the guarantor of the Constitution, it is my duty to 
encourage everyone to uphold his responsibilities. This is why 
I have decided to choose a personality from the parliamentary 
majority to form a new government, in conformity with Article 66 
of our Constitution. I am appealing to the sense of 
responsibility in all of you. The time has come for us to come 
together instead of being divided. The time has come to work 
for the construction of the country instead of destroying it. I 
have confidence in the political maturity of the Togolese people 
[words indistinct] division. The head of government will be 
charged with the task of working towards national unity and 
general interest. He will be charged with managing the 
country's affairs thoroughly and efficiently during this 
delicate phase of national reconstruction. [passage omitted] 
  I wish the prime minister and his future cabinet good luck. 
Long live the Republic! Long live democracy! Long live Togo!

  [Text] In Togo the political crisis is back. Mr. Agboybo's 
CAR [Action Committee for Renewal] and Edem Kodjo's UTD 
[Togolese Union for Democracy] won the majority of votes in the 
legislative elections and agreed that Mr. Agboybo should become 
prime minister. Last night, General Eyadema decided to appoint 
Edem Kodjo as prime minister. As a result, the largest party in 
the coalition, CAR, is refusing to support this government. Mr. 
Agboybo has just said this to our colleague, Adala Benraad: 
  [Begin recording] [Agboybo] Our concern is to do everything 
in our power to safeguard the parliamentary majority resulting 
from the elections. We hope that our colleague Edem Kodjo, 
aware of the stakes, will reconsider his position so that we may 
find a solution enabling us to maintain our majority. This is 
our main concern. Therefore, in the present circumstances it is 
out of the question to [words indistinct]. We want to do 
everything in our power to safeguard the parliamentary majority. 
  [Benraad] In your opinion what would be the solution? 
  [Agboybo] I believe that the appointment took place in 
unacceptable conditions, I do not believe that this appointment 
could be considered as final. The parties concerned should meet 
to reach a decision agreeable to all. [end recording]

  [Text] Following the decision by Edem Kodjo of the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] to accept the post of prime minister, 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has reacted saying that 
his acceptance constitutes a violation of the agreement signed 
on 26 March. CAR noted that under an agreement concluded and 
signed on 26 March by the two political parties which formed the 
parliamentary majority, it was decided that the new prime 
minister must come from the CAR party. On that same day, the 
UTD approved the nominee for that post. The fact that Edem 
Kodjo has accepted the post of prime minister is a blatant and 
unacceptable violation of the 26 March agreement. The CAR 
believes that no one can take advantage of the privileges of a 
parliamentary majority without adhering to the agreement upon 
which that parliamentary majority is based. 
  Therefore, the CAR has decided not to participate in any 
cabinet that may be formed by Edem Kodjo, in defiance of the 
desire expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February 
polls and of the agreement signed on 26 March between the CAR 
and the UTD.

  [Text] Talks between the government and the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continue in Lusaka. 
After a busy morning by the negotiating sides, observers and UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, this afternoon the 
government and UNITA delegations met unexpectedly. Our 
correspondent Alves Antonio reports: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] Everything happened unexpectedly. 
Although the press knows nothing concrete, it is presumed that 
the government and UNITA negotiating teams to the Lusaka peace 
talks have reached an agreement on issues relating to specific 
principles and ways of implementing the presidential elections. 
As the public knows, the general principles on this point were 
approved and signed on 15 April. However, there are still 
strong differences on specific principles. 
  Today's tete-a-tete is by itself a positive sign, since by 
late this morning the UNITA delegation was still intransigent 
and irresolute on its early positions in view of the document 
presented by mediator Blondin Beye. Should an agreement be 
reached on this issue, a plenary session will be held to approve 
the aforementioned document, otherwise the mediators will try to 
approach the government and UNITA negotiating teams as they have 
been doing. Afterward it will just be a matter of concluding the 
document on national reconciliation, as well as reaching an 
agreement on ways to implement the approved principles which 
include delicate issues, such as the status of UNITA leader 
Jonas Savimbi. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- 
recorded]. 
  [Correspondent] In your capacity as prime minister, what 
do you think about reports concerning the ongoing peace talks? 
Is peace still far off? 
  [Moco] I believe that what I think is what any Angolan 
thinks: we must fight for peace. Let it be noted that our 
government has never behaved in a way to leave the Angolan 
people or the international community in any doubt that we are 
fighting for peace. The National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] has been the aggressor. It has 
attacked the country's integrity. It has been destroying the 
country and it has been doing so for no justifiable reason. 
Now, we all hope that pressure from the international community 
at large -- and in particular those countries which are able to 
exert pressure on UNITA -- will be enough to ensure that a peace 
accord will be signed in Lusaka or some other city as soon as 
possible. What I have been trying to convey over the course of 
my tour is that it is easy for us to reach peace on paper. It 
is far more difficult to achieve real peace that will serve the 
Angolan people's interests rather than UNITA's and Mr. Savimbi's 
greed for power. 
  [Correspondent] You talked a great deal about peace during 
your tour. We would like to ask whether peace is near or 
whether there is just a possibility than an accord will be 
signed? 
  [Moco] I think that real peace will hinge on how the Angolan 
people organize themselves. As for peace on paper, that may 
happen soon. 
  [Correspondent] When you held meetings with the provincial 
governments, some specific guidelines were issued. Do you think 
it will be possible for the provincial governments to follow 
those guidelines, principally with regard to food security and 
returning people to their areas? 
  [Moco] I do recognize that it will be very difficult, but it 
is possible to do something. We must perfect organizational 
mechanisms in a situation of war. This is a guideline I issued 
and I believe it can be implemented. An improvement in the 
[20-second break in transmission] is necessary and I will assume 
a stand concerning that matter. Very often governmental 
organizations have been much too kind toward UNITA. There are 
many people who have been fleeing UNITA-held areas. UNITA 
carries out ambushes on the roads. It even prevents aircraft 
from providing help to war-displaced people in a number of 
districts, notably Benguela and Huambo. I feel quite often that 
nongovernmental organizations and the UN representation in 
Angola do not apply enough pressure on UNITA to encourage it to 
allow humanitarian aid to be extended to every part of Angolan 
territory. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister: this will likely be the 
last question from the People's Television of Angola, TPA, and 
it is connected with the first question I asked. Will you not 
be making changes in your governing apparatus before the peace 
accords are signed? 
  [Moco] That depends. At this point, I fail to see the need, 
but the government (?faces) some difficulties and it has to 
fight for a good image. The head of government and the 
president of the republic must ensure that each member of 
government is made aware of his responsibilities in his 
particular field and that is not achieved through dismissals 
alone. Dismissals are often spectacular moves, but there are 
other ways to go about it. Nonetheless, dismissals and 
resignations are only natural in any government at any time. 
Obviously, we have not planned such moves and they are not our 
principal concern either. Our principal aim is to build, to 
help, and to provide support for officials in government. 
Though people may think otherwise, they are only human and they 
experience the same difficulties all Angolans face. In fact, 
that is the way we must act so we can improve the mechanisms of 
government more and more. 
  [Correspondent] How did the government react to the UN 
proposal concerning the search for peace corridors so that 
humanitarian aid can be extended to people in areas [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Moco] I believe you must put that question to UNITA. It 
began the war and it has continued to make war. You are 
perfectly well aware of the fact that it was UNITA that began 
the war, so it is UNITA that must be asked about opening peace 
corridors or whatever you may call them. The fact is that the 
government has never raised problems concerning supplies to the 
people or aid to war-displaced people. We have never raised 
that problem, so I believe that is one question that must be put 
to UNITA. It began the war and it has continued to make war. 
As you know, Chongoroi, here in Benguela, and Ebo were recently 
occupied. So, UNITA began the war and it has continued to be on 
the offensive. It is UNITA that must be asked such questions.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] In Angola, the government has confirmed that the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
forces have taken the area of Chongoroi, in coastal Benguela 
Province. However, that does not appear to be the sole military 
development in the Angolan conflict. Reginaldo Silva, our 
correspondent in Luanda, reports on a war that appears to be 
entering a new stage: 
  [Begin Silva recording] In Angola, the more there is talk 
about an urgent need for peace, the more one hears war-related 
news. According to a statement yesterday by Prime Minister 
Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco on his return from a visit to 
Benguela Province, this happens at a time when the UNITA forces 
have just reoccupied the capital of Benguela Province's 
Chongoroi District. It is difficult at this stage to assess the 
importance of UNITA's advances in Benguela. Its occupation of 
Chongoroi appears to be part of a response to the attacks UNITA 
forces have been coming under in northern Angola. To all 
intents and purposes, the UNITA troops appear to have 
considerably eased government pressure in Benguela Province and 
to have the military initiative in their hands, after government 
forces had made progress along the Bocoio-Balombo and 
Cubal-Ganda lines in the direction of Huambo. 
  Observers in Luanda believe that the war in Angola is 
entering a new stage after the government forces showed an 
apparent inability to make major progress in their northern 
offensive, where the taking of the city of N'dalatando, the 
capital of Cuanza Norte Province, was one of the main goals. 
Contradictory reports may have been going the rounds over the 
last few days, but it appears to be certain that N'dalatando is 
still in UNITA's hands and its forces now enjoy more breathing 
space. 
  Luanda's independent IMPARTIAL FAX publication has reported 
that, after receiving large quantities of war materiel it bought 
from Arab countries, UNITA is determined to change the situation 
in northern Angola so that it will be completely in its favor. 
That war materiel is being assembled in Uige. 
  IMPARTIAL FAX also says that UNITA may soon have PC-7 and 
PC-9 aircraft. Should such reports prove to be true, the 
military situation in Angola may soon suffer major changes. [end

  [Text] UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello said today 
that in his next report to the UN Security Council he will 
inform them that despite the fact that Mozambique's peace 
process has progressed significantly, there are still serious 
problems to be resolved. These include the slow confinement of 
government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] forces 
and the need to find a speedy and realistic solution for the 
formation of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM]. 
Ajello revealed that these and other issues of concern will be 
thoroughly discussed in a Supervision and Control Commission 
meeting scheduled for this afternoon. In this meeting, the UN 
representative in Mozambique will propose a date for closing the 
assembly areas and by then all soldiers who will join the new 
army should be in training centers, and those remaining ones 
should be demobilized. He said these guidelines should be 
established immediately, stressing that the debate scheduled for 
today will be an opportune time to discuss the issue. 
  In his normal Friday news conference, Dr. Aldo Ajello called 
attention to the fact that 55 percent of government soldiers and 
81 percent from Renamo have now been confined in assembly areas. 
He expressed profound concern, saying this is a problem, and 
added that if this tendency persists, there will be problems in 
concluding the process. 
  Ajello revealed that 14,306 government soldiers and 561 from 
Renamo have now been demobilized. The UN Operations in 
Mozambique Technical Demobilization Unit has a list of 18,859 
government soldiers and 1,112 from Renamo that should be 
demobilized. Aldo Ajello said the process of demobilizing 
soldiers from both sides is very slow. Renamo must demobilize 
4,000 soldiers and the government 60,000. Meanwhile, he noted 
that Afonso Dhlakama's movement is slower in demobilizing its 
forces, although President Joaquim Chissano and the Renamo 
leader agreed to speed up the process in their last meeting. 
Ajello said that until now nothing of what they decided on the 
issue has been fulfilled. The UN Security Council will discuss 
these issues by the end of the month and it is expected that if 
appropriate measures have not been taken by then, the UN will 
take appropriate steps in accordance with the circumstances. 
  Concerning the process of the formation of the new armed 
forces, the UN special representative in Mozambique revealed 
that the movement of soldiers to training centers scheduled for 
this week has been concluded, despite the fact that a number of 
soldiers refused to join the new army. According to the program 
for forming the new army, the soldiers will be trained in Boone 
center, located in Manhica District, Maputo Province and Dondo 
center in Sofala Province under the supervision of British 
instructors. Since it is expected that a large number of 
soldiers will be trained, the participation of Zimbabwean 
instructors is being considered. Aldo Ajello said the most 
important thing now is to completely demobilize all those who 
will not join the new army and to consider the possibility that 
the formation of the new forces may be extended to the post 
electoral period.

  [Text] This afternoon visiting Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] leader Afonso Dhlakama was confronted by reporters 
with statements by Aldo Ajello, the UN special representative in 
Mozambique, to the effect that, whereas so far Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] has demobilized some 15,000 
troops, Renamo has only demobilized about 500. Dhlakama replied 
that if that is the case, the blame does not lie with Renamo but 
with the UN's lack of efficiency: 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] If he said that, that is his 
fault, because the Unomoz [United Nations Operation in 
Mozambique] office has a list of over 1,000 Renamo names to be 
demobilized. The process works on the basis of lists. We hand 
in the lists of the people who are to be demobilized. If Unomoz 
fails to set the date, if they fail to go ahead with the 
demobilization, then maybe it is a question of incompetence on 
Unomoz's part. It is not up to Renamo unilaterally to arrive at 
an assembly point and say: Right, you are going home. We have 
collected lists of our men and have handed them over to Unomoz. 
It is up to Unomoz to carry out the demobilization. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpt] An attempted coup has taken place in the central 
African country, Burundi. It was organized by Tutsi Army 
officers. The Burundi Army chief says the coup has failed. 
Other reports say it is still in progress. The Army is still 
controlled by the minority Tutsi people in Burundi. 
  All members of the Burundi Government have gone into hiding, 
probably in a Western embassy. This was confirmed to the BRTN 
[expansion not given] by the interim president, Ntibantunganya, 
last night. 
  Meanwhile the Army has taken action against three rebellious 
Hutu districts in Bujumbura. These are surrounded. The Tutsi 
military want to disarm militias from the majority Hutu people. 
The minister of defense has asked all inhabitants of the Hutu 
district to leave to prevent innocent victims. 
  The Belgian Embassy has asked all the Belgians in Bujumbura 
to stay inside. 
  Some Hutus formed military militias in the last few days. 
This followed reports from the Hutu party, Frodebu, that the 
Army is preparing for violence against the majority Hutu people.

  [Text] The Government of Burundi has taken an important 
decision to disarm the population following the persistence of 
insecurity, especially in some parts of the capital Bujumbura 
where gun fires have been heard over the past week. The 
decision was taken yesterday, following a security meeting here 
last Thursday [21 April] by the interim President Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, along with all partners in the security issue. 
  The decision was read on the state radio last night by the 
interim spokesman of the government, Issa Ngendakumana. 
Marthias Nderegi has the contents. 
  [Nderegi] If the situation of insecurity will continue to 
deteriorate, the country will shortly collapse, as the 
communique read by the ad-interim spokesman of the government 
said. That is why we want to restore security in the mayorship 
of Bujumbura and the remainder of the country. So these 
decisions have been taken by the government. 
  The government condemns actions of some elements and armed 
groups who [words indistinct] and insecurity in the mayorship of 
Bujumbura. The government urged armed groups who continue to 
(?trouble) [word indistinct] of Bujumbura to quickly stop 
shooting. It appeals to soldiers to observe discipline in their 
daily activities and resort to weapons only in case of defense. 
  [The government] urged any person carrying weapons illegally 
to soon hand it in at the nearest zone, commune or province 
before tomorrow 1800 hours local time [1600 GMT on 24 April]. 
It recalls the population that any illegal carrying of weapons 
is forbidden and that anyone who will go astray will be 
seriously punished. 
  The government also urged that all roads which were 
obstructed be soon opened so as to allow free circulation of the 
population. It also urged that all inquiries touching on the 
criminal act have to be followed and finished. Firstly, the 
government called upon the population to understand and respect 
all those measures which attempt to assist to (?restore) 
security and peace for all the country.

<F P=106> [By Ferdinand Bigumandondera] </F>
  [Text] Bujumbura, 23 Apr (PANA) -- Military and political 
authorities in Burundi have underscored the need to disarm 
civilians before any discussion on reforming the Armed Forces, 
but there is division on the method to be adopted, sources said 
in Bujumbura. 
  Interim president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, insists that 
the 
discussion must first of all find out why the civil population 
continues to carry arms. The opposition disagrees saying the 
only way to guarantee minimum security for the population is to 
immediately neutralise armed gangs. 
  The disagreement has automatically stalled efforts to find a 
lasting solution to the civil strife in the central African 
country where thousands of people have perished in the blood 
bath sparked by the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye in a 
failed coup in October 1993. 
  Some leaders of the ruling Front for Democracy in Burundi 
(Frodebu), led by Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma -- who was 
away from the country for a month at the height of the crisis -- 
totally oppose disarming of the civil population. For them, the 
question of surrendering arms to the military does not arise. 
  It is expected that the armed gangs operating in Kamenge (a 
hot spot in the northern part of Bujumbura) will resist if the 
military try to disarm them by force. 
  On Saturday [23 April], the Burundi Government issued a 
48-hour ultimatum to civilians carrying firearms -- legally or 
illegally acquired -- to surrender them to administrative 
authorities in their areas before 6 PM local time (16:00 GMT) on 
Sunday. 
  The Hutu population (majority ethnic group but a minority in 
the Armed Forces since the bloody events of 1972 which deprived 
Hutus of top positions in the government) have been stocking 
weapons, with the collaboration of the authorities, since the 
assassination of Ndadaye. To justify this attitude, the Hutus 
say that the Army, which is dominated by the Tutsi minority 
ethnic group and responsible for Ndadaye's assassination, cannot 
be trusted and should be disbanded. 
  As a consequence, armed militias have been set up in the two 
camps. Hutu youths, most of whom are unemployed, are demanding 
to be enlisted into the Army and Gendarmerie (mobile police) in 
the same numbers as their Tutsi counterparts. They threaten to 
use the type of force witnessed recently in Kamenge if their 
demands are not met. 
  The Hutu youths receive support from the unregistered Party 
for the Liberation of the Hutu People (Palipehutu), an extremist 
movement based in neighbouring Rwanda. In November 1991, it 
carried out a futile armed attack on military positions in the 
capital.

  [Text] The situation is extremely tense in Bujumbura, the 
capital of Burundi. The Burundian Government has demanded that 
the people should lay down their arms. For two days several 
districts of the town have been affected by shooting and 
fighting, especially the district of Kamenge, in the north of 
Bujumbura. Several Hutu took refuge in this district after the 
massacres of last autumn. Francois Rijkmans reports: 
  [Rijkmans] The Burundian Government is unanimous in wanting 
an end to violence in the town. The armed resistance has got 
itself organized these last few days. The Burundian army, which 
is mainly Tutsi, has clashed with Hutu militias. It seems that 
a military committee has put pressure on the government. The 
government wants to restore peace and to disband the illegal 
militias. The decision has been taken: Everyone must hand in 
their weapons this evening at 1800. But there are questions as 
to how, and some people are fearing a new explosion of violence 
in the powder keg of Bujumbura. 
  The Burundian army has surrounded the Kamenge district with 
an impressive number of troops. The people of this district, 
and of other northern districts of the town, had already agreed 
to be disarmed, but on condition that their safety is 
guaranteed, on condition that the troops stop the slaughter. 
  The Brussels representatives of Frodebu, the Burundi 
Democratic Front, are afraid lest the army, dominated by Tutsis, 
should enter Kamenge in force to carry out ethnic cleansing.

  [Text] There was tension yesterday in the center of the 
northern Province of Kayanza. Population at the center of the 
province was in an unrest in the afternoon following a kind of 
uprising by a group of young men following the execution of the 
director of the Lycee [government secondary school] of Kayanza 
by his own pupils in his own office. Last Thursday [21 April], 
the pupils of the Lycee of Kayanza had demonstrated to demand 
the resumption of classes which had been suspended following the 
departure of a group of pupils from that school. Until now, 
however, there hasn't been any response to this demand.

  [Excerpt] In Gihogazi, Karuzi Province, a military 
detachment was attacked this morning by as yet unidentified 
assailants. The attack was finally repulsed but two soldiers 
have been wounded. According to the Karuzi governor, whom we 
managed to get on the phone, the assailants were well-armed. 
Also, the Karuzi-Bugenyuzi road is still obstructed by 
roadblocks. 
  Measures taken by Karuzi authorities include: strengthening 
the military detachment stationed in Gihogazi and Karuzi, 
clearing blocked roads, and, finally, calling on the population 
to dissociate themselves from the wrongdoers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Arusha, Tanzania, April 23 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels 
threw talks planned here Saturday [23 April] and aimed at ending 
an ethnic bloodbath into turmoil by refusing to negotiate with 
the government delegation. 
  Interior Minister Faustin Munyazesa, accompanied by two 
senior military officers, were due to arrive late Saturday 
aboard a United Nations plane. But they had failed to turn up 
by eight p.m. (1700 GMT), two hours after the talks were 
scheduled to open. 
  The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which issued a unilateral 
ceasefire declaration earlier Saturday, sent only one 
representative, secretary-general Theogene Rudasingwa. 
Rudasingwa told reporters that he was willing to discuss 
ceasefire conditions with military officers, but rejected talks 
with members of the interim government which the rebels do not 
recognise. "I came here with two objectives, to talk to the 
secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity Salim 
Ahmad Salim, and to talk to Tanzanian officials," Rudasingwa 
said. 
  He expressed pessimism about the likelihood of the 
government 
acccepting rebel conditions for a ceasefire starting at midnight 
(2100 GMT) Monday, including an end to violence that has cost 
tens of thousands of lives, and an international investigation 
into the massacres. "Based on their track record, I don't think 
their response is going to be positive," Rudasingwa said. 
  A Rwandan diplomat meanwhile declared there would be no 
official government reaction to the ceasefire proposals because, 
he said, the rebels were responsible for the violence. He 
accused the rebels of boycotting the talks by sending only one 
representative. 
  A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
meanwhile 
declined to comment on the ceasefire declaration because the 
world body had been informed of the proposals directly but had 
learned of them from reporters. 
  The death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious 
April 6 plane crash rekindled a three-year civil war between the 
rebels, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, and the army, 
drawn mostly from the majority Hutus.

  [Excerpts] Arusha, Tanzania, April 23 (AFP) -- Planned 
talks Saturday [23 April] between Rwanda's rebels and government 
aimed at ending an ethnic bloodbath were called off as the 
government delegation failed to show up, Tanzanian officials 
said. 
  The sole rebel delegate meanwhile refused to negotiate with 
members of the interim government, proclaimed after the death of 
President Juvenal Habyarimana plunged Rwanda into frenzied 
bloodletting which left tens of thousands dead. 
  Rwandan Interior Minister Faustin Munyazesa, accompanied by 
two senior military officers, reportedly drove to Goma in 
eastern Zaire and boarded a UN plane for Arusha. But they had 
not arrived in this northern Tanzanian town by 10 P.M. (1900 
GMT). 
  Tanzanian foreign ministry officials said the talks might go 
ahead Sunday if the government delegation arrived. [passage 
omitted] 
  UN special envoy to Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, 
meanwhile declined to comment on the ceasefire declaration 
because the world body had not been informed of the proposals 
directly, but had learned of them from reporters. [passage 
omitted] 
  Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers were killed, and the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda scaled down its force from 2,500 to 
270 troops. 
  Booh-Booh said earlier that UN peacekeepers evacuated from 
Rwanda might return if the talks produced a ceasefire. "I have 
been authorised by the (UN) secretary-general to keep 1,000 
troops in Nairobi so that if we get a ceasefire they can be 
brought back quickly," Booh-Booh said. 
  Organisation of African Unity secretary-general Salim Ahmed 
Salim, also here for the talks, expressed outrage at the UN 
decision to withdraw almost all its peacekeepers from Rwanda. 
Aid agencies have also condemned the pullout of about 1,000 
peacekeepers which they said left Rwandan civilians 
unprotected. But Salim said the UN peacekeepers could return 
and would "have an important role to play" if a ceasefire was 
agreed by both sides. 
  He said the massacres should be investigated and the 
responsibility of both sides determined. But he added: "Some of 
these massacres were committed by elements of the security 
services."

  [Text] The meeting scheduled to take place in Arusha 
yesterday between representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] and those of the Rwandan Government Army did not take 
place. It was at the initiative of the facilitator, Tanzanian 
President Mwinyi, who [words indistinct]. 
  It is thus obvious that the RPF cannot hold talks with a 
delegation entirely composed of people known for having taken 
part in the massacres of thousands of innocent people and who 
continue to do so. The RPF's position is so clear and justified 
that even the international community should not be [words

collaboration with the leaders of the sham government. 
  The second condition is that the Presidential Guards should

  [Excerpts] The peace talks on the Rwandan conflict, which 
were scheduled to begin in Arusha today, did not take place 
following the failure by the Rwandan Government to arrive in

were ordinary discussions between the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] secretary general, Theogene Rudasingwa, and the chairman 
of the talks, the prime minister and first vice president, John 
Malecela, the talks were also attended by OAU Secretary General 
Salim Ahmed Salim. 
  Commenting on the peace talks, Dr. Salim expressed the need 
for a cease-fire agreement and appealed to all African countries 
and the international community to make more efforts in order to 
stop further killings of the Rwandan people [words indistinct].

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Rwanda: The Arusha meeting has 
failed. The representatives of the Rwandan Armed Forces did not 
turn up and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] delegation left 
early this afternoon. However, the UN special representative, 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, wants to see some positive signs. Anne 
Corpet got through to him in Arusha earlier today: 
  [Begin Booh-Booh recording] I do not think that it was the 
leader... [changes thought] The RPF secretary general was 
received by the prime minister and the OAU secretary general 
this morning. I was received after him, and I was told that 
some proposals about a possible agreement concerning the 
cease-fire were made to him and that he was intending to get in 
touch with the leader of his party. He will give the official 
reaction of his party tomorrow. He has left for Nairobi to get 
in touch with this person. In that respect, we cannot say that 
it is a failure. 
  What concerns me is the hoax played by the representative of 
the Rwandan government. We have not had any news from this 
delegation. It was said that it was now in Goma, now in 
Kinshasa, now in Nairobi, and their absence here is a major 
handicap in the contacts we have to establish. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] As for the fighting, it 
continued all day in Kigali according to the United Nations. 
[passage omitted] We have just heard from Medecins Sans 
Frontieres Belgium that 170 Rwandan wounded who were in the 
hospital of Butare have been slaughtered by the Rwandan 
presidential guard since Saturday morning, yesterday morning. 
This was reported by Medecins Sans Frontieres Belgium, which 
also said that its team has had to leave the town of Butare.

  [Text] The Government of Tanzania has again stressed its 
intention to continue seeking ways to bring about peace in 
Rwanda in order to save the lives of Rwandans. This was 
expressed by the minister of foreign affairs, Joseph Rwegasira, 
at a news conference regarding the peace talks which were 
scheduled to take place in Arusha today. 
  Rwegasira said the delegation of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, 
RPF, led by its secretary general, Theogene Rudasingwa, vowed to 
stop fighting in Rwanda tomorrow and he stressed the need for 
all sides involved in the conflict to implement the Arusha peace 
agreement. 
  However, Rwegasira, on behalf of the prime minister and 
first 
vice president, John Malecela, who is the chairman of the 
current talks, said even if the delegation of the Rwandan 
Government failed to arrive either today or tomorrow, the 
government [of Tanzania] would use diplomatic channels to 
communicate with that side to restore peace in Rwanda through a 
cease-fire. 
  The UN secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has 
called 
on both sides fighting in Rwanda to stop the killings 
immediately and reach an agreement to implement the resolve for 
peace, reached in Arusha last year. In a statement issued in 
Arusha today, the UN secretary general called on both sides to 
cooperate with the UN team which is assisting them so that the 
team can fulfill its duties as directed by the UN Security 
Council. Butrus-Ghali also expressed his concern over the 
prevailing situation in Rwanda, where these two groups are not 
showing signs of ending their conflict [words indistinct]. Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations has decided to let its 
peace-keeping force stay in Rwanda, provided that the two sides 
stop fighting and stop killing officers of the United Nations in 
Rwanda and other aid organization officials and innocent 
civilians.

  [Text] Arusha, Tanzania, April 23 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels 
declared a unilateral ceasefire from midnight (2100 GMT) Monday 
[25 April] ahead of peace talks to open here later Saturday, but 
said it would only hold if the government agreed to end ethnic 
bloodletting. A "unilateral declaration of ceasefire" signed by 
rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe and 
issued in this northern Tanzanian town blamed the massacres of 
tens of thousands of Rwandans on the "presidential guard, armed 
civilians and militias." 
  It called for a "cessation of hostilities" to get food and 
medicine to tens or possibly hundreds of thousands of displaced 
people and "bring this conflict to a peaceful settlement." 
  The death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious 
April 6 plane crash triggered an ethnic bloodbath and rekindled 
the three-year civil war. 
  The rebel declaration said the ceasefire would be 
conditional 
on the government forces "controlling all killings and acts of 
violence in areas under their control within 96 hours of the 
coming into force of this declaration." Another condition was 
that the government forces accept an international inquiry into 
the killings and allow those found responsible to be punished. 
  It also made the end of fighting dependent on the government 
forces agreeing to joint security patrols with the rebels to 
stop atrocities. 
  It also said the government must agree to joint control of 
the airport and safe corridors for humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Fighting continued in Kigali today. The Arusha 
meeting between Rwandan Armed Forces and the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] has not yet started. The RPF has declared a 
unilateral cease-fire, which is to begin at 2100 on Monday [25 
April]. The RPF is setting certain conditions. The second RPF 
Vice President Denis Polisi was interviewed by Muriel Pomponne: 
  [Begin recording] [Polisi] This cease-fire can only begin 
when Rwandan soldiers and the militias of the MRND [Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR 
[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] stop the killing of 
civilians. Either these soldiers and these militias stop the 
massacres themselves, or if they do not, I believe that the RPF, 
having a moral obligation to defend the Rwandans, will defend 
them. 
  [Pomponne] Are you telling us that the announcement of this 
cease-fire is not certain? 
  [Polisi] The cease-fire? We declared it in all sincerity. 
The other party must now accept the condition. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Extreme confusion prevails in Rwanda. Fighting 
is continuing in Kigali, while no progress has been made in 
Arusha. The meeting between the belligerents announced by the 
United Nations has still not taken place. Anne Corpet reports: 
  [Corpet] In Arusha, these peace talks are still indeed 
awaited. They have not been cancelled officially, although the 
Rwandan Government delegation has not arrived. The Rwandan 
interior minister is believed to be in Goma, in Zaire, with two 
army chief officers. A UN plane is ready to take them to 
Arusha, but the plane has not taken off yet. 
  For its part, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] sent its 
secretary-general, Theogene Rudasingwa, by land, and we have 
just heard that he left Arusha this morning. However, he 
proposed a conditional cease-fire yesterday which would come 
into force as of tomorrow. 
  [Announcer] Things seem to be even more complicated since 
another mediation is reported to have taken place or to be 
taking place in Gbadolite, in Zaire, according to some sources: 
  [Corpet] Yes, it is believed to be taking place in Zaire 
under the aegis of Marshall Mobutu. The Rwandan ambassador in 
Belgium has announced that a meeting took place last week 
between delegations of the RPF and of the Rwandan Government. 
According to the Rwandan ambassador, the two sides reached an 
agreement on a text providing for a cease-fire which was 
supposed to be signed today. The trouble is that the RPF has 
denied meeting the Rwandan Government and denies the existence 
of such an agreement. Moreover, the RPF did not attend the 
meeting which is reported to have been scheduled for today in 
Zaire to sign the cease-fire. 
  From a diplomatic point of view, confusion has the upper 
hand, with two negotiation sites and two cease-fire proposals, 
but no official meeting between the two sides. Meanwhile, on 
the ground in Rwanda, as you said, fighting is continuing 
without respite. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Faustin Twangiramungu, chosen by the Arusha </F>
Conference to become transitional prime minister, by Robin 
White, in a "neighboring country"; date not given -- first 
paragraph is announcer's introduction] 
  [Text] One of the survivors of the atrocities that 
followed the death of President Habyarimana, in which 
presidential guardsmen and militias apparently sought out and 
slaughtered ministers close to the president, was the man chosen 
by the Arusha Conference to become transitional prime minister, 
Faustin Twangiramungu. He is in hiding in neighboring country. 
Robin White got in touch with him, and asked him if he thought 
he had a role in sorting out the mess that Rwandans are in: 
  [Begin recording] [Twangiramungu] Of course yes. Well, as 
far as Rwandans are concerned, most of them have respected the 
peace agreement. Therefore, I think I still have a role to 
play. Our intention was to have this broad-based transitional 
government set in place. But as you are probably informed, we 
had some delay tactics initiated mainly by the political party 
called the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development] which is the political party of the late president. 
What they really wanted was to wage another war against the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and probably win it. But it 
appeared that they are not going to win this war. 
  Secondly, they did not want what we call and what is 
contained in this peace aagreement, the power sharing. And we 
believe that this power sharing is the only solution to the 
situation we have in Rwanda. 
  [White] So, what you yourself propose should happen now? 
  [Twangiramungu] Well, what I do propose, is not a military 
solution. What I propose is of course a political solution. 
And a political solution requires that RPF meets these military 
officers and decides the cease-fire. But to get to this 
cease-fire, of course, there are some preconditions. In certain 
place, they have to accept that... [pauses] to denounce this 
government which is self-proclaimed. Second, they have to 
(?disband) the Presidential Guard. 
  [White] It sounds to me as if you have rather more in common 
with the rebel RPF than you do with the other side now? 
  [Twangiramungu] Well, it is not to having common views. I 
believe it is a question of being practical and being pragmatic 
with regard to the situation which prevails. After all, who 
started these incidents which have cost us a lot? This is the 
Presidential Guards. 
  [White] Will you be going to the Arusha peace meeting? 
  [Twangiramungu] Well, if I am invited, yes I will. And I 
think it would be better for me to go there and give my views on 
this particular issue. And I am still insisting that I be 
invited to go to Arusha. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- ANC Johannesburg 
sub-regional executive member Susan Keane was killed in Sunday's 
[24 April] carbomb blast which rocked central Johannesburg on 
Sunday. Ms Keane was the 41st candidate on the regional election 
list. 
  Another regional executive member and regional candidate, 
Joan Fubbs, who was with Miss Keane, survived unhurt. Ms Keane 
died in hospital. 
  Speaking at a press briefing at the ANC PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices, PWV premier 
candidate Tokyo Sexwale described this as a cowardly action 
designed to disrupt the elections. Mr Sexwale confirmed an 
earlier report from a man claiming to be an eye witnesses, who 
saw a white person fleeing from a white car just before the 
explosion. 
  According to ANC information at least seven people were 
killed and 45 injured. However, police have put the injury toll 
at 92. 
  Mr Sexwale called on all people to remain calm. "There must 
be maximum restraint here and there must be no retaliation 
because we don't know what is involved. Police were 
"co-operating extremely well", he said. 
  "This type of action in Johannesburg is intended to send 
indications of negativity through the country and abroad." 
  He said the election would go ahead "full steam". "The 
election must proceed. This (blast) was intended to frighten 
away voters." 
  He said the security forces and police would be out to 
protect voters and to ensure elections went ahead. 
  Mr Sexwale said it was not possible to identify a specific 
target so far but believed the ANC offices were the intended 
target.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
24 April] 
  [Text] Once again enemies of democracy have plunged our 
country and its people into a period of mourning with a car 
bomb-blast that left 9 people dead and 92 others wounded in the 
Johannesburg city centre on Sunday 24 April. 
  According to eye-witness accounts, a white man was seen 
alighting from the car used in the blast and rushing away from 
the scene minutes before the explosion. In the ensuing 
explosion, ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Cosatu [Congress 
of South African Trade Unions] offices in the vicinity, private 
homes and business premises were damaged. Windows, 
communication lines and computers at ANC headquarters and 
regional offices were seriously affected. 
  A member of the ANC local government transitional team and 
ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional 
elections candidate Susan Keane, who was on her way to a meeting 
at ANC PWV regional office was killed. Her colleague and a 
member of the ANC PWV regional executive committee Joan Fubbs 
escaped unhurt but had to be treated for shock at a local 
hospital. 
  Although the ANC cannot at this stage point accusing fingers 
at a specific organisation or persons, the ANC believes that the 
blast is an attack on peace, democracy and the forthcoming April 
27 elections by a tiny minority. Their plans must not succeed. 
  The ANC appeals to all our people, black and white not to be 
provoked into rash actions but to hand down their verdict on 
such heinous acts by massively turning out to the polls on April 
27 to vote for democracy. 
  The ANC extends its deepest sympathy to members of the 
bereaved families and wish those wounded a speedy recovery. We 
express our sympathy with all those whose homes and business 
premises have been damaged. 
  In this regard, the ANC dips its banners in memory of one of 
our glorious daughters of our country, our beloved Susan Keane. 
It is unfortunate that she died at a time when all she had 
lived and struggled for throughout her life is about to come to 
fruition. Our people deserve the right to live without fear of 
violence and intimidation. 
  The ANC calls for a speedy and thorough investigation into 
the cold-blooded murder and injury of innocent men and women of 
our country. In this context, we call for the arrest and 
prosecution of those responsible.

  [Text] Cape Town April 24 SAPA -- State President F W de 
Klerk on Sunday [24 April] expressed shock and outrage at 
Sunday's car bomb explosion in Johannesburg, saying crimes of 
this nature would not stop the election. Nine people died and 92 
others were injured when the car bomb ripped through several 
streets in downtown Johannesburg shortly before 10AM on Sunday. 
  Reacting to the incident, Mr de Klerk said there was no 
possibility that radical minorities would be allowed to 
frustrate the will of the vast majority of the South African 
people. "All they will achieve will be to add to the unnecessary 
suffering of innocent citizens who have already suffered enough." 
  Mr de Klerk said the SA Police would do everything in their 
power to bring the perpetrators to justice. Those responsible 
for the blast would be tracked down relentlessly and punished 
with the full rigour of the law. 
  President de Klerk also condemned the attack on African 
National Congress members and Independent Electoral Commission 
monitors in Ulundi on Saturday in which at least three people 
were killed.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel, the National Party [NP], the ANC Youth League and 
the African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] on Sunday [24 
April] all expressed their "shock and horror" at Sunday 
morning's bomb blast in central Johannesburg. 
  Mr Kriel said in a telephone statement: "Those who believe 
that they will prevent or disrupt the election by such terrorism 
have completely missed the bus. "Such mindless acts of terrorism 
will not stop the birth of democracy in South Africa. 
  "Those responsible for this outrage will achieve nothing 
except strengthening the determination of the people of South 
Africa to vote for democracy." 
  The NP urged police to do their utmost to apprehend the 
perpetrators of "this cowardly deed". "South Africa can not 
afford this kind of terrorist deed. It is time to ensure 
stability." 
  The ANC Youth League [ANCYL] also expressed its disgust at 
the bombing, saying it was a frightening demonstration of the 
"disrespect for human life in those who are opposed to the 
changes that must be brought about by the coming election. 
  "ANCYL calls on all the youth and people of South Africa to 
hold their hands together and move forward to a peaceful, 
non-racial and democratic country. 
  "This blast is an indication of what will happen to the 
country if we don't go beyond apartheid," the ANCYL statement 
said. 
  The ACDP condemned the incident "with the contempt it 
deserves". "Too many lives have been lost already and we cannot 
afford to lose more lives," it said. 
  All those commenting extended their condolences to the 
families of the victims and wished those injured a speedy 
recovery.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- Bomb blasts damaged at 
least four polling stations on Sunday [25 April] night and 
Monday morning. The stations hit by the bombings were in 
Potgietersrus in the Northern Transvaal, Boksburg north on the 
East Rand, Bloemhof in the Western Transvaal and two in 
Steynsburg in the Eastern Cape. 
  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Ben van der 
Ross said the IEC was examining alternative sites and other 
requirements that had arisen as a result of damage to voting 
stations. 
  The IEC did not foresee any difficulties in establishing 
alternative polling booths at short notice or directing voters 
to nearby stations. Further information would be made known to 
affected communities through the nearest IEC sub-provincial 
office. 
  "The IEC deplores the loss of life in the spate of bombings 
during the night and this morning," Mr van der Ross said. The 
two explosions in Steynsburg on Sunday night caused an estimated 
R10,000 damage to the Khayamandi community hall polling station, 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported. 
  A second explosion rocked the town hall a short while later, 
causing slight damage. There were no injuries in either 
explosion and no-one had claimed responsibility by Monday 
morning. It was not yet known what type of explosives were used.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- At least two people 
were killed and 30 injured in a bomb blast at a Germiston taxi 
rank on the East Rand on Monday [25 April] morning. However, an 
East Rand police official earlier said seven people were killed 
according to someone who was on the scene of the 8.45 AM blast 
at the taxi rank on the corners of Odendaal and Simpson Streets. 
  East Rand police spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said extensive 
structural damage was caused in the immediate vicinity of the 
blast and human remains could be seen from the nearby Trust Bank 
building. 
  Four minibuses were severely damaged. An area about 100 m 
[meters] around the scene of the explosion was cordoned off. 
The injured were taken to the William Cruywagen, 
Boksburg/Benoni and Natalspruit hospitals. 
  The type of explosives used was unknown, but experts on the 
scene were sifting though the debris for clues. No-one had 
claimed responsibility and police said they were not warned 
about the blast. 
  Congress of SA Trade Unions [COSATU] Spokesman Neil Coleman 
said the Germiston blast took place "right outside" a COSATU 
sub-regional office in the East Rand city. 
  The series of blasts which started with a huge car bomb in 
central Johannesburg on Sunday was clearly a co-odinated attack 
on the ANC and its allies in the run-up to the election, said Mr 
Coleman. He urged police to take immediate action to ensure the 
safety of people using or finding themselves near premises 
occupied by the ANC and its allies. 
  "A start could be made by clearing all cars within a certain 
radius from buildings used by our allies," Mr Coleman said. Mr 
Coleman added information reaching COSATU indicated the 
Germiston blast was a car bomb. [Johannesburg SAPA in English at 
0907 GMT on 25 April reports that "at least eight people died 
and 33 were injured in a bomb blast at a Germiston taxi rank on 
the East Rand on Monday morning, police confirmed."]

  [Text] Taxi commuters in Germiston are still shaken after a 
massive bomb went off at a taxi rank this morning. Ken Daniels 
went to the scene. He spoke to Manana Makanya: 
  [Begin recording] [Daniels] The scene around the area is 
totally devastated. There's wreckages of minibus taxis, there 
are bits of bodies lying about, some bits of bodies have been 
thrown as far as a 100 meters from the scene, and windows are 
broken for several blocks around the area. 
  [Makanya] Do you have any idea how many people have been 
killed? 
  [Daniels] Well, the police said at this stage two have been 
confirmed, and 30 people injured, but just as we were leaving 
the scene a few minutes ago they said that another body had been 
found, so the death toll is three, but it could even be more by 
the time the morning's over because several people have been 
very badly injured. 
  [Makanya] Any clues yet about the kind of explosive used? 
  [Daniels] No the police don't know yet. The bomb disposal 
people are still going through the area. It's being cordoned 
off, we haven't been allowed to the area where the bomb blast 
took place, in case there is another bomb there, so they're 
looking through it, and the explosive experts are trying to 
establish exactly what the cause of the explosion was. 
  [Makanya] And so at this stage the motive is also unknown I 
guess? 
  [Daniels] The motive is unknown, but it does appear that 
the....[pauses] A police spokesman, Captain Wikus Weber, did say 
that the target seems to be the taxi rank, which is frequented 
mainly by black passengers on minibus taxis, and it appears that 
the bomb blasts all round the country at the moment might be a 
part of this campaign which people think is probably a rightwing 
campaign. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- A breakthrough was 
expected shortly in investigations into the central Johannesburg 
and Germiston bomb blasts, SA [South African] Police [SAP] 
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said on Monday [25 April]. 
  Police had increased to R1 million [rand] the reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those 
responsible for the blasts, which left at least 17 people dead, 
Gen van der Merwe said in a statement. 
  The SAP was sparing no effort in hunting down those 
responsible for the mindless acts of terrorism and all available 
resources, including the best detectives, would be deployed, the 
general said. 
  "I call on all South Africans to unite and assist the SAP in 
fighting this civil threat to public safety and democracy in our 
country." 
  He called for calm and understanding from the public and 
said 
the SAP would immediately institute wide-ranging measures to 
prevent similar atrocities. Areas would be cordoned off and 
snap searches conducted. The SAP remained committed to 
combating terrorism "tooth and nail and will not fail in its 
duty to protect the birth of democracy in South Africa. I am 
able to say that investigations into these outrages have reached 
the stage where it is hoped that a breakthrough will take place 
shortly."

  [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- Violence erupted in 
the KwaZulu capital of Ulundi, where the headquarters of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] are sited, on Saturday [23 April], 
with reports saying at least two people were killed, several 
others injured and vehicles torched in clashes between IFP and 
African National Congress supporters. 
  A KwaZulu Police official in Ulundi confirmed the fighting. 
"Our men rushed to the scene of the fighting in Ulundi, but we 
don't have exact figures on the number of dead or injured. A 
senior official is coming here to deal with the media," he said 
from the KwaZulu Police pro [as received] headquarters in Ulundi. 
  Both IFP and ANC officials confirmed the clashes, but 
differed in their versions of events. Earlier, IFP President 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State 
election roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi, leaving 
hundreds of supporters waiting at a rally in Welkom. 
  KwaZulu government Durban representative Rev Jabulani 
Mdlalose said the chief minister had been "summoned" back to 
Ulundi. 
  In its version of events, the IFP said an ANC convoy was 
distributing pamphlets in downtown Ulundi and reportedly abused 
residents who did not want to accept the documents. "An 
altercation developed and ANC members opened fire on a group of 
residents. At this time the full extent of casualties is not 
known, however at least one resident, Siphiwe Ngcobo, was 
seriously wounded by ANC gunfire. 
  "It has been reported that two ANC vehicles were then set on 
fire by angry residents," the IFP said. 
  The incident, the IFP said, took place along the King 
Dinizulu Highway in Ulundi. 
  The ANC in Johannesburg said it had received reports that 
two 
people may have died in the clashes. 
  A Constable Vilikazi at the Ulundi police station confirmed 
that ANC canvassers were by 6.25PM still holed up in the 
station, where they were seeking sanctuary. Saying further 
details would be available from the KwaZulu Police pro, he added 
the ANC canvassers were being protected by the policemen there. 
  "It is too sensitive, we are trying to save them. We are not 
allowed to say how many people are here. We are getting the 
right people to speak to you," he said, refusing to give his 
full name. 
  ANC media spokesperson Carl Niehaus confirmed his 
organisation had received reports of fighting in Ulundi. "We 
demand an immediate response from the police and officials 
regulating the state of emergency in Natal on events today. We 
call on all parties to condemn all attacks and expose those 
preventing free and fair electioneering."

<F P=106> [Report by M. Merton and N. Lewis] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- A stand-off between 
African National Congress supporters holed up in the Ulundi 
police station, KwaZulu, and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] members 
gathered outside the premises seemed to have ended on Saturday 
[23 April] evening following the intervention of IFP leader 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  The ANC supporters and Independent Electoral Commission 
monitors sought sanctuary at the police station earlier on 
Saturday after two people were killed and two vehicles torched 
in clashes between the ANC members and IFP supporters in 
downtown Ulundi. 
  At least five other members of the ANC contingent, 
canvassing 
political support in the northern Natal town -- where the IFP 
has its headquarters -- are still missing. 
  ANC lawyer John Wills told SAPA that six ANC members and 
four 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] monitors were in the 
police cells "in protective custody", awaiting the arrival of 
armoured-plated vehicles to transport them out of the area. 
  He said at least 200 IFP supporters were gathered outside 
the 
police station. "The ANC and IEC members have been holed up in 
the station for the past four or five hours. The situation is 
really tense, but the crowd outside is dispersing now," he said 
from the Ulundi police station at about 7.10PM on Saturday. 
  Chief Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State election 
roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi on hearing of the 
news of the fighting in Ulundi. 
  He arrived at the police station shortly before 7PM to 
resolve the stand-off. 
  Clashes erupted in the KwaZulu capital on Saturday afternoon 
after an ANC convoy entered the town to distribute election 
literature and canvass political support. 
  The IFP claimed the ANC members attacked its supporters 
after 
they refused to accept ANC pamphlets, but this was strongly 
denied by the ANC in Johannesburg.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- The ANC on Saturday 
[23 April] night welcomed Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's intervention into the conflict between 
IFP supporters and ANC canvassers in Ulundi which killed at 
least two people and injured several others. An ANC statement 
said ANC President Nelson Mandela immediately contacted King 
Goodwill Zwelithini who expressed his serious concern, saying 
the events in Ulundi had deeply distressed him. 
  Mr Mandela also contacted Police Commissioner General Jan 
der 
Merwe who ordered more troops into the area. 
  "The continuation of political intolerance and daily murders 
may not be tolerated any longer and all parties have a duty to 
take decisive action to bring an immediate end to it," the 
statement said. 
  The ANC demanded the IFP should "take immediate and strong 
party disciplinary measures against any of their members who 
were involved. 
  The role of the KwaZulu Police also needed to be 
investigated 
because of eye witness allegations that police failed to stop 
the attack on ANC campaigners. The ANC urged the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] to investigate these 
allegations. 
  It said it was crucial all necessary steps should be taken 
to 
ensure the freedom of all parties to campaign throughout Natal 
and specifically in KwaZulu. 
  IEC Natal monitoring head Bheki Sibiya told SAPA it would 
investigate the incident to see if the electoral code had been 
breached. If there was a prima facie case against those who had 
threatened the ANC and IEC members, the IEC would prosecute. The 
other, preferred, alternative was mediation, Mr Sibiya said. 
  Clashes started after 17 ANC members, accompanied by 
Independent Electoral Commission monitors, drove to Ulundi 
around noon on Saturday to distribute election pamphlets and 
canvass political support. Most of the canvassers were Congress 
of South African Trade Union Members. 
  The IFP and ANC versions of events on Saturday afternoon 
differed. While the IFP said ANC members opened fire on 
residents, the ANC said its canvassers were attacked and their 
two vans set alight. 
  Five ANC members fled and are still missing. Six others and 
four IEC monitors took refuge in the Ulundi police station. 
After about five hours, an armour-plated vehicle brought the ten 
to safety in Eshowe.

  [Text] One of the ANC members who sought refuge in the 
police station at Ulundi yesterday says he was rescued by white 
policemen from almost certain death. 
  Provincial election candidate Welcome Mthimkulu has alleged 
that the KwaZulu policemen were ready to hand the ANC canvassers 
over to the mob outside. He said that a number of white 
policemen, however, had taken them to a safe place until they 
could be removed to Eshowe. Two people were killed in the 
clash, eight are still missing, and the ANC has called on the 
Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] to launch a search for them. Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi was forced to interrupt his [Orange] Free 
State election campaign yesterday to intervene in the conflict 
in Ulundi. Dr. Buthelezi persuaded the crowd to disperse after 
it had gathered outside the police station. 
  The ANC supporters and IEC monitors were subsequently taken 
in armored vehicles to Eshowe.

  [Text] The death toll in yesterday's attack on ANC election 
canvassers at Ulundi has risen to three. 
  A spokesman for the KwaZulu Police says the latest victim 
was 
among the 10 canvassers who had sought refuge at the police 
station. He said he died after being shot, apparently as the 
refugees were being taken to safety. A search for eight ANC 
supporters missing since the incident has so far proved 
fruitless. It's still unclear what exactly happened at the 
police station after the arrival of IFP leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi to deal with the problem. One of the ANC members who 
escaped to the police station said he was rescued by white 
policemen from almost certain death. ANC provincial election 
candidate, Welcome Mthimkulu, alleges that the KwaZulu policemen 
were ready to hand the ANC members over to the mob outside. 
  He said a number of white policemen, however, had taken them 
in armored vehicles to a place of safety until they could be 
transferred to Eshowe.

  [Text] Cape Town April 25 SAPA -- Members of the public 
should feel assured of effective protection while voting in the 
election, State President F. W. de Klerk said on Monday [25 
April] morning. "Contingency plans are in place for the 
election. We have high manpower levels and we will not allow 
the right wing or anyone else to disrupt the process," he said. 
  Mr de Klerk, on his way from an hour-long cabinet meeting to 
a National Party caucus meeting before the special parliamentary 
session, was reacting to questions about the car bomb explosion 
in central Johannesburg on Sunday and its possible effect on the 
election. "We have achieved virtually full inclusiveness and 
are now dealing with a small handful of radicals on the right 
and the left. We have maximum security deployed across the 
country. This type of situation does offer a risk, but I can 
assure the public of effecting protection while voting." 
  It is believed the brief cabinet meeting was used to discuss 
the possibility of amnesty for security forces, the car bomb 
blast and the events in Ulundi over the weekened where several 
people were killed while putting up election posters. 
  Mr de Klerk said no decision had yet been taken on the 
indemnity, but added the cabinet would be meeting again later on 
Monday.

<F P=106> [By Kurt Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 22 SAPA -- More than 93,000 
policemen and 67 companies of SA Defence Force troops would be 
on duty to protect voters on election days, the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] and security force officers said on 
Friday [22 April]. At a news conference on security arrangements 
for the election, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said 
it would be unrealistic to expect no intimidation or attempted 
disruptions on voting days. 
  "But the security forces are alert and ready to deal with 
them," he said. 
  SA Police Deputy Commissioner Gen Johan Swart said policing 
the elections would be the most significant and daunting task 
ever undertaken by the SAP [South African Police]. "I believe 
the police have the expertise and the motivation to take on this 
enormous responsibility. We realise the eyes of the world will 
be focused on South Africa. We will do everything in our power 
to ensure the elections will be a success." 
  Each police region had a detailed plan in place and every 
policeman who would be on duty at the 9,000 polling stations had 
received special training. All available police reservists had 
been called up and 8,000 had responded. "We have placed the 
entire police force on full standby. We will engage 93,000 men 
and women for functional duties. In each police region we have 
appointed teams of top detectives to deal with intimidation, to 
investigate as quickly as possible and to bring perpertrators to 
book," said Gen Swart. 
  Police would be assisted by thousands of traffic officers 
and 
civil defence agencies which were on full alert. 
  "I wish to assure the public to remain calm. There is no 
cause for alarm or over-reaction. Security forces will maintain 
high visibility." 
  Gen Swart said there were small groups considering 
disrupting 
the elections and he warned them they would be arrested and 
detained until after the elections. Police would do everything 
possible to refuse bail. "There are areas where we expect 
trouble. We will monitor these areas but we will not tell you 
where they are," he told journalists. 
  SADF [South African Defense Force] Communications Chief 
Director Gen Gert Opperman said the army was committed to the 
process of change and would do everything in its power to 
contribute to free and fair elections next week. "We have 
called up members of part-time forces so that we have sufficient 
manpower. We appeal to employers, the men called up, their 
relatives and friends to support the call-up as it is in the 
national interest. Without them the SADF will not be able to 
perform its expected task." 
  Tons of ballot papers had been stored at army bases and the 
air force would transport ballot papers to polling stations. 
Operational duties had been well planned in conjunction with the 
SAP. Troops would be deployed near polling stations and would 
also supply medical support. 
  The army would deploy 67 companies and more troops were due 
to report for duty before April 27. Gen Opperman said he was not 
in a position to give the exact number. There would be flexible 
and mobile deployment making it unnecessary to have large 
numbers of troops at every polling station. 
  The National Peacekeeping Force was not part of the SADF and 
would be disbanded soon after the election. The NPKF would be 
deployed on the East Rand in a support role. 
  "We pride ourselves on our professionalism. We are above 
party politics. We do not choose sides and we will act against 
any individual who threatens the process regardless of political 
affiliations. We are from the nation and for the nation," Gen 
Opperman said. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said voters who brought firearms or 
other 
dangerous weapons to polling stations would be 
arrested."Contrary to perceptions, security forces will be 
entitled to carry arms and will do so at the polling stations. 
Police personnel will be present within the inner perimeter of 
polling stations and will at all times be under the direction of 
the presiding electoral officer at that polling station." 
  Mr Justice Kriegler criticised a Sunday newspaper report 
headlined "Rough Ride on Big Day", which suggested continuous 
friction between the IEC and the SAP. 
  "I met with editors on an off-the-record basis and I 
believed 
I could rely on the integrity of all those present. Clearly I 
was wrong. The report is untrue, malicious, not in the public 
interest, and is calculated to induce fear into the minds of the 
electorate." 
  Asked for his hopes and fears for the election, Mr Justice 
Kriegler raised chuckles by repyling: "I hope it goes well and I 
fear that it won't."

  [Text] At least 10 people have already been arrested for 
attempting to disrupt the elections, and strong measures will be 
taken against anyone who tries to hamper the election process. 
This is the promise given at IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] headquarters yesterday at a special briefing on 
security at polling stations. 
  [Correspondent Arlene Wainstein] Independent Electoral 
Commission chairman, Judge Johann Kriegler, says it's 
unrealistic to expect that there won't be some problems. 
Flanked by two high-ranking police and army officials, he said 
firearms would not be allowed at polling stations. 
  [Kriegler] Voters who disregard this request and instruction 
will be liable for arrest and prosecution. 
  [Wainstein] Nearly 100,000 members of the police will be on 
duty during the critical voting days next week; and they are 
ready to arrest anyone who tries to disrupt the voting process. 
  [Police Commissioner Johan Swart] And they will be detained 
in the police cells until after the election. And the South 
African Police will do everything in our power to oppose any 
application for bail. 
  [Wainstein] The SADF [South African Defense Force] also has 
at least 67 companies of troops on standby with more due to 
report in the next few days.

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Chandler and Jo-Anne Collinge] </F>
  [Text] Extremists are secretly planning to disrupt next 
week's election in some platteland areas, and white suburban 
residents in a number of urban areas are preparing to barricade 
their suburbs. Planned disruptions by rightwingers include 
roadblocks on routes to polling stations and "friendly appeals" 
to people not to vote. 
  At Viljoenskroon in the northern [Orange] Free State, 
military watchtowers were set up at the entrance to the town 
yesterday. Floodlights were erected on the road from the nearby 
township. Rightwingers set up poles on which to place booms 
across the road. As the town declared itself "part of the 
volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] at 4 pm, rightwingers told all 
blacks to leave town by 3pm. Very few black people defied the 
order. Sources say violence should not be discounted as a 
factor in right-wing plans to disrupt the elections. Former 
SADF [South African Defence Force] officer Willem Ratte -- who 
led a Boerekommando [Boer Commando] group which occupied Fort 
Schanskop at the Voortrekker Monument in December -- claims to 
be organising "regional defence groups" in rural and urban 
areas. He said in Pretoria yesterday that it was largely to 
protect white areas against the National Peacekeeping Force 
[NPKF]. The NPKF has so far been deployed only on the East Rand. 
  Ratte's supporters have been holding meetings in the 
Pretoria, Verwoerdburg and Akasia area in particular, at which 
plans are being made for "protection of suburbs". Measures are 
said to include armed residents patrolling the areas, roads 
being barricaded, shopping centres being placed under guard, and 
pedestrians and motorists stopped "for identification purposes". 
  The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says it is moving 
"thousands of members" into an area stretching from the Northern 
Transvaal to the Cape border to ward off persecution or action 
against rightwingers, and says it will not be part of the 
election. The use of roadblocks, particularly in remote parts of 
the Transvaal and Free State, is said to be a key factor in 
intimidating people not to vote. 
  The South African Iron, Steel and Allied Industries Union 
has 
told its whites-only membership "to take every precaution". It 
has also told members that there could be power disruptions 
which could last a week. Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] 
has denied that electricity could be affected during the 
election period.

<F P=106> [News by Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Brits, Western Transvaal, April 23 SAPA -- Chaos and 
war were at South Africa's door, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] leader Eugene Terreblanche 
warned on Saturday [23 April] in the Western Transvaal where AWB 
members are preparing to "secure" the territory as a "base". He 
told a rally attended by 200 supporters at Brits it now made 
more sense to reach for the gunpowder than head for the ballot 
booth. "We don't want war, but we are not white colonists who 
will be driven from the country," Mr Terreblanche said. 
  He dismissed the pact for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] 
which Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen was to sign on 
Saturday as worthless because it did not guarantee a volkstaat. 
Gen Viljoen had become a "Brutus" to his own nation, and had 
become a part of the "sick" political system in South Africa. 
"While the rest of the AWB movement are dug in in the Western 
Transvaal, we say we do not have an agreement with the African 
National Congress which states South Africa should be a unitary 
state." 
  The area from the Northern Transvaal to the Cape border was 
being prepared as a base for rightwingers. Many had already 
moved into the area, and many thousands were still on their way, 
Mr Terreblanche said. Rightwingers would be able to live in 
this area where the "gangsters" from the new government would 
not be able to touch them. The hour had arrived for members of 
the security forces to make a decision on their allegiance, and 
whether they wanted to become "traitors" who fired on women and 
children of their own nation. 
  Mr Terreblanche knew white security force officers were 
preparing plans to act against rightwingers. "If you touch one 
rightwinger we will donner [hammer] you...," he said, the rest 
of the sentence being inaudible by the applause. 
  While the AWB had been ordered to withdraw from Mmabatho, it 
would never withdraw from the Western Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche 
said. "If anybody will have to withdraw, it will be the forces 
they want to send in against us." 
  He warned that if the AWB was forced into a fight, it would 
fight for the whole South Africa, and then decide where it would 
place blacks. 
  Mr Terreblanche said a chaotic situation would arise in 
South 
Africa within days or weeks, and then the AWB would restore law 
and order and take over the country. "Chaos and order is at the 
door. You are not heading for peace and prosperity. You are on 
your way to chaos. We don't want war, but we are not white 
colonists who will be driven from the country." The enemy would 
be levelled with the gravel, Mr Terreblanche said.

  [Text] The defense force has denied allegations that the 
Bothaville commando is involved in right-wing security 
arrangements at Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] Free State. 
Earlier this week right-wingers began erecting road blocks and 
watchtowers at the town. The defense force said in the 
statement that the commando was implementing a nationwide 
instruction to assess the situation in military commando areas 
to prepare for any eventuality after the election. The SADF 
[South African Defense Force] also rejected claims that the 
commando had been paid by the Viljoenskroon town council.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has 
sought the aid of the defense force to defuse the tense 
situation at Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] Free State where it 
is believed that right-wing extremists will soon man two 
watchtowers recently erected in the town. 
  The IEC's media officer in Bloemfontein, Mr. Rob Hadley, 
said 
that requests for meetings with the Viljoenskroon town council 
yesterday and today had proved fruitless and that the IEC had 
consequently asked the defense force to patrol the streets of 
the town on Wednesday and Thursday. He said the watchtowers 
were the subject of an investigation into alleged acts of 
intimidation by the Viljoenskroon town council.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Rees] </F>
  [Text] Bloemfontein April 24 SAPA -- SA Defence Force 
[SADF] troops have been sent to Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] 
Free State to ensure rightwingers do not disrupt elections this 
week, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Sunday 
[24 April]. This follows the erection by the 
rightwing-controlled town council of watchtowers and roadblocks 
at entrances to the northern Free State town. 
  Work on the "security measures" had been completed, though 
the rightwingers have assured police they do not plan to disrupt 
the historic poll, SA Police spokesman Adj Rudi van Zyl said. 
  All three access roads to the town now have two booms in 
place, and two watchtowers have been erected at the entrance to 
the Rammulotsi black township, which was reported Sunday to be 
very tense. None of the installations were staffed on Sunday 
night. 
  The rightwingers have said the security measures were simply 
precautions in case white Viljoenskroon needs protection from 
violence during or after the election. 
  The council was reported last week to have said the SADF was 
responsible for the roadblocks and watchtowers, though police 
sources on Sunday said this was a transparent attempt to 
transfer responsibility for their actions. 
  Military commando members had approached the town council in 
their private capacity and the town clerk and council had gone 
ahead with the security installations, the source said. 
  Police said members of the town council had made themselves 
unavailable for consultations on Sunday.

  [Text] The South African Army has become the latest 
institution to express serious concerns about the capabilities 
of the National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF]. The chief of the 
Army, General Hattingh Pretorius, said in Heidelberg in the 
Transvaal that the Defense Force was lately perceived as being 
the only organization that could ensure stability and protect 
the country from anarchy and chaos. He said the image of the 
SADF [South African Defense Force] was now more positive than 
that of any other security force.

<F P=106> [Report by Newton Kanhema and Guy Jepson] </F>
  [Text] One thousand members of the embattled National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] have been fired since its formation in 
late January, according to its commander, Major-General Gabriel 
Ramushwana. The former Venda military strongman also hinted at 
further purges of undisciplined force members after the 
spectacular failure of the NPKF in less than a week at the sharp 
end on the East Rand. A special investigation team is to probe 
allegations of misconduct and indiscipline against members of 
the multiparty force since its deployment in Thokoza, Katlehong 
and Vosloorus last week. 
  Wayward members are alleged to have held their commanding 
officer hostage for three hours in a de facato mutiny, disobeyed 
orders while on patrol, panicked under fire, consumed alcohol 
and smoked dagga [marijuana] on duty, and shot at the police. 
  Among the more startling allegations against the 
peacekeeping 
force told to WEEKEND STAR by an impeccable NPKF source was that 
some Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed wing] 
(MK) elements had passed on key intelligence on its operations 
on the East Rand to ANC-aligned self-defence units (SDUs). "We 
would strategise what we ought to be doing and before 
implementing the strategy the word would have been passed to the 
residents -- especially to the SDUs," said the source. "There 
is no trust between the SADF [South African Defense Force] and 
the MK soldiers. How can you describe an army which locks its 
own commander inside an amoured vehicle. They were sending 
messages to the people." 
  The NPKF, which had been fired on repeatedly by 
Inkatha-supporting hostel dwellers in Thokoza and Katlehong 
since its deployment, beat a hasty retreat on Wednesday as a 
full-scale war erupted between hostel dwellers and the SDUs. 
But before they left, at least 20 people had been killed, among 
them THE STAR's chief photographer Ken Oosterbroek, who was 
allegedly shot on Monday by a panicking NPKF member during a 
fierce three-day gunbattle in Thokoza. 
  The NPKF -- which will continue to perform "non-aggressive" 
duties in East Rand townships, such as providing escorts and 
protecting key points, schools and polling stations -- was 
replaced by the SADF, which had stabilised the area since the 
withdrawal of the controversial Internal Stability Unit in 
February. 
  At a joint press conference on Thursday, NPKF and SADF 
commanders explained that the two forces would remain under 
separate commands but would conduct joint operations. The SADF 
is to carry out "aggressive" tasks -- searches, foot and vehicle 
patrols and roadblocks -- in the trouble spots. Significantly, 
while the NPKF is tasked with "liaising with the community," the 
SADF is responsible for the liaison forums -- key dispute 
resolution bodies set up in conjunction with community leaders 
in February. 
  In an astonishing turn of events following heavy gunbattles 
in Thokoza on Monday and Tuesday, NPKF commander Colonel Quinton 
Painter was allegedly held hostage inside an armoured vehicle 
for three hours by MK elements within the NPKF. Painter had 
reportedly been due to attend a task force meeting which would 
include IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] representatives. He was 
reportedly freed after threatening to call ANC president Nelson 
Mandela. ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] premier 
candidate Tokyo Sexwale, who addressed MK force members 
privately in their barracks after the incident, subsequently 
called for Painter to be dismissed. 
  Sexwale's discussion with the MK members infuriated SADF 
elements in the force and drew strong criticism from 
Ramushwanna. "I do not accept any politicians coming into any 
of my barracks and addressing soldiers privately. We are an 
integrated force and we do not want unnecessary tensions," he 
said. 
  Commenting on the mutiny allegations, Ramushwana said he had 
not yet received a report from his officers. "I have heard it 
as a rumour and I cannot comment until I receive a report." 
  Asked what went wrong on the East Rand, Ramushwana said an 
incorrect perception had been created when the SDUs used NPKF 
armoured vehicles as cover when they attacked the hostels. 
"They were shooting at the hostels from under and on the sides 
of our vehicles and the IFP people saw us as part of the 
attack." However, the general stressed that the IFP had 
threatened before the arrival of the force on the East Rand that 
it would not be welcome. "They were prepared to create problems 
for us." 
  Ramushwana said any NPKF soldier who acted partially would 
be 
fired and confirmed that 1,000 soldiers had been dismissed -- 
many for being absent without leave. It is understood that a 
large number of those dismissed were MK members. 
  The source said several SADF soldiers had their lives 
threatened and some had chosen to leave the force.

<F P=106> [Report by E van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- An accord on Afrikaner 
self- determination, including the concept of a Volkstaat 
[homeland], was on Saturday [23 April] formally signed between 
negotiators of the Freedom Front, the government and the African 
National Congress. Present at the signing ceremony at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria were Freedom Front leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen, ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki, and government chief 
negotiator Roelf Meyer. All three signatories to the accord 
hailed it as underlining the importance of peaceful negotiations 
to reach solutions and avoiding conflict. 
  Gen Viljoen said had it not been for the forum negotiating 
the accord, "major conflict might by now have erupted". It was 
also a demonstration of the desire to reconcile the two major 
indigenous groups. This was the beginning of a process which 
offered hope of peaceful co-existence. The FF [Freedom Front] 
had chosen the path of negotiation to avert senseless and futile 
violence. 
  Gen Viljoen called on Afrikaners to come out in support of 
his strategy to realise self-determination. ANC National 
Chairman Thabo Mbeki said the accord lay the basis for 
addressing Afrikaner self- determination. Alluding to the 
Conservative Party [CP], he added it was regretful that some 
still chose to stay outside the peaceful democratic process. In 
the aftermath of the elections, the discussions would continue, 
he said. "This sends a message that there is no need to resist 
change through violence. We need to accommodate each other. 
This is another step to create a South Africa in which all 
citizens will feel they belong to one common whole. It is 
important that all of us commit ourselves to seek solutions 
through peaceful negotiations (rather) than by war," Mr Mbeki 
said. 
  Mr Roelf Meyer said the accord removed all the reasons the 
CP 
had advanced for not taking part in the elections. The accord 
provided for the debate on self-determination to carry on after 
the elections. The government believed a volkstaat was not 
viable, he added. "It remains an unrealiseable idea because 
Afrikaners do not form the majority of the population in any 
region of the country," Mr Meyer said. The government and the 
National Party believed self- determination could be exercised 
in other ways and through other mechanisms than through a 
volkstaat with demarcated geographical boundaries, he said. 
  Responding to a question about the ANC sending out mixed 
messages on the "volkstaat" issue by Nelson Mandela saying there 
"will never be a volkstaat", Mr Mbeki said the ANC would not 
have been involved in nine months of negotiations on the accord 
if the organisation did not believe it necessary to discuss 
Afrikaner self-determination. No volkstaat had been presented 
as yet to approve or disapprove of, he said. However, the ANC 
would never accept an Afrikaner "volkstaat" where the objectives 
of non- racialism and democracy were subverted. The accord, he 
said, provided for the election results, non-racialism and the 
encouragement of peace to be taken into account. If the 
election results signified "substantial support" for a 
"volkstaat", it would not be the only criteria, Mr Mbeki said. 
  Gen Viljoen said he would regard "above 35 to 40 per cent" 
of 
the estimated 1.8-million-strong Afrikaner electorate as proven 
support, but the interpretation of "sufficient" support lay with 
the constitutional court. 
  Asked how the move would affect the National Party's 
support, 
Mr Meyer said "more than half of those people calling themselves 
Afrikaners don't want an own geographical area". 
  On the chances of the CP now joining the process, Gen 
Viljoen 
said CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg had insisted on 800,000 votes 
to be agreed on as "substantial support". In addition, Dr 
Hartzenberg sought agreement that the polling of 800,000 votes 
would guarantee an Afrikaner Volkstaat. If these demands were 
not met, the FF should withdraw from the elections. The CP also 
felt that participation in the polls would legitimise the 
elections, Gen Viljoen said. Nevertheless, the interim 
constitution's principle 34 provided for a volkstaat council to 
be established and the FF might also include experts of the 
Afrikaner Volksfront on the council. 
  Gen Viljoen said he was concerned about the far-rightwing's 
threats to destabilise the country and disrupt the elections. 
He said they should be "wisely" dealt with to avoid bloodshed. 
Their serious emotional commitment was not difficult for him to 
understand, he added. He called on them to rather join the FF's 
strategy and offered to negotiate, facilitate and mediate to 
avoid violence.

<F P=106> [Report by K Swart] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- The accord on Afrikaner 
self- determination signed in Pretoria on Saturday [23 April] 
makes provision for a 20-member volskstaat [homeland] council to 
constitutionally pursue the establishment of a white homeland. 
The accord was signed at the Union Buildings by Freedom Front 
leader Gen Constand Viljoen, African National Congress National 
Chairman Thabo Mbeki and government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. 
  Under the accord, constitutional provision is made for any 
community sharing a common cultural and language heritage, 
"whether in a territorial entity or in any other recognised 
way". The final constitution may now give expression to any 
form of self- determination provided there is substantial proven 
support within the community for self-determination. 
  The accord constitutionally establishes a volkstaat council, 
which will gather and make available information regarding 
possible boundaries of the volkstaat, its powers and functions, 
and the constitutional relationship with government at national 
and regional level. The volkstaat council will be elected by 
members of parliament who support the establishment of a 
volkstaat. 
  The Freedom Front will invite the public to nominate 
candidates to the council. A short list of possible appointees 
will be drawn up by a panel. After formal hearings and 
interviews, 20 "experts in their fields" will be appointed as 
councillors. 
  The accord states the procedures in the constitution 
regarding the finalisation of present provincial boundaries 
should not be construed as precluding the establishment of the 
volkstaat. 
  A national advisory body attached to the volkstaat council 
could be established, consisting of 25 representatives elected 
by local communities supporting the ideal. If a volkstaat is 
realised, this body will represent the communities in a 
volksraad [national council] of the volkstaat. 
  Citizenship for people residing in a volkstaat will not be 
racially-based and shall be compatible with 
internationally-accepted norms. 
  The accord also provides for further negotiations on 
Afrikaner self-determination after the election. The 
possibility of local, regional and other forms of 
self-determination will be considered. 
  Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat 
will be indicated by the support gained in the election of 
parties with a mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat. 
Electoral support should not only be measured nationally, but 
also by counting votes at provincial level.

<F P=106> ["Essence of the Accord on Afrikaner Self-Determination" </F>
signed by the Freedom Front, the ANC, and the South African 
Government/National Party; issued by the Ministry of 
Constitutional Development and Communication on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service on 23 April] 
  [Text] 1. Introduction 
  The accord must not be seen in isolation but in conjunction 
with Constitutional Principle XXXIV, Chapter 11a: Volkstaat 
[homeland] Council of the Constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa, Act 200 of 1993, the unsigned memorandum of agreement 
between the ANC and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front], dated 
December 21 1993, the Guidelines for the deliberations of the 
Volkstaat Council, as well as the unmandated defining statement 
on the principle of self- determination. 
  2. The essence of this package is the following: 
  Constitutional provision is now made for any community 
sharing a common cultural and language heritage, whether in a 
territorial entity or in any other recognised way. 
  The final constitution may now give expression to any 
particular form of self-determination provided there is 
substantial proven support within the community for such a form 
of self-determination. 
  A constitutional body, the Volkstaat Council consisting of 
20 
members is established. The Volkstaat Council shall serve as a 
constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the volkstaat 
to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a volkstaat. 
  The Volkstaat Council shall be competent to gather, process 
and make available information with regards to: 

  -  possible boundaries, 
  -  powers and functions, 
  -  legislative, executive and other structures at national and 
provincial level, and 
  -  any other matter directly relevant to the establishment of 
such 
a volkstaat. 

    To make feasibility and other relevant studies with regard 
to 
the above. 
  The Volkstaat Council is elected by members of Parliament 
who 
support the establishment of a volkstaat. The following 
procedure will be followed by the Freedom Front in the 
appointment of the said council: 

  -  the public will be invited to nominate suitable candidates 
for appointment to the council. 
  -  a short list of possible oppointees will be drawn up by a 
panel. 
  -  after formal hearings and interviews, twenty experts in their 
fields will be appointed as councillors. 

    The procedures provided for in the constitution with regard 
to the finalisation of present provincial boundaries shall not 
be construed as precluding the establishment of a volkstaat. 
  Proposals for self-determination of local communities 
through 
community councils or structures modelled along the lines of 
similar structures and processes in other parts of the world 
could be considered. 
  A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council 
and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local 
communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of 
self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established. 
  In the event of the realisation of a volkstaat, this body 
will represent the respective communities within the volksraad 
of such a volkstaat. 
  Citizenship intended for persons residing in a possible 
volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be compatible 
with internationally accepted norms. 
  The accord makes specific provision for the following: 
  The parties commit themselves to further negotiations also 
after the election to address the ideal of Afrikaner 
self-determination including the concept of a volkstaat. 
  The possibility of local and/or regional and other 
expressions of such self-determination will also be considered. 
  Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat 
will be indicated by the electoral support which parties with 
a specific mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat will 
gain in the forthcoming election. 
  To facilitate the consideration of the volkstaat after the 
elections, electoral support should not only be measured 
nationally, but also by counting the provincial votes at the 
level of: 
  The electoral district; and the polling station as indicated 
by the parties. 
  The Volkstaatraad [Volkstaat Council] shall form such 
advisory bodies as it may determine. 
  The parties further undertake to discuss and reach agreement 
on matters such as stability in the agricultural sector and 
indemnity as well as other outstanding issues which could 
include international mediation to help resolve these matters.

Freedom Front, the African National Congress, and the South 
African Government/National Party; issued by Ministry of 
Constitutional Development and Communication 23 April on the 
SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Taking note: 
  of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 
200 of 1993 as amended; and 
  Taking note: 
  of the unsigned memorandum of agreement between the 
African National Congress (ANC) and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
(AVF) [Afrikaner National Front], dated December 21, 1993; and 
  Taking note: 
  of Constitutional Principle XXXIV, dealing with the issue 
of self-determination; and 
  Subsequent to the discussions between the delegations of the 
ANC, the AVF, the South African Government and eventually the 
Freedom Front (FF) 
  The parties represented by these delegations record the 
following agreement: 
  1. The parties agree to address, through a process of 
negotiations, the idea of Afrikaner self-determination, 
including the concept of a volkstaat [homeland]. 
  2. The parties further agree that in the consideration of 
these matters, they shall not exclude the possibility of local 
and/or regional and other forms of expression of such 
self-determination. 
  3. They agree that their negotiations shall be guided by the 
need to be consistent with and shall be governed by the 
requirement to pay due consideration to Constitutional Principle 
XXXIV, other provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of 
South Africa, Act 200 of 1993 as amended, and that the parties 
take note of the memorandum of agreement, as referred to above. 
(The appendix to this accord contains copies of these documents 
perused by the delegations.) 
  3.1 Such consideration shall therefore include matters such 
as: 
  3.1.1 Substantial proven support for the idea of 
self-determination including the concept of a volkstaat; 
  3.1.2 the principles of democracy, non-racialism and 
fundamental rights; and 
  3.1.3 the promotion of peace and national reconciliation. 
  4. The parties further agree that in pursuit of 3.1.1 above, 
the support for the idea of self-determination in a volkstaat 
will be indicated by the electoral support which parties with a 
specific mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat, will 
gain in the forthcoming election. 
  4.1 The parties also agree that, to facilitate the 
consideration of the idea of a volkstaat after the elections, 
such electoral support should be measured not only nationally, 
but also by counting the provincial votes at the level of: 
  4.1.1 the electoral district; and 
  4.1.2 where ever practical the polling stations as indicated 
by the parties to, and agreed to, by the Independent Electoral 
Commission. 
  5. The parties agree that the task of the Volkstaatraad 
[Volkstaat Council] shall be to investigate and report to the 
constitutional assembly and the commission on the provincial 
government on measures which can give effect to the idea of 
Afrikaner self-determination, including the concept of the 
volkstaat. 
  6. The parties further agree that the volkstaatraad shall 
form such advisory bodies as it may determine. 
  7. In addition to the issue of self-determination, the 
parties also undertake to discuss among themselves and reach 
agreement on matters relating to matters affecting stability in 
the agricultural sector and the impact of the process of 
transition on this sector, and also matters of stability 
including the issue of indemnity inasmuch as the matter has not 
been resolved. 
  8. The parties further agree that they will address all 
matters of concern to them through negotiations and that this 
shall not exclude the possibility of international mediation to 
help resolve such matters as may be in dispute and/or difficult 
to conclude. 
  8.1 The parties also agree that paragraph 8.0 shall not be 
read to mean that any of the deliberations of the constitutional 
assembly are subject to international mediation, unless the 
constitutional assembly duly amends the constitution to enable 
this to happen. 
  8.2 the parties also affirm that, where this accord refers 
to 
the South African Government, it refers to the South African 
Government which will rule South Africa until the April 
1994-elections.

<H8>  Chapter 3 </H8>
<H5>  Memorandum of Agreement between the African National </H5>
Congress and the Afrikaner Volksfront (unsigned - 21 December 
1993) 
  The delegations of the African National Congress and the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF] have met on numerous occasions to 
discuss matters arising from the political transition in South 
Africa. 
  1. These discussions have resulted in the following 
agreements of understanding: 
  1.1 Both parties are committed to the development of a 
non-racial democracy. They both accept that many Afrikaners also 
have a commitment to the ideal of self-determination in a 
volkstaat and that this ideal should be addressed expeditiously, 
without delaying the current process of transition. 
  Both parties reject any political suggestions which would 
embody racism and failed apartheid policies. 
  Proceeding from its perception of the balance of political 
forces, the AVF has been unambiguous in its rejection of 
communism as an acceptable political system. 
  1.2 Both parties believe that the objectives stated above 
are 
attainable, and that a suitable political solution can be found 
through a process of negotiations. The formulation of this 
solution demands commitment founded on a new vision for the 
future South Africa, supported by its leadership. Both parties 
seek constructive engagement in the constitutional process. This 
is a crucial commitment which will help in addressing the 
entrenched mistrust and antagonism which exists between the 
supporters of the Afrikaner Volksfont and the African National 
Congress. 
  1.3 Both parties recognise the danger of serious conflict 
between members of their respective constituencies, and the 
destructive impact such conflict would have on the future 
development and property of South Africa. Furthermore, both 
parties have expressed their concern about the unstable social 
and political environment in the country, the unacceptable 
levels of political violence in particular regions, and the 
levels of crime and general crisis in the maintenance of law and 
order. All these matters, including the continuing spate of 
murders of farmers in rural areas, must be addressed 
collectively as a matter of urgency. 
  1.4 Though the two parties do not share a common position on 
the proposed schedule for the transitional process they have 
agreed that a strategic agreement, addressing matters of mutual 
concern, ought to be entered into. This will facilitate the 
implementation of the transitional process and the conduct of 
the elections on 27 April 1994. 
  2. Therefore, given the above mentioned concerns and 
considerations, the following agreements are now registered: 
  2.1 South Africa should be the home to all its inhabitants 
who share a common future, based on peaceful coexistence, 
economic interdependence and constitutional governance. 
  2.2 The two parties are determined to find an acceptable and 
sustainable accommodation for all In South africa, bearing in 
mind the aspirations of the two parties, their constituencies, 
and other political formations in the country. 
  2.3 Recognising the role both parties can play in restoring 
peace and stability, they have agreed on the need to establish 
an inclusive security system as determined by the working group. 
The purpose of this will be to address all matters of security 
and stability. They further agree that similar structures could 
be established for agriculture and other relevant groupings. 
  2.4 They agree that the aspirations of many Afrikaners to 
govern themselves in their own territory should be addressed. 
Accordingly they agreed that a joint working group be 
established for this purpose, bearing in mind the call made by 
Dr Mandela, Dr Hartzenberg and General Viljoen for a solution 
which entrenches reconciliation, prevents conflict, and 
facilitates co-operation among all people. This working group 
should complete its task and report back to its principals by 20 
January 1994. 
  The working group should examine, among others, the 
following 
issues: 

  -  financial and economic viability of such a region and its 
monitory and fiscal relationship to the rest of the country; 
  -  civil rights of Afrikaners outside the volkstaat; 
  -  civil rights of non-Afrikaners inside the volkstaat; 
  -  the nature of the relationship between the volkstaat and 
other 
local, regional and central government/administrative structures; 
  -  the timetable and process of establishing such a volkstaat in 
the light of the existing transitional process; and 
  -  the method of determining support on a geographical basis for 
the idea of a volkstaat. 

    Matters of mutual concern should be discussed and addressed 
in detail for the purpose of formulating recommendations and 
solutions. 
  2.5 The parties agreed, as part of this process, to send a 
joint delegation to Switzerland and Belgium to study how the 
political systems of these two countries work, and to determine 
whether aspects of these systems may be helpful in the 
resolution of the South African conflict. 
  2.6 The AVF, having accepted the ANC's good faith, has 
undertaken to actively discourage any action calculated to 
destabilise the transitional process. The culmination of this 
strategic agreement into a final settlement before the end of 
January 1994 will enable the AVF and its affiliates to consider 
participation in the transitional structures and process, as 
well as in the elections as scheduled to be held on 17 April 
1994. 
  2.7 The ANC, having accepted the bona fides of the AVF, 
gives 
its commitment to promote agreements entered into with the AVF, 
including such constitutional and legislative agreements which 
may be required for their implementation. 
  2.8 Should any party to this agreement at any stage consider 
the whole or the specifics of the agreement to have been 
violated, an attempt at mutual conciliation will be made through 
the facilitators of the process before any unilateral action is 
taken. 
  2.9 It was decided that a meeting at leadership level will 
be 
convened as soon as possible with the view to: 

  -  ratification of this agreement; 
  -  deciding on the time frame for the above proposed actions, 
and 
on a way of achieving legitimacy; 
  -  mandating and monitoring the task of the proposed working 
committee; 
  -  public release of the strategic agreement; and 
  -  deciding on ways of marketing these agreements, and publicly 
confirming all undertakings. 
<H8>  Chapter 4 </H8>
<H5>  Guidelines for the deliberations of the Volkstaat Council </H5>
  The following guidelines for the deliberations of the 
Volkstaat Council were discussed by the delegations: 
self-determination: 
  The investigation of the different modes of 
self-determination and the concept of a volkstaat. This 
investigation will be reported to the constitutional assembly 
and the Commission on Provincial Government, including manners 
in which effect can be given to the different modes of 
self-determination. 
  The accommodation of demands for self-determination on a 
provincial basis, through sub-regional structures within a 
province as now sanctioned by the amendments to Section 160(3) 
of the constitution, should also be explored. 
  Proposals for self-determination of local communities 
through 
community councils or structures modelled along the lines of 
similar structures and processes in other parts of the world 
could be considered. Citizenship: 
  Any form of derived citizenship intended for persons 
residing 
in a possible volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be 
compatible with internationally accepted norms. Advisory bodies: 
  A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council 
and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local 
communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of 
self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established. In the 
event of the realisation of a concept of the volkstaat, this 
body will represent the respective communities within the 
volksraad of such a volkstaat. 
<H8>  Chapter 5 </H8>
  Unmandated defining statement on the principle of 
self-determination with reference to the central concept of 
self-determination used in the Memorandum of Agreements 
Constitutional Principle XXXIV and the accord. 
  The delegations at this stage suffice with the following 
defining statement, although unmandated: 
  1. The concept shall in no way be construed as to give 
support to those fatal racist ideologies of the Twentieth 
Century that was based on chauvinistic excessive escalation of 
identities or even ethnocentrism which bred discrimination, 
racism and prejudices which on their part brought war, misery 
and death to many. 
  Legitimate self-determination instead should be consonant 
with and indeed flows from the concept of fundamental rights and 
the constitutional state. 
  2. The concept of self-determination we therefore could 
endorse is the universally accepted one that has been expressed 
in the Charter of the United Nations which serves the purpose of 
peaceful co-operation between peoples on the basis of mutual 
respect and recognition of fundamental freedom and basic human 
rights for all. 
  3. The legitimate concept of self-determination to us 
relates 
to the expressed desire of a substantial community or a people, 
who has attained through the prolonged experience of a common 
history, language, culture and often also of land, a sense of 
cohesion and belonging that universally constitutes the sense of 
nationhood. 
  The concept therefore relates to the need expressed by such 
a 
community or people to determine its own destiny and to 
excercise the right to decide policy and practise with regard to 
political, constitutional, economic, social, religious and 
educational matters in a way that is consistent with the 
peculiar expectations and value systems of such people. 
  4. We have assumed that the desire for the exercise of 
self-determination with such a people must be a popular demand 
beyond reasonable doubt, a fact which may require substantial 
proven support through an agreed democratic process. 
  5. Self-determination within a complex pluralistic society 
based on inclusive democracy has to be negotiated and 
implemented with due regard to the rights of other citizens 
sharing the same territory on a permanent basis. Wider 
democratic processes must also be recognised. 
  A balance should be negotiated between the desire of such a 
people for self-determination and the ideal of peaceful 
wellbeing of the larger whole of society. 
  Self-determination will serve the purpose of building the 
state and not cause the dislocation of the state. It should 
facilitate peace and not cause conflict. 
  6. At the same time self-determination for a people 
constituting a minority should be considered with due regard to 
and in full recognition of the legitimate expressed expectations 
of such a people so as to avoid a type of majority domination 
that may in itself cause conflict or even the disintegration of 
the state. 
  7. In our considerations we have recognised various modes of 
self-determination. It may involve the negotiation of a 
territorial entity which may have various degrees of autonomy. 
This may be augmented by constitutional devices securing various 
degrees of autonomy over the specific affairs of that community 
at one or more of the levels of government. We have agreed that 
the principle of self-determination could be negotiated and 
applied to suit the demands of each unique situation. 
  8. The introduction of any form of self-determination 
through 
negotiations will need to be accompanied by extensive public 
information and a raised level of trust.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Minister of Constitutional Development </F>
and of Communication R.P. Meyer on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 
23 April] 
  [Text] The accord on Afrikaner selfdetermination which was 
signed by the Freedom Front, the ANC and the government, is the 
result of months of negotiations. In this process the government 
took an active part with great dedication. An [words indistinct] 
constitutional settlement has now been reached which offers the 
constitutional opportunity to the Freedom Front for continuing 
negotiations on the question of selfdetermination, even after 
the elections. The government has gone out of its way to make 
this settlement possible, also by amending the 1993 Constitution 
to ensure a constitutional principle on selfdetermination and a 
mechanism for continuing negotiations. 
  Therefore no logical or sensible ground for parties like the 
CP [Conservative Party] to stay outside the constitutional 
dispensation and not participating in the elections, still 
exists. 
  The government does not, however, wish to create the 
impression that either it or the NP [National Party] is in 
favour of the creation of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] by 
their participation in this facilitation process. It remains an 
unrealisable idea because Afrikaners do not form a majority of 
the population in any region of the country. It is and will 
continue to be the viewpoint of the government and NP that 
selfdetermination could be exercised in other ways and through 
other mecanisms than a volkstaat with demarcated geographical 
boundaries. This viewpoint is in accordance with international 
trends. Other forms of selfdetermination can be achieved within 
a federal dispensation through the devolution of power to 
specific communities.

<F P=106> [Report by R. Banda] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP] 
leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the accord on Afrikaner 
self-determination signed earlier on Saturday [23 April] 
furthers only the interests of the ANC and SA Communist Party 
[SACP]. The accord was signed by negotiators of the Freedom 
Front, the government and the African National Congress. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
had already made it clear that he was not interested in the 
creation of a volkstaat [homeland]. "It is very clear that the 
ANC and the SACP will win the elction, and this will place them 
in a stronger position, since they have given no real 
undertakings in regard to a volkstaat in terms of the definition 
as set out by the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National 
Front] and the CP," he said. 
  "In these circumstances, even this accord offers no 
possibility of the Boere Afrikanervolk [Boer Afrikaner people] 
to obtain their full self-determination and independence." 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the "accord, taking part in the election 
and being part of the new Parliament will not enable the freedom 
front to achieve the freedom of the Afrikanervolk".

  [Text] Ventersdorp April 24 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has 
rejected the accord on Afrikaner self-determination. "The AWB 
rejects the pathetic little sham masquerading as `a historic 
agreement' signed between the Freedom Front [FF], African 
National Congress and the National Party," the AWB's Executive 
Council said in Ventersdorp in the north-eastern Transvaal on 
Sunday [24 April]. 
  The accord, signed in Pretoria on Saturday, makes provision 
for a 20-member volkstaat [homeland] council to constitutionally 
pursue the establishment of a white homeland. 
  FF leader General Constand Viljoen had "reached new depths 
in 
political naivety and plain duplicity by announcing this 
agreement as a breakthrough and virtually regarding it as an 
acceptance of a volkstaat by the African National Congress," the 
AWB said. 
  "The ANC leadership has said repeatedly a volkstaat is not 
acceptable, and Gen Viljoen himself has gone so far as to state 
there is no `instant volkstaat' and that in such a state 
`non-citizens' or non-Afrikaners would also be involved in 
governing and direction of the state. 
  "How can this be the self-determination for which he says he 
stands?" 
  The volkstaat meant nothing, the AWB said. 
  "Gen Viljoen knows it. The FF is in the election for no 
other 
purpose than to try and cash in for their own financial benefit."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
20 April] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Candidates' Lists </H5>
  The list of candidates for the National Assembly and 
provincial legislatures, published during the course of 
Wednesday April 20 and Thursday 21, contains certain errors for 
which the commission assumes responsibility. 
  Among these errors is that which the commission drew to the 
attention of editors yesterday concerning the listing of the 
African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] under the provincial 
list. 
  In column one of page 7, due to a typographical error, the 
name of the ACDP was rendered as the Democratic Party, and its 
leading candidate in the Eastern Cape, Mr Brian Court, was 
listed above the party name, not below as it should have been. 
We reiterate our apology for this error. 
  Additional anxiety was created for some voters because the 
list appeared to leave the National Party out of the national 
component of the list for the national assembly. This is not an 
error. The National Party chose to place all its candidates on 
regional lists, as it was permitted to do in terms of Schedule 2 
to the Electoral Act, and this decision has no outcome on the 
apportionment of seats to that party. 
  The National Party announced this decision at its federal 
congress earlier this year. It is therefore asked to convey the 
motivation for this decision to its supporters and others who 
might enquire. 
  The commission points out that several parties asked for 
postponements for the submission of their lists, and that in 
many instances, parties were late in providing accurate 
information to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] 
regarding the identification and eligibility of candidates. 
This required necessitated extensive re-checking by officials 
of the election administration directorate, further delaying the 
process of publication. 
  The list that was presented for publication was thus 
compiled 
under extreme pressure of time, and within hours of the 
production deadlines that would enable the commission to provide 
the list to the electorate via publication in newspapers 
throughout the country. Had we delayed any longer, we might have 
risked not being able to provide lists before the election. 
  The commission apologises for errors, asks both political 
parties and votes to consider the difficult circumstances under 
which errors happen, and wishes to make clear that these are not 
the responsibility of the newspapers. The newspapers themselves 
have performed an admirable task in printing the information 
provided to them under great pressure of time, and serving as 
carriers of the information to the electorate. 
  [Signed] Paul Bell, director of information

  [Text] Cape Town April 22 SAPA -- The Africa Muslim Party 
[AMP] says its candidates' lists published by the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] in newspapers on Thursday [21 April] 
was wrong, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
reported on Friday. Ten AMP members had resigned or had been 
asked to withdraw, party leader Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said. The 
IEC had agreed after negotiations AMP could change its lists by 
Monday, he said. 
  Some candidates had resigned because of pressure by the 
community and others had been found wanting when measured 
against the AMP's Islamic principles, Dr Sooliman said. 
  The IEC could not be reached for comment.

<F P=106> [Report by John Soderlund on the 27 parties contesting the </F>
election and their platforms, "as supplied by the parties 
themselves"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Pan Africanist Congress [PAC]: Clarence Makwetu </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: Central to the PAC's campaign are the issues of 
redistribution of land and wealth, a beefed-up education system, 
affirmative acation and quota programmes in the workplace and 
labour tribunals to rectify the injustices to which workers are 
subjected. It claims to be the true voice of the oppressed 
masses and promises to give them more power over the management 
of the economy, industry and State services. The PAC proposes 
that businesses should be socialised and democratised, and its 
tax policy would attempt to redistribute wealth from the 
"settlers" to the Africans. 
<H5>  United People's Front [UPF]: Mokhudu Ledhwaba </H5>
  Registered to contest: Northern Transvaal 
  PLATFORM: The UPF aims to bring unity to the northern 
Transvaal region's five national groups. The total eradication 
of racial discrimination is the party's first and foremost 
priority in the region's reconstruction. 
  People who have been dispossessed of their land and denied 
fundamental rights will be the subjects of affirmative action 
under the UPF. The party stresses this will not mean apartheid 
in reverse, but the creation of equal opportunities. UPF 
believes it is in the interest of all South Africans that the 
process of restoration is carried out with minimal damage to 
stability and economic growth. 
<H5>  Workers' List Party [WLP]: Professor Ndlovu </H5>
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: The WLP stands for the building of a mass workers' 
party. The WLP manifesto says its will institute a 35-hour 
week, an end to retrenchment and a public works programme. It 
aims to build an economy which places human needs before profits 
and involves people in democratic decision-making. Full 
maternity rights, women's health rights and an end to violence 
against women are promises the party makes. It says it would 
build a caring society by prioritising the rights of children, 
the aged and the disabled. Its manifesto says it would ensure 
an end to corruption, the accountability of leaders and the 
building of a united nation. 
<H5>  African National Congress: Nelson Mandela </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ANC represents the majority of blacks and 
other 
fellow South Africans who deplore apartheid, and its 
exploitative and discriminatory policies, says the party. To 
address past imbalances the ANC has a Reconstruction and 
Development Programme (RDP) which is a comprehensive plan to 
bring about a better life for all the people. Within the 
framework of the RDP, the results of past discrimination to 
specific groups in society will be corrected through affirmative 
action. Africans, women, rural areas and the disabled will 
enjoy special attention in this regard, it says. It argues it is 
the only party with a clear plan to build a democratic 
nonracial, non-sexist, united South Africa. 
<H5>  Luso-South African Party [Lusap]: Manuel Moutinho </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Verenigeeng] region 
  PLATFORM: The major political groupings had written off the 
Portuguese community as being of little importance in the 
election, says Lusap. It aims to look after the interests of 
the Portuguese community in government. The Party was formed as 
a result of the alienation of the Portuguese community in the 
transition process, it says. Further, the provision in the 
Electoral Act allowing permanent residents to vote and the 
system of proportional representation provide an opportunity to 
get one representative at both regional and national levels, 
says a spokesman for the party. 
<H5>  The Right Party [RP]: George Sinclair </H5>
  Registered to contest: Eastern Transvaal 
  PLATFORM: The Right Party stands for complete separation 
between different ethnic groups so that each can live in peace. 
It cites as an example the Swiss system of government where the 
people in the different cantons can either accept or reject the 
laws made by the central government, so that different 
communities with different values can live in peace and harmony, 
with the right of association and disassociation. Each person 
has the right to a private life free from interference and 
domination, it insists. The party supports strong local 
government and limited central government. 
<H5>  Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front [FF]: Constand Viljoen </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The FF stresses it is treating the elections as a 
test for support of the ideal of a volkstaat. Secondarily, it 
will offer those who cannot be accommodated in the volkstaat the 
alternative of self-determination elsewhere. It is approaching 
the issue of self- determination within the framework of the 
elections, unlike the CP which is choosing to boycott the 
election. A principle in the constitution says that if enough 
support is demonstrated for the volkstaat idea, a Volkstaat Raad 
(council) may be established by elected FF members. 
<H5>  South African Women's Party [SAWP]: Sue Millard </H5>
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The SAWP was formed to draw together women from 
every corner of the country when it seemed that other efforts 
towards solutions were failing, says Millard. Instrumental in 
the formation of the party were journalists Michel Muller, Susan 
Smuts and Millard. Muller was privotal in the forming the 
Western Cape branch which will contest the regional election. 
<H5>  Wes-Kaap Federaliste Party [Western Cape Federal]: Stephen </H5>
Scheepers 
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: Details could not be obtained. However, in terms 
of the party's electoral pact with the Federal Party for the 
Western Cape region, it is required to accept, without 
condition, the policies of the Federal Party, says Frances 
Kendall. 
<H5>  Sports Organisation for Collective Contributions and Equal </H5>
Rights [SOCCER]: James Mange 
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: The Soccer Party claims to be able to heal the 
rifts and find a common ground by building national spirit on 
the emotionally bonding elements of sport, music and the arts. 
"We intend being a unifying force in the forthcoming election. 
Through sport, music and the arts -- social elements which have 
historically crossed all social and political boundaries -- the 
Soccer Party aims to provide South Africans with a common 
destiny through a sense of unity, pride and mutual respect," 
says a spokesman. 
<H5>  The Green Party [GRP]: Nathan Grant </H5>
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The Green Party, which was established several 
years ago, plans to run its election campaign around green 
issues, among both black and white voters in the Western Cape. 
Among intentions is to stop the University of Cape Town 
developing land around Valkenberg. 
<H5>  The Keep It Straight and Simple Party [KISS]: Claire Emary </H5>
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: Emray wants to put a limit on the size of big 
government -- "to get it off our backs." The best way to 
achieve this strategy is to restrict its powers to tax. The tin 
tacks of democracy rest on the tax code, thus the power to tax 
is the power to destroy she says. It is the spending power of 
the politician or parliamentarian which must be contained. The 
onus is one the taxpayer to draw the line and put politicians in 
their proper place -- to serve, not to rule, she says. 
<H5>  Women's Rights Peace Party [WRPP]: Nina Romm </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: Stands for the reconstruction and transformation 
of 
society for everyone through focusing on gender issues. "It is 
vital that, in ordesr to have a truly democratic government, 
liberation from sexism goes hand in hand with liberation from 
racism." The WRPP will consistently monitor all government 
policies and decisions and vigorously oppose any that in any way 
discriminate against women and children. The WRPP claims it 
will add a new richness to the concept of what a "multiparty 
democracy" is by giving women an independent voice within 
government. 
<H5>  Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International </H5>
(SA): David Fredericks 
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The party is standing in order to make the ideas 
of 
socialism part of the political fabric of South African society 
and to expose and to get people to reject the pro-capitalist 
negotiated settlement. It stands for the nationalisation of all 
the big companies, mines and farms, under workers' control 
without compensation, and for the revolutionary overthrow of a 
capitalist society. It stands for the building of a socialist 
society. 
<H5>  Ximoko Progressive Party: S D W Nxumalo </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, N. Tvl [Northern Transvaal] 
and PWV 
  PLATFORM: No details could be obtained. 
<H5>  African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP]: Kenneth Meshoe </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ACDP says it represents the following: a fresh 
start, uncontaminated by the past; a diverse leadership, united 
behind common Christian principles to bring hope and vision to 
the nation; a genuine federal framework or self-governance with 
maximum constitutional powers at the lowest possible level, and 
an open-market economy. 
<H5>  African Democratic Movement [ADM]: Brigadier Oupa Gqozo </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ADM stands for a negotiated constitution for 
the new democratic and free SA [South Africa]. It places a lot 
of weight on the value of an independent judicial system, saying 
many black people have been sentenced in the past because of its 
lack of independence. The ADM would push for the improvement of 
South Africa's international image and put much effort into 
attracting foreign investment and maintaining current foreign 
involvement in the local economy. It would equalise the 
educational biases in budgets for different races and ensure 
equal educational opportunities up to primary school level. A 
unitary state is rejected by the ADM as less democratic and too 
dictatorial. Such a government gives power to a few people who 
govern the people to their own benefit. 
<H5>  African Moderates Congress [AMCP]: Marvin Phiri </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The AMCP believes the country must be managed like 
a company where government positions will be filled by 
experienced, qualified and competent persons with proven track 
records, regardless of their party political affiliations. The 
voters, as shareholders, will measure the dividends of this 
strategy in the general economic prosperity of the country, says 
its policy statement. The party places much emphasis on the 
South African youth and carries this through to asserting that 
Cabinet positions should be filled by young executives. Its 
economic policy is strongly free-market oriented. 
<H5>  Africa Muslim Party: Imtiaz Sooliman </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, W. Cape, Natal, PWV 
  PLATFORM: The party's policies are based strongly on those 
propounded by the Koran. It aims to encourage racial harmony 
and religious tolerance, respect for human life, women's rights, 
honouring parents, the elderly and an accountability to God. 
<H5>  Democratic Party [DP]: Zach de Beer </H5>
  Registerd to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: In a climate in which the ANC and NP have already 
done deals in private to share government after April 28, the DP 
has a more important role than ever before, both now and after 
the election. 
  The DP, unlike its opponents, has always taken an 
uncompromising stand on morality, human rights, social 
responsibility, an open and free economy, clear government 
deregulation, privatisation, free and compulsory education, law 
and order, real federalism and independence of the courts. It 
talks empowerment, not entitlement economics, and has always 
stood up for the individual. It has earned people's trust, says 
a party spokesman. 
<H5>  Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa [DPSA]: T.K. Mopeli </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, OFS [Orange Free State] and 
PWV regions 
  PLATFORM: The party's views are similar to those of the ANC 
with the exception that they espouse a more free-market economic 
policy. It stresses the importance of protecting the rights of 
workers and the need to institute a land reform policy which has 
no restrictions on the ownership or use of land. "The DPSA has 
maintained the principles and objectives of one economy, one 
passport, one citizenship and one democratic, nonracial South 
Africa," says its manifesto. 
<H5>  Federal Party [FP]: Frances Kendall </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and PWV region 
  PLATFORM: Kendall stresses federalism above all. She 
believes in the devolution of power and in direct democracy. 
The electorate should be encouraged and allowed to vote on 
issues on an ongoing basis. The Federal Party believes central 
government should have power only over defence, finance, foreign 
affairs and the Appeal Court. Each region should have power to 
determine its own economic, health and social welfare policy. A 
pact has been struck with the Wes-Kaap Federaliste [Western Cape 
Federal] Party and they have agreed to adopt the FP's strong 
federalist stance. 
<H5>  Islamic Party: Abdullah Gemiedien (not leader now) </H5>
  PLATFORM: At the heart of the Islamic Party's policy is the 
need to achieve recognition for the rights of Muslims. More 
specifically, the party would push for the legalisation of 
Muslim precepts of polygamy and inheritance rights, says a party 
spokesman. In the longer term, it would make the general public 
aware of the benefits of the high moral standards of the Muslim 
creed. 
<H5>  Merit Party [MP]: Solomon Sehkolne </H5>
  Registered to contest: Eastern Cape 
  PLATFORM: The Merit Party is effectively what the old 
Progressive Party was. The goal of the MP is one word -- 
quality. "The principle of the mass is bound to end in disaster 
and that apartheid and peoples' power both suffocate quality. 
We desperately need the third option of merit which generates 
quality by requiring critical measurement of the real worth of 
the individual to count in all spheres and reduces violence by 
demanding the responsibility of the individual and enhancing the 
economy. There is nothing we can do about it before the 
election," he says, explaining how the party hopes to bring the 
idea of merit through its voice in a new government. 
<H5>  Minority Front [MF]: Amichand Rajbani </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and Natal/KwaZulu 
  PLATFORM: Following the provision in the constitution for 
"the effective participation of minority political parties in 
the legislative process in a manner that is consistent with 
democracy", the Minority Front has registered to contest the 
election. Throughout the world minorities, through their 
political parties, are playing a role in government by being the 
pure and effective voice of the minorities, says the MF. The 
party has a 10-year programme to build itself into a strong 
force. Its priority is to get a voice in the provincial and 
national parliaments. Minorities do not want a voice through 
proxies as they are subject to things like party discipline, 
says the MF. "We are here to ensure that any action by 
government and the private sector minorities are not prejudiced." 
<H5>  National Party [NP]: F.W. de Klerk </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The NP asserts repeatedly that it is the only 
party 
which has been able to admit its past mistakes and work on 
correcting them in a future government. It promises to focus on 
stimulating rapid economic growth, providing decent facilities 
for millions of South Africans and effecting national 
reconciliation. It boasts a long experience of government and 
argues for autonomous local and regional government and a 
strongly free-market economy based on the right to private 
property ownership. More equitable tax policies will be 
implemented and discriminatory policies of the past will be 
reversed to ensure full political and civil rights to those who 
did not previously enjoy them. 
<H5>  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]: Mangosuthu Buthelezi </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The IFP is contesting the election on a strong 
federalist ticket. It has consistently opposed the Interim 
Constitution thrashed out in the World Trade Centre talks 
because it does not give nearly enough original powers to the 
provinces, says the party. It has also consistently championed 
the cause of the free market but recognises the need for state 
intervention to redress past inequalities, said a spokesman. He 
added that it believed an affirmative action plan should be 
implemented. The IFP argues that the smaller the government, 
the more freedom its people have. Therefore, taxation should 
only be on essential governmental functions. It also believes 
that traditional institutions must be respected and has fought 
for the restoration of the dignity of kingdoms such as KwaZulu.

  [Text] On this last Sunday before the election RAPPORT has 
asked the leaders of five political parties why they think 
voters should support them. Here are their answers: 
<H5>  The National Party Keeps Its Promises </H5>
  [NP leader F.W. de Klerk] This week heralds the beginning of 
a new life for all South Africans. The quality of that life 
will depend on how you vote -- that is the heartbeat of 
democracy. Before you vote I want to share a few ideas with you: 
  I have had the honor of serving as state president for the 
past five years. As the leader of the National Party I have 
promised to lead our nation into a new period of freedom. I 
have kept that promise. I have promised to end apartheid, and I 
have. I have promised to release Nelson Mandela and to unban 
political parties, and I have done that. I have promised to 
hold free elections in which all people would be allowed to 
vote. I have kept that promise. I have promised to lay down 
the basis for justice. That has been done. I have kept all my 
promises. 
  After the election we will have a government of national 
unity. This means that the most important political parties will 
share power. It is in the best interest of the country that the 
National Party leads that government. If we can get the 
majority of your votes then I can continue my work for a 
prosperous and peaceful South Africa. It is not just enough to 
have free and fair elections. The elected government should act 
in the best interest of the people: 

  -  We must create job opportunities so that all our people 
can support their families and can be independent of the state. 
  -  We must build houses so that all our people can be 
accommodated. 
  -  We must ensure that effective standards of education and 
health 
care is available to all. 
  -  To achieve all these things we have to manage the economy in 
such a way that businesses, large and small, can flourish. 
  -  Above all we must have respect for law and order so that 
violence, crime, and intimidation, can be wiped out from society. 
  -  We must replace racial tension with harmony. We must replace 
hate with goodwill. We must promote strong family values. 

    In this way this huge nation of ours -- all its people -- 
will remain the richest nation in Africa and occupy a front seat 
in the league of nations. The National Party stands for the 
same plan which has ensured the prosperity of several nations 
throughout the world. The ANC would like to do all these 
things, but can they? They do not have any experience in 
government. They make promises they cannot keep. They are in 
alliance with communists (SACP) [South African Communist Party) 
who have totally unacceptable ideas on how to manage the 
economy. Their plans will ensure the collapse of the economy. 
They were involved in violence far too often to be trusted to 
end it. The only safe option for you -- those desiring peace, 
reconciliation, and a prosperous future -- is to vote for the 
National Party. With your help I promise that we will build a 
great new South Africa. And as you know, the National Party 
keeps its promises. 
<H5>  The ANC Has a Plan for South Africa </H5>
  [ANC leader Nelson Mandela] South Africa is in a mess as a 
result of the National Party's policy of apartheid. Nearly 50 
percent of all South Africans are unemployed, there is a 
shortage of at least 6.5 million homes, and three times more 
money is spent on educating white children, compared to that 
spent on black children. South Africa is being torn apart by 
violence and crime, directly linked to unemployment and the fact 
that many people are hungry. The only way to address these 
problems is to give our people hope and to ensure that they will 
have a better life after 27 April. This cannot be done with 
vague promises and by spending most of the time attacking other 
parties, like the National Party and Democratic Party are doing, 
without a plan on how to save South Africa from the present 
decline. 
  The ANC has a plan: 

  -  We have a plan to create 1.5 million job opportunities 
within the next five years through a public works program, 
similar to the "New Deal" [preceding two words in English] so 
successfully applied by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S. after 
the Great Depression. Such a public works program will be 
labor-intensive and will help to build houses and roads, and 
will provide electricity and running water in townships 
[preceding word in English], denied to the people for years. 
  -  We will support small business development and also create 
new 
job opportunities. 
  -  The apartheid system of education will be rationalized and 
one 
National Department of Education will be created in order to 
effectively use funds to ensure 10 years of free education for 
every child. 

    These are just a few of the concrete plans we have to ensure 
a better life for all in our country. No other party has such 
an extensive plan. Our children and grandchildren should never 
experience the violence and suffering, the injustice and pain, 
that we have experienced. They should enjoy their childhood and 
should feel safe with their families. They should be raised 
with equal opportunities so that they can explore all 
opportunities. I call on all South Africans to build on 
reconciliation, peace, and a better life for all. Now is the 
time. Vote ANC. 
<H5>  Self-determination can lead to a better life for all </H5>
  [Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi] In spite 
of their differences, I beleive that Zulus and Afrikaners have 
one thing in common -- a fundamental belief in the principle and 
practise of self-determination. Self-determination does not lie 
at the root of conflict and of competition, but it is a 
complementary factor and could lead to a better life for us all. 
Because we blacks comprise the majority of the country's 
population, self- determination will guarantee for us all 
freedom from domination. I say this without rancor or reproof, 
but if we want to be fair toward one another, and if we really 
wish to find one another, we must accept that we suffered 
terribly under the Afrikaners. They misused their power to 
dominate others mercilessly. 
  We, the blacks, are now on the threshold of becoming the 
'dominant' group in the country. But I cannot emphasize enough 
that we are a people with a long history of accomodating other 
people -- a history of cooperation and coexistence. We are 
people whose commitment to reconciliation knows no bounds. We 
can not forget, but we can always forgive. It is for this 
reason that I can state with absolute certainty that we are 
prepared to promise, indeed, guarantee, that we have no desire 
whatsoever to dominate any other group, and specifically not the 
Afrikaner. 
  Despite the horrors of our tragic past, now is the time to 
look forward to a brighter common future, as brothers and 
sisters. It may be that the Afrikaner dominated us, but they 
were also dominated by others, and that is what gave rise to 
Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid. We will not repeat that 
mistake. 
<H5>  Support the FF [Freedom Front] for a homeland </H5>
  [Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen] The Freedom 
Front is not ashamed to say we are a Christian party working for 
the maintenance of Christian values and the survival of the 
Afrikaner in South Africa. Many Christians in this country are 
concerned about the strong influence being exercised by the 
communists within the ANC. A vote for the FF will give us the 
opportunity to unashamedly testify to our Christianity in the 
highest assemblies of the land. This does not mean we are giving 
recognition to a communist constitution, but rather it offers us 
the chance to fight communism and this imperfect constitution in 
the political arena. 
  The argument is used that one should rather vote for the 
National Party to vote against the ANC. That is totally wrong, 
and does not take into account the new system of proportional 
representation. Under the new electoral system the results are 
calculated in percentages. So it could happen that in the Cape 
the ANC might get 40 percent, the FF 30 percent, and the NP or 
the Inkatha Freedom Party 30 percent. Should the anti-ANC 
parties then agree on certain issues, they would together have 
60 percent and they, not the ANC, would govern the region. So 
no vote is lost, as was the case in the old system. 
  The FF stands for the same freedoms as the NP, but offers 
you 
self-determination as a further assurance for the future. If 
the NP leaders are unable to keep a check on the ANC as a 
government, how are they going to do so as an opposition? The 
ANC dominated the NP in the negotiations, and used them to get 
rid of opponents such as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. Venda and 
Transkei are not troubled because they support the ANC. 
Self-determination as a modern concept must form part of any 
future solution in South Africa. There are those for whom this 
is not important. The 34th principle in the constitution makes 
self-determination for our people and for other communities 
possible. The proviso is that there must be sufficient support 
within that community for self-determination. Without 
self-determination for those peoples who desire it, we will have 
no peace, but will simply become another African state with a 
strong, dictatorial central government. 
  Prevent that by voting for the FF. That will also make it 
possible for us to establish a homeland council. According to 
Article 184 of the constitution, this homeland council will be 
established after the election. That will become the most 
important instrument for constitutionally making a homeland 
possible in the new constitution. 
<H5>  The DP Promises Human Rights and Democracy </H5>
  [Democratic Party leader Zach de Beer] The election campaign 
is now nearing an end, and the Democratic Party [DP], after a 
difficult beginning, is doing better and better. There are 
several reasons for this. --- Human rights: There are fears 
that the human rights which were so trampled upon during the 
years of NP rule will again be in danger under a future 
government which wants to hold too much power. Just as the NP 
was a party of and for whites, so too an ANC government may feel 
that its first duty is to see to its 'own people', and that 
causes concern among South Africans about their personal rights. 
The DP and its predecessors have shown for 35 years that they 
can be trusted with the rights of the indivudual. In contrast 
to other parties, the DP has never been identified with any 
particular ethnic group, and offers a place to every South 
African as an individual. We want to protect the citizen against 
the misuse of power. 
  Economic management: The NP government intervened in the 
economy on a large scale by, for instance, setting prices and 
interest rates and by trying to manage the flow of labor. That 
led to disastrous deterioration. The ANC, given its strong ties 
with communism, will also be under pressure to apply central 
planning methods. That, as current history has shown, never 
succeeds. What does succeed is liberal democracy and free 
enterprise--as has always been propagated by the DP. And people 
are increasingly realizing this. 
  Prevent one-party domination: Opinion polls have indicated 
that the ANC could achieve a two-thirds majority, which would 
mean that to a large degree it would draw up the constitution 
according to its will. That would be dangerous, and we must 
prevent them from getting that kind of majority. The DP, which 
has opposed apartheid for all these years, is a party which can 
effectively compete with the ANC, as shown by Prof. Maki Mandela 
who decided that she could not vote ANC and chose the DP as her 
alternative. 
  Peace: Among the important parties, the DP is the one which 
has never been accused of being in any way involved in violence 
-- except as a victim. Our hands are clean, and people know it. 
So peace, which leads to stability and investment; democratic 
values which create confidence; and lively political debate. 
Liberal democracy with free enterprise. That is why the DP 
deserves support.

<H5>  National Assembly elections: </H5>
  The entry of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the 
elections will make it difficult for the ANC to get the 
two-thirds majority it needs to write the final constitution on 
its own. But ANC leaders remain confident of getting more than 
60 percent of the national vote. 
  The National Party [NP], which saw its share of the 
potential 
vote improving from a low of 13 percent to above 20 percent by 
the beginning of March, now has to fend off challenges from both 
the Freedom Front and Inkatha. Before the IFP entered the 
elections, many Inkatha supporters who planned to vote said they 
would back the NP. 
  Now President F.W. de Klerk is desperately trying to prevent 
them reverting to the IFP -- which explains his blistering 
attack on IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Durban this week. 
He said Chief Buthelezi was fickle, intolerant, indecisive and 
two-faced. 
  Chief Buthelezi's major problem will be getting the bulk of 
his supporters to the polls. Few of them have had access to 
voter education programmes and many do not have identify 
documents. 
  But if he is successful the IFP stands a good chance of 
getting more than five percent of the vote. This will qualify 
if for seats in the cabinet although Chief Buthelezi says 
Inkatha will not accept any posts. 
  Any success General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front 
achieves 
at the polls will be at the expense of the NP. But the front is 
likely to struggle to reach General Viljoen's target of a 
million votes. 
  The DP [Democratic Party] will also struggle to get 
sufficient votes to qualify for cabinet posts. 
<H5>  Provincial Elections: </H5>
<H5>  Western Cape </H5>
  Before the ban on public opinion polls, the National Party 
had pulled ahead of the ANC but was short of the 50 percent of 
votes needed to ensure Hernus Kriel is elected provincial 
premier. 
  The Democratic Party will need to get 10 percent of all the 
votes cast in province to qualify for a cabinet seat. The 
SUNDAY TIMES poll conducted in March showed the DP had just 
over 10 percent of potential voters. 
  If the NP falls short of 50 percent the DP could determine 
the choice of the Western Cape premier. 
<H5>  PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] </H5>
  The ANC looks set to win more than 50 percent of the votes 
in 
the province, ensuring tha Tokyo Sexwale will be elected premier. 
  But the NP maintains the ANC will fall short of 50 percent. 
Its Transvaal leader Pik Botha spoke this week of forming 
alliances with other parties to elect a non ANC member as 
provincial premier. 
  A key question is whether the DP will qualify for cabinet 
membership as the SUNDAY TIMES poll showed it had the backing of 
just under 10 percent of potential voters. 
<H5>  KwaZulu/Natal </H5>
  The late entry of the IFP has thrown this contest wide open. 
  The ANC is still likely to get the most votes, but the IFP 
could run a close second if it is able to rally its supporters 
to the polls in the short time available. 
  The IFP could also benefit from the backing of those who 
plan 
to vote for the NP or DP nationally. 
  It is likely that no party will get more than 50 percent of 
the vote in the province and there will have to be horse-trading 
to decide on the premier. 
<H5>  Northern Cape </H5>
  Little is known about voting trends in the country's least 
populated province. 
  But given the large number of coloured voters in the 
province 
and the predominant support for the NP in this community, the 
Nats must be regarded as favourities to win control of the 
province.

<F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 24 SAPA -- African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela ended his gruelling election roadshow 
in Durban on Sunday [24 April] with a strong message of 
reassurance to whites, urging them not to leave South Africa and 
guaranteeing their safety after this week's poll. He told a 
crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings 
Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos 
after elections. He did not elaborate. 
  "We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no 
looting or interference in people's private property. We're 
developing creative programmes in which people are taking part. 
  "Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family, 
black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South 
Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity." 
  The ANC president branded as "prophets of doom" those 
predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to 
whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: "I appeal to 
whites in particular not to fear the future." The ANC 
recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the 
country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had 
become "the most valuable asset in this country". 
  Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving 
South Africa and made an "earnest appeal from a man who has 
spent 27 year in jail" for them to stay."All of you in this 
country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your 
country. This is our country. 
  "We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under 
apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment." 
  A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car 
bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he 
would take up these issues in discussions with State President F 
W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did 
not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt 
elections. 
  "We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous 
progress despite the attempts of criminals. 
  "Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the 
security forces." 
  The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces 
for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out 
alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been 
among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in 
KwaZulu/Natal. "The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP 
[South African Police] have done nothing of these things except 
to run round in the streets." 
  Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he 
said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had 
committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and 
December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for 
current violence. 
  "I want to state very clearly that those people involved in 
killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position 
they hold, will be dealt with according to the law," he told the 
cheering crowd. 
  "They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay." 
  Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no 
chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for 
emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the 
only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came 
while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government 
and amounted to stopping the ANC from "bettering the lives of 
all". 
  The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa 
were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told 
a media conference after the rally. "They are not bluffed by the 
National Party." 
  He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural 
diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural 
mix as one of the country's strongest assets. 
  Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did 
not mean "black majority rule". "All of you must pledge to be 
part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a 
government of the minority and can never be a government of 
majority in this country. 
  "I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in 
the future. Stay here and help us." 
  Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South 
Africa, he replied: "I feel elated. At the same time, I feel 
sad," explaining that many people who had made freedom possible 
were not alive to see it happen.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] leader, addressing his first and last election rally at 
Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday [24 April], said his party 
would demonstrate its power at the polls this week in spite of 
his short election campaign. Addressing up to 15,000 supporters 
at a colourful election gathering complete with flags, badges 
and posters, Mr Buthelezi said his party remained the only party 
with support across South Africa. 
  "My supporters stretch across the nation and the politics my 
party endorses has not only remained consistent and pragmatic, 
but has a universal appeal of which no other South African party 
can boast," Mr Buthelezi said. 
  He urged people "to go for the bottom", a reference to the 
IFP's place at the bottom of the ballot. 
  He accused the African National Congress and SA Communist 
Party [SACP] of raising expectations. "What the ANC/SACP 
alliance has failed to take into account are the obvious 
problems which flow from inflated expectations, especially when 
faced with the inequalities of the present and our country's 
restrained resources. 
  "I am absolutely convinced that the ANC has neither the will 
nor the power to put right in this country what the decades of 
apartheid have made so terribly wrong. The ANC has specialisd in 
the politics of deceit. 
  "My message to the people of South Africa is that the deep 
wounds in our society are as much produced by the ANC's grossly 
wrong responses to the needs of the people that apartheid has 
inflicted upon them," Mr Buthelezi said. 
  He said the car bomb blast in central Johannesburg did not 
augur well for the future. He hoped it was an isolated incident. 
  He also criticised the ANC for having shot Zulu marchers in 
Johannesburg on March 28, saying it would not be forgotten. 
  He said the ANC and the National Party had become "the 
strangest bedfellows the history of mankind has ever seen". 
  He said the ANC was pulling out all stops to make IFP 
strongholds ungovernable. "They would rather wipe the IFP off 
the face of this earth than face our formidable opposition in 
next week's elections," he said. 
  He said there were irreconcilable differences between black 
political groups. He said the ANC/SACP would never represent all 
South Africa's blacks. 
  For the April elections to succeed in establishing a secure 
and stable interim government, the prime political antagonists 
would have to exercise greater control over their followers. A 
culture of political tolerance had to be entrenched. 
  "While the IFP recognises that both the ANC and the NP 
[National Party] are two major political parties in South 
Africa, we are equally aware that these parties are rejected by 
a large proportion of South Africa's electorate. "Any efforts by 
either of these parties to wrest control over a central party 
dictatorship after the elections will be the death knell for the 
people of South Africa." 
  He said the IFP had rejected the notion of the ANC and NP 
deciding bilaterally about the future of South Africa. "The 
people of South Africa need the protection and strength of the 
IFP to secure a democratic settlement." 
  As Mr Buthelezi finished his speech, hundreds of his 
supporters armed with sticks and assegais streamed out of the 
stadium. Police on the scene said there were no incidents.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IFP on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
24 April] 
  [Text] Everyone in S.A. [South Africa] wants peace, 
economic recovery, investor confidence, jobs, houses, better 
schools and hospitals. We believe that IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] policy will produce these in the following way: 
<H5>  Peace </H5>
  Our policy of federalism would not have any group of people 
feeling that they are dominated by any other. Power would be 
devolved right down to local government level: we would have 
government assistance but not government dictating to the 
people. This will allow people to express their cultural 
differences: to adopt different policies on such things as 
abortion in different provinces according to the principles of 
the people in that province. This will remove the resentment 
created by dictating to people from above and would already help 
towards creating peace. 
  Economic improvement, to give everyone jobs, better houses, 
schools, hospitals, will come about through our economic 
policies because we believe in free enterprise. This results in 
people having enthusiasm to work because each man reaps the 
reward of his own labour. Social programmes are created by the 
state; assistance is sought from big business and the wealthier 
private sector, but it cannot be forced from them; it is drawn 
by incentives. 
  The IFP has always promoted hard work. We support self 
reliance and self improvement, respect for other members of 
society and responsibility in exchange for rights. 
<H5>  Economic reconstruction and development </H5>
  The IFP recognises the need to correct the economic 
disparities which are a product of the policies in the past, but 
we must do this in a realistic and productive way. 
  Our policy of federalism would result in competition between 
the various provinces to create the most efficient economic 
system. We believe that the less the government interferes in 
the economy, the better. This does not mean that the government 
plays no role. We recommended the establishment of permanent 
independent commissions. An independent auditor general, a civil 
service commission, the regulatory relief commission, the 
economic development commission, the environmental commission 
and the consumer affairs commission. Unlike the ANC we would not 
allow government to appoint these commissions and then seek 
advice from other bodies and implement it according to our grand 
design. We would want the commissions to be representative of as 
many sectors of the public as possible and let government be 
advised by the commissions. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  Our tax policy would require every province to receive an 
entitlement from the central government, i.e. a percentage of 
the amount of taxes paid returned to the province to use for the 
benefit of the people of the province. Some provinces are poor 
and would require more handouts from central government than 
others, but the present interim constitution puts the provinces 
completely at the mercy of the central government. Therefore an 
ANC dominated central government could attempt to deprive 
provinces in which the ANC is not in a majority; like the 
Western Cape and Natal. This will build resentment, not peace. 
The IFP's federal economic policy would allow the principle of 
asymmetry and subsidiarity to take place; this means that each 
province takes on as much responsibility for health, education, 
schools and so on as it can cope with; as the province becomes 
stronger and wants to take on more responsibility it is allowed 
to do so. We cannot produce a nation of little grey people. We 
want a multi coloured South Africa where people can grow as tall 
as they are able. 
<H5>  Land policy </H5>
  We would want to see a strong welfare programme; but more 
government money for welfare can only come from a market driven 
economy. Only that way will we have the confidence of local and 
overseas investors to invest money in our country. To return 
land to the people, firstly we would look to the masses of 
wasted land belonging to the state; thereafter we would attempt 
to expropriate unprofitable land by paying reasonable 
compensation for that land. 
  Our idea of government is that of a caring parent who 
assists 
the family of 9 children i.e. the provinces, and insists on 
basic principles of good living i.e. the 33 principles of the 
constitution and basic human rights for all. The ANC sees the 
government as a dictating parent who believes that he or she 
knows best what is right for everyone. Their's is a communist 
style recipe for disaster. 
  Although we have governed in KwaZulu for 9 years we have not 
been accused of corruption as has the NP [National Party], 
wealthy businessmen have assured us they will invest in 
KwaZulu/Natal if we achieve federalism. 
  To be a winning nation South Africa must have peace and 
economic growth. Our policies will bring these about. We are not 
going to deliver dreams in people's laps as the anc promises to 
do; we want to build a country in which everyone's dreams become 
possible. 
  To do this for you, you must vote for us. 
  Chief Buthelezi's final appeal to the country before the 
election campaign closes is: 
  Please South Africans, no more violence. Let us all go 
peacefully on Wednesday and Thursday to cast our vote and take 
up the struggle inside Parliament.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment" column] </F>
  [Text] In just a little over 24 hours, the first votes in 
South Africa's historic democratic all-inclusive elections will 
be cast. It will mark the culmination of more than four years of 
negotiations, nearly a century of struggle waged by the African 
National Congress and the end of a tragic past. It will also 
signal the beginning of a new future as we embark on a course in 
pursuance of three imperatives -- reconciliation, reconstruction 
and development. Without these, we run the risk of failing in 
our historic duty to deliver the country from 46 years of 
institutionalised apartheid. 
  We must move with all haste as we set off on this course and 
consolidate the victory that we have won at such great cost. 
There can be no time for complacency even on day-one of our 
liberation. Serious dangers lurk ahead and any procrastination 
in the execution of our historic responsibility could expose our 
fragile democracy to all sorts of threats from forces both 
outside and within the process. These threats must not be 
underestimated, despite the public commitment by almost everyone 
of apartheid's partners in the electoral process. 
  For them, the elections symbolise their most traumatic 
moment 
-- it will decisively strip them of the privileges and power 
they have exercised with impunity and guarded jealously and 
ruthlessly for so long. We therefore must not underestimate the 
temptation among these forces to grab back that power -- both 
now and in the next five years. One of the surest ways of 
consolidating our victory is to gives it a material and tangible 
character which the democratic majority will feel committed to 
defending. But we cannot guarantee that the ANC will be able to 
move with the necessary haste in consolidating the victory 
unless it is sufficiently empowered in parliament to fend off 
opposition from its partners in the government of national 
unity, who simply have no history of commitment to democracy. 
Their claim that they have shed the repressive baggage 
accumulated over the past 46 years is unconvincing. 
  If in fact the National Party [NP] jettisoned this baggage 
in 
1990, when it unbanned the liberation movements, there is simply 
no evidence to bear this out. No new houses have been built and 
grossly uneven expenditure on education and health care for 
blacks and whites remains very much a feature of the country 
under NP rule since 1990. Violence continued to escalate each 
year since 1990 with no convincing action being taken by the NP 
to bring the bloodletting under control. To suggest that it 
will begin to deliver after the election when it could not in 46 
years and more recently in the four years after it underwent its 
conversion, is simply unconvincing. 
  But this is not the only argument that the NP is using to 
bolster its position in a democratic parliament. It has also 
asked voters to vote for it in order to curb the power of the 
ANC, which if left unchecked, will resort to communist rule, it 
claims. But the NP is less than sincere in making this claim 
because it has as recently as four years ago pronounced the 
death of communism when justifying its unbanning of the SACP 
[South African Communist Party]. To now project it as a threat 
is not only inconsistent but transparently dishonest. Either 
that, or the NP has stopped believing its own arguments. 
  Whichever way we look at it, the NP must not be allowed the 
space to delay the liberation by blocking the ANC's 
reconstruction efforts. Nor must the Democratic Party and 
Inkatha, which co- managed suppression of democracy with the NP, 
be allowed to postpone the liberation. We can only block the 
initiatives of these parties by strengthening the hand of the 
ANC, which has behind it more than 80 years of commitment to non 
racialism, democracy, accountability and transparency. 
  DEFEND YOUR LIBERATION AND VOTE FOR THE ANC.

  [Text] East London April 25 SAPA -- Ciskeians queued in 
their hundreds in East London from early Monday [25 April] 
morning in a last-minute rush to get voter cards for Wednesday's 
election. 
  Acting regional representative of the Department of Home 
Affairs in the Border, Mr Les Grieb, said the department's 
office in East London stayed open on Saturday and Sunday, 
issuing some 1,500 cards. 
  By 9.30 AM Monday, the queue already stretched round two 
sides of a city block. Mr Grieb said most applicants would be 
from Mdantsane in the Ciskei. 
  Normal office hours were 8 AM to 3 PM, but any queue that 
still existed at 3 PM would be dealt with, he said. His staff 
had been carrying on until seven or eight at night. "I would 
say they are coping, but we are under terrible pressure at the 
moment." 
  Mobile teams of the department working in the East 
London/Mdantsane also issued about 1,000 cards over the weekend, 
and were back in the field on Monday. 
  At a nearby home affairs office issuing ID documents, the 
queue was much smaller than the voting card line. Mr Grieb said 
that up to last week, the ID office had been issuing up to 1,000 
documents a week. It seemed people had decided that if their 
ID's had not arrived by now, they would rather get a voter card.

  [Text] Vancouver April 24 SAPA -- As many as 200,000 North 
American residents could be voting in the April 26-28 election, 
according to South African Embassy estimates in Washington and 
Ottawa. Those and other expatriates round the world were so 
numerous, they could influence the outcome of the election, the 
South African ambassador to Canada, Andre Kilian, told the 
VANCOUVER SUN newspaper. 
  Large advertisements last week in United States and Canadian 
newspapers gave South African expatriates and refugees the 
locations of polling stations throughout both countries, some 
specially set up in centres where there are no consulates. 
  The advertisements indicated U.S. and Canadian residents 
would be allowed to vote even if they had become citizens of 
those countries, provided they produced documentary proof they 
were once South Africans. 
  Although neither embassy could give official numbers, both 
offered rough estimates based largely on the host governments' 
census data. These put the numbers of eligible South African 
voters at about 100,000 in each country, totalling 200,000. 
  The sheer volume of enquiries to telephone numbers provided 
in the advertisements indicated a high rate of expatriate 
voting, the Washington and Ottawa embassies said. "I just hope 
we have enough ballot papers," Mr Kilian said, but added there 
was a "contingency plan" in case of a shortage.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba] </F>
  [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi might be one of two of South Africa's deputy 
presidents after the election if he does "reasonably well" in 
next week's poll, according to reliable ANC sources. The 
sources said Buthelezi, whose party made a sensational 
last-minute entry into the election race this week, was being 
seriously considered in ANC circles for the position of one of 
two executive deputy presidents. The offer would be made to him 
in the interests of peace and national unity, especially if he 
had a fairly respectable showing in the election. 
  He would then join National Party leader F.W. de Klerk as 
the 
country's deputy president, with the ANC forfeiting its right to 
appoint the first deputy president -- something to which it will 
be automatically entitled to if no more than two parties get 
over 20 percent each in the election. 
  The sources stressed, however, that this was just one of the 
options being considered in certain ANC circles, although not 
everyone in the organisation's national executive committee 
(NEC) was happy about it. The ANC begins a two-day meeting of 
its extended NEC today, where the first deputy presidency of the 
country and Nelson Mandela's tentative Cabinet will be discussed. 
  Within the ANC itself, National Chairman Thabo Mbeki and 
Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa are the two main candidates, 
with each man's supporters lobbying very strongly for their man. 
Because of the divisive nature of the designation of a deputy 
president, this issue has so far been discussed in hush-hush 
tones within the ANC. 
  Mbeki's supporters, mostly in the ANC Youth League, point to 
the fact that he was placed second on the lists which came from 
the various regions across the country. 
  They say the list which saw Ramaphosa leap-frogging to the 
second spot had been a result of the national conference 
attended by party bosses and therefore did not represent "the 
will of the people". Responding to a question at a press 
conference in Johannesburg yesterday, Ramaphosa -- like Mbeki a 
week ago -- said he and his colleagues in the ANC were not 
inclined to talk about themselves and what positions they might 
hold in future. He confirmed, however, that the process of 
putting together an ANC Cabinet was under way. 
  The sources said Mbeki, who was "presently the most senior 
person in the ANC and commands a lot of respect from all 
sectors", was a clear favourite for the job. Another "very 
senior and powerful job" had already been earmarked for 
Ramaphosa. 
  However, ANC sources yesterday told THE STAR there was now a 
possibility of maverick information and publicity chief Dr Pallo 
Jordan becoming a compromise candidate for the first deputy 
presidency to avoid a showdown between Ramaphosa and Mbeki. 
This would be similar to what happened at the organisation's 
July 1991 congress in Durban where Walter Sisulu was elected 
deputy president to stave off a potentially divisive battle for 
the position between the late Chris Hani and Mbeki. 
  Approached for comment yesterday, Jordan said: "I have not 
heard about it. However, I would not be a compromise candidate 
because I am very uncompromising". Asked what his reaction 
would be if he were nominated for the position, he said he would 
"seriously consider it".

<F P=106> [Report on interview with ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki </F>
in Johannesburg by David Frost in London on 24 Apr on the 
"Breakfast With Frost" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Frost] Earlier this morning I spoke to Thabo Mbeki, 
the national chairman of the ANC [African National Congress) and 
I asked him if he felt the sense of joy that was shown by 
first-time voters at last night's Nelson Mandela rally -- joy 
not only at an ANC victory but joy at voting at all? 
  [Mbeki] Yes, I think so and I think you are right, the 
people 
want change. It's not really merely that people want particular 
parties, they want change, they want this capacity to vote, they 
want to see a new government, they want to see a new life. 
  [Frost] That's right, and in a sense, this is something that 
you've all waited for for 30 years. 
  [Mbeki] Yes indeed, it's taken quite a bit of time. But now 
that it's here we do want to conclude this process and indeed 
have this new government. 
  [Frost] Do you think, with all the hopes that will be piled 
high on this new government, do you think you can fulfill 
people's expectations? 
  [Mbeki] Yes, I think it is possible to begin very early 
after 
the elections to begin to meet those expectations. Clearly, we 
can't meet everything at the same time. But I think it is 
possible to begin to show change very quickly, with new houses, 
better schools, and things of this sort. I think it is possible 
to move pretty quickly. 
  [Frost] Your opponents are always talking about the number 
of 
communists in the ANC and so on. I mean, how many communists 
are there likely to be in the government, in an ANC government, 
and what does the word communist mean in South Africa? 
  [Mbeki] Well, David, I don't know. The question of the 
cabinet is a matter that will be, that will be in there, that 
is, in the hands, let me say, of our president. So he's looking 
at that question of who is going to be in that cabinet. I'm 
quite certain he'll be sensitive to all manner of factors and 
clearly you can't have a situation where you had a cabinet which 
was composed in a way that was contrary to the political opinion 
in the country. And in this particular instance, the South 
African instance, you had a communist party that has 
participated in the struggle against apartheid for decades, ever 
since it was formed. And among the majority of the people in 
the country you don't have this particular problem of communism, 
because people see communists as people with whom they served in 
jail, people who were killed, people who were executed because 
of the political struggle. But as I'm saying, that in the 
composition of the cabinet I'm quite sure that the cabinet that 
will emerge will reflect the fact that the majority party in the 
country is the ANC, and the next biggest I suppose might very 
well be the National Party. 
  [Frost] Right, now I was just thinking: Such people as were 
called communists in South Africa that I have met, 
were...[pauses] People in Europe, as you know, think of Russian 
communism. And, I mean, a lot of those so-called communists seem 
to me to be what we would call socialists. 
  [Mbeki] Yes, indeed. I think the positions as explained by 
members of the Communist Party here, are really rather different 
from what one had heard about, what was said, for instance, in 
the Soviet Union. 
  [Frost] Absolutely. Now, you've been in the center of events 
in the last two or three days and throughout the campaign in 
working out this deal, as it were, with General Viljoen. It is 
reported here that the election, [that you were] examining the 
prospects for a white homeland or volkstaat after the elections. 
Is that an accurate report of what you did? 
  [Mbeki] Yes, it is. We've been discussing the question with 
them and yesterday we signed an agreement which spells out how 
constitutionally the matter would be pursued and the votes will 
be counted in such a way as to measure the support for the 
notion of a volkstaat, of an Afrikaaner state. But we also 
agreed that whatever happens to it, it cannot be in violation of 
the principles of democracy, of nonracialism, of fundamental 
human rights. So it won't be merely a matter that there are so 
many Afrikaaners who have said we want a state and therefore 
such a state will be established. It would only be established 
if it is consistent with the rest of the constitution which 
provides for a nonracial democracy. 
  [Frost] I see, that's very clear and a real clarification. 
Does that mean that it would be a part of the new South Africa, 
or independent of the new South Africa? 
  [Mbeki] No, no, even they, when they have argued the 
argument, General Viljoen and the others, they have not argued 
for an independent state. They have argued for a part of the 
country where they would have some particular rights to express 
what they describe as Afrikaaner self-determination, but it 
would be part of South Africa. But, of course, this is a matter 
that must be agreed by this elected constitutional assembly. 
  [Frost] Understood. Tell me, to what do you attribute -- I 
breathed a sigh of relief, and I'm sure everybody did, when 
Chief Buthelezi was brought into the election at the last moment 
-- to what do you attribute that good news, that breakthrough? 
  [Mbeki] It was indeed good news. It's difficult to say but 
it seems that it was a combination of various factors -- that 
people from within the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] were pushing 
for participation; the offer that the ANC had made to the king 
to resolve the matter of the future of the Zulu king. It seems 
also to have made an impression because the king then wanted the 
elections to take place, because his future could only be 
guaranteed by the elected parties. I think matters of this sort 
and some of his oldest friends who seemed to have told him that 
he will end up in a wilderness if he didn't participate in the 
elections. [sentence as heard] I think it's an accumulation of 
those sorts of pressures. 
  [Frost] Well, we will doubtless lose the satellite in a 
moment, so I just wanted to thank you for being with us and 
covering so much ground this morning. And may I just wish you 
the elections and the freedom that you all dream of. 
  [Mbeki] Thank you very much, David. And come and join us 
when we install Nelson Mandela as president.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC Information Chief Pallo Jordan, who is </F>
"considered to be a candidate for a ministerial office," by 
Johannes Dietrich and Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [PROFIL] Mr. Jordan, this week the first general 
elections will take place as planned and even your archenemy 
Buthelezi has given in at the last moment. All in all, a total 
victory for the ANC. 
  [Jordan] No, one cannot say that. One might say, at most, 
that the negotiating tactics of the ANC have paid off. But it 
was expensive: Much blood was shed, the economy has been 
damaged, and the country has been brought to the brink of the 
abyss. Buthelezi's Inkatha Party could already have had 
everything it now has last year. 
  [PROFIL] According to the Constitution, there will be a 
coalition government at first. The public sector and the 
economy will remain largely in white hands. Can the ANC rule in 
this way at all? 
  [Jordan] Power is not just located at the stock exchange, in 
the boards of governors, in the public sector, or in the army. 
Power is distributed among various centers. It is now important 
to shift it. For instance, in 1976, the white management was 
still able to tell the black workers: If you want more money, 
look where you get it from. In 1984, they were no longer able 
to say that, they were confronted with well-organized trade 
unions. If we now get a democratic government, the 
entrepreneurs will be even more careful. In this way power is 
shifted -- not dramatically, but effectively. 
  [PROFIL] Your opponent so far, the National Party (NP), will 
become your coalition partner. Clashes are preprogrammed in 
this case. 
  [Jordan] Quite so. Our first battle in the cabinet will be 
about the redistribution program. The NP always says: That is 
too expensive. 
  We cannot count on their cooperation. 
  [PROFIL] Will you raise taxes? 
  [Jordan] At the moment, taxes are as high on milk as on 
champagne, as high on pig's bones as on Westphalian ham. We 
think this is unjust. We say: Put taxes on champagne and leave 
milk alone! 
  [PROFIL] But with that you will frighten the whites. 
  [Jordan] Of course. 
  [PROFIL] And then they will not invest. 
  [Jordan] We will see. 
  [PROFIL] Will the public sector sabotage the new government? 
  [Jordan] We must expect that. We are dealing with people who 
do not like us. We also do not expect voluntary cooperation by 
banks, by the mining industry, and by the rich white farmers. 
Whether they will really proceed against us actively is another 
question. 
  [PROFIL] What has the ANC learned from the failures of other 
African regimes? 
  [Jordan] We have also been able to learn from the bad 
example 
here. South Africa as the most autocratic country on the 
continent and far more corrupt than any other state in Africa. 
The population was treated like a conquered people, not like 
citizens. We did not have any rights, any claims, nothing. 
Blacks, who constitute 75 percent of the population, earn about 
10 percent of the entire income. As regards inequality, South 
Africa tops any other African country. 
  [PROFIL] While everywhere in the world the red flags are 
hauled down, they are hoisted on the Cape. Is the alliance of 
the ANC with the communists not an anachronism? 
  [Jordan] The fact that communists are so successful here is 
a 
result of history. They have honestly earned their role by 
participating in the struggle for liberation. Paradoxically, 
they were supported by the white minority regime: Anyone who 
was against apartheid was branded as a communist. In the eyes 
of the blacks, communism, therefore, had to be something good. 
  [PROFIL] And the Stalinists in the party could not establish 
a new dictatorship? 
  [Jordan] Most black South Africans know that the communists 
are not strong enough to dominate politics. The fact that many 
South Africans have this fear is mostly only an alibi: They 
pretend to be against the communists, but, in reality, they are 
against democracy. 
  [PROFIL] With the elections, the ANC has achieved its first 
goal: national liberation. What will come then? Is the ANC, 
the collection pond of political movements, now threatened with 
being split? 
  [Jordan] National liberation has not yet been achieved. What 
we will get now is democracy. But national transformation has 
not yet been achieved by that. The issue of the land, for 
instance, remains an enormous problem. The new government must 
struggle for power. The struggle continues.

<F P=106> [Report by Iden Wetherell] </F>
  [Text] Joe Modise -- tipped as South Africa's next defence 
minister -- made an undisclosed visit to Britain in December at 
the invitation of the British Ministry of Defence's sales 
division, the British embassy has confirmed. 
  And the ANC's PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] 
chief, 
Tokyo Sexwale, this week told the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN that he had 
held talks with French arms manufacturers. Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] chief Modise and 
Sexwale's contacts with the European arms industry are highly 
significant in the context of a fierce debate unfolding within 
the ANC on the role of defence in a democratic South Africa. 
  ANC leader Nelson Mandela has pledged to cut defence 
spending 
to pay for the ANC's R39-billion [rand] Reconstruction and 
Development Programme. But sources say powerful ANC insiders, 
including Modise, are fighting for a larger defence budget. 
Modise is said to be angry that he was not consulted about 
proposals to fund the RDP from defence allocations. The "hawks" 
are said to enjoy growing support. 
  ANC attitudes towards the South African Defence Force [SADF] 
have shifted radically in the past few months, sources within 
the movement admit. Institute for Defence Policy Director 
Jakkie Cilliers confirmed that the budgetary claims of a new 
defence force had been boosted by continued unrest and the 
failings of the police and National Peacekeeping Force. Defence 
specialists say that in these circumstances, South Africa's 
defence budget is likely to be hiked, not reduced. The 
integration of the SADF with MK and homeland forces, together 
with a growing reliance on the army as primary internal 
peacekeeper, are cited as new burdens on the fiscus. 
  British embassy spokesman Geoffrey Adams confirmed that the 
British government's Defence Exports Services Organisation had 
"facilitated contacts" between Modise and British industry, 
including defence contractors, during his December visit to 
Britain. Sources say Modise discussed the possibility of a 
British military advisory and training team, similar to that 
based in Zimbabwe, assisting in the military integration process. 
  MK spokesman Calvin Kahn, who together with Armscor 
[Armament 
Corporation] general manager Tielman de Waal accompanied Modise 
to London, would neither confirm nor deny the visit. 
Interviewed this week, Sexwale disclosed he had visited Paris 
last July as the guest of Paris mayor Jacques Chirac and held 
talks with leading politicians and manufacturers. These had 
included representatives of avionics/missile company Matra, 
Thomson communications, and aircraft manufacturer Aerospatiale. 
  Sexwale said he was embarrassed by press speculation that he 
was also being tipped as a future minister of defence. On the 
outcome of his discussions, he added that he had "not been taken 
in by French wine". Sexwale confirmed attending the Paris Air 
Show in 1991 as a guest of French missile systems giant Sagem. 
"I'm a hard-nosed nationalist in matters of technology", he 
said. "This country must not become a banana republic. The 
destruction of our hi-tech base by the current government is a 
crime against the people." But he favours technology that can 
be converted to civilian uses and does not want to see social 
imperatives sacrificed so generals can have "military toys". 
  He described the South African Air Force's recent Pilatus 
deal with Switzerland as "highly questionable". British 
manufacturers complain privately that the French are boasting of 
having tied up sweetheart deals with the ANC. But Sexwale 
denies that any deals have been cut.

<F P=106> [Report on internview with ANC Natal/Kwazulu premier </F>
candidate Jacon Zuma by Stephen Laufer in Natal on 17 April] 
  [Text] Rising to greet King Goodwill Zwelithini's wife 
Buhle Mathe, Inkatha chief Mangosuthu Buthelezii and the 
National Party's Natal leader George Bartlett at last Sunday's 
Jesus Peace Rally in Durban, the ANC's Jacob Zuma already had 
the aura of the regional premiership about him. Zuma was the 
first of the dignitaries to arrive at the ecumenical event, 
adopting the attitude of the man in the driving seat as the 
others entered the presidential box at King's Park Stadium. 
  Still 11 days away from almost certain victory in the 
regional election, he was a man on a mission. Zuma knows that 
he will need to build a broad church if he is to govern South 
Africa's second most populous province successfully. So 
although shirtsleeves sufficed for Mathe, a friend of Zuma's 
wife from schooldays, there was respect in the elaborate 
gestures of greeting. For the pin-striped Buthelezi, Zuma donned 
his elegant double-breasted suit jacket before an apparently 
warm embrace and a quick one-on-one chat in the corner. 
Arriving just a few minutes later, Bartlett was greeted no less 
enthusiastically. 
  Of Buthelezi, Zuma said: "I have spoken to him many times. 
We have very warm relations." It was Sunday, two days before 
Buthelezi's decision to enter the election process, but Zuma 
will not write off the Inkatha chief. The agenda of the Jesus 
Rally was coalition building: no one would be excluded from 
contributing to stability and growth in Natal/KwaZulu, no matter 
their previous track records, no matter the legacy of enmity and 
bloodshed. 
  Zuma has the confidence of a man who believes history is on 
his side. His conviction that he is on a winning wicket flows 
less from the Marxist theory he learnt from Harry Gwala on 
Robben Islannd than the progression of his own life. It's been 
a long road from his impoverished childhood as the son of a 
domestic worker too poor to send him to school to a position of 
influence as a leading ANC strategist. They were years of 
struggle and hardship Zuma describes without a hint of pathos, 
always with the soft smile of a man at east in his own ability. 
  Almost 40 years have passed since his political education 
began in Cato Manor, more than 20 since his release from a 
decade on Robben Island, four since his emergence from the 
gruelling life of an underground operative. 
  "I have accomplished an ambition: to see South Africa free," 
he said, munching on a banana during the drive to an election 
rally in Pietermaritzburg's Imbali township after the Durban 
peace meeting. "The next task is to build the nation, to end 
conflict. It will centre in Natal/KwaZulu. Things could go 
wrong for the whole nation here -- or they could go right. That 
is why I chose to leave politics at national level and work 
here." 
  He appears to have weathered the storm raised by the inquiry 
into abuse of prisoners in the ANC camps in Angola -- there is 
no hint that he has been packed off to the provinces because he 
is no longer viable on the national stage. Zuma is no stranger 
to the art of politics, once described by the German sociologist 
Max Weber as the patient drilling of holes in very thick boards. 
He has been involved in endless discussions and strategy 
sessions aimed at bringing Inkatha and the white ultra-rightwing 
into the electoral process. The participation of Inkatha and 
Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front in next week's elections is in 
part his work. He has patiently built a relationship with King 
Goodwill, who he says is a Christian who wants peace. "He is 
troubled by the deaths," says Zuma, "he wants his people to live 
in harmony." 
  But he is not uncritical of the monarch to whom he 
professes allegiance. Referring to a rally in Durban's Umlazi 
township last Saturday at which Nelson Mandela led an estimated 
20,000 strong crowd in paying homage to the king, Zuma says he 
asked himself: "If the king doesn't understand these are his 
people, then what language does he speak?" The crowd's 
enthusiasm for the monarchy was genuine, says Zuma: "It 
electrified the rally. The king should realise some are made to 
look like enemies, but they love him, they respect him." 
  The monarchy has been manipulated, believes Zuma, not just 
by 
Ulundi's current office-holders, but by the apartheid and 
colonial authorities who went before. "People in general are 
happy to see the lost dignity of the monarchy restored," he 
says, referring to the ANC's constitutional proposals which 
accord a status similar to that of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II 
to the Zulu royal house. 
  For Zuma, a modern democracy needs to continue limiting the 
monarch's influence, if with a new subtly. So he seeks to 
temper constitutional generosity towards Zwelithini with subtle 
pointers to the legitimate claims of others. His knowledge of 
the royal houses of South Africa is an asset here, a reflection 
both of his roots in traditional Zulu society as the son of a 
member of the royal house of Zuma and his skill as a politician. 
  When talk with church leaders turned on Sunday to the royal 
houses, Zuma was quick to respond to mention of the Hlubes in 
the Estcourt area by saying "they contest (Zwelithini's 
sovereignty over them), they claim never to have been defeated 
by Shaka." He goes on to give many other examples of royal 
houses with separate claims to recognition. With much of his 
childhood spend roaming between Durban, Mapumulo and Nkandla in 
the Zulu heartland, Zuma spans the spectrum of Zulu society from 
the traditional to the modern, from the rural to the urban. He 
clearly believes that loyalty to the king is the duty of every 
Zulu, but that democracy demands that the king be shown the 
limits of his power. 
  Democracy was learnt at the knee of his half-brother 
Mntukabongwa, an ANC and South African Congress of Trade Unions 
activist at the Joko tea factory in Durban. It was the 
beginning of a road which saw Zuma joining Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] at its foundation, 
arrested while leaving the country for military training, and 
sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Released in 1973, he 
immediately returned to underground work to reconstruct the ANC 
networks destroyed by the police. Skipping to Swaziland when 
the net closed in, he illegally returned to South Africa several 
times. "If they'd have caught me, they would have killed me," 
he says. "So I had to plan my trips in great detail; that way I 
could be safe." 
  On a bus ride in northern Zululand, Zuma came close to 
having 
to shoot it out with the police. "I'd planned to seize their 
weapons, but they weren't looking for me. It left me a little 
shaken." The risks were worthwhile, says Zuma. "You weren't 
running the struggle by remote control. You could shape the 
structures on the ground." Shaping a new Natal/KwaZulu, and 
through it South Africa, will be Zuma's task in the next five 
years. A graduate of informal night schools and Robben Island 
study circles, and the father of 10 children, he is determined 
to give education spending very high priority. "I'd like to 
retire from active politics at the next election," he insists. 
"I'll be 57. A cottage by the sea, with the waves lapping, 
would be wonderful. I love the sea."

<F P=106> [Report by L. Braid] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town April 23 SAPA -- The new Government of 
National Unity would have five years in which to lay the 
foundation for a new South Africa, State President F W de Klerk 
said on Saturday [23 April]. If this foundation was not laid 
well, the country would pay an expensive price later. Mr de 
Klerk was addressing a luncheon of the President 100 Club 
attended by 450 people. 
  "We have a one-off chance to get it right. This is not the 
time for people to vote for their little prejudices, but to vote 
on a basis of principles and policies with regard to the major 
issues which have to be addressed in the next five years." 
  He said a vote for the small parties with a narrow focus 
would be wasted. "These parties focusing on specific issues 
cannot be trusted because they over-emphasise only one aspect 
and ignore the total picture. 
  "These are serious times and many of the smaller parties are 
making a joke out of an election which will determine the course 
and direction of the country." 
  Turning to the National Party's two main opponents, Mr de 
Klerk said if the African National Congress had too much power, 
it would play into the hands of the "wild ones" in the party. If 
the ANC was cut down to size by a strong NP [National Party], it 
would provide a balance of power which South Africa needed. 
  He said he was deeply disappointed that the Democratic Party 
had found it necessary to demonise the NP as if it was the main 
threat to the future. "I would have expected the DP to stand up 
and fight the ANC and say that we should not waste time trying 
to cut each others' throats, but instead gather support for that 
which we believe in." 
  Although the NP could not claim all the honour for change, 
it 
had been the initiator and had had the guts and courage to 
change itself from within. "I ask for a mandate to enter the 
Government of National Unity to represent the moderates with 
assertiveness because we will have a strong, wide, deep power 
base," he said.

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says that he will not serve in a government of 
national unity even if his party wins enough votes. Dr. 
Buthelezi said at an election rally near Piet Retief in the 
Eastern Transvaal that the IFP's struggle for freedom had just 
begun. 
  Dr. Buthelezi also warned that if the ANC-SACP [South 
African 
Communist Party] alliance gained more than 50 percent support in 
the election, it could scrap the present interim constitution. 
He said that a bleak future would await South Africa because 
federalism, the kwaZulu-Natal region, and other provincial 
powers would disappear.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified Pretoria correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The National Inauguration Committee (NIC) has 
devised a ticket system to control the hordes of people expected 
to attend the May 10 presidential inauguration ceremony in 
Pretoria. A spokesman for the NIC said only 150,000 people 
would be allowed on to the lawns of the Union Buildings, and it 
was hoped that strict crowd control would prevent a spillover of 
people into residential areas. 
  The spokesman said separate events were planned for venues 
outside Pretoria to prevent a huge influx of people. An 
international soccer match was planned for the FNB [First 
National Bank] Stadium near Johannesburg. It was hoped the new 
president would be able to address people at other venues later 
in the day, the spokesman said. 
  Security arrangements for the inauguration, which would be 
attended by at least 50 heads of state or their representatives, 
had been going well. Heavy security force deployment around the 
Union Buildings would contain the crowd to the lawn below the 
amphitheatre, where the ceremony would take place, the spokesman 
said. Various assembly points would be set up in Pretoria where 
people would receive security screening before being given 
tickets to attend the inauguration. They would be bussed from 
the assembly points to the Union Buildings. The Arcadia suburb 
would be closed off to traffic. 
  Sources on the security planning committee of the NIC 
however, were less optimistic about crowd numbers. A source 
said an unprecedented number of security force members would 
roll into Pretoria to prevent the ceremony from turning into 
bloody chaos. He said a contingency plan was going ahead for up 
to 1 million people expected to converge on Pretoria. 
  A source on the Joint Security Committee said several 
thousand security force members would be deployed around the 
Union Buildings, but they would not be able to prevent carnage 
if things went wrong. In an effort to dilute the crowd at the 
Union Buildings, talks were also under way to install huge 
television screens at several stadiums where people could follow 
the inauguration. These included Loftus Versfeld, Centurion 
Park, Ellis Park and the FNB Stadium. The security plans 
included: 

  -  Security forces, both uniformed and plainclothed, would be 
brought in from other regions to control the crowd. 
  -  VIPs would be housed in only a few hotels to ease security 
and 
travel arrangements. 
  -  Permanent and roving roadblocks would be set up on access 
routes to check for weapons. 
  -  Random checks on individuals for firearms would be done 
throughout the day. 
  -  The police and defence force would establish a joint 
operation 
centre from which security would be co-ordinated.

that a large number of official documents were destroyed as he 
prepared to leave office. Mr. Kriel insisted, however, that the 
documents were not secret, but were party political papers and 
personal documents. But a source close to the department claimed 
that officials shredded documents which showed that the SAP 
[South African Police] favoured the NP [National Party] over the 
ANC. The source said so much paper had to be destroyed ahead of 
elections that the ministry's own paper shedders could not cope.

<F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress said it was "outraged" that Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel had shredded official documents, and asked what 
dark secrets he was so eager to keep from the public. "We have 
no doubt that the documents that are being destroyed contains 
evidence of how the National Party abused the South African 
Police for their own petty party political aims," the ANC said 
in a statement on Sunday [24 April] in reaction to reports that 
Mr Kriel had shredded the documents on leaving his office. 
  The ANC asked whether the documents were related to Third 
Force activities. It said Mr Kriel was trying to rob South 
Africans of their right to know what happened during the 
apartheid years. The ANC said Mr Kriel would continue abusing 
power if he gained any position of seniority in the race for the 
Western Cape premiership. 
  Mr Kriel has said the papers were personal and party 
political.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Most Rightwingers Likely To Vote for Viljoen -- "Whether or 
not the Conservative Party [CP] officially jumps on board 
(another sticker on the ballot form!?) it is now clear that the 
bulk of white right-wingers will turn up at the polls, probably 
to cast their X opposite the visage of General Viljoen," states 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 April in a page 18 
editorial. Although South Africa can "rejoice in the turn of 
events," "let's not run away with the idea that the right is 
disposed of." THE STAR believes "the core issue has not been 
dealt with. The constitution still fails to offer a place in 
the sun to nervous minorities. There are going to be renewed 
demands for unattainables -- Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland], 
sovereign kingdom, whatever -- until the simple and attainable 
core need for real minority rights is met. South Africa has 
leaped a hurdle, not finished the race." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Democratic Party `Watchdog Role' Needed -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 22 April in its page-6 editorial 
points out that "Nelson Mandela, [Trevor] Manuel and other ANC 
leaders are adept at making the statements calculated to assuage 
the concerns of businessmen, investors and those who rely on 
them. But the politicians' constituency is wide, and their 
pre-election strategy has been to target their promises to 
specific audiences. The ANC prides itself on its inner 
democracy. But that interaction of forces within the party has 
not led to open debate but to conflicting and contradictory 
statements on all manner of topics." Ahead of the 26 April 
elections, "the ANC realises that public airing of those 
contradictions would bring home the ambiguities of the party's 
economic policies. That is surely the message of the ANC's 
refusal this week to state how the modest cost of its 
reconstruction and development programme was calculated." 
BUSINESS DAY says "an experienced watchdog will be vital" for 
the economy to succeed. "Only the Democratic Party [DP] can be 
trusted to play the proper watchdog role. Its record and 
experience of opposition politics will be crucial to the 
functioning of a proper democracy." Every vote for the DP "will 
be a vote for the decent South Africa we all want." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Decline of Political Violence Welcome -- "It is probably 
still too early to start celebrating, but reports that political 
violence is on the decline are good news," maintains a page-12 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 April. "No 
deaths were reported in Natal on Wednesday and calm seems to 
have returned to the East Rand after the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] replaced the National Peacekeeping Force on 
Tuesday night." "It might just be a coincidence that relative 
quiet has returned to our troubled land but this gap rekindles 
hope." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Buthelezi Joins Election To Raise `Legitimate' Complaints -- 
Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 22 April in a page 20 
editorial has "grave misgivings" about the Inkatha Freedom Party 
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's decision to join the polls 
and NEW NATION "advise the government, ANC and other interested 
parties to do all possible to ensure that Buthelezi does not use 
the election platform to discredit the process of democracy. We 
fear that he may be taking part in the elections in order to 
raise `legitimate' complaints with all and sundry that the 
elections were not fair because he did not have enough time to 
campaign; that some parts of Natal and the Transvaal were 
ravaged by violence; his supporters could not all come to the 
polls; and that the ballot papers may have been tampered with 
owing to the fact that Inkatha's name had to be stuck at the 
bottom of the form." NEW NATION also believes Buthelezi might 
claim "that he should be part of the government of national 
unity to avoid bloodshed from his dissatisfied supporters -- an 
easier route to public office than the confirmation of the 
vote." However, the paper does hope that Buthelezi has "no ill 
intentions, and will go out to prove us wrong." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  `Strong Mandate' for ANC Reconstruction Program -- 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 22-28 
April 
in its page-20 editorial says the priority for the new South 
Africa "must be reconstruction" through "development, job 
creation and the provision of basic services." The editorial 
examines the various parties to determine which one can most 
effectively deliver on this. "The IFP, NP [National Party] and 
DP, despite the changes they have gone through, still represent 
sectional interests. One strong advantage of the ANC is that it 
is a broad church: its election lists cross racial, class, 
gender and ethnic boundaries -- and that is an essential element 
in any government that is going to deal with the difficult 
problems we face. The NP is too burdened by its past, too 
untrustworthy in its born-again non-racialism." The 
Pan-Africanist Congress is "too willing to play a racial 
ticket," and its socio- economic policies "have not taken 
cognisance of the post-Cold War reality." The DP is "plagued by 
poor leadership, has been disappointing in its attempts to win 
over doubtful voters, particularly from minority groups." So, 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN finds it "appropriate to give the ANC 
a 
strong mandate to undertake its Reconstruction and Development 
Programme, without having to buy off sectional interests." But 
there are aspects of the ANC that "trouble" WEEKLY MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN, "particularly in the week when some of its staff have 
been accused of having detained and abused IFP supporters in the 
basement of its PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
headquarters, more so when it is becoming apparent that Section 
29 detention without trial is being retained." The paper is 
also concerned that the ANC "has shown too great a willingness 
to give the security forces unfettered powers and indemnity in 
the Natal State of Emergency. This is not a good omen for 
dealing with political rivals." There are also some "senior ANC 
people who have a flexible commitment to human rights." 
Nevertheless, "the ANC is the only party that has thrown its 
weight behind reconstruction and development, and has an 
extensive plan to achieve it. That plan is not without its 
flaws, but it is the best one before us as we go to the polls."

<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Johannesburg Blast `Last-Ditch Attempt by Fanatics' -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 April in a page-10 
editorial says the 24 April bomb blast in the center of 
Johannesburg has "shaken the fledgling mood of marvelous 
optimism that swept South Africa after the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] breakthrough: we have reason to curse the brutal, 
ignorant criminals responsible for the outrage." "This bomb was 
another last-ditch attempt by fanatics to sabotage the 
transition the overwhelming majority of South Africans is 
committed to. It might not be the last act of terror in this 
period, but it does not signal the civil war or uprising that 
the doomsday prophets predicted for our moment of great change. 
The election is going ahead, miraculously, with the 
participation of all the most significant political parties in 
our country. This is an achievement of which the world is in 
awe: we have to keep our heads, and to see it through to 
completion." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  New Style of Opposition Required -- Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY 
in English on 25 April declares in a page-16 editorial that the 
Democratic Party (DP) "has the vision required for opposition" 
role in the new South Africa. "Unlike the ANC, NP [National 
Party] and Inkatha, its prospects do not depend on inspirational 
leadership." However, the "nature of opposition politics will 
change significantly. The Westminster style of opposition will 
not be altogether appropriate in South Africa in the next five 
years." This period requires "nation building", and "the value 
of the DP lies in its ability simultaneously to oppose and help 
build, and to detect and strategically counter, as effectively 
as possible, threats to civil liberties." "It will have to use 
delicate judgment (totally lacking in the NP) to detect when the 
line is crossed between co-operation and compromise, and 
self-destructive appeasement. When that line is breached, in 
economics or civil rights, that is when to yell from the 
rooftops." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  SOWETAN Urges Votes for ANC, PAC -- A front-page "Comment", 
that continues on page 12, of Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 
25 April says that although the choice for black voters in this 
week's election "will be difficult," there is "an undeniable 
obligation to vote for the liberation organisations. The ANC 
and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] are the only parties for 
whom our choice should be made. Regrettably, Azapo [Azanian 
People's Organization] is not standing. The liberation 
organisations were the engine in the struggle that brought about 
the first all-race democratic elections in SA. Not only did the 
leaders of these parties spend years in prison, they were 
subjected to all the terrible onslaughts used by apartheid to 
destroy entire communities and in the process, our beautiful 
land." "Mr F W de Klerk, although he represents the party that 
caused the damage in the past, will and must be recognised by 
history as an important catalyst in this momentous change. Some 
will also look on the IFP with a measure of unhappiness. But 
the fact that Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi finally entered the race 
must reflect favourably on him."

  [Text] Lome, April 23 (AFP) -- Opposition leader Edem Kodjo 
was named Friday [22 April] to be prime minister of Togo more 
than two months after legislative elections won by a coalition 
of opposition parties. 
  Kodjo, 55, who heads one of the smaller opposition parties, 
was a close aide to President Gnassingbe Eyadema before he 
distanced himself from the regime in the 1980s. He emerged in 
1990 as one of the leaders of the pro-democracy movement. After 
the national conference of 1991 which launched the transition to 
democracy, he founded the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD). 
  In the February elections, he was elected to parliament in 
Lome as part of the opposition front which won an absolute 
majority of 43 seats. However, the UTD garnered only seven 
seats. 
  Although the president is bound by the constitution to 
choose 
a prime minister from the ranks of the parliamentary majority, 
the choice of Edem Kodjo came as a surprise. The leader of the 
Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) which won 36 seats, Yaovi 
Agboyibor had been considered the most likely choice for the job. 
  Eyadema said in a broadcast speech that he had asked the 
opposition to submit "several names" for the post of prime 
minister but it had not complied and "the country can wait no 
longer". 
  Kodjo said he had accepted the post in spite of an 
opposition 
decision to back Agboyibor because the political wrangling had 
gone on too long and there was "a risk that the parliamentary 
majority could be undermined". He called for a national effort 
to revive the country economically, and achieve reconciliation 
and social harmony. 
  A co-founder and deputy leader of the pro-Eyadema Togolese 
People's Rally, two years after the president seized power in 
1967, Kodjo was successively minister for the economy and for 
foreign affairs. But in 1978 he was appointed 
secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity from 
1978, a post he held for five years during which he gradually 
broke with Eyadema. 
  He was the opposition parties' joint candidate in the 1993 
presidential election before they decided to boycott the poll.

  [Excerpt] In Burundi part of the Army attempted a coup last 
night, but it seems that the attempt failed. The plotters did 
not manage to get the Bujumbura military camps onto their side, 
and early this morning the Burundi chief of staff said the 
situation was under control. 
  It was at 0300 that a group of 300 putschists -- 
paratroopers 
plus a tank -- attempted to persuade other troops to join them, 
but without success. A first truckload of troops involved in 
the coup was arrested, and the others scattered and fled through 
the town. 
  According to some reports, some of the officers involved in 
the coup have been arrested. 
  The Burundi Army is made up almost entirely of Tutsis; last 
night's coup attempt was probably made by Tutsi extremists. 
Some reports say that Tutsi civilians were involved in the 
organization of the coup, but the army staff remained loyal to 
the interim president and the government. The political 
leadership was warned in time and took shelter. 
  Some shooting was heard at about 0600 or 0630 this morning 
near the military camps in the south of the town, but otherwise 
Bujumbura is calm. People are starting to come cautiously out 
of their houses. The French and the Belgian schools opened 
normally. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 25 Apr (AFP) -- Six or seven Burundian 
soldiers, including four officers, were arrested yesterday after 
a an attempted coup d'etat in Bujumbura, diplomatic and military 
sources disclosed. The situation in Bujumbura seemed "quite 
normal" this morning, a diplomat in the Burundian capital said. 
  According to the Burundian Army headquarters, this attempted 
coup was planned by "very few Army elements, who were 
immediately neutralized, thus preventing them from rallying 
other soldiers to their cause." Four officers and two or three 
other ranks were arrested while four others have reportedly 
fled, the same sources added. The officers arrested are said to 
be from the Higher Institute of Senior Military Officers. They 
are currently under interrogation. [passage omitted]

  An earlier report indicated the blast went off in Hillbrow. 
There is still no confirmation from police.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] official Vusimuzi Zwane told SAPA a "massive car 
bomb" had exploded just half a block from the PAC regional 
offices. Mr Zwane said the building, which he could not 
identify, was "blown to bits". There was a fire raging and water 
pouring from it. Police had cordoned off the area, he said. 
"It's hell out here." Earlier people had jumped from the 
building, he said. Mr Zwane said he personally had moved three 
bodies and saw another two which seemed to be dead. "I think 
the blast was aimed at us," he said. 
  This seemed to contradict earlier reports that the blast was 
outside the African National Congress' PWV regional offices at 
Lancet House. The ANC are in Jeppe Street, but the blast was in 
Bree Street, he said.

<F P=106> [By Lew Elias] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Buckled balconies, 
twisted aluminium building facades and an overturned and 
burnt-out car were the most prominent features of a glass-strewn 
Bree Street in central Johannesburg on Sunday [24 April] in the 
wake of a carbomb that exploded in the central city quiet. The 
overturned wreck was in front of a store that had been 
completely blown away by what police estimated to be between 70 
and 90kg of explosive material. 
  Four people died and at least six were injured in the blast, 
that could have been targetted at black political organisations. 
The national and regional headquarters of the African National 
Congress and the regional office of the Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] are all within a block of the site of the explosion. 
  Police are still combing the glass-covered streets and 
bombed-out buildings for signs of futher unexploded devices. 
  Sapa took a walk across the blast site with PAC 
Secretary-General Benny Alexander, who was on the phone to the 
regional secretary Musi Zwane when the blast occurred. "I 
thought it was something wrong with the line and then he said, 
`there has been a terrible explosion, I'm getting out of here'," 
Mr Alexander told SAPA as he inspected the outside of the PAC's 
new office in SA [South Africa] House, Bree Street, a block away 
from the centre of the blast. 
  "Benny, is everything all right?" regional police 
commissioner Maj-Gen Koos Calitz asked as the PAC party [as 
received] walked through the debris. Witwatersrand Police 
liaison officer Col Steve Senekal said four people had been 
killed in the blast and a SAPA reporter saw paramedical staff 
treating at least six people on the pavement outside the 
Johannesburg Garden Court Inn about a block away from the blast 
site. At least two of the patients were badly cut in the face 
and body. 
  In Bree Street between Von Williegh and Kruis the 
devastation 
was the worst. Windows were blown out up to four blocks way, 
however, and the entire central city area was physically rocked 
by the blast. The Monte Carlo Hotel, across the road from the 
centre of the blast, had balconies on the second floor buckled 
and hanging down supported only by metal concrete reinforcing 
rods. The hotel building was severely damaged on the side with 
bricks blown out of the wall. The shop across the road, where 
the burnt-out Audi lay on its roof on the pavement, was 
completely empty and gutted by fire. Windows frames in the 
upper stories of the adjacent Queens Court building were twisted 
and glass littered the streets for up to five blocks. 
  Merchants were already removing grilles and sweeping glass 
out their store windows in preparation for the expected squads 
of glazers, while five full SA [South African] Defence Force 
Ratel troop carriers prepared to disgorge personnel to prevent 
possible looting. 
  Shops in the small street mall including a branch of a fried 
chicken outlet had their all-glass storefronts blown away. 
  Police under the supervision of Gen Calitz were combing 
through the debris, videotaping and photographing the damage, as 
the bomb squad with sniffer dogs searched nearby buildings for 
more unexploded devices. 
  Meanwhile, ANC department heads were early Sunday afternoon 
on their way to Shell House to "secure their offices" after a 
number of windows in the building were blown out. 
  ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said earlier the building across 
the road in Plein Street had protected the building up to the 
10th floor but the windows in the upper stories were damaged and 
papers were blowing into the street. 
  A crowd of about 200 people who had gathered to debate the 
blast scattered and ran when a police car drove through it.

  [Text] At least four people are now known to have been 
killed and 18 injured in this morning's powerful car bomb 
explosion in central Johannesburg. 
  The explosion occurred in Bree Street near the regional 
offices of the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and 
the ANC's national headquarters. Regional ANC spokesman Obed 
Bapela has said a senior ANC official was among those killed. 
He said there were about 200 MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of 
the Nation -- ANC military wing] members in the ANC's regional 
offices when the bomb went off. The police say the bomb, of 
between 70 and 90 kilograms, had apparently been planted in or 
under a car parked at the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh 
Streets. 
  Neighboring buildings were extensively damaged and numerous 
windows were blown out. After the explosion people scattered in 
all directions. A sizable crowd began gathering near the scene 
of the blast but dispersed peacefully after being addressed by 
Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC. Troops were called in to help 
patrol the area which had been cordoned off by the police 
shortly after the blast. 
  Police sniffer dogs are being used to comb the area for more 
bombs.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Police on Sunday 
confirmed seven killed people died and 92 were injured when a 
carbomb exploded on Sunday [24 April] morning on the corner of 
Bree and Von Wielligh Streets in central Johannesburg. Speaking 
at a press conference, Witwatersrand Police liaison officer Col 
Steve Senekal said: "This is by far the largest bomb that ever 
went off in Johannesburg. It was comparable to the Pretoria 
Church Steet bomb blast" on May 20, 1983. Police were not 
certain what type of explosive was used and said it would take 
some time to complete the investigation. 
  Col Senekal said two policemen on general patrol were a few 
metres away from the cream or beige Audi when it exploded. One 
of the policemen was slightly injured, he said. 
  Col Senekal said police did not have an idea of what the 
motive or target for the blast was. "It is not for us to 
speculate. There are various offices in the area such as the 
SADF [South African Defense Force], PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] and ANC regional offices." 
  Col Senekal welcomed African National Congress spokesman 
Carl 
Niehaus' intervention when a crowd gathered near the scene. Mr 
Niehaus asked the crowd to be calm and not to retaliate. "We 
certainly appreciate it. We certainly don't need retaliation." 
He also appealed to other organisations to ask their members to 
remain calm. 
  A 70 to 90kg bomb was placed inside or underneath the Audi, 
which was totally destroyed. Buildings shopfronts and vehicles 
in the area were severely damaged. The area has been cordoned 
off and will remain so until at least Monday. 
  Police have already offered a reward of up to R500,000 
[rand] 
for information leading to the arrest of "those responsible for 
this irresponsible and unbelievable deed". 
  A journalist asked police whether another incident was 
related to the bomb blast. Apparently a black Toyota Cressida 
was seen in Bree Street near the Smal Street mall. Three black 
men were seen lying on the ground spread-eagled. Police could 
not confirm the incident. 
  Television crews from ABC and CNN were being shown around 
the 
blast scene shortly after 1PM. Print journalists will be 
allowed onto the blast site in groups of two and three later on 
Sunday.

<F P=106> ["Special news bulletin"] </F>
  [Excerpts] With barely two days left before South Africa's 
historical election, a powerful car bomb has exploded this 
morning at approximately 0945 in the Johannesburg city center. 
At least four people have been confirmed killed, but according 
to reports the death toll already stands at seven. Several 
people were injured by glass fragments, and a spokesman for the 
Hillbrow Hospital says 79 people have been admitted, 11 of them 
in a serious condition. The explosion took place in Bree 
Street, between Von Wielligh and Kruis Streets, close to the ANC 
headquarters. There is no confirmation that there are possibly 
more bombs in the vicinity. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified 
eyewitness, 
in English] We all saw....[pauses] The only thing we saw is we 
saw the police search the car here. After the police searched 
the car they went off; they drove. They parked down there and 
that's when the explosion came. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Now you said the 
police were here, and they searched the car? 
  [Eyewitness] They searched the car here, here, here. Right 
here. 
  [Correspondent] And the car came through. 
  [Eyewitness] The car....[pauses] They left the car in the 
car 
park there. It was about plus five minutes, I say three to five 
minutes; then the explosions came. [end recording] 
  The police estimate that between 70 and 90 kg of explosives 
were used. The front of a shop was completely destroyed and 
there was a fire inside the building. The police, fire brigade, 
and paramedics were on the scene within minutes and four street 
blocks around the scene of the accident were cordoned off. The 
explosion was heard by inhabitants in Hillbrow and Kensington. 
A spokesman for the ANC, Mr. Carl Niehaus, says extensive 
damage was done to the organization's headquarters and telephone 
lines were damaged. He said the explosion took place shortly 
before an ANC election bus was due to depart from the building 
to embark on voter education. He described the explosion as an 
attempt at blatant intimidation. 
  [Begin recording] [Niehaus] We believe that this is an 
attack 
on the entire democratization process in South Africa, and 
specifically on the ANC, and we call on all our people not to 
allow themselves to be provoked by this attack. We must remain 
as calm as possible and ensure that we win this election in the 
best possible way, that everyone turns up to vote. The best way 
to fight this type of terrorism is at the polls. 
  [Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in English] I hope very much that 
we will not panic and as long as the security forces show that 
they are going to be effective in following up all of this kind 
of thing, we should be saying....[pauses] Quite obviously there 
are those who want to subvert and sabotage the efforts, and we 
mustn't allow them. First of all we mustn't panic, and we must 
go along because there isn't as much violence as they had hoped 
there was going to be, and I just beg our people to remain calm 
and to let the security establishment deal with it. We are 
going to vote and these elections are going to be free and fair, 
and so there to all those ghastly creatures who are trying to 
subvert us. We are not going to allow them to do that. [end 
recording] 
  The PAC's regional office is also in the vicinity. A 
spokesman for this organization says he is convinced that the 
explosion was aimed at the PAC.

  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force will not play any 
part in election security. This role will be performed 
exclusively by the police and defense force. Major General Gert 
Opperman of the SADF [South African Defense Force] said that 
members of the SADF would be deployed near voting stations, 
while the SAP [South African Police] would be responsible for 
the immediate security of the voting stations.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Ministry in Asmara on 23 </F>
April] 
  [Excerpts] It is obvious that the relations between the 
people of Eritrea and Sudan are historical and long standing. 
On the basis of this view, and believing that the government of 
the national salvation revolution of Sudan would place its 
national interest and the peace and stability of the region 
above all else, our relations with Sudan were very special 
before the independence of Eritrea. To further strengthen and 
develop these relations, we have been working jointly with the 
Sudanese Government. 
  However, the National islamic Front of Sudan, from its 
political bases in Sudan, wished to control a force in Eritrea 
and formed a group called the Islamic Jihad of Eritrea in 1989. 
It continued to support this group until and after the 
independence of Eritrea. 
  As the Government of Eritrea, we have placed those 
considerations regarding relations between the two nations above 
everything else and we hope that we will overcome the obstacles 
through communication and dialogue. We have made every effort 
to further strengthen and develop cooperation between the two 
peoples. It is true that we have noticed the positive role 
played by the Sudanese Government in controlling and containing 
the movements of this Eritrean group [Islamic Jihad], but since 
the middle of 1993 up to now this group has been carrying out 
its destructive activities, coming all the way from Sudan to 
collaborate with other groups from other regions. 
  This new development compelled us to tell our people and the 
international community everything about this. So the main 
reason for the deterioration in relations was that the 
destructive activities which had been directed against Eritrea 
had been emanating from Sudan. [passage omitted] The practical 
implementation of the agreement reached will guarantee positive 
developments in relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 23 Apr (ENA/PANA) -- The newly formed 
Ethiopian National Democratic Party (ENDP) announced in Addis 
Ababa on Saturday [23 April] that it would not participate in 
the upcoming Constituent Assembly elections. The party said it 
decided to withdraw from the polls in protest against the 
rejection by the National Electoral Board of its demands for the 
extension of the deadline for the registration of voters and 
candidates. It said that another demand for the extension of 
the election date was also rejected by the board. 
  However, the ENDP vowed to continue participating in the 
ongoing council discussions and debates on the draft 
constitution.

Democratic Movement, UPDM, has officially announced the 
dissolution of the organization effective 18 April. The UPDM's 
executive committee decided to dissolve the organization at its 
meeting held in Awasa town. The executive committee made the 
dissolution of the organization known in a letter addressed to 
the ETHIOPIAN NEWS AGENCY. The movement also noted that the 
movement's official documents, along with its seal and insignia, 
would be illegal as of that date. 
  The movement was formed to unite and organize the various 
nationalities in southern Omo Region and struggle for a common 
cause. But, since the various nations and nationalities have 
organized themselves, the movement unanimously resolved to 
restructure the movement's multinational structure to suit 
present political trends and to address the basic issues of the 
various nationalities.

  [Text] Nairobi, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Rival Somali factions have 
agreed to hold a preparatory peace conference in the Kenyan 
capital on May 10, a United Nations spokesman said Tuesday [26 
April]. The meeting was earlier scheduled for Monday but was 
postponed. 
  Later on Monday, representatives from Somalia's 15 main 
factions met in Mogadishu and decided on the new date, the 
spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from the Somali 
capital. The conference will bring together representatives 
from the Somali National Alliance led by Mohamed Farah Aidid and 
those from the group of 15 factions headed by self-styled 
president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. The preparatory conference will 
prepare the ground for a conference of national reconciliation 
tentatively planned to take place on May 28 in Mogadishu.

  [Text] The delegations of the Angolan Government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] met 
alone today to discuss the issue of specific principles 
governing the second round of presidential elections. There are 
reports that the UNITA team has demanded that the Electoral Law 
be reviewed. Alves Antonio, our correspondent in the Zambian 
capital, reports: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] Good evening. At the Lusaka peace 
talks UNITA has defended the need to review the Electoral Law. 
The specific principles contained in the point on the 
conclusion of the presidential elections has continued to 
dominate the talks. The two teams again met alone today in a 
bid to find ways and methods to overcome the stalemate. Though 
the practical results of the meeting are not known yet, official 
sources believe that the government and UNITA teams are about to 
strike an understanding. 
  Meanwhile, Radio Angola learned earlier this evening that 
UNITA is now pushing for a review of some chapters in the 
Electoral Law. The United Nations has rejected that request. 
The United Nations believes that respect must be shown for 
Angolan sovereignty and for this country's democratic 
institutions. In view of that, the Electoral Law review now 
requested by UNITA will be entirely up to the Angolan Parliament 
where, incidentally, 60 seats are reserved for UNITA. Official 
sources close to the talks have said that UNITA's request has 
been set aside. 
  Other reliable sources have told Radio Angola that this 
country's Electoral Law is a perfect [as heard] document that is 
superior to similar laws in many other countries. In view of 
that, those sources regard the review of that document as 
inopportune. They also noted that UNITA itself had helped draw 
up the Electoral Law. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations has already expressed an 
interest in providing material and financial assistance to the 
process of the second round of presidential elections. Such 
assistance would include participation by observer, security, 
control, and verification personnel. 
  There is the belief that the Lusaka peace talks may 
experience new developments within the next few days. It is a 
matter of waiting and seeing. [end recording]

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks may continue to be 
productive, but the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] leader has dampened everybody's optimism when he 
again complicated matters by demanding that his organization 
govern Huambo, Bie, and Benguela Provinces at any cost. He 
alleges that the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola [MPLA] did not win elections in those provinces. MPLA 
Information Secretary Joao Lourenco, who is also a deputy in the 
National Assembly, has just told the People's Television of 
Angola, TPA, that UNITA must accept that it lost the September 
1992 elections. He added that those elections had been general 
and not regional. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] Jonas Savimbi is a real cheeky 
fellow, but we do not believe he has the right to make the 
demands that he just made. He must recognize that he lost the 
September 1992 elections. He must behave as a loser and not as 
a winner. The winning party formed the government. As a matter 
of good will, it decided to open government to several figures 
in opposition parties, including of course UNITA, which is led 
by Mr. Jonas Savimbi. It should be understood, though, that 
this was a government offer and not something the government was 
obliged to do. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the ministerial portfolios demanded by UNITA, 
MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco warned that the 
government's patience has a limit. He added that UNITA's 
demands are quite absurd. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] This is a matter that must be 
made 
quite clear. UNITA did not win the September 1992 elections. 
It cannot demand -- there is nothing that awards it that right 
-- to be given this or that ministerial portfolio, particularly 
when it comes to portfolios that the government believes should 
not be in the hands of opposition parties. We believe that the 
government has shown great generosity. If one looks at the 
number of portfolios that the government has given the 
opposition in general, and UNITA in particular, one surely will 
find that they add up to a considerable number. Such portfolios 
include posts such as ministers, deputy ministers, governors of 
certain provinces, and administrators of districts and communes, 
and they make up a considerable number. In view of that, the 
government believes that UNITA must not continue to make demands 
concerning central and provincial government posts. [end

  [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of

occupy N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
armed forces, however, have firmly defended the area and are 
dealing serious blows to the men led by Eduardo dos Santos.

  [Excerpts] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] wants to capture the capital of Huila Province's 
Jamba Mineira District. Jonas Savimbi's men are applying 
pressure on the area and have already carried out a number of 
attacks, which have all met with a prompt response from the 
government forces. 
  Over the last few days, UNITA moved and deployed three 
battalions over a radius of 15 km north and east of Jamba 
Mineira District. (?The next) will be UNITA's fourth attack on 
the area this month and its aim is to occupy it. The UNITA 
forces were repelled in the first three clashes, leaving 38 
soldiers killed on the ground, along with the equipment they 
were carrying. 
  On 14 April one UNITA battalion attacked Jamba Commune in 
Lubango District, but Savimbi's men met with stiff resistance 
and were put to flight. They left 17 soldiers killed on the 
ground and our forces also took three prisoners. [passage 
omitted] 
  The precarious calm that has prevailed over Cuito was broken 
yet again yesterday. Jonas Savimbi's men and their weapons made 
it clear that the city and its residents could once again 
experience the horrors of war at any time. 
  Yesterday morning the UNITA [word indistinct] troops 
attacked 
government positions in the northern part of Cuito. The 
10-minute attack occurred at about 0700 and resulted in the 
death of one child. Sources in the Angolan Armed Forces 
Operational Command have disclosed that the UNITA forces are 
continuing to carry out provocative operations to try and find a 
pretext that would allow them to fulfill their plans to attack 
Cuito. That source added that, as part of their provocative 
ploys, on 23 April they fired a shell at the government position 
in the north of Cuito.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday we reported that six ministers had 
mysteriously left the country, the rumor in Maseru being that 
they had fled in fear of their lives. But government sources 
maintained they had left for official duties. Well, two of the 
ministers have returned and another four are expected to return 
shortly, according to the principal secretary for information, 
Seeiso Serutla. Koja Berwado got in touch with Mr. Serutla on 
the line to Maseru and asked him why the ministers had decided 
to come back. 
  [Begin recording] [Serutla] This is as a result of the army 
having accepted their pay cheques because the ministers had to 
flee because of the allegations of threats on their lives, when 
the armed forces received their salaries, which apparently did 
not include the increase. 
  [Berwado] So, is it the case that the army has now been paid 
these new wages with the 100 percent increase which they 
demanded? 
  [Serutla] No, at the moment there is no increase in their 
salaries, but the army has accepted that there will be an 
increase and there are some increases in their salaries for May, 
which obviously will be backdadted from April. Let me make it 
clear that it is not 100 percent, as the army (?heard). 
  [Berwado] So, how much is it? 
  [Serutla] I am not sure about the percentage, but it is 
certainly not 100 percent. 
  [Berwado] Who exactly is in charge of the country at the 
moment? I mean, is it the army or is it the government? 
  [Serutla] The Government of Lesotho, through the prime 
minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, is the government of this country, 
and they are still there. 
  [Berwado] So, now, you are definitely going to see a kind of 
a backlash of this situation that erupted last week? 
  [Serutla] I cannot guarantee you anything as, I mean, the 
army in Lesotho is obviously a problem, and I can't guarantee 
anything. All I can say is that we are talking and we are in the 
process of talking to each other. 
  [Berwado] And who in the army are you negotiating with? Who 
is in charge of the army at the moment? 
  [Serutla] A major general. 
  [Berwado] Mr. Serutla, it is quite a worrying prospect if 
you 
say the army have agreed, but then there are no guarantees. 
What about the political situation? 
  [Serutla] What kind of guarantees would you want? I mean, 
they have guaranteed to us that they have accepted some 
increases in their pay salaries, whatever it is. They have said 
they have settled down and that we will continue talking to each 
other. 
  [Berwado] On the question of the mutineers who killed the 
deputy prime minister last week, are they going to be brought to 
book? 
  [Serutla] Well, I want to leave that question really to the 
head of the army. It is their job, whenever there is anything 
like that to deal with it as it is appropriate. 
  [Berwado] Have they indicated that they are going to deal 
with that aspect of the situation? 
  [Serutla] Well, not to me personally. 
  [Berwado] Do you believe they will? 
  [Serutla] I believe that. The situation in Lesotho was bad 
by killing the deputy prime minister, and that the only way 
which will advance peace in Lesotho is for the law breakers to 
be seen to be punished for what they have done, I mean that is 
my personal view. I mean, I think in any civilized country that 
is what we expect.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama has said that the candidate 
receiving the second highest vote total in the presidential 
elections must be appointed vice president of the Republic. 
With regard to the legislative elections, the party receiving 
the second highest vote total should have ministerial 
representation in government. The Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] has said that it does not plan any type of interparty 
government, but it stresses that the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] had rejected such a political solution as 
far back as 1984, after the Nkomati Accord was signed. 
  "I have not yet presented this proposal to my brother, 
President Chissano, but that is my dream, and I have already 
talked about it with diplomats. Many people ask: What does the 
president dream, and I say that is the dream I have, not because 
the country is completely ravaged, but rather because in Africa 
it is very difficult to find victors and vanquished working 
together in the first years after elections," Afonso Dhlakama 
said. 
  According to the Renamo leader, "the party (candidate) that 
comes second ought to be appointed vice president of the 
Republic and, in terms of government itself, the party that 
comes second should also have some ministers in it. That is the 
government I dream of." 
  These and other details concerning a proposed government of 
national unity, GNU, were not discussed when Chissano and 
Dhlakama met last week, but the Renamo leader says that "some 
diplomats with whom I have met have talked a great deal about 
it." 
  In his meeting with the president of the Republic, "we 
discussed the GNU issue, but there was no agreement. I simply 
told him that all wars in Mozambique have had their own 
histories: The war against Portuguese colonialism had its 
history, Renamo's war for democracy had its history, and 
democracy itself will have its history." 
  As the Renamo leader explained, this means that "the party 
which wins the first multiparty elections in this country must 
not seek to govern alone, so as to avoid attacks, acts of 
revenge, and so forth." 
  Renamo leader Dhlakama added: "I have said before that we 
must make use of experiences of others, because any democracy 
has its own history. We do not believe that Frelimo, Renamo, 
the Mozambique Democratic Party (Pademo), or the Mozambican 
National Union (Unamo) can govern the country alone. With those 
conditions in mind, if we look at the history of the United 
States, or of Portugal, we will see that in Portugal 16 
governments fell in the wake of the 25 April 1974 revolution, 
after which the Portuguese learned their lesson. So we cannot 
just proceed to copy what the Americans or the Italians are 
doing today." 
  An African diplomat who noted that it was strange that 
democracy should be demanded for Africa said: "It is immediately 
clear that it is not Dhlakama's idea. When the moment of truth 
comes, people turn around and say that Africa is not ready for 
democracy, so they start coming up with any number of formulas 
to alter the people's wishes, the outcome of the vote. 
Elections should be held for useful purposes. They should not 
be held for nothing, as though no elections had taken place. If 
elections are held simply for there to be no difference between 
victors and vanquished, then you might as well save millions 
upon millions of dollars and spend them more wisely on 
rebuilding our nations." 
  Afonso Dhlakama also said that he will compete in the 
presidential elections, should the Renamo special congress 
endorse his candidacy. He added that, if he were to win, "I 
shall indeed be president of the Republic, no matter what my 
previous experience. The decision will be the people's, and I am 
going to present my government program to the country." (In 
Maringue a few days later, the Renamo special congress confirmed 
him as Renamo's candidate in the upcoming presidential 
elections). 
  The Renamo leader believes that 12 or 20 parties can govern 
the country together during the first five years after 
elections, "learning, being courageous, agreeing to being 
self-critical, and all the rest. In the next election, five 
years hence -- that is when there should be victors, and the 
vanquished will join the opposition and will not touch the 
government." 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana reacted on behalf of the 
government: "That there should be neither victors nor vanquished 
was a phrase we used, from a military viewpoint, to say that war 
produces neither. That was said in terms of the General Peace 
Accord about the end of the war. In terms of political 
governance, though, we said there should be a multiparty system 
and elections. Thus, elections must produce a winner." 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana disclosed that, in the wake 
of the Nkomati Peace Accord between Mozambique and South Africa 
in 1984, the Mozambican Government had held Pretoria-mediated 
talks with Renamo. There was the admission at those talks that 
the war might be settled with political accommodation for 
Renamo. The South African Government even proposed the opening 
of schools to train Renamo members in the border areas of 
Namaacha and Milange. 
  "It was in that spirit that the famous Pretoria Declaration 
was made in October 1984, with great protocol and pomp, but then 
Renamo pulled out and reneged on what it had signed. There was 
the famous phone call to [late Renamo member] Mr. Evo Fernandes, 
who pulled out of that plan. Political accommodation for Renamo 
was the plan, meaning a cessation to the war and reintegration, 
which would naturally have led to a Frelimo-Renamo government, 
but Renamo rejected it in full," Minister Teodato Hunguana said. 
  He also revealed that later, well before the Rome peace 
talks 
had begun, the government took up once again the proposal to 
reintegrate Renamo. That proposal, meanwhile, had been rejected 
by Renamo, which demanded a multiparty system and elections as 
the only way to settle the problem. 
  The government's position continues to be that the party 
that 
wins elections has the responsibility to find solutions that 
will guarantee peace, stability, and a balanced government in 
the country, but, in Teodato Hunguana's words, the winning party 
must not be told what or what not to do. He added that "we can 
defend our ideas. We are free to do so, but no one should ever 
defend his ideas by resorting to the blackmail of warfare, armed 
violence, or the threat of armed violence to try to get others 
to agree." 
  Hunguana described the Renamo leader's demands as predating 
the Rome talks and added that he was not clear about the GNU 
concept. He said, however: "Let there be no confusion. Neither 
Frelimo nor the government are saying that they are brushing 
aside any type of interparty government. Such a government 
could very well result from the search for correct solutions. 
It is perfectly imaginable that as a result of the elections a 
government will be formed that will reflect such tendencies, but 
that will not be an automatic development." 
  The labor minister described as strange Afonso Dhlakama's 
idea that the vice president should come from the party 
receiving the second highest vote total, because that is not 
written into the Constitution. He affirmed, however, that a 
political argument -- rather than a legal one -- could be used, 
as long as it also recognized the problem of proportion: A party 
can come second with 40 percent of the vote and a party can come 
second with 5 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Luis Fernandes in Beira] </F>
  [Excerpt] President of the Republic Joaquim Alberto 
Chissano repeated in Beira today the message he had conveyed 
during his tour of Gaza Province: that we must all work to 
rebuild the country and to create better living conditions for 
the people. The Mozambican head of state conveyed that message 
-- which we perceived to be conciliatory -- when he commented on 
the report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government now 
that he is touring that province. Chissano said that, quote, if 
we have the understanding that that is a common goal, we will 
always see our ideas as contributing toward the resolution of 
problems, unquote. 
  [Begin Chissano recording] It is true that we have reached a 
stage when there are two issues that are talked about in such a 
way as to be made to look contradictory. That should not be the 
case. Much is said in connection with political competition and 
there is also a lot of talk about national reconciliation. This 
has caused some confusion -- namely, the perception that 
political competition can be destructive. Others believe that 
political reconciliation is tantamount to scrapping political 
competition. That should not be the case. We have decided that 
political competition is desirable, so we have created a 
multiparty system. Let us compete politically, but let us do it 
constructively. We must not think, however, that reconciliation 
means we all toe the same political line and we all share the 
same views concerning national reconstruction. There is 
opposition. That has to be recognized. There is opposition. 
Reconciliation means that we are going to engage in serious 
political fighting, but that we will do so with respect, so that 
it will not interfere with the economy, in the sense that it 
could be sabotaged. [end recording] 
  The report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government 
generally deals with the impact of war, natural disasters, and 
political and economic developments over the last two years.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Mateus Ngonhamo, joint commander of </F>
the Supreme Command of the FADM, by Lourenco Jossias on 12 
April; place not given] 
  [Text] [Jossias] General, could you tell us what are the 
duties of FADM [Mozambique Defense Armed Forces]? 
  [Ngonhamo] Well, there are various duties because, as in any 
country in the world, its infrastructures ought to be defended 
and independence ought to be upheld. Those are the duties of 
the FADM: to defend independence and Mozambique's sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. 
  [Jossias] What sort of an army will we have in our country? 
Will it be an army for purely defensive operations or will it 
also be geared toward attacking -- an internationalist army? 
  [Ngonhamo] Right now, your question has many answers. It is 
our desire to have a professional and nonpartisan army with 
defensive and offensive capabilities. If we create an army only 
with a defensive responsibility, our task would not be complete. 
Like I said earlier, we want to defend Mozambique's territorial 
integrity and that is accomplished in different ways. We can 
defend ourselves from any aggression by a neighboring country or 
any power. 
  That could be a defensive action, but within this context we 
can have offensive actions. So, I can say that the army we are 
preparing right now ought to be practically and technically 
offensive and defensive. 
  [Jossias] General, you once said any of Mozambique's 
neighbors posed a threat. Do you still believe that and if so 
why? 
  [Ngonhamo] I see things from different angles. My reading is 
very simple. When I speak of a threat from neighboring 
countries, I speak as a Mozambican who is inside his country. I 
see Mozambique as an independent and sovereign country -- a 
country with economic potential -- and not as a country that is 
the property of a party, such as the one in power today. 
  I have referred to threats -- and I will continue to 
reiterate that we ought to be ready -- because today's friend 
could be tomorrow's enemy. If today there are countries with 
ties of friendship to Mozambique, it is because they are friends 
with the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party, which is 
in power. Our country is under a democratic regime and tomorrow 
any other party could win the elections, but it may not have 
ties of friendship with those countries. That can create 
problems. Let us look at the situation in some countries right 
now. 
  Today, the South African problem is a threat to Mozambique. 
One does not yet know what the situation will be there. 
Mandela, De Klerk, or any other party could win. One does not 
know what the future has in store for South Africa. Here in 
Maputo I am seeing the answer to my assertion that those 
countries pose a threat to Mozambique. South African refugees 
have begun to arrive in Mozambique, fearing the war there, and 
there are people already leaving South Africa for Portugal and 
other countries. That creates a very difficult situation for 
us. It is not only a military threat, but an economic one as 
well. If Mozambique is to have refugees again, and the same 
situation that we had with the ANC in the past, the same 
situation that we had with the Zimbabweans fighting against the 
colonial system in Rhodesia, it will be a threat to us and our 
stability. We, the FADM, will be ready to help, whatever the 
need. 
  We could speak of a country as small as Swaziland, where the 
situation is also not very clear. Their lives evolve around a 
monarchy, but one day a madman may surface and wish to change 
the situation, as in Lesotho, and he could expel the king and 
establish a system that might not conform with ours and with our 
lives in Mozambique. 
  We could even speak of Botswana, where the situation is very 
calm. But that should not please every Mozambican, because one 
day some sort of crisis might flare up. 
  When one sets fire to cotton with a match, the fire and 
smoke 
will not be noticeable immediately. Cotton first burns from the 
inside, and the flames only begin afterward. There are many 
internal problems in Botswana about wish I cannot comment. 
There are refugees from different countries there. It is a 
threat that can surface at any moment. 
  Zimbabwe is even a more serious and open threat. Zimbabwe's 
economic dependence on Mozambique might not please some 
Zimbabweans. It is not a good situation for us. If Mugabe today 
accepts that economic subordination and dependence, it is 
because he has access to the sea. One day, any other party 
might come to power in Zimbabwe and say that that dependence 
should stop, and that it should control the access to the sea by 
trying to integrate Mozambican territory into Zimbabwe. 
  Zambia also has its problems. Today it is a democratic 
country. President Chiluba was democratically elected, but there 
are corruption problems there, and the government has been 
accused of not resolving the economic problems and of not 
creating stability. As Zambia's neighbors, we ought to be 
worried. As soldiers we are always on standby, and we ought to 
be ready to defend ourselves against any dangerous situation and 
instability. 
  With Tanzania we have historic problems, we have blood 
ties. As you know, Mozambicans waged the independence war from 
Tanzania. There are Mozambicans in that country. There are 
people of mixed blood. Mozambicans have left children in 
Tanzania, and today some are here and others are there. There 
has always been a rapprochement. That is still the case today. 
For instance, there are many Mozambicans who are entering 
Nampula, Zambezia, and Niassa alleging that they are looking for 
their parents because they were born in Tanzania during the war. 
Because life is difficult, they need their parents. 
  It is problems like these that affect Mozambique. To date 
politicians do not believe that the situation exists. 
  These are the aspects upon which I based myself when I said 
that all of Mozambique's neighboring countries pose a threat to 
us. There are other issues which I cannot disclose because of 
their far- reaching and secret nature, and which we can only 
deal with within the general staff of the FADM. I have just 
referred to the tip of the iceberg. 
  [Jossias] Turning to the formation of the FADM. In your 
opinion, who is responsible for the present delays? 
  [Ngonhamo] Well, that is a delicate situation. I have been 
involved with the formation of the new army since the very 
beginning and I feel that in fact there are delays in a number 
of sectors. All sectors that affect the formation of the FADM 
are linked to logistics. There are financial problems. I do 
not know whether there is any authorized person in the Ministry 
of Finance or in the FADM logistics. It is in those sectors 
where we can find those responsible for the delays in the 
formation of the army. 
  It is the Mozambican state that is responsible for the 
finances and logistics of the FADM. With the support of other 
countries, the responsibility of restoring training centers 
rests on the shoulders of the state and the government. The 
latest example about this slowness was the ship that was 
supposed to carry the uniforms. It was a joke that so far has 
not been explained. 
  We expected the ship on 15 March, but it only arrived on 12 
April. It sailed from Portugal to South Africa where containers 
were transferred to another ship. On its way to Maputo the ship 
was rerouted to Beira. These are very difficult and complicated 
situations that we cannot understand. 
  We in the CCFADMM [Joint Commission for the Formation of the 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces] suggested that the government 
should use cargo aircraft to ferry at least part of the 
consignment for the first battalions still to be trained, while 
the remainder of the uniforms could be sent by ship to shorten 
the delay. In fact, those problems are the responsibility of 
the government and the government should shoulder them. 
  [Jossias] We know that during the training at Nyanga the 
British instructors refused to let the national flag be raised. 
Now the same situation has arisen at training centers in 
Mozambique. What is the FADM Supreme Command's position about 
this matter? 
  [Ngonhamo] Maybe people have not been properly informed. In 
fact I would like to clarify what has happened or is happening. 
We are the FADM and the Mozambican army. We recognize the flag 
of the Republic of Mozambique. What happens is that there are 
two flags in the country: the flag of the ruling Frelimo Party 
and the state flag. We recognize the state flag that will be 
raised at all barracks and at every FADM center, and even at our 
command post, the Garden, the flag of the Republic of Mozambique 
will be raised, except for the party flag because then it would 
be necessary to get hold of the flags of the country's parties 
and raise them at barracks and training centers. Actually, we 
have been issuing military cards carrying the Republic of 
Mozambique seal. 
  [Jossias] But was there such a problem at Nyanga or not? 
  [Ngonhamo] Well, that issue was not carefully studied and 
clarified. The British and the Zimbabweans did not refuse to 
have the flag. They were awaiting orders from Mozambique to 
know whether they could raise the flag. There was no time in 
view of the speed with which the program was implemented. The 
course ended before we could address the situation. If for 
instance a program involving the FADM is to be carried out in 
any neighboring country, the Republic of Mozambique flag will be 
raised without any problem. 
  [Jossias] The FADM salary plan has just been approved. 
General, are you happy with the plan? 
  [Ngonhamo] I am happy and agree with the salary scale. I 
took part in the discussions with the Frelimo government over 
that issue. Moreover, the finance minister informed the sides 
that 80 contos for a trooper was what the Mozambique Government 
can afford right now. The government's capacity can only go that 
far. I do not think there is any other alternative. I think 
that the matter might not be closed because the new government 
emerging from the elections will, at our request, analyze the 
situation to see whether the soldiers' salaries can be increased 
because their pay does not correspond to the current cost of 
living. The metical has been devaluing all the time. The FADM 
soldiers will accept those salaries, and we as commanders will 
explain to them the reasons for their pay, as well as the 
capacity of the Mozambique Government. 
  [Jossias] We are now going to ask you a personal question. 
How do you differentiate Renamo's General Ngonhamo and FADM's 
General Ngonhamo? 
  [Ngonhamo] Yes, there is indeed a difference. First, when I 
was a Renamo general, I had my instructions and my beliefs were 
different from those I now have as an FADM officer. Even the 
uniforms and stripes were different. My views are apolitical at 
this stage, and I am wearing an FADM uniform. The work I do is 
no longer for the benefit of the party but, rather, for the 
benefit of the people. I have nothing to do with any party. 
Let them have their political clashes, let them have their 
differences. My task at this juncture is to protect the 
country's borders and guarantee security. I am a different man. 
I have changed. 
  [Jossias] You have often come out publicly making political 
statements that reflect Renamo's views. To what extent to do 
such statements help the cause of national reconciliation? 
  [Ngonhamo] I can refute such allegations, which I regard as 
unfounded and arising from the poor understanding shown by some 
people, notably journalists with certain government newspapers. 
I could ask any journalist to point out which sentences in my 
statements he or she perceives to be of a political nature. 
What is at stake here is not the political statements but, 
rather, the underlying reasons for such statements. I am a 
military officer, not a politician. I do not like to shove 
problems under the carpet. I like to indicate clearly what the 
problems are. The problem is that those people who are affected 
by my statements then think they are political statements. Let 
me cast a look back at the speech I made at the close of the 
first training course. That speech caused controversy and even 
SAVANA came out saying that it had been a political statement. 
That is not true, though. 
  I said that we had very difficult work on our hands and that 
we were facing financial problems which the government was very 
slow to address. I also noted that that problem could affect 
training, that our forces might not be operational prior to the 
holding of elections, and that the government appears to develop 
an allergy when money matters come up. This is something that I 
would like to reiterate even now, because it is the truth. 
  I am very happy with the cooperation of Frelimo officers 
helping us train the army. They are good and they cooperate in 
everything as long as money is not involved. When money matters 
come up, something gives and they do not cooperate. They want 
to use the country's money as though it were a favor or a gift 
and that is no way to go about it. We have experienced that 
problem even within the supreme command. I have discussed this 
matter with Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo and we are having 
problems. The statements made by the Joint Commission for the 
Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, CCFADM, at our 
meetings do not correspond with the reality on the ground. 
Despite the fact that our office at the Garden has nothing 
inside, the government team to the CCFADM has already publicly 
stated that conditions are in place for people to work. That is 
a lie. That place has no conditions and people cannot work 
there. That is a money-related problem. 
  We, for instance, are senior commanding officers but we have 
no houses. We have no cars, but they say that cars have already 
been ordered. I have already had talks with the government team 
and told them that there is no need to wait for vehicles to be 
ordered from France or wherever else. You can buy vehicles here 
in Maputo or in South Africa. So that our work can get off the 
ground, let us start working with these vehicles and then we can 
also use the other vehicles that are supposed to be coming from 
France. 
  For example, I have said in this interview today that the 
government must carry the blame for delays in the training of 
the new army. Many people will see that statement as a 
political one. Yet, it is not. When I said that all the present 
government can pay soldiers is 80 contos per month and that we 
will take up this matter with the new government that emerges 
from elections, many people will have interpreted it as a 
political statement. Yet, I was saying the truth. That is the 
situation. This government says it cannot give more and we are 
going to work with the next government in a bid to secure better 
conditions for our soldiers. This is the reality, pure and 
simple. 
  [Jossias] Will you remain head of the Renamo team to the 
CCFADM or is that position incompatible with your new duties? 
  [Ngonhamo] For working reasons, that matter is being looked 
at within Renamo. Because there is a lot of work to be done, 
the joint commission needs to make many trips to various parts 
of the country. The new army led by us also has an office and a 
general staff. We are always having to respond to reports and 
messages about the deployment of troops. Now, we are going to 
have the first battalion of special forces and it winds up its 
training within the next two weeks. That involves a lot of work 
and it requires separation so that a new work routine can be 
created in this new area. It is an issue that is being 
analyzed. Furthermore, it does not look very good if the same 
person is a colored on one hand and a black on the other. 
[sentence as printed] A person should have one race only. 
  [Jossias] You do agree, though, that this is one issue that 
must definitely be clarified? 
  [Ngonhamo] Of course I agree, and it will be clarified as 
soon as possible. 
  [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: you are working with two generals 
who used to be your enemies. I would like to know how you 
relate to them and with whom you feel more at ease. 
  [Ngonhamo] I feel at ease with both. I also feel at ease 
with all those generals who are not involved in these 
commissions or in carrying out these tasks. When I work with 
them, I am working with Mozambicans. Obviously, some present 
wrong ideas, but that is not a serious problem because I have 
managed to analyze things calmly. One can communicate with me, 
and there is really no problem. What is more, there is no 
reason for separation from the Frelimo generals because, to my 
mind, we were separated during the war and now we are together. 
If we are on an equal footing with them today, it is because 
work has been done to achieve it. 
  [Jossias] In an interview he granted this newspaper 
recently, 
General Mabote said that the war waged by Renamo was not a 
guerrilla war but, rather, pure terrorism. Given that you were 
one of Renamo's principal strategists, how do view the war waged 
by your movement? 
  [Ngonhamo] I did read the interview granted by Gen. 
Sebastiao 
Mabote. First, Mr. Mabote said that in this country there had 
been only one guerrilla war for independence and that what had 
followed had been terrorism. He thereby clearly suggested that 
Renamo had been responsible for the terrorism. Second, he 
implied that there is no general more intelligent than he within 
Frelimo, his party. 
  I do not believe that he was too aware of what he was 
saying, 
or perhaps he said it for some particular reason. What he said 
was not true because ours was not a terrorist war. Had it been 
so, it would not have received so much support from the people. 
A terrorist cannot administer a territory. A terrorist cannot 
change the situation within a country, or the traditional 
symbols of government. 
  I do confirm that vehicles were burned and that people were 
killed during the war. Responsibility for those deaths must not 
be laid at Renamo's door. Obviously, we have to admit that 
Renamo bullets did claim innocent lives during the war. Gen. 
Mabote said that Renamo killed civilians. He also said he had 
been trained in Soviet academies and suggested he was very 
intelligent. I can only regret that the Soviets should have 
trained him poorly. 
  First, one thing I know as a soldier is that barbed wire 
should be used to fence in any military barracks. Those were 
not the instructions given by Gen. Mabote concerning Popular 
Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, FPLM, barracks. There, 
he used people as human shields around the barracks and those 
people were caught in the fire and killed when there were 
attacks. It was not Renamo that put people around its barracks. 
Those were orders issued by Frelimo and by Gen. Mabote, who was 
the FPLM's chief of the General Staff. 
  As for Mr. Mabote's comments about burned vehicles, I would 
like the Mozambican people to answer that charge. Frelimo 
forcibly took vehicles from their owners to put them in convoys 
to carry Frelimo war materiel and soldiers so they could launch 
military offensives against Renamo. Obviously, vehicles that 
were part of convoys were ambushed and burned. There are 
Mozambicans who are still claiming compensation for those 
losses. It was not Renamo that commandeered those vehicles for 
its military convoys. 
  Third, Frelimo soldiers forced civilians to join their 
military convoys. They used to say that it was for security 
purposes, so they could travel between Beira and Machipanda, 
from Maputo to Beira, or from Maputo to Namaacha, Ressano 
Garcia, and Ponta do Ouro. Those vehicles were ambushed and 
after a few shots the soldiers would flee and the civilians were 
left to die. It was not Renamo that did that. Civilians who 
misbehaved and went about on their own were punished and 
detained. Those actions were the fruit of Gen. Mabote's 
intelligence, who was the FPLM's chief of the General Staff. I 
do think that he had some special motive for saying those things. 
  [Jossias] As commander of the new army, do you think that 
Gen. Mabote would be fit to serve in the new army now being 
formed? 
  [Ngonhamo] All people are welcome and can serve in the FADM 
forces. Whether or not they have experience or ability, we are 
going to train them. There will be no problem about that. 
  [Jossias] He also said that the young generals should 
refrain from making political statements. Do you agree with him? 
  [Ngonhamo] I agree with him, but unfortunately he 
contradicts 
himself in that interview. First, when he compares guerrilla 
warfare and terrorism, his idea promptly loses validity. He has 
gone so far as to say that generals who make political 
statements are illiterate. In saying so, he is making a 
political, rather than a military, statement. If, however, he 
was serious when he said that, then we are in agreement, because 
our view is that soldiers should not make political statements 
because they are not politicians. 
  Obviously, there are statements which, by virtue of our 
work, 
end up as political statements, even though that is not our 
intention. We must defend our work, our interests with the 
politicians. We are handicapped and we need the collaboration 
of politicians to be able to walk. We must report the problems 
and difficulties we come up against when we deal with 
politicians, but when we do so they think we are fighting them. 
  We can suppose that the Frelimo government will lose the 
upcoming elections and a new government will be elected. I can 
guarantee you that the new government will come in for the same 
treatment from us. That is how it has to be. We are going to 
apply pressure on the government to always seek to improve the 
conditions of the military. This is why I have said we will be 
touching again on this matter of salaries with the new 
government. If Frelimo wins, then we will have new meetings to 
try to negotiate the salaries of military personnel. That is 
not a matter of making politics but, rather, of working with 
politicians. 
  [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: do you think it will be possible to 
create a regional army in which the FADM forces will take part? 
  [Ngonhamo] The situation in southern Africa does not suggest 
that any conditions are in place for the existence of a force of 
that kind. My belief is that such a force will be possible at a 
later stage, when there is greater stability and a more 
thoughtful approach to things. I cannot limit the development 
of such things. At this juncture, such a proposition is 
difficult because the situation in our region is not 
particularly good and all countries are full of problems. What 
is more, those are political problems that affect even the 
soldiers. However, such a plan will be possible if democracies 
are allowed to grow more solid and if there is lasting peace. 
At this point, there is mistrust even among countries, which 
makes the implementation of such a plan very difficult. 
  [Jossias] Kindly tell us whether work is under way to 
reintegrate Renamo's generals into the new army. 
  [Ngonhamo] Yes, that work is under way. There are positions 
in the new army, and we are going to share those positions. 
There are areas where half of the men will be former government 
army officers and the other half will be made up of former 
Renamo officers. They come together and that is what is called 
a unified army. The fact that positions are being divided must 
not be viewed as divisions along party lines. That was the way 
we found to integrate soldiers in the new army. From the 
infantry up to the special forces, half of the men will come 
from the government and the other half from Renamo. 
  [Jossias] Very little is known about you. Who is, in fact, 
Gen. Ngonhamo? 
  [Ngonhamo] My name is Mateus Ngonhamo. I was born on 15 
August 1963, and I shall be turning 31 this year. I am still 
unmarried, but I dating someone and I hope to marry. I come 
from a family of traditional rulers, and my father is a bishop 
with the Zionist Church. 
  I was born in the area of Dombe, in Manica Province's 
Sussundenga District. My first schooling was at the Catholic 
mission in Dombe. That was where I completed my primary 
schooling, with the help of the nuns. Then I moved to Chimoio, 
where I did the first two years of secondary school, after which 
I joined the Agrarian Institute, where I did the second year of 
the agriculture course. In 1978, I left school and joined 
Renamo. 
  [Jossias] Why did you leave school? 
  [Ngonhamo] I made that decision because of a problem 
connected with my studies. My name came up on a list saying 
that I should conclude my course in Cuba, in the company of 
other colleagues, my cousins included. We accepted that because 
we knew this was a matter of responding to the country's needs. 
  However, I could not help asking myself one question: Those 
names came up on one day, I was supposed to have my medical 
check-up the next day, and the following day we would all be 
leaving for Cuba. I wanted to say goodbye to my parents, who 
lived some 300 or 400 km from Chimoio. I could not leave 
without telling my parents where I was going. It was not 
possible. There were others who felt like me, who could not go 
without saying farewell to their relatives. It would not be a 
good thing to leave without saying anything to the family. 
There were eight of us who felt that way, and we did not go to 
Cuba on the date that had been set. 
  We stayed and the situation became very difficult. There 
were witch hunts, various problems, and there was the risk that 
we might be expelled from the institute. We were reactionaries 
and we lacked discipline. I told my father that I did not want 
to study any more. I wanted to leave my studies and get back 
home to make a decision. 
  I went to my village and explained everything to my father. 
I told him that I was leaving and that I might come around some 
day. I had already been in contact with Renamo men, even at that 
stage. I asked them to come to my house so my father could see 
and believe that I would be joining them. They arrived there in 
the morning and I introduced them to my father. We prepared 
breakfast for them and then we left for the jungle. 
  When I went there, I trained as a soldier, like the others 
did. After undergoing training, I received a weapon and I 
started working as a Renamo private. I did a course as section 
chief, after which I did another to become platoon commander. 
That was the organization we had in our guerrilla army. 
  On 15 September 1981, Renamo made me a one-star general and 
I 
started working in various provinces. I worked in Inhambane, 
Manica, Sofala, Tete, Zambezia, and Nampula. After completing 
another course in 1986, I was promoted to two-star general. 
  I worked on various fronts. I went to Niassa and Nampula, 
and I became a lieutenant general in 1990. Then I came to the 
Southern Front and worked here as Southern Front commander and 
coordinator. I was commander for Maputo, Inhambane, and Gaza 
Provinces. 
  When the General Peace Accord was about to be signed, I 
returned to Maringue and stayed there until I was appointed head 
of the Renamo team to the CCFADM. 
  [Jossias] What is your area of expertise, after failing in 
your agricultural studies? 
  [Ngonhamo] I have specialized in infantry, light and heavy 
artillery, and military intelligence. 
  [Jossias] Is military intelligence counterintelligence? 
  [Ngonhamo] No. Military intelligence is not 
counterintelligence. I have also specialized as a military 
cadres instructor. Those were various duties I had to fulfill 
during the war. 
  [Jossias] Did you go about on foot in the provinces you have 
mentioned? 
  [Ngonhamo] That is right. We did not have vehicles. I 
remember quite well that in 1982 I went on foot from Mabote (in 
Inhambane Province) to Gorongosa. It was a long march that took 
us 94 days. I have also traveled on foot both ways bet?een 
Gorongosa and Zambezia, and Nampula and Niassa. 
  When I left Gorongosa now, I went to Chibuto on foot. It was 
always like that. We had no transportation. 
  [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo, did you never undergo military 
training outside the country? 
  [Ngonhamo] Well, I have been abroad on several occasions to 
do some courses, but most of my training was done inside the 
country. I have been to South Africa. In 1984, I was with the 
Renamo team that tried to negotiate an accord with Frelimo. 
  [Jossias] Why did that accord fail? 
  [Ngonhamo] It failed because Frelimo's knowledge about 
Renamo was very scant. Samora Machel did not know Renamo well 
and was always given wrong information. That is yet another 
thing I would like to say about Gen. Mabote. He misled 
President Samora Machel a great deal. He always gave him the 
wrong information, even about the military situation, and he 
knew little about Renamo. 
  Samora always believed that Renamo would end with the 
signing 
of the Nkomati Accord. He thought that Renamo survived thanks 
to South African support. That was far from correct: Renamo 
did not die out with the Nkomati Accord. In fact, it increased 
its operations. Samora was also misled when he was told that it 
was no solution to negotiate with Renamo because Renamo lacked 
intelligence and that it had neither politicians nor military 
figures. That was what prompted Samora to outline the program 
of the talks to get Renamo to integrate into Frelimo, to offer 
an amnesty to Renamo. That was no good. 
  Jacinto Veloso headed the Frelimo team to the talks. That 
team included [Member of Parliament] Sergio Vieira; [Labor 
Minister] Hunguana; [former adviser to Samora Machel] Fernando 
Honwana; Hama Thai, who is now the Mozambique Armed Forces chief 
of General Staff, but who was in the Air Force at the time; and 
others. 
  Their only message was amnesty. They had no alternative in 
their baggage. So we told them: "We are the ones who should be 
granting you amnesty, not the other way around." So, the talks 
flopped and we continued with the war. 
  When we went to Rome, Frelimo already an idea about what the 
talks should focus on. There was negotiation in Rome. There 
were ploys, but they no longer viewed the matter as they had 
done in 1984. 
  [Jossias] One could say that you became a general when you 
were still very young. 
  [Ngonhamo] Yes, but I think that was due to my military 
skills. Perhaps I was a good soldier.

Resistance [Renamo] soldiers were demobilized throughout the 
country by 24 April. Over the last three days the two sides 
have (?only) sent 51 men to join the new Mozambican Army, 
thereby increasing to 4,000 the number of troops available for 
the formation of the future Mozambique Defense Armed Forces. 
Meanwhile, the UN Operations in Mozambique has reported that 
some 50,000 government and Renamo soldiers have already been

  [Text] Harare April 22 SAPA -- Forty-five members of the 
Azania People's Liberation Army [APLA] and Umkonto we Sizwe [MK, 
Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] on Friday [22 April] 
graduated at the Zimbabwe Army Staff College in Harare, after a 
four-month course in conventional warfare. Zimbabwe Defence 
Minister Moven Mahachi said the men were now ready for 
integration into South Africa's new national army, ZIANA news 
agency reported. 
  Mr Mahachi told the men to prepare to work alongside their 
former foes. "You are obviously aware that you will be 
integrated into a new defence force where you will work with 
people who were your enemies for a long time. 
  "It will not be an easy transition but one that will demand 
your determination, patience and goodwill in a spirit of 
reconciliation," the minister said in a speech read for him by 
Deputy Defence Secretary Alexio Guruwo. This, he said, was the 
only way to ensure that democracy in South Africa would succeed 
and be sustained. 
  "We in Zimbabwe went through a transition period quite 
similar to what you will experience in South Africa in the next 
few months. We are more than willing to share our experiences 
with you to the best of our ability as we have demonstrated by 
accepting to train in our military institutions cadres from MK 
and APLA."

  [Text] Harare April 22 SAPA -- Zimbabwe President Robert 
Mugabe has not, contrary to reports, ordered a commission of 
inquiry into a land-grab scandal involving senior party and 
government officials, a daily newspaper in Harare reported on 
Friday [22 April]. He had made his own enquiries and that was 
the end of the matter, it said. 
  The DAILY GAZETTE was quoting Minister of Home Affairs 
Dumiso 
Dabengwa on an earlier remark to a human rights convention 
nearly two weeks ago that Mr Mugabe had ordered an inquiry into 
disclosures that state-owned farms, many of them intended for 
resettling thousands of peasant farmers, had been distributed 
among officials including two cabinet ministers, top officers of 
the army, air force, police and intelligence services and senior 
civil servants. 
  "The word inquiry does not automatically translate into a 
commission," the GAZETTE quoted Mr Dabengwa on Friday. "The 
president went on to enquire about the scheme himself and got 
the reply he wanted, resulting in the action he has taken." 
  Last week Mr Mugabe announced he had cancelled all leases to 
the estimated 180 state-owned farms, and denied there was a 
scandal. Only a few political figures had benefited, he said. 
  The independent press here has named 15, and there are known 
to be at least five more. 
  Observers say Mr Dabengwa's remarks are likely to deepen 
dismay over the way in which the government is handling the 
scandal, and that it is clear Mr Mugabe does not intend to give 
it the same concern he did to the 1989 controversy when ruling 
party politicians profiteered in a used-car racket. Then he 
appointed a commission of inquiry headed by a judge that 
resulted in five cabinet ministers resigning in disgrace for 
cheating and lying, one of them taking his own life. 
  Land is regarded as the most explosive issue in Zimbabwean 
politics, and probably the basis of Mr Mugabe's political 
platform because he regularly promises to correct the inequities 
of the colonial past. At independence the ruling ZANU (PF) 
[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party promised 
165,000 families would be settled in five years. Fourteen years 
later, about 100,000 have been settled and vast tracts of land 
bought by government are lying idle.

  [Text] The newly inducted internal affairs minister, the 
Honorable Samuel Dhokie, has said the Liberian people are tired 
of war and will join forces to subdue any group or individual 
intending to wage war on the nation through any attempt to take 
power by force. Minister Dhokie said Liberians should all be 
prepared to (?find solutions at the) conference table, noting 
that the gun can only continue to bring untold suffering to our 
people instead of helping to heal the wounds inflicted as result 
of the four-year civil war. 
  Speaking yesterday when he officially took over at the 
Internal Affairs Ministry, Mr. Dhokie appealed to all warring 
factions, including the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, 
NPFL, to effectively implement the disarmament aspect of the 
Cotonou Accord so as to give participatory democracy a chance in 
Liberia. Minister Dhokie emphasized that what has happened to 
Liberia has equally happened to most of the great and developed 
nations of the world and said what Liberians need now is a 
demonstration of the virtue of reconciliation, love for one 
another, and forgiveness in order to rebuild the country. 
  Minister Dhokie said that his ministry is one of the 
bedrocks 
upon which the achievement of lasting peace, reconciliation, and 
reunification rests and assured that he would work tirelessly to 
bring the people together under the Liberia National 
Transitional Government [LNTG]. He reminded the Internal 
Affairs Ministry family of the important role the ministry must 
play at this crucial time and urged them to remain dedicated, 
committed, and responsible for the mandate of the LNTG. 
  Minister Dhokie then apologized to the traditional leaders 
in 
the country, especially those who left their various counties 
and got stranded in Monrovia for the suffering the war has 
caused them and appealed to them to fully contribute to the 
success of the LNTG. 
  The newly commissioned defense minister, retired Major 
General Sande Ware, has called on officials of the Defense 
Ministry to work in unison for the enhancement of policies and 
programs of the LNTG. He said that it is only through a united 
front that people of one goal can withstand the test of time in 
the service of their community and nation. Minister Ware, who 
retained his position as defense minister, maintained that the 
hallmark of his administration will be division of land, labor, 
and hard work at the Defense Ministry. [sentence as heard] The 
LNTG defense minister made the remark yesterday during his first 
meeting with officials of the Defense Ministry and members of 
the general and special staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia. 
  On the crisis in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia], Minister Ware asked the Defense Ministry 
family to assist in bringing the parties together for the 
peaceful resolution of the conflict. He described the ULIMO 
crisis as the most dangerous conflict in the country and 
appealed to peace-loving Liberians and friends of Liberia to get 
involved to quickly bring the ULIMO internal crisis (?to a 
speedy end).

  [Text] Alhaji Koromah is not only unhappy with the 
fighting going on around the Po River bridge, he has also thrown 
a spanner in the works of the transitional government, after 
euphoria greeted Wednesday's [20 April] announcement that a 
cabinet had been agreed. First, Charles Taylor quibbled, but 
then backtracked. Now, Alhaji Koromah says he does not go along 
with the selection of ministers. Robin White asked Alhaji 
Koromah what his problem was: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] According to the Cotonou 
Agreement, it is the three signatories to the Cotonou Agreement 
-- NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the erstwhile 
IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] who are to decide on 
the allocation of ministries. And the last time in Cotonou, the 
ministries were divided. ULIMO got Defense Ministry and Finance 
Ministry. Now, we hear on the air that Defense Ministry has 
been given to the interim government. This is not only 
unacceptable, it is also totally illegal. So, as far as ULIMO 
is concerned, that particular act is null and void and it will 
never be accepted. Defense Ministry goes to ULIMO. 
  [White] So, what are you going to do about it? 
  [Koromah] We have several options. We are just making it 
clear. Council of State has not any power to distribute any 
ministries. So, if it is going to live by its creator, which is 
the Cotonou Accord, it will not do anything that is illegal. 
So, we have a number of actions that are both drastic and 
nondrastic. So, we want to start off by bringing it to their 
attention that that action there is no action and it will not be 
accepted. 
  [White] Couldn't somebody have agreed to this on your 
behalf? 
  [Koromah] No, I communicated last night and this morning 
with everybody: the acting chairman, General Isaac Quawah; the 
members of the executive council, I talked by radio to top 
members, the field commander, General (Dumbuyah); and the 
battalion commander talked to me, (Jango Jaba); and nobody seems 
to be aware of this. 
  [White] Now, there seems to be trouble again within your 
organization with forces supporting Roosevelt Johnson fighting 
around the Po River bridge again. Now, you met Roosevelt 
Johnson in Sierra Leone and it had been reported that you had 
sorted out your problems, so what is going on? 
  [Koromah] Well, I don't think it is Roosevelt Johnson's 
forces because Johnson kissed the Bible in front of Captain 
Strasser and his deputy chairman, Bio, and took an oath and he 
signed a document so the group of people who attack our 
positions around the Po River are just rebels and we will treat 
them as rebels. As a matter of fact, according to my Zebra 
Battalion commander, (Jango Jaba), that particular group 
attacked our positions and positions of ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. 
As you know, ECOMOG is deployed in our territory and they killed 
at least two ECOMOG soldiers. Our forces killed about 47 of 
their men, and about 50 of those rebels were arrested by ECOMOG. 
They are presently being interrogated at ECOMOG base and the 
rest of them ran off. 
  [White] Where is Roosevelt Johnson now? 
  [Koromah] Roosevelt Johnson is... [pauses] he should be in 
Monrovia, and the last time I was in Monrovia, I had invited him 
and we had set up a committee that was discussing across the 
line and trying to get our pieces together and sort things out. 
So, it was completely shocking for me to have heard that 
another group of attackers had come, but I don't want to believe 
it is Johnson because I don't believe he is a pagan to go and 
kiss the Bible and get involved in rebel activity... 
  [White, interrupting] It sounds to me that you need to go 
back to Liberia yourself and sort out these problems. 
  [Koroma] Yes, I am on my way. For security reasons I am not 
going to tell you the date. 
  [White] Why? Who might kill you? 
  [Koromah] It is not a question of who might want to kill me. 
I mean all kinds of people want to kill me. [end recording]

  [Text] Efforts have been going on to put finishing touches 
to Liberia's Transitional Government. One of the participants, 
ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], has 
again been split by factional fighting. Krahn supporters of 
Roosevelt Johnson have been battling with Alhaji Koromah's 
Madingo forces at the Po River bridge just northwest of 
Monrovia. It follows last month's assault on ULIMO headquarters 
at Tubmanburg by Johnson's forces. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey 
Allison telexed this report: 
  Factional fighting continued this morning with skirmishes at 
(Krombatkam), a village 300 yards from the Po River bridge, 
sparking off a wave of panic-stricken residents behind ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring 
Group] checkpoint south of the bridge. One of the fleeing 
residents, Joshua Schneider, who appeared terrified, said that 
the villagers took to their heels as the sound of gunfire neared 
the center of their village. 
  Troops of the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, deployed south of 
the Po River bridge, have sealed off the area to normal traffic. 
ECOMOG troops on the Po River highway today told journalists 
that one of their sergeants had been killed in crossfire in 
yesterday's gunbattle at the bridge. Commanders of the Koromah 
faction still in control of the Po River bridge said seven Krahn 
soldiers were killed in yesterday's fighting around the Po River 
alone. ECOMOG troops near the bridge confirmed that 35 Krahns 
were rescued and taken to the headquarters of the peacekeeping 
force. A commander of Alhaji Koromah's Madingo faction said 
there are still pockets of the Krahns in the forest and we will 
institute a systematic mopping-up exercise to rid the area of 
any threat.

prevented a team of NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
Legislative Assembly members in Kakata from entering Monrovia. 
Reports say ECOMOG is insisting that the officials had to be 
cleared at headquarters for official pass, a move condemned by 
the NPFL's TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] members. The 
NPFL Assembly members condemned ECOMOG for [words indistinct] in 
the way of free travel between Monrovia and Gbarnga, saying 
there is no need for a pass system in a reunified Liberia.

  [Text] The attention of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] High Command 
has been drawn to a front-page publication of the 25 April 
edition of the INQUIRER newspaper, reporting that ULIMO fighters 
loyal to General Roosevelt Johnson have taken over the Po River 
Bridge. 
  ECOMOG says the publication was not only false but also 
misleading and is capable of causing panic and giving the 
general public a wrong impression of the [word indistinct] 
situation at Po River Bridge. 
  According to the release, ECOMOG has been in control of the 
Po River Bridge and is still in proper control of it. It is 
obvious therefore that the INQUIRER reporter was not physically 
present at the bridge to ascertain the full position of things 
there. 
  Also on the observation of the ECOMOG High Command was a BBC 
Focus on Africa news item aired recently, which alleged that an 
ECOMOG tank was hit by a ULIMO RPG. The release also noted that 
none of ECOMOG vehicles was hit by a shot from an RPG and is 
therefore reiterating the need for constant consultation from 
ECOMOG High Command on matters affecting its operations, 
especially at this stage of the Liberian peace process.

  [Text] A two-day all-citizens conference has ended in 
Gbarnga with the issuance of a resolution giving a one-week 
grace period to the State Council for the full sitting of the 
Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG] to ably observe 
the disarmament process. In the eight-count resolution, the 
citizens called for the setting up of a committee which would 
constantly remind ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] to accelerate the peace 
process. 
  According to the resolution, the all-citizens conference 
fully endorsed all NPFL nominees to the LNTG and urged the 
appointees to adhere to the code of conduct agreed upon by the 
NPFL. The resolution also called on the NPFL to contact leaders 
of all armed groups to the Liberian conflict through NPFL 
representatives to the Constitutional Assembly to open dialogue 
for the total and the unconditional resolution of the Liberian 
civil conflict. The conference also spelled that the general 
and presidential election, scheduled for December this year, be 
held in accordance with the (?April 7 accord) in Monrovia. 
  Receiving the resolution, the leader of the NPFL, Mr. 
Charles 
Gankay Taylor, said he would carry out the wishes of the 
Liberian people as he is their servant. He said the road to 
peace has been rough and rocky and the Liberian people have 
contributed immensely to the peace process. Mr. Taylor said the 
Liberian people can boast that they preserved the sovereignty of 
this nation. 
  The NPFL leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, speaking during 
the citizens meeting in Gbarnga over the weekend, said the NPFL 
is satisfied over the resolve of intense negotiations thus far 
in furtherance of the peace process and therefore formally 
becomes part of the LNTG today, Monday. Mr. Taylor expressed 
greats thanks and appreciation to the Almighty God for his mercy 
and handiwork which have continued to sustain this nation, 
despite all odds during the course of the five-year old civil 
conflict.

  [Text] Our guest this morning is Edem Kodjo, the new 
Togolese prime minister, appointed last Friday by President 
Eyadema. The appointment of Edem Kodjo, chairman of the 
Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] is being disputed by the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], which is the other party of 
the majority. The CAR recalls that according to an agreement 
made last month with the UTD, the prime minister should come 
from the CAR. For his part, Edem Kodjo wants to calm things 
down. Here is his reaction, speaking to Guy Mariot, our 
correspondent in Togo. Listen hard: The line quality is not of 
the best. It will be difficult to hear all of what he says. 
  [Begin recording] [Kodjo] We must try not to poison the 
atmosphere, because the reaction of the CAR is a reaction that 
must be integrated within the framework of the problems that we 
are facing and will face. The most important thing is that the 
bridges should not be broken between the two political parties 
which make up the parliamentary majority. And these bridges 
have not broken. As Mr. Agboyibo has himself suggested, and I 
think it is not a bad idea, we should seek fresh consultations 
in such a way as to make progress on the problems we face. 
  [Mariot] But does the UDT-CAR coalition still exist, Mr. 
Prime Minister? 
  [Kodjo] Of course it does. And it is this coalition which is 
the fruit of the victory of the Togolese people during the 
recent parliamentary elections. We cannot get away from this 
coalition. I believe we must do our utmost to ensure its 
continued existence. 
  [Mariot] So when will the government be announced, and how 
will it be made up? Will it be technocrats, and from which 
parties? 
  [Kodjo] In principle the government should be made up of 
representatives of political parties in the assembly, 
personalities from the political world, and civilian 
personalities, who can make a contribution to solving the 
problems of this country, and there is no question of forming a 
government of technocrats. 
  I think [words indistinct] a certain number of choices 
(?about its direction) and this has to be taken into account. 
As such, we have to appoint a new kind of government where the 
main political forces of the country are represented. 
  [Mariot] How can you sell your government program? What are 
its main outlines? 
  [Kodjo] First of all we need national reconciliation, in 
other words, we have to ensure that conditions exist enabling 
everyone to express their opinions and to feel free in a free 
country. I think that to do this we need to give up our 
quarrels. We will do what we can. The different players in the 
political game should be associated in this game, and find 
themselves free in this country. 
  We must do our utmost to get the problem of refugees solved, 
because it is a basic aspect of reconciliation. Starting this 
reconciliation, (?demanded by the people), must be carried out 
[words indistinct] in such a way that the army, which is our 
army, can find understanding and a total feeling of brotherhood 
among the people. 
  After this comes the creation of a state based on law, which 
is something essential in democratic systems; human rights must 
be respected, we must have institutions to strengthen respect 
for human rights. 
  Certain solutions have also been envisaged in the 
constitution. We must institute it rapidly. We must quickly 
move toward a state based on law, and the state based on law 
should be decentralized so that the people can take a closer 
part in mapping out policies concerning their future. 
  We also need an economic recovery. This is the main problem. 
As you know, the economic situation in our country is bad, its 
economic recovery can only come as a result of efforts and also 
as a result of the confidence we must give the outside world so 
that we can use the necessary capital sums for the development 
of our industry, agriculture, and trade. 
  With the devaluation of the African Financial Community 
franc, the problems are all the more difficult. We need to 
buckle down to this problem to ensure the economic recovery of 
this country. We can do it. 
  Finally, we need social peace, because economic development 
is of itself a good thing, but we need social peace in as far as 
whole strata of the people, like young people, women, farmers 
try a new path [as heard]. Otherwise, young people [word 
indistinct] the future. 
  [Mariot] What do the people of Togo expect of you today 
after 
such a long period of difficulties? 
  [Kodjo] (?First let me say) what I expect of the Togolese 
people: That they should have confidence, that they should 
mobilize themselves for the work we are going to do in common. 
  As for what the people expect of me, it is the small 
contribution I can make, because in the nature of things, I have 
perhaps a small degree of experience in some areas, and I could 
put to use this experience and the relationships I have been 
able to form here and there to solve the problems that the 
Togolese people want to solve. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Burundi remained surprisingly calm after its 
president's death on 6 April. This calm has just been shattered 
20 days later. Elements of the Burundi Armed Forces, dominated 
by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried once again to seize power 
yesterday. The coup plot was quickly foiled and was mostly 
unnoticed in Bujumbura. Here is our correspondent Celsius 
Senguyunva with a report. 
  [Begin Senguyunva recording] Officially, the information has 
not yet been confirmed or refuted. We have been able to obtain 
some scraps of information from the Army Headquarters which say 
that about 10 soldiers tried to stage a coup by mobilizing 
others who did not follow them. These 10 people have been 
arrested. The Army Headquarters is still not prepared to 
disclose the identity of these people. All we know, and I am 
repeating what the Army chief of general staff told us on the 
phone just a while ago, is that the people who attempted to 
stage this coup are the same ones who tried to stage the October 
coup in which President Ndadaye was killed. He said that these 
people were already on the black lists of the investigators and 
could have been arrested at any moment. Reports trickling out 
to us say that some of the soldiers managed to escape. There are 
some senior officers among these soldiers. [end recording] 
  The mutiny was therefore quickly quelled in Bujumbura, but 
the number of soldiers involved remains unclear. According to 
the Army Headquarters, six or seven soldiers including four 
officers have been arrested. Others managed to escape. 
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the current speaker of the National 
Assembly, who is acting as president of the Republic, confirmed 
the coup attempt to Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] Last night, some unusual 
movements were observed within a unit of the Burundi Army. The 
Army chief of general staff and [words indistinct] military 
defense units tried to monitor the movements and they confirmed 
this morning that an attempt was made. 
  [Saliou] Could you confirm to us reports that the four 
soldiers, who are allegedly the brains behind this putsch, have 
been arrested? 
  [Ntibantunganya] Actually, two officers have been 
interrogated at the Army Headquarters and have provided some 
information, which I cannot comment on now. 
  [Saliou] Do you fear for your life now? 
  [Ntibantunganya] If someone is a politician he always fears 
for his life. This is especially true in a country such as ours 
which is experiencing difficulties, but I am not scared. [end 
recording] 
  The new coup attempt in Burundi illustrates the agitation 
within the ranks of some Tutsi extremist soldiers, who have 
never accepted the coming into power of the Hutus, yet are 
nonetheless in the majority. [passage omitted] This morning, 
gunfire could still be heard in the outlying northern districts 
of Bujumbura. Armed clashes have for several days now been 
taking place between soldiers and armed Hutu militiamen. 
However, according to military sources, these clashes are not 
linked to the coup attempt. The rest of the capital and the 
country is calm.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 25 Apr (PANA) -- A small section of the 
Parachute Battalion of the Burundi Army were the plotters of the 
failed coup d'etat late Sunday [24 April], the minister of human 
rights said Monday in Bujumbura. The minister, Issa 
Ngendakumana, who is the government's spokesman, told the 
PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY in the Burundi capital that two trucks 
filled with parachutists had gone to several barracks to 
persuade other soldiers to join the plot. 
  But the director of communication at the Ministry of 
National 
Defense, Commander Sinarinzi, said that five junior officers 
were leaders of the plot and that just one truck with five 
parachutists aboard had attempted to carry out the coup. The 
second truck, he said, was abandoned by its driver who 
immediately reported the plot to the Special Investigation 
Brigade. Sinarinzi said that the five arrests had been made and 
that the mutineers were being interrogated. 
  This is the third coup attempt in Burundi in nine months. 
The first was on 10 July 1993, on the eve of President Melchior 
Ndadaye's inauguration. Ndadaye, the first democratically 
elected president in the country, was killed in the second 
attempt on 21 October. His successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, died 
on 6 April in a suspicious plane crash. 
  Sunday's fioled coup coincided with the ultimatum had been 
largely ignored. 
  The same source said that 10 residents of Ruhero, a posh 
central area of Bujumbura, surrendered their firearm licenses to 
local authorities. However, firing continues in the northern 
part of the capital killing and injuring soldiers and civilians. 
  Musaga, a relatively quiet suburb in the south of Bujumbura, 
was again the scene of violent ethnic clashes Sunday. Four 
people were wounded, police and local residents said. Armed 
gangs attacked a military detachment based in the northeastern 
province of Karuzi Sunday, severly wounding two soldiers, the 
governor of the region, Mbonyumugenzi Frederic, said.

  [Text] [Announcer] In Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, 
south of Rwanda, the situation is calm but still very tense. 
Last night's abortive coup by several dozen soldiers and 
officers has failed. Some of those behind the coup have been 
arrested, others are on the run. Francoise Berlaymont first 
tells us how the abortive coup started: 
  [Berlaymont] Those behind the coup were arrested last night. 
According to the interior minister, they are three Tutsi 
extremists, three officers, namely two captains and one officer 
cadet of the Superior Institute of Military Officers [Institut 
Superieur des Cadres Militaires]. They went out yesterday 
afternoon with one armored car and two trucks as well as some 50 
men. They tried to storm the residences of the chief of staff 
and the defense minister, as well as the president's residence. 
However, those behind the coup did not manage to convince the 
other barracks. The abortive coup was not only directed at the 
government, but also at the army high command. 
  Those officers who have been arrested are believed to 
reproach the chief of staff for its lack of firmness in the 
Kamenge clashes. This is the Hutu district of Bujumbura, whose 
inhabitants have been opposing the Army for two weeks. The Army 
issued an ultimatum. Yesterday, Sunday [24 April], at 1800, all 
the inhabitants were to surrender their weapons, which they 
failed to do. The ultimatum was postponed to this evening, at 
1800. Several thousand soldiers came from other regions of the 
country last weekend to surround Kamenge. This maneuver could 
have been used as a cover for the coup. 
  Shooting went on all day in Kamenge with guns, grenades, 
machine guns, and rifles. It is impossible to enter or leave 
the district. The rest of the capital is calm, but tension is 
extremely high, despite seemingly normal life. Francoise 
Berlaymont reporting from Bujumbura for the news bulletin. 
  [Announcer] We have heard that contacts are being 
established 
in Bujumbura. Their aim is to prevent a violent confrontation 
in the northern districts of the town between the Army -- 
dominated by Tutsis -- and the Hutu gangs of armed resistance 
fighters who have found refuge there. If these contacts fail, 
this would in all likelihood lead to more tension in Burundi. 
  In Brussels, the FRODEBU [the Front for Democracy in 
Burundi], has said that last night's abortive coup is to be 
attributed to the supporters of the former president, 
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who, for his part, has strongly denied 
these allegations. The FRODEBU, the majority party in Burundi, 
has also said that the coup was continuing, that the Army was 
putting the government under pressure, that the next few hours 
will decide whether it is double or quits.

  [Text] The Burundi interim president, Mr. Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, has addressed again all the citizens on the 
crucial issue of security over the whole territory in general 
and to the mayorship of Bujumbura in particular. He launched an 
urgent appeal to all the Burundians so that they all continue to 
bring back durable peace in the country. Security is on the 
agenda of all the consultation meetings which are being held 
since a number of weeks. 
  Mr. Ntibantunganya first evoked the problem of disarming the 
civil population, precising that after the expiry of the 
ultimatum, the follow-up committee on the evolution of the 
situation in Burundi after the tragic death of President 
Ntaryamira had extended the delay. In his declaration, the 
interim president indicated that the reasons for the disarmament 
of the civilian population are multiple. The government will be 
able to settle problems pertaining to peace and security. 
Disarmament will allow to avoid suspicion between the nation 
components. 
  The government intends to get the law on the arms detention 
respected. The president-interim also thanked the nation's 
Armed Forces for keeping loyal to legal institutions by refusing 
to rally eventual putschists.

  [Text] The deadline set by the government for the surrender 
of firearms expired yesterday. No statement has so far been 
issued. Earlier, the government warned all groups in possession 
of firearms, whether lawfully or unlawfully, that the Army and 
the security committees will be forced to search for firearms if 
they are not surrendered. A government announcement called on 
armed groups to stop shooting and on the Army to maintain 
discipline and to use weapons for self defense. 
  Speaking to reporters, Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko 
disclosed that the seizure of arms would take place in all parts 
of the country, that is the municipalities, divisions, and 
regions. Meanwhile, our reporter in Karuzi region has reported 
that two soldiers were shot and injured by unknown assailants.

  [Text] The government's call for people to surrender their 
arms does not seem to have been heeded in Bujumbura. After the 
expiration of the ultimatum yesterday at 1800 local time, the 
possession of about 10 firearms was declared in Rohero Zone, six 
arms in Ngagara, and one in Bwiza. No arms were declared or 
surrendered in Musaga, Buyenzi or Nyakabiga. The town's 
northern zones of Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke, whose leaders 
we met, remain tense. The head of Kamenge Zone said he no 
longer has access to his office. The head of Kinama Zone told 
us that people had left the zone en masse. Only armed elements 
remain there.

  [Excerpt] Ndjamena, 25 Apr (AFP) -- The Chadian delegation 
charged with supervising the Libyan withdrawal from Aozou Strip 
arrived in Aozou yesterday where it held a working session with 
the Libyan delegation, a communique issued by the office of the 
president in Ndjamena today pointed out. This meeting, which 
was attended by a UN delegation, was aimed, notably at fixing 
the timetable for the departure of the Libyan troops. 
  The Libyan withdrawal from Omchi is expected to end on 25 
April in the part of the strip situated east of Aozou, the 
communique specified. In the west of the territory concerned, 
the following timetable was established: Withdrawal from Kirzo, 
"from around 20 May to 25 May;" withdrawal from Rasmia, from 26 
to 28 May; withdrawal from Gazoumgoud, from 24 to 28 May, and 
last, withdrawal from Aozou "by midnight on 30 May." Thus, "up 
til midnight on 30 May, the civil and military administration in 
the various aforementioned localities will be Libyan." 
  Finally, the communique of the Chadian delegation, whose 
departure from Ndjamena was announced on 15 April, said "the 
minesweeping exercise continues despite some incidents on both 
the Libyan and Chadian sides." [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Rwandan delegation held a news conference at the

was made up of some of the ministers of President Habyarimana's 
government. The various delegation members spoke of the tragic 
situation in Rwanda. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] [Words indistinct] 
the 
Rwandan head of state against whom an attack was carried out on 
the night of 6 April. The Burundian head of state and close 
aides of the two presidents also lost their lives in the attack. 
There has been much loss of life and property all over the 
country following the resumption of hostilities by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] in the capital and elsewhere in violation 
of the Arusha peace accords, as well as through citizen's 
ensuing anger. In view of this situation, the Rwandan 
Government, formed on 9 April, tried to install peace in 
accordance with the first of three missions assigned to it: the 
rapid restoration of (?order) and securing lives and property. 
  Within this framework the Rwandan Government has taken 
initiatives since (?12 April) to obtain a cease-fire. It has 
also expressed its gratitude for and accepted the role played by 
the mediators who at the RPF's own request on (?19 April) made 
available a text which was approved by the RPF [words

  [Text] In Rwanda the unilateral cease-fire declared by the 
Patriotic Front [RPF] is due to come into force at 2200 GMT. 
However, this end to the fighting is conditional on an end to 
the massacres. Meanwhile, massacres and fighting are continuing 
in the capital, Kigali. 
  On the diplomatic and military fronts the situation is 
deadlocked between the two warring factions. The interim 
government has announced its own cease-fire from Zaire. Any 
dialogue seems more and more unlikely. Here is the foreign 
minister of the transitional government, Jerome Bicamumpaka: 
  [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] If the RPF wants to talk 
with 
the Rwandan army over the heads of the government, this is not 
possible. On the other hand, if the RPF wants to negotiate with 
soldiers under the authority of the Rwandan government, I 
believe that we can take the necessary steps to enable such a 
dialogue. The RPF cannot hope to dictate anything by refusing 
to recognize our government. I believe that the RPF is not 
sincere when it speaks of a cease-fire; had it been sincere it 
would not have started the hostilities on 6 and 7 April. This 
time, however, if the RPF, taking note of developments in the 
military sphere, in the political sphere, is changing its mind, 
if it wants a genuine cease-fire with proper guarantees, then we 
are ready to negotiate with the RPF, but we do not trust its 
statements. 
  [Correspondent Dominique de Courcelles] You, the government, 
have for your part declared a unilateral cease-fire, too. What 
is the situation regarding this cease-fire? 
  [Bicamumpaka] [Words indistinct] of the Zairean president, 
we 
proposed a cease-fire. We hope that the Zairean president will 
forward this proposal to the RPF and that the latter will accept 
it. Either we negotiate and we have peace, or, if we do not want 
peace, if the RPF wants war, we hope to defeat it militarily.

  [Text] In its 23 April communique, the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] declared unilaterally that it would stop fighting in 
all the areas it has liberated, from midnight last night, 
depending however, on the fulfillment of all its conditions. 
  It is worth recalling that the unilateral cease-fire comes 
at 
a time when RPF fighters have been doing well. The new 
positions taken together with the former neutral zone represent 
an area twice as big as the area which the RPF previously 
controlled before the resumption of the war this month. The RPF 
fighters have hugely increased the territory under their 
control, having added to it the area from which they had 
previously withdrawn. 
  There is a current lull in the fighting. The entire Mutara 
region and the entire Kibungo Prefecture are in RPF hands. 
Radio Rwanda has confirmed an Army Headquarters report that 
there is no fighting in these areas, and the Army Headquarters 
has also confirmed this by saying there is no fighting in 
Byumba. Indeed, the entire prefecture and town of Byumba were 
under RPF control by the time of the unilateral cease-fire. The 
same applies to most parts of Ruhengeri Prefecture. The 
cease-fire comes at a time when the whole prefecture is under 
RPF control. The same applies to the town of Kigali. By the 
time the cease-fire was declared, RPF fighters maintained 
control of the liberated areas, while remaining vigilant. The 
government forces had tried in vain to push them out of these 
areas. 
  That, in brief, was the situation as of yesterday, when the 
RPF and its fighters declared a unilateral cease-fire while at 
the same time remaining vigilant. 
  As you have just heard in our war front news, the RPF 
fighters have gone further than temporarily taking control of 
communes. They have also added the area from which they had 
previously withdrawn to their territory. In two weeks and four 
days -- that is 18 days -- the RPF fighters have gained control 
of the entire Mutara and Buganza regions. They have moved away 
from controlling only communes, and now control entire 
prefectures and their towns. Examples are Byumba Prefecture and 
its town and Kibungo and its town, which are in RPF hands. 
  Apart from that, the RPF fighters have displayed exceptional 
courage. The fighting which stopped last night had even moved 
into the capital where the RPF is in control of strategic 
military positions. We support the RPF fighters and are 
encouraged by the selflessness and courage that they continue to 
exhibit in the liberation of Rwanda, while protecting innocent 
people, as decided by the RPF.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Faustin Twagiramungu, 
the man who was to bring Rwanda's Hutus and rebel Tutsis 
together in a broad-based interim government, accused Rwandan 
soldiers of killing their president to revive the civil war. A 
transitional government based on a peace agreement signed on 
August 4 last year was to include members of the insurgent 
[Rwandan] Patriotic Front (RPF) most of whose members are from 
the Tutsi minority. But the ethnic bloodshed which broke out 
after President Juvenal Habyarimana's death on April 6 in a 
suspicious plane crash put paid to the plan. 
  "The soldiers wanted to stage a coup but they realised a 
coup 
would not win support and instead installed a government which 
would do what they wanted," said Twagiramungu, who has fled to 
Kenya where he is living at an undisclosed location. He said 
Monday [25 April] the "strongman" behind the alleged coup was a 
chief of staff at the Defence Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  Twagiramungu, 49, a member of the Republican Democratic 
Movement (MDR) - the main opposition party to the Habyarimana 
regime - is a Hutu. He was to have taken over as prime minister 
from Agathe Uwilingiyimana, also from the MDR. However Hutu 
hardliners in the presidential guard murdered Uwilingiyimana and 
would have killed Twagiramungu if he had not fled his home and 
left the country, he said. He said he had "jumped over the 
wall" into a neighbour's home from where he was taken aboard a 
United Nations armoured vehicle to the headquarters of the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). He stayed there until 
April 19. 
  Twagiramungu said he had had to leave his family at the home 
of another neighbour because there was only room in the UN 
vehicle for himself and his eight Bangladeshi bodyguards. 
Soldiers looted and machine-gunned his home after he left, he 
told journalists here. In the doomed plane carrying Habyarimana 
were also several of his closest aides including the Army chief 
of staff. The president of neighbouring Burundi Cyprien 
Ntaryamira and two of his ministers were also aboard, though 
Twagiramungu said that in his view "for the Burundians, it was 
an accident. No one knew they would be there." 
  Twagiramungu said the RPF had "nothing to gain" from killing 
the president and that it was more likely that Hutu extremists 
in the Army had done it to "revive the civil war" because they 
resented sharing power with the Tutsis. Twagiramungu accused 
these soldiers of having made several previous attempts to 
revive the fighting. One involved the murder of the minister of 
public works Felicien Gatabazi, who was shot dead in Kigali on 
February 21, he said.

Restaurant in 7th Avenue, Marabastad. They then sped off in a 
blue Toyota RSI, according to initial reports. The injured were 
taken to H F Verwoerd Hospital. It was not immediately clear 
what type of explosive was used, but the blast was heard for a 
considerable distance. A police investigation was immediately 
begun, Lt Harrington said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- Police on Monday [25 
April] night denied a suspect was arrested in connection with 
car bombings in Johannesburg in the past two days. African 
National Congress National Chairman Thabo Mbeki earlier said 
passersby had made a citizen's arrest after seeing a white man 
running from a car which was packed with explosives. The 
suspect had parked the car outside a Department of Home Affairs 
office in Benoni on the East Rand, he said, adding police were 
dealing with the matter. 
  But police spokesman Col Steve Senekal said there was no 
truth in Mr Mbeki's statement. He said passersby had noticed a 
vehicle with a suspicious parcel inside. Police took the car 
away and searched it. There were no explosives. "We have been 
trying to get hold of Mr Mbeki to clarify the matter," Col 
Senekal said. 
  At least 19 people were killed and more than 130 were 
wounded 
in two car bomb attacks on Sunday and Monday.

"The blast in Germiston will seem like a Sunday school picnic

going until we get our `volkstaat' [Afrikaner homeland]." BBB 
leader Prof Johan Schabort said on Monday night he knew nothing 
about the claim. However, just as the African National Congress 
could not control its supporters so the BBB did not know all its

  [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- Police had encountered 
logistical problems and a police officer made an error of 
judgement during attempts to search the ANC's Shell House 
headquarters following the fatal shooting of Zulu marchers, the 
Minister of Law and Order, Mr Hernus Kriel, said on Monday [25 
April]. 
  Speaking during the debate on constitutional amendments, he 
said the unsuccessful search of Shell House would form part of a 
Goldstone Commission inquiry into the march and subsequent 
shootings. "The principle remains that no one is above the law. 
It is absolutely essential that we find out the truth as soon 
as possible." 
  Mr Kriel expressed regret at Monday's series of bomb blasts 
and said such incidents should never happen in a civilised 
country. The police assisted by the army would do their best to 
limit any escalation of violence during the election period. 
  "Reckless actions and omissions" by the ANC, IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] and the Conservative Party had created a climate 
for violence in the country. 
  The ANC and IFP were involved in internecine violence which 
had claimed thousands of lives. Their leaders had repeatedly 
failed to meet to discuss their differences. The CP 
[Conservative Party] had incited people to violence and CP 
leader Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg had publicly declared his party 
would use violent means if they did not get a volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland]. Mr Kriel said several recent blasts had 
been with dynamite, and asked where the dynamite came from. 
  The government had repeatedly warned the CP not to join 
forces with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance 
Movement -- AWB], but the CP did not have the courage to 
distance itself from the AWB.

  [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- Bombers were stupid and 
spineless if they believed they could stop the elections, the 
minister of foreign affairs, Mr Pik Botha, said on Monday [25 
April]. 
  Speaking in debate on constitutional amendments, he said 
those responsible for recent explosions would not halt the 
elections. "We will not allow ourselves to be scared off. I 
appeal to all South Africans to take part in the elections with 
even greater dedication and determination." 
  Earlier, Mr Roger Burrows (DP [Democratic Party] Pinetown) 
said the DP utterly condemned the bombings and the bombers 
responsbile for blasts in Johannesburg on Sunday, and in 
Germiston and Randfontein on Monday. "The people of South 
Africa must go to the polls with the firm belief it is democracy 
they are going to achieve."

  [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela said he held talks with President 
F W de Klerk on Monday [25 April] morning to discuss tough new 
measures to hit back at the people behind the latest upsurge of 
bomb blasts. 
  Mr Mandela said he had also talked to Justice Minister Kobie 
Coetsee and Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe. "I was 
convinced they want to put an end to the violence." 
  Speaking at Hillbrow Hospital after visiting some of the 
victims of Sunday's Johannesburg blast, Mr Mandela said the 
proof of this would be in the implementation. "I am convinced 
tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I 
hope what we discussed will be implemented firmly. I hope the 
government acts in a way to remove the impression it's a 
government of weaklings." 
  Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's 
car bomb explosion in Johannesburg. Twelve explosions in all 
have occurred since Saturday, including another massive blast at 
a Germiston black taxi rank on Monday morning which killed 10 
people and injured 36. 
  The ANC president said the security forces were doing the 
best they could in difficult circumstances and he hoped their 
response following his latest talks with the government "will 
raise the confidence of the public". 
  The forces of peace were far stronger than those who wished 
to cause violence, he said. "We are one country and one 
people... I want you to look to the future with hope and 
confidence." People should turn up in large numbers to vote to 
show their defiance to those who did not want the elections. 
  The country's first all-race election begins on Tuesday. 
  Inside the hospital, Mr Mandela spoke to some of the victims 
of the Johannesburg blast including 29-year-old David Maimela, 
who told SAPA he was visiting his girlfriend when it occured. "I 
think it's very bad. It's not right to try to stop the 
elections. This is the first time we are going to vote." Mr 
Maimela's one ankle was fractured and his forehead was lacerated 
by shrapnel. 
  Thirty-three-year-old Eric Ngxalose, short-order cook at a 
Midtown fast food outlet, was coming to work when the bomb, 
estimated to have comprised 70-90kg of explosives, went off. Mr 
Ngxalose's leg was injured. 
  Mr Levy Khumalo, 51, was also hit by shrapnel. A resident of 
Jeppe Hostel, he was in town on Sunday morning to visit his 
children, who sell clothes in the city centre. Speaking through 
a Zulu interpreter, Mr Khumalo told SAPA he was shocked by the 
explosion. "I was not expecting that." He told nurses he did 
not want to see Mr Mandela, and his bed was curtained off when 
the ANC leader arrived.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki by </F>
announcer Jon Snow in Johannesburg on 25 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] I've been speaking to the chairman of the 
ANC, Thabo Mbeki, and I asked him if he thought he was being 
told the whole truth about what was happening and whether he was 
confident that the bombings could be stopped? 
  [Mbeki] The problem, Jon, is either the incapacity or the 
unwillingness of the police to deal with this problem. 
Fortunately what is happening now is that a fair amount of 
information is beginning to accumulate as to who is involved. 
That's more than 50 percent of the battle -- to discover who 
actually is involved in a sense of planning the activities of 
this third force leading it, controlling it, and I'm saying that 
a fair amount of information is getting accumulated, much of 
which the police might indeed have had, but have been either 
unwilling or for some reason or other incapable of acting 
against them, a new government.... 
  [Snow, interrupting] Is the unwillingness though because the 
police are too close to these people? 
  [Mbeki] Because many of them come from within the police 
force. They come from within the police force and I think that 
many of the police are unwilling to act against their colleagues. 
  [Snow] So how can you change that? You can't do it 
overnight. 
  [Mbeki] It'll change, it'll change because the rot does not 
affect the entirety of the police force. But the way the police 
have been structured up to now is in a sense like a military 
organization, where junior officers get afraid to act until a 
more senior officer acts, and aware the senior officer is a 
person involved in third force activities then the organization 
gets paralyzed. No it's not as though the whole police force 
was in that sort of position, I think there will be many police, 
policemen and women who will be quite ready to act against this 
third force even out of a sense of restoring the professional 
integrity of the service. 
  [Snow] Is a large measure of what's happening basically a 
very frustrated extreme, rightwing white community that want's 
to set up a volkstaat, and is there any prospect of them ever 
being able to do so? 
  [Mbeki] I don't think it's the people who want to establish 
a 
volkstaat, I think it's the people who don't accept that there 
should be change. People who cannot accept that you can have a 
democratic government which because of the demography of this 
country will be in the majority black. They don't want that. 
They don't want any alteration of this system, and therefore 
say that we make sure that we shoot and kill so hard that such 
alteration will not occur. 
  [Snow] But then that suggests that if these people aren't 
prepared even before the election to accept the principle of a 
black majority government after the election, you may be forced 
to issue banning orders and then start arresting these people. 
  [Mbeki] No. You see we have to get to the leadership, the 
organizers, the planners of this kind of violent activity that 
we are seeing now in the run-up to the elections. I don't think 
it's a matter of banning organizations. 
  [Snow] You see I interviewed Mr. Terreblanche [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement leader] over the weekend and he said: Well, 
I don't encourage it, but this is going to happen, and I can 
understand why it's going to happen, and there will be more and 
more of it. That's exactly what he said. Now this is almost 
tantamount to encouraging it, therefore will you not be forced 
to move against people like Mr. Terreblanche? 
  [Mbeki] Sure, Terreblanche is encouraging it, but what I'm 
saying, Jon, is that what's critically important is not so much 
Terreblanche, it's the people who are actually planning, 
organizing, accumulating weapons, accumulating explosives, 
distributing them, training people, ordering people to go and 
place a bomb here or there, ordering somebody to go and 
assassinate and so on, we need to get to those people.

  [Excerpts] A man is being detained for questioning in 
connection with the spate of bomb explosions during the last two 
days. This information was announced by the deputy minister of 
law and order, Mr. Gert Myburgh. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Freedom Front leader General Constand 
Viljoen] The security situation in our country is critical, and 
I believe that the levels of violence have overtaken any level 
at which one can have an election and later say the election was 
free and fair. It is a pity, because we have been hoping all 
along that we could have constitutional peace with all the 
groups before continuing with the process. 
  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement member Fred Rundle] It is not 
our people. I do not know who it is. You must remember that 
there are literally hundreds of organizations which, just like 
ours, do not want to fall under a communist government. And 
these people -- it can be any one of these people. I do not 
know who it is. [end recording] 
  The Democratic Party has expressed condolences with the next 
of kin of those killed in the bomb blasts. The PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] has said the attacks follow a pattern 
as the targets have been groups of black people or offices used 
by liberation groups. The party has asked voters to vote for the 
sake of peace and wisdom.

  [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress seemed amenable to a general amnesty for all people 
guilty of, or associated with, political crimes, the state 
president, Mr F W de Klerk, said on Monday [25 April]. Speaking 
in debate on constitutional amendments, he said important 
breakthroughs had been achieved on the issue following 
negotiations with the ANC, among others. The government had 
noticed a fundamental shift in the ANC's attitude as a result of 
talks, with that organisation realising there would not be a new 
police or defence force after the elections. 
  The amnesty deadline had been set at October 8, 1990, but it 
could be revised in the course of negotiations on further 
constitutional amendments. "The government has a firm 
commitment to October 8, but in interaction with all parties 
there can be shifts within the framework of the constitution."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
25 April] 
  [Text] The president of the African National Congress 
(ANC), Comrade Nelson Mandela, has on a number of occasions 
pronounced on the issue of indemnity for members of the security 
forces who have been involved in criminal activities in defence 
of apartheid. The most recent pronouncement was made in Durban 
on Sunday 24th April. 
  The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC on 29th 
August 1993 called for a full investigation of all the abuses 
that occurred under the apartheid system, pointing out that the 
National Party (NP) government has never accepted collective or 
individual responsibility for the abuses of the regime. The ANC 
has always been of the opinion that the NP government has 
neither the moral right nor the authority to unilaterally 
indemnify itself or its agents for wrongs committed in the past. 
That right can only be exercised by a government representative 
of all the people of South Africa. Such indemnity shall occur 
subject to full disclosure of the violations committed. 
  Disclosure should not be viewed as punitive, but is a 
necessary precondition for national reconciliation. The ANC 
re-affirms that position. 
  The principle of indemnity has never been under dispute 
between ourselves and the NP government. Following the adoption 
of the Groote Schuur Minute in May 1990, the NP government and 
the ANC jointly arrived at a formula, which was translated into 
legislation, whose terms defined 8th October 1990 as the cut off 
date for all acts for which indemnity could be sought. That 
legislation remains operative. The ANC which was integrally 
involved in the conception and elaboration of the terms of that 
law, remains fully committed to its letter and spirit. 
  Comrade Nelson Mandela's reiteration of the ANC's position 
regarding indemnity in Durban on Sunday, implies that, subject 
to full disclosure, the ANC is fully committed to granting 
indemnity to all members of the security forces for acts of 
commission or ommission, that violated the rights of others 
committed before the agreed cut off date, 8th October 1990. 
  Sadly, numerous violations continued after that date. Hit 
squads, assassinations, covert operations, and para-military 
activities that wreaked havoc on our communities escalated. 
Thousands of people lost their lives, including entire African 
families. Respected judicial commissions and other official 
investigative bodies have repeatedly implicated members of the 
security forces in such crimes. The affected communities have 
also alleged that members of the security forces colluded and 
involved themselves in destabilisation activities. 
  It would be presumptuous of the ANC or any other party to 
seek to exonerate the perpetrators of these crimes unilaterally. 
In two days time the South African people will be going to the 
polls to elect a democratic parliament. That parliament, will, 
among other tasks, be charged with a thorough re-examination of 
the past, by setting in motion a process of national disclosure 
of all violations of human rights from all sides. A democratic 
parliament could then exercise its discretion as to how the 
matter is to be handled. 
  The ANC reiterates it commitment to the norms of democracy 
based on respect for human dignity and the rights of all persons 
irrespective of race, class, gender or creed.

  [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- About 900 South African 
National Defence Force [SANDF] troops will provide a guard of 
honour at the inauguration of South Africa's new president in 
Pretoria on May 10. 
  South African Defence Force Chief Commandant-General Georg 
Meiring said in Pretoria on Monday the new SANDF would play an 
important role in the elections and inauguration of the 
president and deputy presidents of the government of national 
unity. 
  The army will co-ordinate the SANDF's participation in the 
ceremonies in Cape Town and Pretoria from May 6 to 10. 
  Troops consisting of members of different forces in the 
SANDF 
will line the route in Church Street from the Presidency to the 
Union Buildings for the inauguration on May 10. 
  They will wear South African army camouflage uniform, 
trimmed 
with red and white, and will withdraw as soon as the president 
has passed by. 
  The army will provide a guard of honour at the Union 
Buildings. A 21-gun salute will be fired and a South African Air 
Force fly-past will honour the new president. 
  Heads of state and other foreign dignitaries arriving at 
Waterkloof Air Force Base in Pretoria will be greeted by Air 
Force and Medical Services guards of honour. Dignitaries 
arriving at Jan Smuts Airport near Johannesburg will be met by 
an army guard of honour. 
  Gen Meiring said this would be the first large-scale 
ceremonial appearance of the SANDF.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Election Seen as Cause for Celebration -- Johannesburg 
SUNDAY 
TIMES in English in an editorial entitled "Laying the Foundation 
for Our Future," on page 40 on 24 April says that the coming 
election is a time for celebration for South Africans. South 
Africans will vote, it says, because "this election, and this 
election alone, must lay the foundation of the future for them, 
for their children and their children's children." The 
editorial welcomes the followers of Chief Buthelezi and Constand 
Viljoen into the election, saying "no South African should stand 
aside in angry isolation." Referring to the atrocities of 
apartheid, the paper says: "To have come from such a past to our 
present condition is truly a miracle." It notes that some 
"foreign observers...notably the Sunday Times in London, lapsed 
into gleeful anticipation of disaster, attaching it first to the 
right wing and to the army or police, and later to Inkatha or to 
a wider Zulu nationalism. In the event, the armed forces have 
not mutinied, nor have the police rebelled, and Inkatha has led 
the Zulu people, dancing with joy, into the elections." 
Apartheid, the editorial points out, has created "mountainous 
problems" that must still be solved, such as poverty and 
illiteracy. Furthermore, "minorities, still flocking to the 
banner of the National Party," are trying "to cling to privilege 
or fondle fears of the future." Nevertheless, it concludes, 
South Africans over the past four years "have shown that we are 
able to find solutions. And that is reason enough to join the 
Zulus in celebration." 
<H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>
  Vote for ANC Urged -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English 
on 24 April carries beneath its masthead on page 1, a nearly 
full-page reproduction of the South African flag with a large 
"THE END!" stamped over it. In the lower right corner of the 
flag is the following editorial statement: "We have come to the 
eve of our liberation and stand ready to reclaim a right we have 
been denied for centuries -- the right to vote and take charge 
of our destiny. But as we prepare to excercise this right, we 
dare not take a retrogressive step and delay our freedom. There 
is simply no reason to prolong for one minute the poverty, 
unemployment, illiteracy, violence and racism that National 
Party rule has come to symbolise so powerfully. Nor is there 
any moral justification for extending the life of any of its 
partners in apartheid. Our destiny demands that we vote for 
democracy, peace and reconciliation. It demands that we vote 
for the ANC." 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Need for Multiparty Government Seen -- In an editorial 
entitled "Use Your Vote for South Africa's Salvation," 
Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on page 10 of its 23 April 
edition, finds reasons to vote for several parties. After 
noting that "none of the competing parties deserves unqualified 
support," the editorial continues by stating: "Firstly, the 
Democratic Party [DP] most closely espouses the principles we 
cherish, and we consider its presence in government to be 
essential....Votes for the DP will not be wasted -- they will be 
votes for multi-party government." The ANC, the editorial 
continues, "has earned its place as the major party in a 
government of national unity." "Nelson Mandela...is the only 
man with the stature to hold us together and set us firmly on 
the new road." Looking to the future, however, the editorial 
cautions: "But in the second election the ANC should be judged 
according to its performance. While it boasts many men and 
women of outstanding quality, it also harbours some deeply 
irresponsible and dangerous elements." The editorial also notes 
a "compelling case for getting the talents of other parties -- 
including the National Party -- into the new Parliament." The 
editorial calls the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program 
"the most substantial contribution to the policy debate during 
the election campaign." The paper says the plan has "many 
positive aspects," but argues that the ANC will have to be more 
convincing about its "cost implications" and about how 
productivity is to be increased. 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Editorial Urges Vote Against ANC -- "South Africa stands on 
the threshold of one of the biggest, if not the biggest 
development in its existence," begins a page-24 editorial in the 
Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 24 April. "For true 
democratic freedom, the rights of the individual, the right to 
private ownership, the right to freedom of association, the 
right to protect your own language, the right to freedom of 
religion -- every South African should fulfill his basic 
democratic right -- he must vote." "Of course, many are 
hesitant." "Of course mistakes were made during the 
negotiations process. This newspaper has never hesitated to 
point out these faults. It also does not plan to be silenced in 
future." "Two real dangers exist. The first is the refusal to 
vote with the argument, among others, that one should not 
participate in a `godless' dispensation." "The second real 
danger is a party adopting plans which have failed miserably in 
other places -- a party prepared to maneuver its communist 
partner into parliament under its wing." "The real ANC has not 
stood up yet and if it does stand up in future, will it be with 
the face of a Lenin or a Stalin?" "RAPPORT urgently encourages 
its readers to go and vote -- against the ANC, which has still 
not found its true soul and which should not be allowed to apply 
communist principles."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Johannesburg Bomb Blast `Bloody Madness' -- "Madness. Sheer, 
bloody madness" is how Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 
April in its page-6 editorial describes the bomb blast in 
central Johannesburg on 24 April. "Since the explosion was near 
both the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional 
and Pan-Africanist Congress offices, we can safely assume that 
it was intended as an attack on one of them, probably the ANC." 
Ultimately, the explosion was "a futile" deed since "the 
election will go on. Nothing will stop it." 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  `Wild Men' of Right Need To Be Addressed After Election -- 
Referring to the bomb explosions that have shaken the country 
since Sunday, 24 April, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 26 
April in a page-18 editorial says: "We should have expected the 
merciless actions of the wild men of the Right. Now that this 
stage is upon us, let it not drag the country off its momentous 
course." Firstly, the bombers should be tracked down and 
brought to justice. Secondly, they should be made to understand 
that "they achieve nothing." "There is a belief among such 
people that they can blast their way to the future security they 
seek. In reality, they do the reverse." "Reason cannot speak 
to the wild men themselves; but it can speak to their families 
and friends, the confidantes and advisers upon whose tacit 
support the bombers depend." In conclusion, the paper warns "it 
is clear that the concerns of the right wing -- both inside and 
out of the constitution -- have not been met. We have, 
miraculously, come to this election without them. In the early 
aftermath, our leaders must turn with utmost sincerity to 
finding the rightists, too, a place in the sun." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Bomb Blasts; FF Needs To be Addressed After Election -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 April in a page-16 
editorial says the rash of bomb blasts since 24 April should be 
viewed as "a desperate but doomed last ditch flourish 
perpetrated by a dying movement." BUSINESS DAY believes the 
"dissident, non-participating right wing has been reduced to two 
groups. First there is a small coterie of ineffectual CP 
[Conservative Party] politicians, centred on Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
Second is the more dangerous -- though often clownish -- group 
of shadowy mini-armies, numbering perhaps a thousand 
individuals. Given effective police intelligence work, this 
guerrilla threat is far from unmanagable. Compared to the now 
disappearing prospect of civil war in Natal, the bombers are a 
minor problem." South Africa faces a period of "vicious though 
limited terrorism" which may intimidate voters, but the best 
response would be to "go out and vote in the new South Africa. 
The more these brutal elements are isolated, the better." The 
government is also warned "not to treat the Freedom Front 
lightly once the election is over. To do so would invite a 
mushrooming of the dangerous right." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Bomb Blasts Attempt To Cause `Panic' -- We are outraged at 
the senseless killing of innocent people through the use of car 
bombs," declares a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 26 April. "We urge our people to make it their 
business to go out and vote instead of being frightened off by 
these enemies of progress. They are out to cause as much panic 
and fear as they can to disrupt the elections. The opposite 
will in fact become the truth." 
<H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>
  ANC's Mandela `Head and Shoulders' Above Other Parties -- 
"We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and 
the world to know that as from Wednesday [27 April] a truly new 
South Africa will be born," declares a front-page editorial in 
Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 24 April. "While there 
are many men and women of vision who made this day possible, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela undoubtedly stands head and shoulders 
above all who finally took us to this glorious and momentous 
day. We thank God almighty. Let us go to the polls on 
Wednesday and vote for a party we can trust with our lives."

  [Text] Cape Town April 25 SAPA -- The terrorists 
responsible for the spate of bombings over the past two days 
would be ruthlessly hunted down, the deputy minister of law and 
order, Mr Gert Myburgh, told a media conference here on Monday 
[25 April]. The government had taken a number of major steps to 
ensure the public would be able to vote as safely as possible 
over the next three days 
  He said the government condemned the bombings in the 
strongest possible terms. "It must be stated quite 
categorically that, despite these evil acts of terrorism, South 
Africans will vote on April 26, 27 and 28," he said. "I would 
like to assure the public that the government, the SAP [South 
African Police] and other security forces will not fail in their 
duty to safeguard the transition to a democracy in South Africa." 
  The SAP had already offered R1 million [rand] for 
information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. 
  Steps taken to promote voting safety included: 

  -  immediate nationwide cordon and search operations by the 
SA Police and other security forces to reduce the chances of 
further bomb blasts and other atrocities; 
  -  more than 100,000 police would be deployed to ensure the 
safety 
of polling booths and stations throughout South Africa; 
  -  in the largest peace-time call-up yet in South Africa 
thousands 
of SA Defence Force members would be deployed to assist the SAP 
safeguard the election process; and 
  -  implementation of contingency planning to deal with the 
situation. 

    Mr Myburgh said no police force in the world could guarantee 
that acts of terrorism would not take place, "but I would like 
to state quite clearly that the SAP and other security forces 
can and will ensure that the election process as a whole is not 
derailed". 
  "I therefore urge the public to stay calm and to fully 
co-operate with the security forces in their task of ensuring 
that the election process is not derailed." 
  Mr Myburgh said he would like to express his and the 
government's condolences to the family and friends of the 
victims of all the bomb blasts. 
  Answering questions, he said it seemed quite logical that 
there was a pattern in the bombings, but he could not comment at 
this stage on who police thought might be behind it. The police 
had assigned their most competent detectives to the 
investigation. 
  The explosive devices used in the blasts had been home-made, 
but were professional in the sense that they "did detonate". 
There was no indication that any grouping like a third force 
had been involved. 
  On election precautions, he said ballots and voting 
stations, 
at which police would be deployed, would be closely guarded as 
routes to them. Polling stations were to be checked out the day 
before voting and closely guarded right until the last person 
had left at the end of the voting. The same measures as in the 
past were being taken to protect political personalities.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- An average of five 
security force personnel will be deployed at each of about 9,000 
voting stations in this week's elections, Electoral Commissioner 
Zac Yacoob said on Monday [25 April]. He told a press briefing 
at the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] Midrand nerve 
centre 10 to 15 people would be deployed at voting stations in 
some areas, including the Western Transvaal. On average, two 
people would guard each voting station at night. Security force 
members might "not be apparent" at the stations, he said. A 
total of 65,000 security force members would be deployed. 
  South African Defence Force [SADF] Communications Chief 
Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said the response to a Citizen 
Force call-up had not been as good as expected. On the 
reporting dates of April 15 and 22, only about 43 per cent of 
those expected turned up. This meant those who reported would 
have to serve 60 days instead of the planned 30 days. "We are 
thinly stretched," Gen Opperman said. However, about 80 SADF 
companies would be deployed to support police, he added. 
  Mr Yacoob said bomb blasts since Sunday would not prevent 
the 
elections. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said the 
blasts would not prevent the elections being free and fair, 
although they might cause a low turn-out at the polls. The IEC 
would declare the elections substantially free and fair on the 
basis of franchise provisions. 
  These included the percentage of the electorate who voted, 
the percentage of spoiled papers showing an inability of voters 
to understand the procedure and the question of "gross societal 
intimidation". Other factors were the extent of free and fair 
electioneering and "how no-go the no-go areas were". 
  Gen Opperman said the security forces appreciated the 
Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the elections. Mr 
Justice Kriegler said the IFP's decision had minimised 
opportunities for violence.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] says the decision on whether or not 
to keep voting stations open after 7PM on the three voting days 
will be entirely up to the presiding officer overseeing the 
process. 
  An IEC statement said on Tuesday [26 April] issues such as 
the safety of the area after dark would be considered. The 
IEC's major concern was to allow every eligible voter an 
opportunity to cast his or her ballot. "Every effort to achieve 
that will be undertaken and all kinds of measures will be 
employed," the statement said. 
  Additional electoral officials would be brought in to staff 
the voting stations should the need arise, or if the presiding 
officer requested it. Mobile voting stations could also be used. 
  The commission called on voters to exercise "patience, 
understanding and co-operation in this historic process".

  [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Tuesday [26 April] accused the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] of incompetency after ballot papers allegedly 
arrived at many polling booths around Durban and 
Pietermaritzburg without the party's sticker attached. 
  IFP spokesman Ed Tillett labelled it a "deep election 
crisis". "The IEC is in complete disarray. What it boils down 
to is plain incompetency," charged Mr Tillett. 
  He said areas such as Mpumalanga outside Durban, Umbumbulu 
south of the city, Warner Beach, parts of Pietermaritzburg and 
others had experienced this problem. "How can one hope to 
achieve fair election results? In vast areas (IFP supporters) 
cannot vote today." In Ulundi there was a shortage of ballot 
papers, and in many areas people did not have voter cards, said 
Mr Tillett. 
  He added top-level negotiations with the IEC were in 
progress. 
  IEC spokesman Glenn Mcdougall said late changes to the 
ballot 
paper and logistical problems, especially transport, had caused 
delays at some polling booths.

President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Tuesday [26 April] he had 
been in contact with Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler about the crisis in the voting 
process in Natal, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news reported. He said numerous calls had been received 
from IFP voters in many areas complaining about voting 
procedures. 
  Mr Peter Miller of the IFP's electoral office in 
Pietermaritzburg said an IFP member, who had refused to accept a 
ballot paper without the party sticker, had been told to sign it 
at the bottom. 
  Only when he refused to do that, was he given a proper 
ballot 
paper with an IFP sticker.

  [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The delay experienced by 
some special voters in certain parts of KwaZulu/Natal was being 
urgently addressed on Tuesday [26 April] morning, Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Glenn McDougall said. 
  He said because of late changes to the ballot paper and 
logistical problems, especially transport, there had been delays 
at certain polling booths. Some voting material had also 
arrived late from Johannesburg. 
  However, no serious disruptions had been reported in the 
region by 10AM, Mr McDougall added. 
  Voting at two polling stations visited by SAPA in the 
greater 
Durban area on Tuesday morning was late in getting underway. 
  In Amanzimtoti, special voters were served tea and cake 
while 
they waited for over two hours to cast their vote. An IEC 
official at the scene said some voters were "not impressed". 
  The official said a number of people had missed the 
opportunity to vote as some had to board flights abroad, while 
other disappointed voters had gone home. 
  At Durban's City Hall one disabled pensioner said after 
casting her vote: "I'm fed up ... I haven't even had a cup of 
tea." 
  The old lady who had travelled from Umlazi at 5.30AM said 
she 
was happy she had finally had the opportunity to exercise her 
choice in electing the next government.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- The elections must be 
extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel 
residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents 
and to cast their votes, says Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
Thokoza chairman Abraham Mzizi. Speaking at Thokoza hostel on 
Tuesday [26 April] afternoon, Mr Mzizi said thousands of East 
Rand hostel residents still had no identity documents. 
  He would send a fax to Ulundi to notify IFP leader 
Mangosutho 
Buthelezi about the situation, he said. 
  East Rand SA Defence Force Commander Col Chris du Toit had 
already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels 
of government". 
  Hostel inmates, most of whom are IFP supporters, had been 
unable to get to Home Affairs Offices in surrounding white towns 
to get ID, said Mr Mzizi. "They will be abducted or killed (if 
they leave their hostels)." 
  Inkatha's late entry into the election had exacerbated the 
problem. There were more than 1,000 eligible voters without ID 
in Thokoza hostel and more than 2,000 in the Katlehong hostels 
and the outlying Zonkezizwe hostel. "There are also problems in 
Tembisa I have not spoken about." 
  Mr Mzizi called on the Independent Electoral Commission to 
visit the hostels to issue temporary voters cards and if they 
could not come on Tuesday they should do so on Wednesday. 
  "And if necessary the election must be extended. If people 
cannot vote because they have no ID it will not be free and 
fair. It will be grossly unfair," Mr Mzizi said.

  [Excerpt] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] Transvaal Chairman Themba Khoza on Tuesday [26 
April] claimed wide-spread abuse in Soweto, South Africa's 
biggest black township, on the first day of the country's first 
all-race election. Speaking at a press conference in 
Johannesburg, Mr Khoza said IFP stickers had not arrived on time 
at a number of polling stations in Soweto and African National 
Congress agents had marked ballot papers on behalf of some 
voters. 
  Voters at the polling booth at Chiawelo, Soweto, were given 
second ballot papers if they filled their first ones in 
"wrongly", he said. 
  Mr Khoza said voters at Bhukalani primary school in Zondi 
section and at a polling station in Mzimhlope were given 
"aggressive answers" by Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
agents when they complained there were no IFP stickers on their 
ballot papers. Because of this the voters had also been forced 
to expose their political affiliation. "It makes the election 
not private anymore." 
  When IFP agents at Mzimhlope tried to intervene "they were 
chased away by ANC agents", Mr Khoza claimed. 
  IFP stickers also failed to arrive on time at the voting 
station in Dube, and similar problems were experienced at 
Baragwanath Hospital and in Zola section. 
  "And this is only Soweto I've talked about. There are 
absolutely no secrets in this election," said Mr Khoza. He said 
IFP representatives had already complained to the IEC. He would 
consult Ulundi about taking the matter further. 
  Mr Khoza's comments followed complaints by IFP Thokoza 
Chairman Abraham Mzizi, who said the elections had to be 
extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel 
residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents 
and to cast their votes. 
  Speaking at Thokoza hostel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mzizi 
said thousands of East Rand hostel residents still had no IDs. 
He would send a message to IFP leader Mangosutho Buthelezi, he 
said. 
  East Rand defence force commander Col Chris du Toit had 
already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels 
of government", said Mr Mzizi. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program] </F>
  [Text] Voting at various polling stations has not gone as 
smoothly as intended. The latest on the conducting of special 
voting in the Northern Transvaal is that voting materials are 
being delivered to polling stations in drips and drabs. 
District voting officials have complained that voting material, 
such as ballot papers and marking ink, are being delivered at 
random and at the wrong points. 
  Meanwhile, the situation at several polling stations in 
Natal 
is reported to be chaotic. A short while ago officials at 
Newcastle appeared to have no idea where their ballot papers and 
equipment were. And in Durban's Wentworth hospital no votes 
were cast a few hours after the official starting time. The IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] ascribed part of the delay to 
a sit-in in its offices last night by members of a voter 
education organization. The IEC says it will try to iron out all 
of the problems today to ensure a smooth run tomorrow.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth April 26 SAPA -- The elderly and 
disabled trickled to the polls without fanfare in the Eastern 
Cape on Tuesday to cast their votes on the first day of the 
country's first all-race elections. 
  The busiest voting booth was at Louis le Grange Square 
police 
headquarters in Port Elizabeth where over 400 police personnel, 
who qualify for special votes, had voted by 10AM and 100-odd 
prospective voters were standing in line. Elsewhere only small 
queues could be found by mid-morning. 
  Local police liaison officers were however concerned at the 
time taken by voting: five minutes and 20 seconds for one 
person to cast a double ballot. "If it's still like this by 
Thursday voters will be frustrated. If some don't get to vote 
when the polls close I can guarantee you unrest," said Col Louis 
Botha.

  [Text] East London April 25 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress believes the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has 
"really messed things up" in the Eastern Cape, spokesman Mcebisi 
Bata said on Monday. He said the ANC was upset by the "late" 
list of polling stations in the region. "We think they (the 
IEC) are not as organised as people would expect them to be," 
said Mr Bata. 
  IEC East London spokesman Mike Chandler said he did not 
anticipate people having difficulty in finding polling stations: 
"There are 1,797 polling stations in Transkei alone. Divide 
that among the population; they are all very close to polling 
stations." 
  In 90 per cent of villages in the region the polls would be 
the "major event of the century", said Mr Chandler. "You'll be 
able to see polling stations 10km off." 
  The official list of polling stations was first published on 
April 21, as a 24-page supplement to the East London-based daily 
DISPATCH newspaper. 
  A revised list was published as a supplement to the paper's 
Transkei edition on Monday (today). 
  On Monday afternoon, Mr Chandler was compiling a third list 
which he hoped to make available for publication that evening. 
  He said he had no idea where the list published that morning 
had originated, nor if it was up-to-date. Mr Bata said the ANC 
was doing all it could to publicise the location of polling 
stations. It had asked regional radio stations to make the 
locations known and the response had been good. 
  Mr Chandler defended the publication of the final list of 
polling stations only a day before the elections, saying if it 
had been published a month before voters would have forgotten 
where the stations were. "I don't really understand what the 
difficulty is. The area is going to be saturated with polling 
stations." 
  Mr Bata criticised the imbalance in special voting stations, 
saying there were only three at Mdantsane but 38 in East London. 
Mr Chandler said this was due not to the IEC but the legacy of 
apartheid. 
  Special voting stations were for the benefit of hospital and 
clinic patients, old-age home residents and prison inmates. 
That there were so few special stations in Mdantsane indicated 
the relative lack of these institutions in black areas.

  [Text] Cape Town April 26 SAPA -- By mid-morning there had 
been no security problems at any of the voting points for 
special votes in the Western Cape, an Independent Electoral 
Commission spokesman said on Tuesday [26 April]. "The security 
forces have not reported any major problems," he said. An 
administrative hitch in the Mitchell's Plain area -- where 
ballots had not reached the right destinations -- had been 
sorted out, he added. And a claim that the African Christian 
Democratic Party had distributed pamphlets on Tuesday at the 
Buffeljags Prison at Swellendam, in contravention of the ruling 
that all electioneering cease on Monday, was being investigated.

  [Text] It's been reported from Pietersburg, Gazankulu, 
Venda, and Lebowa that voting has been hampered by a lack of 
ballot papers and equipment. Reports say that people have 
traveled far and are waiting to vote. The commissioner of the 
QwaQwa police, Major General Jaap Venter, has made an urgent 
appeal for ordinary voters not to travel to polling stations for 
special votes today. Gen. Venter said that thousands of people 
had arrived at the seven polling stations in the area, thinking 
that they could vote today.

  [Text] Bloemfontein April 26 SAPA -- Voting in prisons 
proceeded smoothly on Tuesday [26 April] as special polling 
stations were set up for as many as 100,000 prisoners, a 
Correctional Services spokesman said. No incidents were 
reported and the atmosphere in prisons was calm, he said. 
  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials set up the 
stations behind bars and guards took eligible prisoners to cast 
their votes. There was no adverse reaction from murderers, 
rapists and other prisoners denied the vote by a last-minute 
cabinet decision on Tuesday, the spokesman said. 
  Prisons Commissioner Gen Henk Bruyn this week barred the 
media from prisons in order to "keep the atmosphere as calm as 
possible". 
  Officials on Tuesday had no clear idea of how many of the 
country's 115,000 prisoners would vote, but estimated the figure 
could come close to 100,000. 
  In the Orange Free State and Northern Cape seven prisons had 
completed voting by noon on Tuesday, a spokesman said.

  [Text] South African citizens resident in the western zone 
of Nigeria were registered today for voting in their country's 
first nonracial elections which begin tomorrow. The 
registration took place in the offices of the United Nations 
Development Program at No. 11, Onikon Abayomi Drive, formerly 
Prince Drive, Ikoyi, Lagos. Yesterday, South African citizens 
resident in the northern and eastern zones of Nigeria registered 
in Kaduna and Enugu for the exercise. The three centers, used 
for registration of eligible voters, will also serve as voting 
stations tomorrow, which is the only voting day in Nigeria. All 
these arrangements are being coordinated by the National 
Committee Against Apartheid, NACAP, in conjunction with 
officials of the South African Independent Electoral Commission 
who are already in the country. The campaign for the elections 
were concluded yesterday. The ANC leader, Dr. Nelson Mandela, 
the Inkatha Freedom Party, and other political leaders addressed 
the electorate on why their parties should be given preference 
during the polls.

  [Text] I address this message to all South Africans. 
  Today is a day like no other before it. Voting in our first 
free and fair election has begun. Today marks the dawn of our 
freedom. 
  As we travelled around every part of the country we saw your 
misery. We shared your hopes and dreams. 
  Now your day has come, because this election is about you. 
It is your election. It is your vote that counts. 
  Years of imprisonment could not stamp out our determination 
to be free. Years of intimidation and violence could not stop 
us. And we will not be stopped now. 
  You hold the future in your hands. 
  And now is the time to rise to the challenge. 
  Standing together, let us send a message loud and clear: We 
will not let a handful of killers steal our democracy. 
  Our surest way to stop them, and to bring peace, is to cast 
our vote. Let us vote in such overwhelming numbers that we show 
everyone how much we love our country, how much we love our 
people, how much we love peace, how much we love life itself. 
  We will show the world that we are determined to stand up 
against the violence, determined to vote for a better life for 
all. Every South African knows: Now is the time. Sekunjalo 
["Now is the time" in Zulu]. Ke nako ["Now is the time" in 
Sotho].

  [Text] Pretoria April 26 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on 
Tuesday encouraged people to vote, saying polling stations were 
perhaps the safest places in South Africa with "tremendous" 
safety measures taken by security forces. He promised a 
clampdown by government on those responsible for the spate of 
bombings linked to the elections. 
  He was speaking at the Karmel old age home in Pretoria where 
he had taken his mother, Mrs Corrie de Klerk, aged 89, to cast 
her special vote. 
  Mr de Klerk told journalists that the government and the new 
government of national unity would act sternly against those 
responsible for the bombings, thought to be a "lunatic fringe on 
the right". 
  He said no conclusions could be reached from voting patterns 
so far, adding that he expected a high average percentage. He 
was glad that technical hitches experienced at some polling 
stations on Tuesday morning had been ironed out.

<F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] released its list of 
candidates yesterday, appearing to give high-profile public 
figures and whites prominence on its national list but 
preserving its top echelon for the regional list in 
KwaZulu/Natal where it expects the strongest support. 
  Inkatha expects at most to win 23 percent of the votes 
nationally, with its list of provincial candidates almost 
equalling that of the combined regional and national component 
for the national assembly. It is fielding 76 candidates to 
contest the 400 seats. Most opinion polls have given Inkatha 
about 13 percent of the votes nationally, although the latest 
Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) report gave it only about 
7 percent, which would result in the top 20 making it into 
Parliament on the national list. President Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
heads the national list followed by former SACP [South African 
Communist Party] member Joe Matthews and hardliner Walter 
Felgate. 
  Positions five, six and eight are held by former NP 
[National 
Party] members Koos van der Merwe, Jurie Mentz and Hennie 
Bekker. Press officer Sue Vos will also make it into Parliament 
at number seven. At number nine is information director Ziba 
Jiyane with Velaphi Ndlovu at 11 and former Independent 
Broadcasting Authority member Harriet Ngubane at number 12. 
Chief negotiator Ben Ngubane heads a strong list of candidates 
on the regional list, the safest route to election. 
  HSRC director Lawrie Schlemmer estimates that Inkatha could 
manage 25 percent support in KwaZulu/Natal, giving about 15 
candidates from that region a good chance. Among these are 
Dennis Madide, Faith Gasa Forouk Cassim, Kisten Rajoo, Peter 
Smith of the information department, Natal Red Cross director 
Inka Mars, Ben Skosana and Philip Powell. 
  For its KwaZulu/Natal Provincial legislature, Inkatha has 
its 
chairman Frank Mdlalose as premier candidate followed by Jeffrey 
Mtetwa and two royal family members Gideon and Vincent Zulu. 
Also high on the list are former DP [Democratic Party] MPs Mike 
Tarr and Peter Miller, with Arthur Konigkramer in ninth and Sue 
Felgate at 15. 
  Maritzburg mayor Patrick Cornell occupies the number 20 slot 
and Lindelane warlord Thomas Shabalala is at number 26. 
  In its second strongest region, the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Inkatha has chosen Transvaal leader 
Themba Khoza to head the list for the national assembly. He is 
likely to get into Parliament. At number nine is Charles 
Loliwe, who called on Inkatha members to march on the ANC 
offices at Shell House recently. Inkatha's choice for PWV 
premier is Musa Myeni with Hennie Bekker's wife, Gerda, 
occupying fourth position before Ruth Felgate. 
  Mungo Soggot reports that Inkatha's 11th hour decision to 
take part in the poll has triggered the frantic printing of 
88-million labels. Jackstadt MD [managing director] Ken Steyn 
said his company, which printed the stickers, had delivered 40 
[metric] tons of label stock to printing company Self-Adhering 
Products. It, in turn, had printed 22-million labels a day 
since last Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>
  [Text] The NP's [National Party] allocation of seats for 
the national assembly will be determined differently from all 
the other parties on the national ballot paper because it is the 
only party to have submitted only regional lists. 
  The Electoral Act stipulates that at least 200 of the 
assembly seats are to be determined from political parties' 
regional lists for the national assembly. Parties are entitled 
to also submit a national list of candidates for up to 200 
seats. This allowed parties such as the ANC to draw up a list 
of 200 candidates from a broad spectrum of people at its head 
office that are not necessarily regionally based. 
  The NP was the only party that opted for the second method 
of 
determining its national assembly seats -- arguing that by 
submitting only regional lists it showed its commitment to a 
federal system. 
  It is estimated that, assuming a 100 percent poll, each 
55,000 votes will be worth one seat in the assembly. This is 
calculated by taking the estimated 22.2-million eligible voters, 
divided by 400 seats. 
  All parties expect the NP will have their seats in the 
assembly determined by, firstly, taking the total number of 
votes cast for their parties respectively divided by, say, 
55,000, to determine the number of seats they will have in the 
national assembly. Half of these seats won will be filled by 
those on their national lists. 
  The rest of their seats will be filled from their respective 
regional lists of candidates for the national assembly. This 
will be determined by taking the respect regional tally of votes 
won by each party and dividing this by 55,000, to give the 
proportion of seats that party can fill in the national assembly 
from that region.

<F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- Eight Conservative Party 
[CP] city councillors from Pretoria have joined the Freedom 
Front [FF], FF spokesman Stephan Maninger said on Monday. This 
was part of the "overwhelming support" the FF and its leader 
General Constand Viljoen were attracting countrywide from CP and 
National Party [NP] members, he said in a statement. 
  Over the weekend two senior CP MPs, Tom Langley and Dries 
Bruwer, defected to the FF. Mr Bruwer is also president of the 
Transvaal Agricultural Union. Last week 11 CP-controlled town 
councils pledged support for Gen Viljoen. 
  In a seperate statement Mr Maninger dismissed as "devoid of 
all truth" rumours that the FF was considering forming a 
coalition with the NP. The policies of the FF and the NP were 
"world's apart" and such a coalition could never happen because 
the NP was already in a de facto alliance with the African 
National Congress, he said. 
  The rumours had originated from the rightwing broadcaster 
Radio Pretoria, Mr Maninger said. Critising the radio station, 
Mr Maninger said Radio Pretoria had in the past broadcast the 
opinions of individuals as facts. He accused the radio station 
of biased reporting, saying that the broadcaster did not "even 
tolerate differing views anymore".

    [Editorial Report] Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 
April runs two different half-page election campaign ads for the 
National Party (NP) on pages 11 and 13. The left third of each 
ad has a photograph of the person quoted in the text of the ad. 
Following the text of each ad is the National Party motto "BE 
SURE OF A BETTER LIFE", followed by "Vote for FW de Klerk and 
the new National Party", the NP logo, and a photograph of De 
Klerk next to a voter's cross. Each ad ends with: "We've made 
the change." 
  The first ad on page 11 has the photograph of Colin Wainer 
with the caption, "'I've never voted before, but now I'm voting 
National Party'." The text reads: 
  "'I'm Colin Wainer, a professional freelance photographer, 
I'm 35 years old and I've never voted before. I always 
considered politics to be for politicians. 
  "Two weeks ago the NP's advertising agency commissioned me 
to 
photograph people endorsing the NP for their ad campaign. For 
me, just another job that I was happy to do. 
  "Since then I've photographed amongst others, a lot of 
ordinary black people who'll be voting NP. We chatted, even 
talked a little politics and their grassroots political savvy 
and their commitment to the NP impressed me. 
  "But it was only when I studied the ads to check my 
photography that the strength of these people's convictions 
about the NP dawned on me. They'd been threatened with injury 
and death, their children were threatened and one teacher checks 
her car for bombs every time she uses it -- all because they 
dared to support the NP in the townships. What humbled me most, 
was that during our work not one had even mentioned danger. 
  "Yet they offered to be seen in the papers by millions, 
including their intimidators. One little old grandmother said 
"Let them kill me. There will always be someone else who stands 
up for the NP. I shall be at the polling station on the 27th 
with a badge with Mr. de Klerk's face on it. So everyone will 
know who I'm voting for." 
  "I felt ashamed by their courage. I realised that I had 
neither bothered to vote, nor had I never bothered to stand up 
for what I believe in. I never realised how important it is. 
  "I phoned the ad agency and said that I wanted to endorse 
the 
NP. Maybe I'll lose a job or two because of it, but compared to 
the risks they're taking, I'd be proud to. I'm dedicating my 
vote to their courage. 
  "And to you cynics out there I'll add: nobody's getting paid 
for these ads. And to all you who take for granted your right 
to vote freely and safely, take note of these people. They've 
worked out exactly why they take these risks.'" 
  The second ad on page 13 has a photograph of Mxolisi Ncapayi 
with the caption "`I was an MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] soldier, now I'm with the National Party.'" The 
text reads: 
  "My name is Mxolisi Ncapayi. I was an MK guerilla fighter 
against the apartheid regime. But now I'm going to vote for the 
National Party -- and so are hundreds of other ex-MK people like 
me. 
  "To put it simply; we have seen the ANC in its true colours, 
and we don't like what it has become. 
  "On the surface it talks of liberation, with the face of Mr. 
Mandela smiling down from every poster. 
  "But underneath, it has become a party which is 
power-hungry, 
a party which is just using the masses of black people for its 
own ends, a party with its own secret agenda which will ruin the 
country the way many other African countries have been destroyed. 
  "And it has become a party which sponsors violence and 
intimidation -- and betrays its own people. 
  "This makes us very angry, because a lot of us fought for it 
-- and were prepared to die for it. 
  "I know. I was one of them. I fought for the ANC from the 
day my friend Sipho was killed by the police when we were 16. 
  "I joined MK and was sent to Zambia for training. Then I 
came back as a guerilla -- to liberate my country. 
  "Eventually I was caught, and I spent four and a half years 
on death row, waiting to be executed for killing a police 
informer. 
  "But now the struggle is over. The world has changed. And I 
have changed too. Our country is liberated. President F.W. de 
Klerk and the National Party have got rid of apartheid and 
apologised for it. The new National Party welcomes all races 
into its ranks. We are about to have our first free elections. 
  "I changed when I was in prison. I discovered that the ANC 
had killed my father because he was receiving food parcels from 
the Church. They made a mistake; they thought the food was 
coming from the government. 
  "They never bothered to check. And afterwards they never 
apologised, or even helped my people. I learned the hard way -- 
as have hundreds of other ex-MK people -- that the ANC does not 
care for its own, or the mass of people. It just wants power. 
  "It still has not changed. It is still the party of 
violence. It still threatens and intimidates people. It still 
attacks those -- like us -- who dare question it. It is still 
living in the past. But there is no point in that. We must look 
to the future. 
  "Only the NP can secure that future. Only the NP really 
wants to stop the violence. Only the NP has a plan which will 
get jobs for people -- and then we will be able to build houses 
and schools. 
  "That is why I -- and all the rest of us ex-MK people -- can 
only vote for the NP.'"

    [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 
24 April on page 39 and Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 
24 April on page 34 carry the identical full page National Party 
advertisement. A picture of State President F. W. de Klerk is at 
the center of the page under the heading "NOW IS THE TIME..." in 
large black letters. The following text is printed over F.W de 
Klerk's signature with the party slogans at the bottom of the 
page: 
  "For the last five years it has been my privilege to serve 
as 
your State President. 
  "As the leader of the National Party, I made a promise to 
guide our nation into a new era of freedom. I have kept that 
promise. I made a promise to end apartheid -- and I have. I 
made a promise to release Nelson Mandela and unban the ANC and 
others -- and I have. I made a promise to hold free elections 
where all the people could vote. I have kept that promise too. 
  "The National Party has kept all its promises. 
  "After the election we will have a government of national 
unity. This means that the political parties will share power. 
It is in the best interests of our country that the National 
Party should lead that government. If you help us to win a 
majority of votes, you will enable me to continue to work for 
our vision of a new, prosperous and peaceful South Africa. 
  "We will have a great deal of hard work to do after the 
elections. We have to improve the living conditions of all our 
people. Because that is the key to peace and prosperity. We 
must build houses for the homeless. We must ensure a high 
standard of education for all our people. We must create job 
opportunities. 
  "To do all this, we must make the economy grow through sound 
economic policies. We must have low levels of taxation, low 
inflation and low interest rates. And we must attract huge 
foreign investment. 
  "Most of all we must restore respect for the rule of law so 
that violence, crime and intimidation can be driven forever from 
our society. We must ensure that all the people can live in 
dignity without fear, oppression or humiliation. 
  "The only safe choice for all people who want peace, harmony 
and a prosperous future is to vote for a strong new National 
Party. 
  "If you give me your help, I promise that we will build a 
great new South Africa. 
  "And as you know -- we keep our promises. 
  "Come, let us join hands and work together for a better 
life." 
  "F W De Klerk 
"Be Sure of a Better Life "Vote for FW de Klerk and the new 
National Party "We've made the change"

    [Editorial Report] Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network 
in English at 1535 GMT on 23 April broadcasts the following 
advertisement: First, a slogan sung by several voices: "Join us 
and build a better future." Then follows a voice reading the 
following: "The great thing about a multiparty democracy is that 
one party cannot just do whatever it likes, because the others 
keep an eye on it. Look, we did have opposition parties in the 
past but, well, maybe they were too weak to do anything, you 
know. This time I'm making sure we get a better life. I'm 
voting with my head, not my heart. I'm voting for the new 
National Party." The advertisement is followed by the voices 
singing: "Be sure of a better life for you." 
  At the beginning and end of the advertisement an announcer 
says: "This political advertisement was paid for by the party."

    [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 
on 23-24 April on pages 7 and 9 carries two half-page election 
advertisements from the Democratic Party [DP]. The 
advertisements are printed on the lower right-hand corners of 
the pages. The page 7 advertisement says in large white letters 
across the top: "In 1989, these were the NP [National Party -- 
Nats] leaders whose government brought you detention without 
trial, crime, corruption and hit squads." 
  Below this are two rows of photographs arranged around the 
date 1989. The photographs, with names printed underneath, are 
those of, top left to right; R. F. Botha, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs; F. W. de Klerk, State President; D. J. de Villiers, 
Minister for Administration and Privatization. Bottom left to 
right: H. J. Coetsee, Minister of Justice; G. S. Bartlett, 
Deputy Minister Economic Affairs and Technology; and R. P. 
Meyer, Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development and 
Planning. 
  Below the photographs, again in large white letters, are the 
words: "Thankfully they're now the new National Party, and if 
you turn the page, you'll meet their new leaders." The print 
and photographs are set against a dark background. 
  The page 9 advertisement carries at the top, in the same 
sequence, the same photographs of the same six people against a 
dark background in the same order, this time arranged around the 
date 1994. The ministers titles are now updated: D.J. de 
Villiers is identified as Minister for Public Enterprises, H.J 
Coetsee as Minister of Justice &amp; of Defence and G.S Bartlett 
as 
Minister of Mineral &amp; Energey Affairs. R.P Meyer is still 
identified as a deputy minister. Immediately below the 
photographs, in large white letters: "WORRYING ISN'T IT?" 
  Below this runs a thick black line across the advertisement, 
with two columns of small printed text, the two columns 
enclosing the DP emblem in blue and yellow. The small-print 
text reads: "Look again. If FW de Klerk's `new' Nats look 
strangely familiar, it's because thirteen of the `new' Nats' top 
candidates were cabinet ministers or deputy ministers in the 
1989 election -- and they've almost all been ministers, 
deputies, or MPs since the 1970's! These are the `new' Nats 
who, in 1989, promised to cut tax rates by five percent. Since 
then, income tax has nearly doubled. These are the `new' Nats 
who, since 1989, have allowed billions of rands of your money to 
be stolen and squandered by corrupt homeland governments. These 
are the `new' Nats who, in 1993, agreed to retain Detention 
Without Trial. Who, in another secret deal, offered the ANC the 
power to appoint its own judges to the land's highest courts. 
(Luckily the DP put a stop to this at negotiations). It's 
clear that FW de Klerk and his `new' Nats are just as 
inefficient and incapable of containing corruption as the `old' 
Nats. So when they promise to provide effective opposition 
after the election, there's good reason to be sceptical. In 
contrast, there's good reason to believe us when we say we'll 
provide effective opposition. After all, we've believed in the 
same principles for 35 years, so we're not about to abandon them 
now, when they're needed most. So vote for the Democratic 
Party. You'll find there's no better party on which to pin your 
hopes." 
  Below the small-print text and DP emblem runs another thick 
black line, and below this, across the bottom of the 
advertisement, in large black print: "Democratic Party. 
Protecting you from the abuse of power."

  [Text] The National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] says 
it has demobilized and submitted more arms to the expanded 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] under UN supervision, more than ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and AFL [Armed 
Forces of Liberia] combined. 
  The NPFL commander in chief, Charles Gankay Taylor, says the 
NPFL is the only faction under the Cotonou Peace Accord that has 
submitted artillery pieces in furtherance of the disarmament 
process. He said there are our detractors who continue to make 
[word indistinct] action of the NPFL, saying even when we do 
good, some say we didn't do good. Mr. Taylor said there is no 
need for Liberians to continue killing each other and cautioned 
those who desire the leadership of this country not to pursue 
the electoral process. The NPFL leader said politicians are 
delaying the peace process because they are afraid to go to 
elections. 
  At the same time, the NPFL has demonstrated confidence in 
the 
ability of Liberian women to play a key role in the 
reconstruction and development of Liberia. The leadership of 
the NPFL in expressing support for greater involvement in 
government and other key sectors in society for Liberian women, 
said the NPFL, through its political wing, will continue to 
ensure that Liberian women who have the potential are sent to 
high offices in the new Liberia. 
  The assurance was given over the weekend by NPFL leader, 
Charles Gankay Taylor, when he appointed Mrs. Dorothy 
Musuleng-Cooper as the first woman minister to the post of 
foreign affairs to the transitional government. The appointment 
of Mrs. Cooper was greeted with an applause of acclamation 
coinciding with formal pronouncement of the decision by the NPFL 
to take its seat on the transitional government.

  [Text] [Announcer de Sloovere] The situation is still 
unclear in the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Last night a small 
group of the Burundian military tried to overthrow the 
government, but their coup reportedly failed. Yet calm has not 
returned completely. Shooting in the northern district of 
Kamenge is still being heard and the Army has given the 
civilians until 1800 [1500 GMT] to hand in their weapons. Here 
is a report by our correspondent Robert Esselinckx: 
  [Begin recording] [Esselinckx] As far as we can gauge, the 
violence remains restricted to Kamenge and Kinama on the 
outskirts of Bujumbura. The Tutsi-dominated Army has tried for 
days to disarm Hutu civilians and much fighting is continuing. 
  [Unidentified person] Every 10 minutes we hear shooting, 
either machine guns or other firearms. The ultimatum to the 
Kamenge inhabitants to hand in their weapons by 1800 on 24 April 
expired and has been extended another 24 hours. 
  [Esselinckx] What about the white people, the Belgians? Are 
they in danger? 
  [Person] No, not at all. 
  [Esselinckx] Apart from that, a small group of the military 
attempted a coup last night, which reportedly failed. Several 
ministers who had gone into hiding have returned and taken up 
their posts again. Everything is normal in many places in 
Bujumbura. Moreover, Sabena will maintain its three scheduled 
flights for this week. 
  In the meantime, 350 Belgian paratroopers are still in 
Nairobi waiting to return to Belgium, unless, off course, the 
Belgian Government decides to have them help in the evacuation 
of our citizens from Burundi. But the Council of Ministers must 
make a decision on that first. 
  Incidentally, one of the two military Boeings 727 had an 
engine breakdown in Nairobi. [end recording] 
  [De Sloovere] We now have our reporter Faroek Ozgunes on the 
line from Bujumbura for the latest developments. Faroek, have 
you noticed anything at all of this failed coup? 
  [Ozgunes] The leadership of the Burundian Army actually is 
putting the events in perspective and is not talking about a 
coup, but rather of a small uprising within the Army. I have 
spoken with the Burundian Army chief of staff, who told me that 
10 soldiers had left their barracks without permission. They 
tried to involve others in their mutiny but without success, and 
they have been arrested. Also, two officers have been arrested 
and are being questioned at this very moment. 
  [De Sloovere] Did you hear any shooting? 
  [Ozgunes] No. To hear shooting one must travel to Kamenge, 
which everyone is being advised against doing. We tried 
yesterday, but were chased away. Kamenge is blocked off and it 
is impossible to gain access. 
  [De Sloovere] Are there any troops or tanks in the streets? 
  [Ozgunes] Light armored personnel carriers are driving on 
the 
streets, not in the center of Bujumbura itself, but more on the 
outskirts and the gendarmerie have erected checkpoints 
everywhere in the city. Anybody who wants to pass is being 
searched thoroughly, and especially for weapons. 
  [De Sloovere] Yet it is clear that just one spark can make 
the violence flare up. 
  [Ozgunes] That is correct. Right now the center of Bujumbura 
is quiet, but there is a lot of movement, especially in the 
adjoining areas. Hundreds of Hutus have fled Kamenge District. 
One of them told me: There is no place for us to go anymore. 
Kamenge is the only remaining Hutu stronghold in Bujumbura. 
According to these refugees, the Army entered Kamenge yesterday 
and started shooting at random. It is unknown how many victims 
there are. The Burundian Army actually is ready to march into 
that neighborhood to disarm the Hutus. 
  [De Sloovere] How about the security of the Belgians? Have 
they been advised to remain inside? 
  [Ozgunes] The Belgians are in no, repeat no, danger. Yet 
they have been advised by the Belgian Embassy to stay off the 
streets after 1800. This is more a precautionary measure: many 
criminals are using the current chaos to rob people on the 
streets. 
  There was an emergency meeting at the Belgian Embassy 
yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation of our citizens, 
but there are no confirmed plans so far to have Belgians leave 
Burundi. 
  [De Sloovere] Thank you, Faroek. We will hear you again in 
our next newscast.

  [Text] ANC leader Nelson Mandela's niece, Mrs. Nomaza 
Paintin, has become the first black person to vote in a South 
African general election. She cast her ballot in Wellington, 
New Zealand, several hours ahead of the people in South Africa, 
as a result of New Zealand's time zone. New Zealand Prime 
Minister Jim Bolger, a friend of Mrs. Paintin, watched her vote. 
People in foreign countries can cast their ballots at about 200 
polling stations in 80 countries. 
  An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] commissioner, Mrs. 
Helen Suzman, said there was unprecedented enthusiasm in foreign 
countries for the election. Another commissioner, Mr. Zack 
Yacoob, said the IEC estimated that between 25 and 30 percent of 
the total percentage poll would comprise special votes. Special 
votes close at 7:00 PM tonight. 
  The election in South Africa itself began a short while ago 
when people began casting special votes. Local special votes 
include patients in hospitals and maternity homes, residents at 
homes for the elderly and infirm, and members of the security 
forces who'll be on duty on the two official voting days. 
  Prisoners who are entitled to vote will also cast special 
votes. Criminals who have been found guilty of serious crimes 
will not be permitted to vote in the election. This applies to 
prisoners convicted of murder, rape, and robbery with 
aggravating circumstances, and who have been sentenced to 
imprisonment without the option of a fine. 
  Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said after a cabinet 
meeting in Cape Town that the government was not prepared to 
depart from the principle contained in the existing Electoral 
Act. He said the negotiating council had been a party to the 
act, and accordingly had been agreed to by all the parties at 
the time. Mr. Schutte pointed out that such a restriction on 
voting rights to prisoners was in accordance with 
internationally accepted norms.

<F P=106> [By Raphael Banda] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Voting got off to a 
slow start on Tuesday [26 April] in South Africa's first 
all-race elections, overshadowed by a spate of bombings aimed at 
scuttling the process but appeared only to harden black voters' 
resolve to usher in a new era of non-racialism. The handicapped, 
ill, infirm, pensioners and pregnant women cast their votes in 
hospitals and other centres on the first of the three-day 
national and provincial elections marking the end of apartheid 
rule. 
  Members of the security forces, South Africans resident 
overeas, and some categories of prisoners also cast special 
votes on Tuesday. 
  South Africa's financial markets improved as the country 
started voting, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's overall 
index gaining 117 points by early afternoon and the Industrial 
Index soaring 155 points. The all gold index rose 45 points. 
  People arrived at polling stations as early as 4AM, but 
voting began with hitches following delays in delivery of ballot 
boxes, papers and other paraphernalia. Voting picked up by 
mid-morning. 
  Voters went to the polls on crutches and in wheelchairs, 
with 
many escorted by children and grandchildren. 
  Black voters' enthusiasm for the historic elections appeared 
undiminished by the bombing spree which killed 21 people and 
wounded more than 150 since sunday. 
  Police said a bomb exploded at a goldmine near Klerksdorp, 
Western Transvaal on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported. 
  "Bombs and intimidation won't stop us. This is the new South 
Africa," said Catherine Makgongwana, 55, who arrived to vote 
outside Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. 
  In spite of the terror campaign, about 6,000 exuberant 
voters 
who did not qualify for special voting streamed to a polling 
station in Klerksdorp's Jourberton township. Police battled to 
convince the voters they could vote only on Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
  In Ciskei several voting stations opened for normal voters a 
day early and were ordered to close by IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission] officials. 
  Among the elderly casting their votes on Tuesday, was 
President F W de Klerk's 89-year-old mother Corrie de Klerk, who 
was escorted to a Pretoria polling station by the president. 
  Mr de Klerk said technical hitches experienced at some 
polling stations earlier had been ironed out. 
  Special voting at most Northern Transvaal stations failed to 
get off the ground when electoral officials did not turn up with 
voting material. Only one polling station opened in Pietersburg 
for a steady flow of voters to cast their ballots. 
  An Independent Electoral Commission situation report after 
noon said two vehicles carrying ballot papers had been burnt in 
Katlehong on the East Rand, but this had not affected voting. 
  The IEC said that by 10AM, a total of 246 incidents had been 
reported countrywide by IEC monitors, 175 of them concerning 
problems with receipt of voting materials. The problems had been 
dealt with. The IEC said its investigators had reported a 
serious and widespread problem in the issuing of temporary 
voting cards. 
  In KwaZulu/Natal, the IEC said voting was delayed because of 
late changes to the ballot paper and logistical problems, 
especially transport. Some voting material had also arrived late 
from Johannesburg. 
  IEC spokesman Glenn McDougall said no serious disruptions 
had 
been reported in the region by 10AM. 
  In Soweto, long queues formed because Inkatha Freedom Party 
stickers had not been stuck to the ballot papers. The IEC had 
been looking into the hitch. 
  Electoral officials also reported two ballot boxes were 
tampered with at Evander, but they said it was not known if 
ballot papers were removed. 
  Faulty or missing voting materials and the non-arrival of 
party officials delayed polling in parts of Bloemfontein's black 
and coloured townships. 
  Some polling stations in the town reported faulty 
ultra-violet lights for the checking of invisible ink on voters' 
hands and were awaiting replacements from Johannesburg, the IEC 
said. 
  Meanwhile, reports that khaki-clad rightwing militants had 
occupied the voting station at Settlers in the Northern 
Transvaal, vowing that nobody in the area would vote, were 
denied by police. The IEC said later the building which had been 
occupied was not one designated by the IEC as a voting station. 
  An IEC office in the Eastern Cape was evacuated following a 
bomb scare. The SA Defence Force and SA Police destroyed a 
suitcase they suspected was a bomb. Only clothes were found in 
the suitcase. 
  Delays in voting irked some voters, who had to wait for at 
least two hours before ballot boxes and papers were ferried to 
stations. 
  "This is Mr de Klerk's strategy. He doesn't want us to 
vote," 
fumed one old man who had been waiting to cast his vote since 
dawn at mdantsane's Cecilia Makiwane Hospital. The voting 
equipment arrived at 9.30AM. 
  "It's something which is very irregular. Our people are 
getting confused. Some have decided to go home," said a business 
leader in Mdantsane. 
  By mid-morning, voting picked up. 
  In the Eastern Transvaal, for example, voting was reported 
to 
be going smoothly and patients at most hospitals in the area had 
already voted by early afternoon. 
  Despite the technical hitches and slow start, hundreds of 
voters were reported to be arriving at polling stations across 
the country, enthusiastic to cast their special votes and help 
determine the future. 
  Handicapped Miss Nokuzola Gxarisa arrived at Cecilia 
Makiwane 
Hospital at 5.30AM and told a SAPA reporter she did not mind 
waiting for the ballot boxes and papers. I think it's worth it. 
I want to vote. I think there's going to be a change in 
everything," she said. 
  "It feels very nice to be voting for the first time," said 
Mrs Martha Molosewoe, 65, a pensioner wrapped in a heavy blanket 
against the early morning chill as she waited for polling to 
start in a township in Bloemfontein. 
  "It's a special day," said a 76-year-old who was proud to be 
older than her candidate of choice. "I want a new life and a new 
future." 
  One-legged Abel Lephoo has just turned 60 and had a simple 
sentiment about his historic first vote. "It feels good," he 
said, limping to join the queue he would probably have to endure 
for much of the day. 
  South Africans living overseas also voted on Tuesday with 
the 
niece of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela the 
first to cast her vote in New Zealand. 
  The IEC said voting stations in eastern Australia had 
closed, 
with just under 5,000 people having cast their ballots. Detailed 
breakdowns would be released later. 
  Prisoners convicted of lesser crimes as stipulated in the 
Electoral Act, also voted. Voting at Robben Island Prison was 
delayed when the boat carrying electoral officials broke down 
after leaving Cape Town harbour. Officials were processing about 
80 prisoners an hour, the IEC said. 
  About 2,500 prisoners ready to vote since dawn at Leeuwkop 
prison, north of Johannesburg, were told voting would begin 
after 2PM when electoral officers would arrive.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Delays experienced at 
voting stations on Tuesday [26 April] -- the first day of South 
Africa's all race elections -- were teething problems which had 
been sorted out, a top Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
spokesman said. 
  IEC electoral administration training head Kumi Naidoo told 
a 
news briefing most delays had happened in the Pretoria 
Witwatersrand Vereeniging region where ballot papers and other 
election materials were scheduled to be delivered last. 
  IEC monitors had reported 246 incidents of disruption at 
voting stations countrywide by late morning Tuesday. About 175 
cases related to difficulties in distributing election material, 
reporters were told. 
  Mr Naidoo said problems had been resolved "at this stage" 
and, if not, he expected them to be resolved within a short time. 
  Voting at Robben Island -- prison "home" to many of the 
candidates standing in this week's election -- was delayed when 
the ferry broke down. 
  But the IEC and correctional services officials were 
grateful 
for the general smooth running of voting at prisons around the 
country, Mr Naidoo added. 
  Problems at Ulundi -- power base of Inkatha leader 
Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi -- and other parts of KwaZulu/Natal had also been 
sorted out, Mr Naidoo told the lunch hour news briefing. 
  Mr Naidoo confirmed two trucks ferrying ballot papers to 
polling stations in Thokoza and Katlehong on the East Rand had 
been attacked and burned on Tuesday. 
  The IEC was making arrangements to stock up the stations 
with 
ballot papers for Wednesday. He could not confirm the hijacking 
of another truck with ballot papers in Pretoria. 
  Referring to the failure of monitors to show up at voting 
stations, Mr Naidoo said this had happened mostly in 
KwaZulu/Natal. Planning of voting stations in this region had 
been undertaken at the last moment and this explained the 
delays. Voting had started in Ulundi, he added. 
  It was up to election officials at voting stations to decide 
if they would keep the polling stations open after 7PM, the 
scheduled closing time. 
  Presiding officers would consider security at each station. 
  Many voters -- not eligible to vote on Tuesday because they 
were not infirm, disabled or members of the security forces -- 
had arrived and this had contributed to the delays. "Problems 
must be seen in the context of these elections. The IEC's major 
concern is to allow every eligible voter to cast a ballot," Mr 
Naidoo said. 
  He appealed for voter patience.

  [Text] THE PIONEER expresses displeasure about the recent 
mock operation involving American and Ghanaian military 
personnel code- named MEDFLAG '94. In the operation, four 
hijackers took over a Ghana Airways plane carrying about 80 
passengers and a crew of four at the Accra Airport. The 
hijackers made certain demands, including the stepping down of 
the government. THE PIONEER says the operation was 
ill-conceived and ill-motivated because apart from causing fear 
and panic, it amounted to putting bad ideas in the minds of 
certain sections of the society.

  [Text] The leader of the largest warring faction in 
Liberia, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has sounded a warning of 
alert to the people of Liberia. Addressing a cross-section of 
journalists recently in Gbarnga, Mr. Taylor said to avoid chaos 
and anarchy in the country warring factions to the conflict 
should do away with malice that may jeopardize the ongoing peace 
process. 
  Mr. Taylor dismissed the negative notion that the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] is planning to launch an 
all-out attack on the people of Monrovia saying such 
pronouncement is only intended to endanger state security. The 
NPFL leader urged politicians to help to buttress the rebuilding 
of the country. At the same time, Mr. Taylor has stressed that 
no amount of military victory can bring political power but only 
people's power and aspiration.

  [Text] In an effort to maintain peace throughout the length 
and breadth of Liberia, the West African peacekeeping force, 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group], has declared from Po River to Clay Junction 
safe for civilians. The peacekeeping force's 15th Brigade 
commander, Brigadier General Ajibola Kunle Togun, who gave the 
assurance, said the area is now safe and marketers and civilians 
can now begin plying the road. 
  The general gave the assurance yesterday when he led a team 
of journalists on a tour of the area mainly to dispel rumors 
that the Po River Bridge had come under fire during fighting 
between two splinter groups of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia]. According to Gen. Togun, there was 
no fighting in the Po River area and that ECOMOG is in full 
control. He said that ECOMOG has taken charge of all roadblocks 
previously manned by ULIMO in that area. ECOMOG had also 
ordered all ULIMO fighters to stay off the road between Clay 
Junction and Po River and not to harass any citizens. The 
fighters are said to be cooperating. The president was taken to 
Klo Town, near Klo Junction, where the ULIMO splinter group 
consisting mainly of Krahn fighters, is stationed.

  [Text] Reports from Bomi County say Roosevelt Johnson's 
faction of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] has captured Clay near Tubmanburg. The reports quoting 
a spokesman of the Johnson faction said the Krahns group came 
under serious offensive by the Koromah faction. 
  The reports say fighting is continuing in Tubmanburg and the 
Krahn faction has vowed to capture the city. According to the 
reports, the Johnson Krahn faction said it would only turn 
western Liberia over to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
Africa Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] if Mandingos are completely 
out of the area. Recently, the Mandingo faction told the media 
that it has some Krahn elements working on their farms as slaves.

  [Text] The two remaining NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] cabinet nominees, Information Minister-Designate Joe 
Mulbah and Agriculture Minister-Designate Roland Massaquoi, were 
yesterday confirmed by the Transitional Legislative Assembly, 
TLA, after going through the confirmation hearing. 
  In a testimony before the Assembly, Information 
Minister-Delegate Joe Mulbah pledged to maintain press freedom 
and ensure that the state media facilities are made available to 
all candidates during the forthcoming general elections. Mr. 
Mulbah further pledged to improve various state media 
institutions, including the LIBERIAN NEWS AGENCY, LINA, the 
Ministry of Information, as well as reallocate radio and 
television services on to Liberia Broadcasting System. Mr. 
Mulbah also spoke about plans to launch a new government-owned 
newspaper called THE TRANSITION to help improve the 
dissemination of information to the public. 
  For his part, Agriculture Minister-Delegate Roland Massaquoi 
promised to persuade the international community to help 
reactivate the agricultural sector, which is the backbone of the 
Liberian economy. 
  With this confirmation of the two ministers, all the parties 
to the Cotonou Accord are now represented in the LNTG [Liberia 
National Transitional Government]. At the same time, TLA 
members from the defunct NPFL have taken their seats in the 
assembly nearly two months following their induction. At the 
Capitol yesterday, they were formerly welcomed by TLA speaker 
Mr. Morris Dukuly who said their acceptance to be seated signals 
the beginning of the end of the country's quest to be reunited.

  [Text] Two NPFL-[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
nominated officials, Information Minister Joe Mulbah and 
Agriculture Minister Dr. Roland Massaquoi, have appeared before 
the Transitional Legislative Assembly [TLA] at the Capitol 
Building in Monrovia for confirmation hearing. 
  The appearance of the two ministers is in line with the 
position of the leadership of the NPFL to have all of its 
nominated officials formally seated on the LNTG [Liberian 
National Transitional Government]. Outlining the program of his 
ministry, the information boss spoke of plans to strengthen the 
government media system, particularly LIBERIA NEWS AGENCY. 
Minister Mulba spoke of plans to reactivate the radio and 
television facilities of the government-owned Liberia 
Broadcasting System. He said all public media institutions will 
be made available to the public, political parties, and interest 
groups during the transitional period, and repeated his 
commitment to uphold press freedom. The information boss said 
he would be launching a government-sponsored newspaper called 
the TRANSITION. 
  On his part, Agriculture Minister Dr. Roland Massaquoi said 
he would seek international support to upgrade Liberia's 
agricultural sector. Dr. Massaquoi described agriculture as the 
lifeblood of the Liberian economy. 
  Meanwhile, it is still not clear why the NPFL newly 
nominated 
minister of foreign affairs, Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper, has not 
been confirmed by the TLA in Monrovia. Mrs. Cooper was 
appointed by the leadership of the NPFL over the weekend to 
replace Counselor Momolu Sirleaf, after reservations by some 
Monrovia politicians of Counselor Sirleaf holding the post. 
  At the same time, NPFL members of the Transitional 
Legislative Assembly have taken their seats at the Capitol 
Building. The assembly members were welcomed by TLA Speaker 
Morris Dukuly, who said their participation in the LNTG signals 
the beginning of the end of the country's civil conflict.

  [Text] Bamako, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting between two of the 
main Malian Tuareg movements resumed about 10 days ago in the 
northern Malian region of Gao, it was learned today from 
authorized Malian sources in Bamako, two days after the failure 
of a meeting on the integration of former Tuareg fighters into 
the regular Army. No casualty figures for these clashes, which 
were confirmed by the progovernment newspaper L'ESSOR, were 
available. 
  The fighting is between elements of the Popular Movement of 
the Azaouad [MPA] and the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation 
of Azaouad, both signatories to the 11 April 1992 national peace 
pact between the Mali Government and the Tuareg movements, the 
same sources added. An initial clash between these two factions 
on 25 February cost the life of Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the 
artisans of Tuareg integration into the Army and an MPA leader. 
A meeting between the Malian Government and Tuareg 
representatives held in Tamanrasset, Algeria, from 16 to 20 
April, failed over the issue of integrating former fighters into 
the Army.

  [Text] Nigeria is once again in the grip of acute petrol 
shortage. The National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] has tried 
to reassure motorists that things will improve, but all the 
refineries are out of action. Those who do manage to fill their 
cars are paying a high price as the government says it doesn't 
have enough money for imports. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] From Lagos to Maiduguri in the 
extreme northeast, and from the southeastern coastal city of 
Calabar to Sokoto in the northwest, the major preoccupation of 
motorists in the past 10 days has been search for fuel for their 
vehicles. The perennial traffic jam in Lagos has disappeared 
because only a fraction of vehicles are now plying the roads. 
Most are either parked at the garage or on vigil at filling 
stations, expecting fuel. 
  I left home at five o'clock this morning in the hope that I 
would be one of the first to arrive at a station on Lagos Island 
which got its supply yesterday evening. I could not even get 
near the station in my car. All the approach roads were jammed 
with motorists who either slept there overnight or got there as 
early as four o'clock. There is chaos everywhere a filling 
station is located. Station attendants are making brisk but 
illegal business, selling into plastic containers at up to five 
times the official price to taxi and bus operators or to private 
motorists who cannot afford to ground their vehicles or spend up 
to 18 hours on queues. 
  Lagos is even better off compared to most other towns. In 
Abeokuta, there was no drop of petrol at any filling station 
yesterday. In Ilorin and Ibadan, only a handful of stations had 
anything to sell. This has led to frayed (?nights) among 
motorists at the stations and street fights break out now and 
then. In Ilorin, northern Nigeria at the weekend, soldiers and 
policemen fought openly in the streets following a scuffle 
between two servicemen at the a filling station. 
  Military administrators of the 30 states have been visiting 
the NNPC depots and filling stations ostensibly to find out the 
cause of the shortage and to ensure that there is not hoarding, 
but the effort has so far been fruitless because the four 
refineries in the country are hardly producing as a result of 
breakdown of machinery. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, April 26 (AFP) -- Nigeria will import 103,000 
metric tons of petrol this week in a special operation aimed at 
combatting the nation's worst fuel shortage in recent years, an 
official statement said Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Out of this total, 63,000 metric tons will serve Lagos, some 
states located in south-western part of the country, central and 
north-western part of the country, the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation said in an official statement, a copy of 
which was delivered Tuesday to AFP. 
  The remaining 40,000 tons would be destined for the eastern 
part of the country, where there is "a lean stock", said the 
text, signed by the official spokesman of the NNPC, Edem Duke. 
  More imports have also been ordered for next month to 
augment 
supplies to the southwestern part of the country, where Lagos, 
the nation's economic capital, accounts for more than 60 percent 
of vehicles in the country. 
  In addition to the imports, a substantial quantity from the 
two refineries in Port Harcourt will be used to service the 
eastern part. 
  The old Port Harcourt refinery with a capacity of about 
150,000 barrels per day, which has been down for about four 
years due to fire that damaged some parts of it, is now 
operating at 64 percent capacity, while the new one, located 
alongside the other, is now functioning at full capacity, said 
the same statement.

  [Text] Most of the national dailies report that the 
Nigerian Government gave the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation, NNPC, seven days to restore normal supply of 
petroleum products in the country. The order, according to the 
papers, came as the nation continues to witness fuel crisis 
which is almost grinding the economy to a halt. The papers say 
that the directive, which was issued by the office of the chief 
of general staff, warned that drastic measures would be taken by 
the government to deal with the situation if the NNPC fails to 
do so. The story attracted different headlines: NNPC Gets 
Ultimatum, DAILY CHAMPION; NNPC On The Fire Over Fuel Supply, 
DAILY TIMES; NNPC Gets Government Ultimatum To Ease Fuel Crisis,

  [Excerpt] Lagos, 26 Apr (AFP) -- A former Nigerian head of 
state gave Cameroon a disputed border area as a reward for its 
"neutrality" in Nigeria's civil war, but subsequent governments 
repudiated the agreement, according to Nigeria's foreign 
minister. Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe told this week's edition of 
THE NEWS magazine that a deal was done between General Gowon and 
Cameroon leader Ahmadou Ahidjo. 
  This was the first time a senior Nigerian official 
acknowledged the deal since the dispute over Bakassi Peninsula, 
a 1,000 square kilometre territory in the Gulf of Guinea, flared 
again at the beginning of this year. Gowon has until now denied 
signing an accord ceding the territory. 
  The treaty, however, was not ratified by the Supreme 
Military 
Council, the highest decision-making organ during the Gowon 
regime, before he was toppled in July 1975 in a coup, the 
minister said. The military governments of Generals Murtala 
Mohamed and Olusegun Obasanjo that succeeded his regime 
immediately repudiated the agreement, he added. Consequently, 
"that is a dead treaty" and "all the superficial arguments which 
Cameroon has been dangling (over the issue) do not help," he 
added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lagos, April 26 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the 
self-proclaimed winner of June's annuled presidential election, 
"endorsed and actively canvassed" for last year's military 
intervention in Nigeria, his deputy at that election charged 
Tuesday [26 April]. 
  In a letter to the US Congress dated March 21 and published 
for the first time by the Nigerian press Tuesday, Alhaji Baba 
Gana Kingibe said that following the annulment of the vote and 
the subsequent political crisis, the "widest possible spectrum 
of Nigerians" called for direct military intervention. 
  Supporters of a military takeover included Abiola and 
himself, said Kingibe, who is now foreign minister. 
  The letter was published after Abiola reportedly called on 
Washington to tighten sanctions against Nigeria following the 
Army's intervention, which led to the abolition of both the 
country's political parties and parliament. 
  "Chief Abiola and myself were among those who endorsed and 
actively canvassed for this military intervention," Kingibe 
wrote. 
  "We discussed the national crisis with various military 
caucuses, including (current head of state) General Sani Abacha." 
  Abiola and Kingibe contested the election on the ticket of 
the Social Democratic Party. 
  Four days after Abacha came to power last autumn, Abiola 
authorised his political aides to participate in the new 
government, Kingibe claimed. 
  But Abiola, who has openly campaigned for recognition of his 
claimed victory at the polls -- whose annulment was slammed by 
the international community -- has denied ever supporting 
military intervention or submitting a list of his political 
nominees to Abacha.

  [Text] Not only do Foday Sankoh's RUF [Revolutionary 
United Front] rebels in Sierra Leone seem to be resisting the 
Army's attempt to wipe them out, they also appear to be capable 
of launching devastating attacks of their own. The latest, by a 
band of well-armed rebels, was in Pujuhun District, where 100 
rebels entered a town, causing death and destruction. From Bo, 
southern Sierra Leone, Al Hassan Sillah reports: 
  [Begin Sillah recording] The commanding officer of the 
paramilitary SSD [Special Security Detachment] Force stationed 
in the town of (Bandajuma Sowa) in the Pujahun District 
confirmed in Bo this morning that rebels of Foday Sankoh's 
Revolutionary United Front attacked the town on Monday [25 
April], causing severe destruction and death. Speaking to me at 
the headquarters of the SSD Unit in Bo, Inspector Aliu Fofana 
said the rebels, something over 100, entered the town early on 
Monday, using a by-pass that brought them onto the main 
(Koribo)-Pujahun road. Inspector Fofana said that the rebels 
reached Bandajuma and then launched an assault on the town with 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and AK-47 assault rifles, and 
were engaged for some four hours by small group of paramilitary 
troops who were on the ground at the time. 
  According to the inspector, when it became obvious that his 
men were being outmaneuvered both in numbers and firepower by 
the rebels, they had to pull out. But this, he said, was not 
before they had ensured that a great majority of the town's 
civilian population had moved to safety. 
  With the town now at their mercy, the rebels set fire to 
over 
half of the houses in the entire township and abducted an 
unspecified number of young men and women. Fourteen civilians, 
according to the inspector, were killed at the outset of the 
attack, while several people with gunshot wounds were evacuated 
to the government hospital here in Bo. The inspector told me 
that, although his headquarters was razed to the ground by the 
marauders, he lost none of the men and managed to evacuate all 
his armory. 
  (Bandajuma Sowa) had remained one of the two safe havens for 
the troubled people of Pujahun District, who arguably has been 
hardest hit by the rebel war. Sequel to the Monday attack, some 
7,000 people whose areas had been attacked and destroyed by 
Foday Sankoh's rebels, have been managing what remained of their 
lives in this town. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Transitional Prime Minister Kokou 
Koffigoh has left. The first prime minister of the Fourth 
Republic, Kouadjovi Edem Kodjo, has taken over. The 
inauguration ceremony, held late yesterday afternoon at the 
Palais de l'Entente, did not have much pomp -- but it was a very 
important ceremony. Edem Kodjo received military honors and 
inspected the social and professional organizations. The two 
officials then held a brief, private meeting. They delivered 
speeches later. Most of the ideas which they talked about, such 
as reconciliation, dialogue, unity, peace, rule of law, and 
economic recovery, which were included in Mr. Koffigoh's speech, 
were also found in Mr. Edem Kodjo's speech. The only difference 
is that the new prime minister (?added) the issue of 
repatriating refugees. Listening to the outgoing prime 
minister's speech, one did not have the impression that he was 
someone who had been crushed by the transition, but was instead 
someone taking great satisfaction in having accomplished his 
mission, in spite of an uneasy climate. 
  [Begin Koffigoh recording] Mr. Prime Minister, before 
extending my congratulations, I would like to express the 
happiness I felt at hearing your first statement when you were 
appointed prime minister by the head of state. You listed the 
priorities of your future policy, which included reconciliation, 
the consolidation of social peace, and economic recovery. These 
also formed the basis of my actions during the transitional 
period. I would now like to congratulate you on the confidence 
the head of state has placed in you by appointing you his first 
prime minister to the Fourth Republic. Your Excellency, Mr. 
Prime Minister, your appointment and the inauguration into your 
new duties mark the end of our long transition toward a new 
society. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The new prime minister said he was filled with 
emotion in the face of the heavy task that lay ahead of him. 
Here is what he said: 
  [Begin Kodjo recording] Your Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister, 
I would first like to thank you for the warm reception you have 
given me during this inauguration ceremony. I would also like 
to say that on this occasion my first thoughts go to all those 
in the country who lost their lives in order that we might 
obtain democracy. I would sincerely like to thank the Togolese 
people, who have suffered so much in order that the rule of law 
might prevail in our country and human rights might be 
respected. This ceremony is very moving, and I would like to 
express my emotion in the face of the heavy task which lies 
ahead of me. We will be able to accomplish this task only if we 
have a firm and legitimate footing within the parliamentary 
majority of which we are members, and only if we take the 
trouble to open up to the active forces of the nation. In this 
way we will be able to build our country together in harmony, 
understanding, and peace. This country needs to be turned into 
a place where rule of law prevails. We will work toward that, 
step by step. 
  Democracy is not something one confers on oneself, one has 
to 
constantly worked at it. It involves constant effort, but I 
think the Togolese people are committed to making this effort. 
This effort must be continued so that, gradually, the 
establishment of the necessary mechanisms and institutions for a 
genuine state where the rule of law prevails will become 
reality. We have, in conjunction with our friends in the 
parliamentary majority, and with the same concern for openness 
which must be at the basis of all our actions in this delicate 
stage of the life our nation, emphasized a certain number of 
issues which are fundamental if we want our country to move once 
and for all out of the era of disturbances and into an era of 
stability. Of course, we should ensure that the Togolese get 
along with one another, that refugees are able to hope to return 
to their country some day. We should ensure that all those who 
are separated are reunited. This is a very important (?program). 
  The security forces, the police, and our Army must feel 
constantly and totally integrated into this democratization 
process, which is intended for them as well. Our concern is to 
do everything possible so that our country is able recover its 
position within the international community as one of the 
leading African countries. In order to do that, we need to 
normalize our relations rapidly with the financial institutions 
and begin working rigorously toward reconstructing the economy. 
Social peace and security are also moral imperatives. In any 
case, they are essential aspects of a program that parliamentary 
majority parties have been formulating in order that, together, 
we might be able to bring this interesting task to a successful 
end. Our young people, our professionals, our women's 
associations, and the silent forces of farmers are our national 
assets. We must give new hope to all these people, and to all 
these national sectors, so that investors can find a stable and 
secure situation which enables them to move forward and 
contribute to building a solid national economy. 
  I would like to add that we are determined to ensure that 
there is permanent dialogue among all the active forces of the 
nation, a daily dialogue between unions, workers, and 
representative associations. We need to find solutions through 
dialogue to the problem of employment, to the workers' salary 
problem, to the problems of our young people, to the problem of 
finding a public harmony -- which is necessary and unavoidable 
-- and to the problem of our (?uncertain) economy. Mr. Prime 
Minister, I said I would be brief and I will keep my word. I 
would like to end my speech by reiterating that all the Togolese 
people must assist us, so that if shadows exist the shadows are 
dispelled, and if there are clouds then they are dispelled, so 
that in this situation of strengthened unity, especially within 
our parliamentary majority, we can make of this country the 
modern state which it should be. Thank you very much for this 
ceremony. I will always remember this moving ceremony, since 
you said that you will always be at our disposal to give us any 
information we need -- be convinced that we have taken note of 
that. I would like to thank all your aides who are familiar to 
us, and all those who have attended this ceremony. Thank you.

  [Text] In Lusaka, the government and National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] teams are looking for an 
agreement concerning the specific principles that will govern 
the second round of presidential elections. The negotiating 
teams are slowly coming to an understanding, but there are no 
indications that a general and definitive accord might be 
written within the next few days. Alves Antonio, our 
correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] The government and UNITA teams to 
the Lusaka peace talks continue to discuss the conclusion of the 
presidential elections. Of the eight points in the section on 
the specific principles governing the conclusion of the 
presidential elections, six have already been dealt with. Two 
remain and they are giving enough trouble. The negotiating 
teams met on their own the whole day today. They have reached 
no understanding yet, even though sources close to the talks say 
consensus is around the corner. To that end, the advice of UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the mediator at the 
talks, has been asked. What is the source of disagreement, after 
all? 
  Well, UNITA is insisting on Electoral Law amendments it 
deems 
necessary, but the government has its own formula and has 
reservations about such amendments. The final source of 
disagreement has to do with the role of the media during the 
presidential elections, notably the role of national mass media 
whose work is not linked to the specific work of the National 
Electoral Council. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The government and National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] are staying put on the question 
of whether the Electoral Law should be revised. There are still 
differences about this issue. UNITA wants the government 
negotiators to make an undertaking that once a peace accord is 
signed in Lusaka, the Electoral Law can be reviewed. UNITA does 
not want a gentleman's agreement, but one in black and white. 
  The government negotiating team is facing a difficult 
situation because in order to make such an undertaking it has to 
have the green light from the National Assembly. 
  This morning, the government and UNITA delegations met 
without the mediator. In the afternoon, the negotiating teams 
called Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola 
to join them. Sources close to the mediator said this afternoon 
that Beye today presented the government and UNITA delegations 
with a document that contains points advantageous to the two 
sides. The document deals with the Electoral Law.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing in the 
Zambian capital. The two sides met face to face yesterday 
morning, in the presence of the mediators, to discuss the 
conclusion of the electoral process. It was agreed at that 
meeting that the two sides would enjoy an equitable distribution 
and control of state finance during the electoral campaign. 
  Meanwhile, the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] continues to believe that the existing Electoral 
Law must undergo some changes so that the grave errors of 
September 1992 do not occur again. The media will not have the 
right to broadcast election results before the National 
Electoral Council has done so. 
  Nevertheless, the Luanda team to the Lusaka talks continues 
to defend its position that everything must stay as it was in 
1992. In view of that, no one knows whether the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] 
intends to perpetrate electoral fraud yet again against the 
people of Angola. 
  The mediators headed by UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye have been tireless. Blondin Beye has already 
delivered yet another general document to the two sides in a bid 
to narrow differences between UNITA and the MPLA-PT in those 
areas. 
  The two sides are expected to have met again yesterday to 
start analyzing the new proposal advanced by the mediators.

  [Text] The calm that had prevailed in Cuito in the past 72 
hours, was this morning disrupted by small weapons fire and 
mortar explosions. It all happened at about 0900 [0800 GMT] 
when UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
rebels began firing light weapons and launching shells at 
government forces deployed in the southern part of the city. It 
lasted for about 15 minutes, and sources say two people were 
killed and five others wounded. There was agitation among the 
residents, and the streets were deserted for about an hour. As 
is usually the case, the men in the service of Savimbi fire 
shells at the defenseless residents because they are unable to 
face government forces.

  [Text] The military situation in Cabinda is controlled by 
the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] despite operations by the Front 
for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in 
that province. Colonel Paiva, spokesman for the Cabinda Military 
Front Command, says that FLEC concentrates its actions in 
settlements to blame the FAA in the event of civilian victims. 
  By 2100 [2000 GMT] on 23 April, elements of the so-called 
Renewed FLEC tried to destroy the microwave communication system 
belonging to Angola Telecom enterprise. Using 60-mm mortars and 
AKM and PKM automatic weapons, the so-called Renewed FLEC men 
infiltrated the (Trezo) area in the outlaying area of the city 
of Cabinda, attacking FAA positions. They then intended to 
destroy the communication system, isolating Cabinda from the 
rest of the country. The prompt response of the FAA detachment 
thwarted FLEC's intentions and in their flight they left the 
organization's pamphlets. The Cabinda Military Front Command 
spokesman says FAA are ready to respond to and thwart this kind 
of operations. 
  [Begin Paiva recording] As well as the attack the Renewed 
FLEC carried out against the antennas on 25 April, which was 
thwarted, the FLEC recently carried another attack in the (Tando 
Zinze) area. On this occasion they ambushed an isolated vehicle 
belonging to FAA. Our forces reacted promptly, causing 
unspecified losses to the enemy. There is no other event worth 
mentioning. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Aldo Ajello, special Unomoz </F>
representative, in Maputo on 22 April] 
  [Excerpts] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello said in 
Maputo yesterday that the training of 15,000 soldiers out of the 
30,000 who will be part of the future FADM [Mozambique Defense 
Armed Forces] is facing logistical problems. In his usual 
Friday's conference with the press, the Unomoz [UN Operations in 
Mozambique] chief said that this situation is due to shortages 
of accommodation for the 15,000 personnel who do not have 
training programs. 
  Until now, the training program has been established for 15 
infantry battalions in a total of 12,000 soldiers besides the 
navy personnel, special forces, the logistical unit, as well as 
officers and generals who are attending leadership training 
courses. 
  The concern is to find installations to accommodate the 
remaining 15,000 troops of the future army in the anti-aircraft, 
engineering, communications, and air force artillery departments. 
  The Unomoz chief asked, "where are we going to place these 
men?", and said he is "concerned" about the slowness with which 
the government is confining its soldiers, and Renamo's 
[Mozambique National Resistance] slow demobilization of its 
guerrillas. 
  He said, "Concerning the infantry battalions, we will begin 
their first training cycle with 5,000 soldiers, but there are 
army camps in the country which need to be extensively 
renovated". [passage omitted] 
  Aldo Ajello revealed that Lieutenant General Tobias Dhai, 
the 
government's representative in the CCFADM [Joint Commission for 
the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], has 
undertaken to hand over the first list of army camps available 
for the training of the future single army troops. 
  He also said that the two main parties of the Mozambican 
peace process have undertaken to deliver a list of Mozambican 
instructors who will be responsible for the training of the 
personnel. The possibility of involving Mozambican instructors 
in the training of the FADM had already been mentioned by Labor 
Minister Teodato Hunguana, who is the government's second in 
command in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission]. On the 
occasion, Hunguana was reacting to a proposal forwarded by 
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama to President of the Republic 
Joaquim Chissano, on the possibility of Zimbabwean instructors 
coming to train the Mozambican single army. 
  The new proposals come as a result of the significant delays 
in beginning with the training of the infantry battalions, which 
is now scheduled for 25 April, with an official ceremony planned 
for 27 April. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Renamo Accuses Neighboring Countries </F>
of Trying to Manipulate Elections"] 
  [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] says it 
has sent protest notes to some of Mozambique's neighboring 
countries formally accusing them of preparing to manipulate the 
legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 27 and 28 
October of this year. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has alleged 
that there is a secret accord between the Mozambican Government 
and neighboring countries concerning the participation of 
foreign nationals in the elections. 
  Efforts to convince the Renamo leader, who made the 
accusation, to identify those countries have been in vain. He 
simply said those letters had been sent two weeks ago. 
  Dhlakama told NOTICIAS that Renamo "had concluded that there 
was already a secret accord between the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo] and the neighboring countries, whereby those 
countries would send their citizens to vote for the Frelimo 
Party. We, in Renamo, know which countries those are because, 
in the past, Frelimo also sent Mozambicans to vote in favor of 
certain southern African leaders." 
  We asked the Renamo leader whether he was talking about 
South 
Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia. He 
replied: "Yes, some of those countries." 
  The Renamo leader also disclosed that the recent Renamo 
congress had decided that "our people should get in touch with 
those countries to make them see that the war is over. However 
much ideological sympathy there may be for Frelimo in those 
countries, it is important in southern Africa at this stage that 
we make every effort to create economic development, forget the 
past, and enjoy good relations with the neighboring countries." 
  Asked about how the census would be conducted to allow 
foreigners to participate in the country's elections, Dhlakama 
answered that it would be "very simple, because there are many 
Mozambican refugees in those countries and it is easy for 
foreigners to come in with them on their return. What is more, 
many border posts have been reopened along the borders, where in 
the past there used to be none. Today, Frelimo is opening them 
up, thereby making it easier for aliens to come in illegally and 
take part in elections. It is possible that the [census] teams 
could discover they are foreigners during the census, but this 
is not a plan that Frelimo is just following blindly. It is 
part of a strategy intended to fool even the census teams." 
  The Renamo leader said he believed that the letters "making 
the accusation official," the governments of those countries 
"may desist from their plans to send their citizens in to vote 
in favor of Frelimo." [sentence as printed] 
  Afonso Dhlakama reiterated his accusation that the 
government 
is sending youths to some southern African countries "where they 
are being trained to attack Renamo when it is in power." He 
refused to give details but stressed that Renamo is committed to 
"diplomatic action to explain the reality of the Mozambican 
peace process to those countries and to make it clear that 
Renamo does not want war any more." 
  Similar accusations had already been made by Renamo General 
Mateus Ngonhamo, but they have been proven groundless. 
  NOTICIAS approached some African embassies in Maputo in 
connection with Afonso Dhlakama's allegations, but they said 
they knew nothing about them.

  [Text] Mozambique experienced a cruel war for 16 years. It 
killed many people and left in its wake real legions of 
war-displaced people and refugees. That war ended with the 
signing of the Rome peace accords in October 1992, but Carlos 
Reis, president of the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], has 
said that a fourth war could break out if a federal system is 
not introduced in this country. The Unamo leader also made 
hitherto unheard of disclosures. For instance, he said that the 
political opposition parties could nominate Afonso Dhlakama, 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, as their 
candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. Like Unamo, 
those parties are defending a federal system. 
  Unamo President Carlos Alexandre dos Reis said he had warned 
Afonso Dhlakama that, should he fail to follow the path of 
federalism and should another war break out in this country, a 
war like the one in Angola, he -- Dhlakama -- would be to blame 
for the blood to be shed by the Mozambican people. 
  [Begin recording] [Reis] I have already told President 
Dhlakama that if he does not follow that path and we are faced 
with another war such as the one that has beset Angola, he will 
be to blame for the blood that is shed by the Mozambican people. 
Afonso Dhlakama fought for 16 years for change to come to 
Mozambique. We recognize that. Now, he should agree to a 
federal system. That would prove that he does not crave power. 
That would show that he does not want power, that he is not 
doing it all just to replace Chissano. Should he fail to do so, 
he is quite certain to lose all his credibility among the 
Mozambican people. It will show that he wants to come in and 
play the same game the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] 
used to play: It took over and fulfilled none of the promises it 
made. 
  If he fought for the benefit of the Mozambican people, then 
he should agree to a federal system. Should he do so, with our 
support, we would be certain to dislodge Chissano from Ponta 
Vermelha Palace [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In one of his latest statements 
to the national media, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama suggested 
that the candidate with the second highest number of votes 
should be appointed vice president. 
  [Reis] No, that is not democratic. The Frelimo Party has 
already rejected it. That will depend on the party that wins 
elections. As the ruling party, it must resolve the problem of 
government. It will form its government and it will ask whoever 
it pleases to be part of government. Now, no elections would be 
needed if someone could just come along and dictate the 
composition of government to the ruling party. I do not agree 
with that position because I do not perceive it to be 
democratic. [end recording]

  [Text] A Malawian journalist has confirmed the presence of 
Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] personnel at Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] bases in Niassa Province. THE MONITOR's 
(Clement Mthambuli) was in Mozambique recently, having 
interviewed Renamo and MYP officers. The MYP is the armed wing 
of President Banda's Malawi Congress Party [(MCP]. 
  A Renamo officer, who identified himself as Alberto Carlos, 
told THE MONITOR that MYP members are being looked after and 
will return to Malawi once Malawi Minister of State John Tembo 
requests them to do so. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that 
the MCP and the MYP provided varied assistance to Renamo during 
the Mozambique war. 
  The Mozambican Government accused Renamo of sheltering MYP 
members at its bases, but that has been denied by Afonso 
Dhlakama's movement. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that it 
was John Tembo, the number two in Banda's cabinet, who asked 
Dhlakama to look after MYP members and give them all the 
necessary assistance and training so that they fulfill their 
national duty. Alberto Carlos did not elaborate on what he 
meant by national duty, but apparently the MYP is getting ready 
to wage guerrilla warfare should Banda's party lose at the polls 
on 17 May 1994.

  [Text] The DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] has alleged 
that the Angolan government has been sending military troops to 
Namibia charging there were about 2,000 MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] government soldiers in areas along 
the northern border with Angola. 
  DTA president, Mr Mishake Muyongo, said his party had been 
informed that the soldiers were in Namibia to launch attacks on 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
positions across the Kavango and the western Caprivi areas. "If 
this information is correct, as we believe it is, one would like 
to know from the Namibian Government whether Namibia is now 
participating in the Angolan war by backing the MPLA government 
and giving them sanctuary in order to attack UNITA on Namibian 
soil," he said. 
  "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that 
Angolan 
war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing the people of 
Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict, which is not 
of their own making?" 
  Mr Muyongo said it was ironic that while Namibians stood on 
their "toes", fearing that the South African situation could 
spill over here, the Government was prepared to "close" one eye 
to the activities of the MPLA government on Namibian soil. Such 
a situation, he said, could promote a war spill-over from 
Angola. "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that 
the Angolan war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing 
people of Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict?" 
asked Mr Muyongo. 
  "Or, is it the price that SWAPO [South-West African People's 
Organization] has to pay to the MPLA for the long years that the 
MPLA helped them while operating from Angola?" The shadow 
president said his party did not want Namibians to be victims of 
the Angolan war. 
  "The Government of Namibia will be well advised not to get 
involved in this protracted war in Angola under any 
circumstances, but rather try and find a peaceful solution that 
will reduce the human suffering that is now prevalent in 
Angola," said Mr Muyongo. He said his party had also received 
information alleging that the consulate of the MPLA government 
in Rundu and the Military Attache of the Angolan Embassy in 
Windhoek were involved in bringing soldiers to Namibia. 
  "If this is also true, then we ask the Namibian Government 
to 
urgently take action against these Angolan officials who are 
implicated in bringing these armed MPLA soldiers to Namibia, 
before the situation gets out of hand," said Mr Muyongo.

come for the world to rearrange the scheme of international 
relations, adding that the end of the Cold War should bring to 
an end the gestation period for a new world order. Speaking 
when he received the [words indistinct] at the presidential

today to defer to a more (?reliable) economic system and [words

  Mr. Chiluba said it would be pleasing to see a world with 
(?reduced) political confrontations, where cooperation, nuclear 
free zones, freedom, and democracy for all the peoples of the 
world should become the hallmark of labor relations. The 
president commended Cuba for standing up in the world today as 
an example of what determined people can do (?for change and)

  [Text] Security has somehow deteriorated once again in the 
capital, Bujumbura. Although the operation of disarming people 
possessing weapons illegally has already begun, these weapons 
and people possessing guns continue to cause damages. 
Yesterday, three rockets landed in the area of Ngagara, a 
quarter neighboring the militias' stronghold of Kamenge where 
the disarmament operation has begun. 
  One of the rockets reached a house and it smashed its roof 
which collapsed into the living room but causing no casualties 
although two persons were inside the house. The remainder of 
the rocket touched another house across the street and made a 
hole in the roof. The two other rockets exploded in the air and 
made no damage. 
  In the southern part of the capital, gunfires heard over the 
weekend had caused unrest in the areas of Musaga and (Kanyosha), 
and some people may have already been killed. All began with 
gunfires which were heard and compelled the Hutu population to 
flee, thinking it was the militaries who were shooting. On 
seeing this movement, the youth belonging mainly to the Tutsi 
group began to loot the deserted houses. Then the Hutus came 
back to retaliate and killed one young man, a killing which gave 
way to generalised insecurity in the whole area. Until late 
yesterday, tension remained high but the situation was calm this 
morning.

  [Text] Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko met today at the 
Meridien Hotel with provincial governors or their 
representatives. Four items were on the agenda, including 
security. Marie-Jose Niyonzima reports: 
  [Niyonzima] The security situation, refugee repatriation, 
the 
primary and secondary school situation, and the provincial 
administration of security in Bujumbura -- where the civilian 
population illegally possesses many weapons: These were the 
topics that Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and Interior 
Minister Jean- Baptiste Manwangari based their speeches on. 
  They each recalled the government's position concerning 
disarmament, a policy which will be pursued up to provincial 
level. They also discussed the recently failed coup d'etat and 
its continuing investigation. Burundi has a high number of 
refugees who are called upon to live together with others, but 
who are faced with the problems of food, shelter, and health. 
  The prime minister believes provincial governors with 
territory bordering Rwanda must play a large role in 
reestablishing trust among the people. The most important 
recommendations for the governors are ending suspicion between 
the security forces and the population, and placing themselves 
above ethnic groupings and partisanship. Governors must head an 
administration where all levels of the population are involved. 
Since the nation must survive despite its current crisis, the 
resumption of economic activity is imperative. The prime 
minister suggested that schools which are still sheltering 
displaced people release them, so as to allow the resumption of 
classes. However, the problem is returning people to their 
homes when their houses have been burned down or demolished.

  [Text] The Burundian people, especially those residing in 
the capital, are concerned about the issue of disarmament. The 
government announced that the disarming of the civilian 
population was to begin on 25 April. Our colleague, Salvator 
Nvuyekure, met the prime minister, who elaborated on this: 
  [Begin recording] [Nvuyekure] There is no question of 
decreasing pressure on the suburbs, where the disarmament 
operation currently is being implemented. After the ultimatum 
expired on 24 April, military forces for carrying out the 
operation were put in place. Since 24 April, efforts have been 
made to minimize the damage, so that innocent people are not 
victimized. Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko gave assurances 
that the operation is continuing, that it has not been halted. 
Military pressure continues so that, according to the prime 
minister, people gradually will hand over their weapons. The 
operation is related to re-establishing peace and security. 
There will be no backpedalling. 
  [Kanyenkiko] Regarding this issue, the operation will 
continue as planned. We would like to limit human and material 
damage. This justifies the steps taken since 25 April to 
establish contact with the people who are involved in this 
issue, in order to make it easier to hand over the weapons. We 
do not want innocent people to pay the cost if armed groups take 
them hostage. If this peaceful method does not succeed, [words 
indistinct] arms must be carried out. 
  [Nvuyekure] Some people say the armed groups and the 
security 
forces are negotiating. 
  [Kanyenkiko] There are no negotiations. Between who and who? 
There are no negotiations at all. But as I told you, since 
25-26 April we have been trying to talk to our representatives 
so as to find the best way of getting the weapons without human 
or material losses. There are no negotiations. This is just a 
method chosen to carry out the operation without losses. 
  [Nvuyekure] [words indistinct] on the period that you will 
have to wait, one week, two weeks. 
  [Kanyenkiko] You know, the management of a country calls for 
some degree of calm. That means that we shall try all possible 
means. After that, force will be used to maintain the law. [end 
recording] 
  That should make it clear. There should be no more 
speculation or false rumors. The disarmament operation is under 
way. In principle, it must continue throughout the entire 
territory of the Republic.

  [Text] In Rwanda, the cease-fire is but a memory. Violent 
fighting has resumed in Kigali. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The cease-fire announced by the 
rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] came into force on 
Monday at midnight. The RPF has accused the Army of violently 
bombing its positions yesterday afternoon. There was heavy 
fighting in Kigali last night. The RPF bombed the airport 
because the Rwandan Army has introduced large-caliber guns 
there, while the RPF and the United Nations wants this airport 
to become a neutral zone. The Army has promised to withdraw the 
guns, and General Dallaire, the commander of UN troops, is 
expected to try to negotiate a fresh cease-fire. 
  Fighting continued this morning, but with less intensity. 
However, it seems that the Army is still slaughtering opposition 
members. The International Red Cross is trying to evacuate to 
Zaire those who are threatened, including 5,000 people who have 
found refuge in a stadium in Cyangugu, in the southwest of 
Rwanda. A team of 15 Red Cross officers is doing its utmost to 
give assistance to the wounded in Kigali, but three wounded 
women being helped by the Red Cross were finished off by the 
Army as recently as last Sunday.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
president, His Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, together 
with other officials, visited people residing in Byumba. In 
Byumba, they found many Kigali citizens. 
  Between 4,000 and 5,000 people took refuge in the Amahoro 
Stadium in Kigali. Selfless RPF fighters did everything 
possible, despite a crossfire, to use their skills to take all 
these people to safety. These people are currently within an 
RPF-controlled zone outside of Kigali. As you may recall, 
government forces shelled the stadium where these people had 
taken refuge, killing more than 25 of them and injuring over 50. 
  The RPF continues to come to the rescue of the population, 
as 
it has been doing all along, saving the lives of those people 
who were still breathing in the various parishes. This work is 
part of our country's war for liberation. [passage omitted]

yesterday. Since the death of President Habyarimana on 6 April 
and the ethnic atrocities in Kigali, the RPF has been closing in 
on the capital. Abe Saleh asked our Kigali correspondent, Nestor 
Serushago, about the state of fighting today: 
  [Begin recording] [Serushago] In the northern part of this 
town, about five kilometers from the heart of the city, there is 
a heavy fighting between Rwandese forces and the RPF. Battling, 
each one wanting to get a hold of the top of those hills to the 
north so that he can control the town. It is going on right now. 
  [Saleh] Is the fighting only in the north of Kigali? 
  [Serushago] It is where I can see it is concentrated but 
also the eastern (?hills) and the south, there are sporadic 
shootings but not as heavy as that in the north. [end recording] 
  Not much has been heard recently of the transitional 
government who fled Kigali to Giterama, south of the city. But 
now, the commerce minister, (Justin Mugenzi), has turned up in 
our office in Nairobi. Robin White asked him if now that the 
cease-fire had broken down, it meant they would be fighting to 
the bitter end. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mugenzi)] I understand that RPF does not 
want anything else than fighting, fighting, fighting. We are 
trying our best to get whoever can have influence on Ugandan 
Government because all lies with the Ugandan Government, so that 
Museveni can bring this RPF to reasoning and asked them to stop 
it. 
  [White] Are you claiming that he controls the RPF in some 
way? 
  [(Mugenzi)] Well, not only controls but he orders the men, 
we are convinced that without him, RPF will not behave this way. 
  [White] Are you losing the war at the moment? 
  [(Mugenzi)] No, we are not. We are not losing the war, we 
are only losing people, because people are dying in big numbers, 
and this is a pity. It is a pity so many people are dying 
because of this war. And we want to bring an end to the war so 
that people can stop dying. 
  [White] But doesn't it look as you might shortly lose total 
control of Kigali? 
  [(Mugenzi)] No, I don't think so. According to the 
information I have, we are in a good position to stand the 
invasion. 
  [White] But how can you claim to be in any kind of control 
when the government itself has abandoned the capital and gone to 
Gitarama 
  [(Mugenzi)] No, we did not abandon it, we only did not want 
to work under those shells and those bombs because you can 
imagine the kind of noise you have there and you know that in 
any war, a government is always the first target. So if you 
want to keep some kind of administration and control and power 
over the country, you must make sure that the government is 
safe. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 28 Apr (AFP) -- The headquarters of the 
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the capital came under 
intermittent heavy weapons fire on Thursday [28 April], UN 
Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) spokesman Abdul Kabia said in 
Kigali. Contacted by telephone, Kabia said UNAMIR personnel were 
in the building, which is normally the seat of the National 
Development Council (Parliament), "and we had to ask the 
government forces to stop firing to let them out." It appeared 
that the rebels did not return the fire, which broke out early 
in the morning and lasted for more than an hour, Kabia said. He 
noted that the previous night had been very calm. [passage

  [Text] Now to Rwanda, where a cease-fire has been declared 
by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels, starting from 
midnight last night. It comes after three weeks of massacres in 
several parts of the country during which tens of thousands have 
lost their lives. Rwandan Government forces have also announced 
a cease-fire starting today. But the United Nations has been 
unable to get the two sides together to agree on the ground 
(?rules). RPF Secretary General Theogene Rudasingwa is in 
Nairobi at the moment. On the line Robin White asked him if the 
cease-fire was holding: 
  [Begin recording] [Rudasingwa] Our forces began respecting 
the cease-fire, which we declared on Saturday [23 April], with 
effect from midnight last night, but the government troops have 
been shelling our positions until actually early this afternoon. 
  [White] Does that mean you will not keep the cease-fire any 
longer? 
  [Rudasingwa] We are going to keep the cease-fire but, of 
course, we do have a legitimate obligation to respond to some of 
these violations at the time of our own choosing. 
  [White] So, how long will you give government forces to obey 
before you start fighting again yourselves? 
  [Rudasingwa] First of all, we had expected that the troops 
would immediately respect the cease-fire because the cease-fire 
takes two to respect. Secondly, we have given a 96-hour grace 
period within which the government forces must stop the killings. 
  [White] Now, what is the current military position now, as 
you said. How much territory do you currently claim to control? 
  [Rudasingwa] Well, we do control, I think, close to half of 
the territory of Rwanda and the position -- the latest which I 
have -- is that they had an upper hand shortly before we 
declared the cease-fire and they are remaining in those 
positions. 
  [White] How far have you advanced since the fighting 
started, since the death of President Habyarimana? 
  [Rudasingwa] We have definitely advanced close to Kigali. 
As you know, we do control some stratetic locations within 
Kigali. 
  [White] But how many miles have you actually advanced? 
  [Rudasingwa] Well, the distance we are talking about may be 
close to 40, between 40 and 60 kms occasionally. 
  [White] And do you control any territory at all south of the 
capital? 
  [Rudasingwa] As of now, no. I am not aware of any position 
that we do control in the south of the capital. 
  [White] Do you have any plans, if the cease-fire breaks 
down, to try and take over territories south of the capital? 
  [Rudasingwa] Well, if the cease-fire fails, then we continue 
with the struggle elsewhere. We shall continue with the 
objective of contributing to the restoration of law and order. 
If that means that we should hold some positions anywhere in 
the territory of Rwanda, then we shall proceed to do that. 
  [White] I am wondering if in the back of your mind you are 
thinking of the partition of the country, with you controlling 
the north and forces which are basically Hutu controlling the 
south? 
  [Rudasingwa] (?Unfortunately no), I am sorry to [words 
indistinct] because we do have a national agenda. We do have a 
patriotic obligation to rescue the entire people of Rwanda, to 
rescue the entire territory of Rwanda, and it would be 
inappropriate and highly irresponsible on the part of anybody to 
leave any part of the country or any section of the population 
to some of the people who have unleashed a lot of terror on the 
population. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF], Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, held a news conference 
yesterday which focused on our country's current situation. He 
answered journalists' questions on the cause of the resumption 
of hostilities -- after a cease-fire which was announced by the 
RPF and subsequently violated by government troops -- the 
credibility of the negotiations, the continuing massacres in our 
country, and on the politicians who are responsible for the 
atrocities. [passage omitted] By announcing the cease-fire, the 
RPF showed its predisposition for peace, but the war will always 
be inevitable as long as its causes are not removed. This is a 
condition for any other cease-fire. 
  In fact, the RPF president went on, the international 
community first should solve the causes of the war before 
pushing the RPF to negotiate. Saying that the war should stop 
is not enough. If the international community had the will to 
take measures against our war's causes, notably by energetically 
condemning and actively opposing the continuing massacres in our 
country, then the international community would have a right to 
tell the RPF to stop fighting the (?government) forces. 
Therefore, it is not honorable for the international community 
to keep silent in the face of these horrible massacres, whose 
perpetrators pursue survivors inside hospitals and finish them 
off. The dishonorable attitude of the international community 
contradicts the need for the cessation of hostilities. 
  If foreign nationals and UN employees were evacuated by 
their 
troops during the first hours of the massacres, why then should 
the RPF not do the same for Rwandans who have been abandoned by 
those same foreign troops [words indistinct]? 
  That is a question the international community should ask 
itself, before making declarations on keeping the RPF from 
fighting those criminals who launched themselves to power in our 
country. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning war news, the RPF president recalled that the 
fighting was turning in favor of the Rwandan Patriotic Army on 
all fronts. The prefectures of Byumba and Kibungo are entirely 
under the control of the RPF, as well as most of the prefectures 
of Ruhengeri -- not to mention several communes in rural Kigali 
and important strategic positions in the capital. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jerome Bicamumpaka, foreign </F>
minister of transitional government, by Dominique de Courcelles 
in Paris; date not given] 
  [Text] Our guest this morning is Jerome Bicamumpaka, the 
foreign minister of the transitional Rwandan Government. The 
transitional government, which is based some 40 km south of 
Kigali, was set up after President Habyarimana's death. The 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is refusing to talk to this 
government, claiming that it is a self-appointed clique of 
murderers. Jerome Bicamumpaka, who is currently visiting Paris, 
rejects responsibility for the death of the president, for the 
massacres, and for the war against the RPF. 
  The army, he claims, is only defending itself against the 
aggressor and the government is attempting to calm people. Here 
is the Rwandan foreign minister, interviewed by Dominique de 
Courcelles. 
  [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Ever since the government 
launched a pacification action, ever since it called on the 
gendarmerie to deploy in order to halt massacres and looting, it 
has succeeded in reducing massacres throughout the national 
territory. So if this government had not acted as it did we 
believe that the destruction would have been far worse. 
  [De Courcelles] Are you saying that massacres are now 
abating 
in Rwanda? 
  [Bicamumpaka] They are, quite dramatically, but the problem 
is that in the part of the country controlled by the RPF in the 
north, the RPF carried out horrendous killings, near Moutarra 
for instance, where it is estimated that some 20,000 were killed 
by the RPF. All these actions by the RPF do not make our work 
any easier. 
  [De Courcelles] Minister, you seem to be saying that all 
evil 
comes from the RPF, that the RPF killed, that it bombed the 
town, that it brought the war to Kigali. Is the RPF the only 
party responsible? Was it the RPF which started the killings 
following President Habyarimana's death? 
  [Bicamumpaka] Yes. Why? Because just after President 
Habyarimana's death -- you know how the Rwandan president died 
-- the RPF went immediately on the offensive. The units in the 
[word indistinct] palace in Kigali went on the offensive; they 
also attacked on the northern front. Following this attack 
massacres spread throughout the country. 
  [De Courcelles] You probably know what many are saying, that 
the army -- and the presidential guard within the army -- is 
mostly responsible for these massacres. 
  [Bicamumpaka] In fact many of these allegations are 
erroneous. The Rwandan Government did not break the Arusha 
agreement or go on the offensive -- it was the RPF. The cause 
of this is the death of the president which we blame on the RPF 
and on the powers supporting it. In the military sphere we note 
that the RPF is supported by the Ugandan Army; we estimate the 
size of Ugandan units supporting the RPF at five battalions. 
There are also Ugandan army Soviet-made helicopters. So the 
fact that the president was killed and that an attack on the 
northern front and in Kigali followed shortly after prompts us 
to say the RPF is at the root of all the evil, of all the 
massacres currently taking place in the country. 
  [De Courcelles] Therefore you consider that the gendarmerie, 
the army, and the presidential guard are beyond any reproach. 
  [Bicamumpaka] There are certainly elements in the Rwandan 
Army which have committed crimes, in particular the 
assassination of some officials, but it cannot be said that they 
represent the whole of the army. It would have been impossible 
for the Rwandan Army to face the RPF attack and to massacre 
people at the same time.

  [Text] Nairobi, April 27 (AFP) -- Renewed fighting in 
Kigali, including heavy artillery exchanges, breached unilateral 
ceasefires declared by government forces and rebels, a UN 
spokesman said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  During intense fighting early Wednesday, a shell landed on a 
tennis court 50 metres (yards) from UN headquarters near the 
Amahoro stadium where about 5,000 displaced people are 
sheltering, spokesman Abdul Kabia said. 
  By late in the day the Rwandan capital was again reported 
calm. "We drew the attention of both sides to the danger they 
were exposing us to and the fighting shifted," Kabia told AFP by 
telephone from Kigali. 
  But Kabia said the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front had shelled the airport because the Hutu-led government 
forces had set up mortars and artillery pieces there and were 
firing at rebel positions. 
  Meanwhile, the head of the ruling National Republican 
Movement for Democracy (MRND) accused former premier Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana of plotting a presidential coup prior to her 
murder on April 7, the date the ethnic carnage which has claimed 
an estimated 100,000 lives was unleashed. 
  The United Nations cancelled its flights into Kigali and 
asked government troops to move their weapons out of the 
airport, which they promised to do, Kabia said. Four UN planes 
bringing relief supplies were expected later Wednesday, he said. 
  According to International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
delegation head Philippe Gaillard, a rocket landed late Tuesday 
on the X-ray unit at a Kigali hospital near a Rwandan army camp. 
There were no reported casualties. 
  He said the streets of Kigali were still largely deserted, 
except for Army, UN and ICRC vehicles. 
  Both rebels and government forces have declared unilateral 
ceasefires, and claimed that they were only firing when attacked 
by the other side, Kabia said, adding that it was impossible to 
tell who had started the fighting. 
  The UN has sent ceasefire proposals drawn up by Tanzanian 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and Organisation of African Unity 
secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim to both sides and was 
awaiting a response, Kabia said. 
  Interim Commerce Minister Justin Mugenzi blamed the failure 
of the truces on the fact that they were unilateral. "We must go 
back to the documents, negotiate, and reach a common ceasefire," 
he said. 
  UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh is in the Kenyan 
capital Nairobi for discussions with President Daniel arap Moi. 
  The Red Cross said Booh-Booh planned to visit Zaire and 
Uganda to ask their leaders to use their "good offices" to end 
the ethnic and political carnage unleashed after the April 6 
death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a aircraft crash. 
  Rwanda's bloodbath began when Hutu Presidential Guards 
accused the rebels of shooting down the president's plane. 
  The Presidential Guards spearheaded massacres of Tutsis and 
opposition supporters including Hutus. Clashes were also 
reported between the president's northern clan and Hutus from 
southern Rwanda. 
  Meanwhile Wednesday, the head of Habyarimana's National 
Republican Movement for Democracy (MRND) accused Uwilingiyimana, 
killed the day after the plane crash, of having been planning a 
presidential coup. 
  Matthew Ngirumpatse told a press conference here that two 
days before the plane crash, "the prime minister had called 
together a few senior officers and told them of her plan to 
organize a coup against the president." 
  "I am not trying to justify a murder," Ngirumpatse said 
here. 
"I am trying to find the reasons which made soldiers do that," 
he said. 
  Ngirumpatse also denied the existence of organized militias 
within the MRND who have been accused of involvement in 
massacres, and accused the rebels of having started the 
bloodletting. 
  Uwilingiyimana and Habyarimana were members of rival Hutu 
factions.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- A large explosion 
believed to be a car bomb shook the international arrivals hall 
at Jan Smuts Airport on Wednesday morning. The blast was 
confirmed by Witwatersrand Liaison Officer Col Dave Bruce. He 
could not confirm it was a car bomb. 
  A spokesman for the Joint Operational Centre in Pretoria 
said 
although details of the airport blast were still scanty, reports 
had been received three people had been injured -- one 
seriously. "There was a car bomb," said a spokeswoman at the 
Operational Centre. 
  But police in a later official statement said "an explosive 
device...as yet unknown type" exploded at the airport. Police 
could not immediately confirm any deaths. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported a "car bomb" exploded at the parking area adjoining the 
arrivals facility. Kempton Park fire brigade officers were 
treating several injured people who sustained injuries.

<F P=106> [From the "Election '94" program] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Patricia Glyn] Our reporter has arrived 
at Jan Smuts Airport. Hendrick Martin is on the line to us from 
there now to give us an update on the bomb which occurred there 
earlier this morning. Hendrick, hello. How close are you to 
where the bomb actually exploded? 
  [Martin] Well, I'm on the spot where the bomb exploded, on 
the inside of the airport building. It's actually just outside 
the windows on the second floor, a sort of parking area, it's 
just opposite the international departures hall. A lot of 
damage has been done. The windows are smashed. The ceiling has 
fallen in in several places. Even from the ground floor 
outside, some of the windows were shattered, and you can also 
parts of the ceiling hanging down. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, our news bulletin at nine implied that 18 
people had been injured. Do you have an update on that number 
for us, and have they been taken to hospital? 
  [Martin] There seems to be conflicting reports on this. One 
of the fireman said 18 people had been injured, but according to 
the managing director of the airport, Mr. (Braam Loots), only 
nine people were injured and only one of them seriously injured. 
And the police say there were no fatalities. Now at this stage 
everybody who has been injured has been removed. The airport 
has actually been opened, and most of emergency vehicles have 
departed already. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, the injured, were they were passengers or 
people merely seeing others off in the international arrivals 
hall? 
  [Martin] I can't give you specifics on that. What I can say 
is that one of the witnesses, one of the people who was actually 
injured, very slightly, but he was injured in the blast, and he 
saw what was happening. He and a number of people with him, all 
of them employees of the airport, and they seem to have been 
injured, he mentioned a figure of four or five people. I think, 
if I look at the damage, I think some people who may have been 
passengers could have been injured as well because of the damage 
on the inside of the building. This is were passengers collect 
for their departures. 
  [Glyn] So Hendrick let me get this straight, the bomb was 
planted in a car outside the international arrivals hall, but 
the distance between where the car was parked and the hall was 
merely a matter of meters, was it? 
  [Martin] That's how it looks. According to this witness, he 
told me his whole story. He saw a white Peugeot vehicle and he 
saw smoke coming from the boot of this car. He had two traffic 
officials with him, they also saw it, and they tried via radio 
to contact, to get help, to get someone to come and look at 
this, and he said the next moment there was a tremendous blast, 
and it is literally just on the other side of the window. 
  [Glyn] Now did this person also see the man that the police 
are looking for, some chap with red hair who was taken away, or 
drove away in a Toyota Corolla? 
  [Martin] No, he didn't see anybody, at least he didn't 
mention seeing anybody, but another witness apparently did see 
someone running away from the area, and apparently the police 
are in the process of compiling an identikit based on the 
description of the person. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, thank you very much.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Police were 
questioning a suspect who matched the description of a white man 
seen running away from a car shortly before Jan Smuts Airport 
was rocked by a powerful car bomb on Wednesday. SAP [South 
African Police] spokesman Capt Wikus Webber said the suspect had 
been driving a white Toyota. He was fairly tall and had long 
brown hair. 
  Police confirmed there had been no deaths as a result of the 
blast but said two injured people were in a serious condition. 
Police confirmed the blast had been a car bomb. 
  Airport workers were still cleaning up debris -- mostly 
shattered glass -- at 9.30AM after the 7.15AM blast. At least 
18 people were injured in the blast.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- South African Airways 
spokesman Leon Els said international departures at Jan Smuts 
Airport would be fully operational by 2PM on Wednesday [27 
April] after the car bomb. Mr Els said all international 
flights scheduled to leave before 2.15PM would depart from 
Terminal C while mopping up operations were in progress. "We 
expect to have everything back to normal at about 2PM however". 
  He advised passengers to arrive earlier than usual as 
security had been stepped up and cars would not be allowed to 
remain unattended outside the building. "Otherwise everything 
will operate as usual. The domestic services will remain 
unchanged and the parking lots fully operational." 
  Public relations officer for Jan Smuts Airport, Coenie 
Meyer, 
said passengers could be assured that they would be safe. "The 
airport is totally secure and we have been working closely with 
police," he said. "Security has been extremely strict." 
  "We diverted only one flight from Lufthansa to Bloemfontein 
but that has now arrived. Otherwise all flights have arrived 
and departed as scheduled." 
  Mr Meyer said the damage caused by the bomb had mostly been 
to windows, aluminium frames and the ceiling. 
  The Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA], armed wing of 
the Pan Africanist Congress, condemned the bombing, saying in a 
statement the chain of reactionary violence since Sunday "will 
never stop our people in their road to victory. We condemn 
these bombings and killings of our people with the contempt they 
deserve."

  [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk says the answer to 
this morning's bomb blast is a peaceful, well-supported 
election. During a visit to a polling station in Soweto, he 
told Sontie Maseko that strong action was being taken to prevent 
bombings. 
  [Begin recording] [De Klerk] The police will act very 
firmly. 
They have taken all the precautions to assure that this spate of 
bombs will be limited, and that the people behind it will be 
apprehended. Some progress is being made, we must not interfere 
with the investigation, but you have our assurance that the 
investigation is carrying on full blast and that they have a 
very, very good strong team on this, and I'm sure we will have 
success. 
  [Maseko] All eyes are on South Africa. Now what does this do 
to our international image? 
  [De Klerk] Well, obviously it's bad to our international 
image, but a good turnout, with a very high percentage poll, 
which is already apparent we will get, and the peaceful election 
will far outweigh the negative image. It will prove that we are 
dealing here with a small lunatic radical fringe, and that the 
overwhelming majority of all South Africans are committed to 
peace, and that this country is now departing on a new voyage 
towards prosperity and peace for all its people. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- The shadowy Azanian 
National Liberation Army [Azanla], military wing of the Black 
Consciousness Movement [BCM], on Wednesday [27 April] denied 
responsibility for the bomb blast that rocked Jan Smuts Airport 
and injured 16 people, two seriously. 
  Azanian Peoples Organisation [Azapo] official Dr Gomolemo 
Mokae said by telephone: "To the best of our information Azanla 
was not involved in the placing of the bomb." 
  Azapo is a BCM member and is boycotting the all-race 
election. 
  Dr Mokae said it was not uncommon for "De Klerk and company" 
to respond to such activities by condemning not only the white 
right, but also the black left. 
  He was responding to a caller claiming to be from Azanla and 
claiming responsibility for the blast. "It is a bogus call 
initiated by the white regime to try to get rid of the egg on 
its face." 
  Dr Mokae added although Azapo remained opposed to 
participating in the election, it believed it was the democratic 
rights of anyone to take part in the polls.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Police have arrested 
31 suspects and confiscated arms and explosives in connection 
with the recent bomb blasts at Johannesburg, Germiston and Jan 
Smuts Airport. 
  This was announced by Police Commissioner Johan van der 
Merwe 
at a special press conference held at Caeser's Palace, 
Braamfontein, where exhibits and a special video tape was made 
available to the media. He said teams of SAP [South African 
Police] members had worked around the clock for the past few 
days to hunt down those responsible for the blasts and to 
prevent further blasts. 
  "The result was a remarkable breakthrough resulting in 31 
arrests," he said. 
  The arrests were carried out in Rustenberg, Ventersdorp and 
Pretoria and involved the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's [AWB, 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard]. 
  Gen van der Merwe said some had given themselves up and that 
those arrested included a police reservist. Those arrested were 
the brains of the group and it could not be excluded that others 
were involved, including leaders, but this was currently under 
further investigation. 
  The first suspect was arrested and held under Section 29 of 
the Internal Security Act on Sunday, but the rest were regular 
arrests, gen van der merwe said. He said the suspects were being 
held at various locations which were being kept secret. 
  The successful results were primarily the product of good 
intelligence work, he said. 
  Those arrests were all allegedly connected to the bombs 
which were detonated in central Johannesburg on Sunday, at the 
Germiston taxi rank on Monday, the Pretoria restaurant on Monday 
night and Wednesday's Jan Smuts Airport blast. The three 
explosions claimed 21 lives and injured 173 people. 
  Other blasts where only material damage was caused were also 
being linked to the group. These occurred at taxi ranks in 
Randfontein and Westonaria on Monday morning.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Thirty-one suspects -- 
some of them members of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard] unit -- have been 
arrested and are being held in connection with several bomb 
blasts which have hit the Witwatersrand and Pretoria areas since 
the weekend. 
  Two of the men are policemen, one a serving member and the 
other a reservist. All those arrested are being held at 
different places and investigations into further connections, 
perhaps at leadership level, are in progress. This was 
announced by the commissioner of police, General Johan van der 
Merwe, at a special media conference called at a Braamfontein, 
Johannesburg night club on Wednesday afternoon. 
  A confiscated pipe bomb and its explosives were exhibited to 
the media and a special video tape was released to SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] TV and other television 
journalists. 
  The blasts caused the death of 21 people and the injury of 
173. "Investigation teams have been working around the clock 
over the past few days to hunt down those responsible for recent 
terror blasts and in an attempt to prevent further blasts," Gen 
Van der Merwe said. This team effort, co-ordinated and executed 
nationally, had resulted in a remarkable breakthrough, he said. 
  "The achievement again illustrates the will, commitment and 
ability of the SAP [South African Police] to maintain law and 
order and should also be seen as a strong warning to those who 
wish to achieve their aims through violent means. Using 
violence to achieve their aims is not only futile and pointless, 
but will ultimately lead to their own destruction," he said. 
  The media conference was shown 4kg of fertiliser explosive 
which police experts said was "amateur" but the effect of which, 
packed in a 12cm diameter by 60cm steel pipe, was "utterly 
professional". 
  The pipe bomb had been confiscated in a roadblock at which 
suspect was expected. "The breakthrough must be attributed to 
the sheer hard work and determination of the investigation teams 
involved, as well as exceptional intelligence work," the police 
commissioner said. 
  The breakthrough apparently started with the first arrest. A 
suspect was detained under Section 29 of the Internal Security 
Act on Sunday. Regular arrests then followed in Rustenberg, 
Ventersdorp and Pretoria, involving some members of the 
Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's elite Ystergarde. Some suspects 
had given themselves up. 
  Police were confident that those arrested were the brains of 
the group but it could not be excluded that others were 
involved, including leaders. This was currently under further 
investigation, Gen van der Merwe said. He said the suspects 
were being held at various locations which were being kept 
secret.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- More arrests were to 
follow after police arrested a 32nd suspect in connection with 
the spate of bomb blasts on the Reef, Police Commissioner Gen 
Johan van der Merwe said on Thursday [28 April]. 
  Gen van der Merwe said in an SABC [South African 
Broadcasting 
Corporation] interview there was prima facie evidence that the 
suspects had been involved in the explosions. They would be 
brought before the courts soon. 
  It was difficult to say whether more Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] Ystergarde [Iron 
Guard] members were involved, Gen van der Merwe said, but the 
suspects came from a "certain circle" in the AWB. 
  Gen van der Merwe added that police were investigating 
intimidation charges countrywide, but the charges could not be 
described as "widescale".

  [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- The KwaZulu government 
paramilitary training camp outside Ulundi was allegedly raided 
by the South African Police [SAP] on Tuesday [26 April] night, a 
move which drew condemnation on Wednesday from the KwaZulu 
Police [KZP]. 
  KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During slammed the late night 
raid as "highly suspect, provocative and unacceptable", adding 
that it had jeopardised KZP/SAP relations. 
  SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday morning he 
was not aware of any raid, but promised to investigate the claim. 
  Gen During said the move was initiated by Mac Maharaj, 
senior 
African National Congress representative on the Transitional 
Executive Council and lawyer Howard Varney who is investigating 
alleged KZP hit squads. 
  Gen During said the SAP had told him the raid was executed 
because training at the Mlaba camp was in contravention of the 
state of emergency, declared in Natal/KwaZulu almost a month ago. 
  The SAP was also apparently seeking suspected members of 
alleged hit squads who were supposed to have been harboured at 
the camp, Gen During said. 
  Several arms, ammunition, a "large number" of manuals and 
documents were seized in the raid, he added. But, "no evidence 
of unlawful military or paramilitary training was found and 
neither was there any trace of the so-called hit squad 
suspects", Gen During said. 
  The general criticised the timing of the raid, saying it was 
bound to affect goodwill which existed between the KZP and SAP. 
"In many quarters this incident will no doubt be regarded as an 
invasion and an aggression against the KwaZulu government and 
people," he added. 
  The Mlaba camp has trained thousands of recruits to form 
"self-protection units" throughout Natal and in the Transvaal, 
but the ANC alleges its graduates have been involved in 
fomenting violence.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela is confident of retaining the 
support of the security forces, particularly the higher 
echelons, if he is inaugurated as president on May 10. He made 
this comment on Tuesday [26 April] in his final press interview 
before the Independent Electoral Commission releases the results 
of the nationwide poll. 
  The ANC leader, certain to be the country's first black 
president, is scheduled to cast his vote at a polling booth just 
outside Durban on Wednesday -- the day general voting kicks off. 
  Speaking to SAPA in the Presidential Suite of a downtown 
Johannesburg hotel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mandela said he had 
received assurances from SA Defence Force and SA Police generals 
of their full co-operation. "We are exchanging information and 
removing any feeling of insecurity on their part, and I think we 
have established good relations between ourselves and the 
security forces. 
  "I have addressed firstly a meeting of all the police 
generals together with Mr Hernus Kriel (law and order minister) 
and his deputy, and the full staff of the SA Defence Force 
together with Minister of Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee and his 
deputy, Mr Wynand Breytenbach." 
  Mr Mandela added perceptions of the security forces at 
grassroots level would also have to change to enable better 
interaction between them and the community at large. "It is a 
question of supporting the security forces and making them 
legitimate and credible in so far as the masses of the people 
are concerned. Members of other population groups have already 
been drawn into the command structures of the security forces, 
and this has helped to restore confidence in the security forces. 
  "We are departing from the case where blacks are only there 
to carry out orders of the command strctures that are solely 
white." 
  The ANC believed in additional steps to galvanise the 
community behind the police and army. "It is also a question of 
a change in training of the security forces...that they should 
be trained in such a way that the poor image they have amongst 
the black community is removed. 
  "The introduction of community policing is also going to be 
a 
major factor in improving the relationship between the security 
forces and the masses of the people," the ANC president said. 
  The ANC and government had already gone far towards 
redressing racial imbalances in the security forces, he added.

  [Text] The current national flag, the orange, white and 
blue will flutter for the last time today before government 
buildings. It will be lowered at midnight and be replaced by a 
flag entirely foreign to the nation, the flag of the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council]. 
  Afrikaner National Front leader Ferdi Hartzenberg will hoist 
the liberation flag at midnight tonight at Donkerhoek. 
According to the National Front, the flag will be regarded as a 
freedom symbol until such time that the future national republic 
introduces another flag. Dr. Hartzenberg will render a brief 
address during the occasion. The ceremony will be coupled with 
prayers. 
  Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg has also requested flag-raising on 
Wednesday between 0400 GMT and 0500 GMT. In a statement, he 
requested the flag-raising to take place in every town and city. 
He has asked that the national flag and the liberation flag, 
such as the four-color or the Orange Free State flag, be hoisted 
during the occasion and that the national anthem of South 
Africa, "Die Stem" ["The Voice"], be sung or played over loud 
hailers.

  [Text] Cape Town -- The African National Congress (ANC) is 
clutching--in the form of the South African Communist Party 
(SACP)--a "Soviet tiger cub" to its bosom and is raising it so 
that it can later do its destructive work, warns DIE KERKBODE, 
official publication of the [South African] Dutch Reformed 
Church in its most recent edition. 
  "Communism, just like racism, is a very serious threat to 
our 
country. If the ANC, for its own reasons, offers a safe harbor 
to the SACP, it should not expect that the church will look the 
other way for the sake of peace. Excusing and accepting 
atheistic communism is entirely too great a price to pay for 
`unity in South Africa.' The church dares not agree to that. Is 
the church engaging in `partisan politics' when it advises its 
members against voting for an anti-Christian party with a 
history of persecuting the church? If this is so, then it 
becomes the church's mission in this case to engage in `partisan 
politics,'" the lead article contends. 
  The argument that the ANC's alliance with communists is 
comparable to the coalition between the Allies and the Soviet 
Union in World War II to bring Germany to its knees, is 
rejected. "The sad truth is that after World War II the Soviet 
Union left an even more terrible trail of blood in its wake than 
did Nazi Germany prior to and during the war." 
  According to the article, the Reverend Kobus Van Der 
Westhuyzen, moderator of the Western Cape's most recently held 
synod, has said that the church cannot do otherwise than to tell 
the faithful that they cannot vote for communism. "Throughout 
the years the church has spoken out against communism, which 
advocates a form of atheism, and this is still the case. It is a 
pity that the ANC has not distanced itself from the SACP. It 
would have made its message easier." 
  Dr. Pieter Bingle, minister of the Cape Town Reformed 
Congregation, told the newspaper that believers cannot support 
an ideology such as communism whose values are alien to the 
values of the Bible. "The communists are known for the fact that 
they will try anything--at any price and regardless of the path 
they pursue--to achieve their Marxist ideals." Prof. Pieter 
Potgieter, moderator of the most recent General Synod of the 
Dutch Reformed Church, denies that the church's discouraging 
people to vote for the SACP can be regarded as interfering in 
the political arena. He said that the SACP is not participating 
in the election as a separate party. Professor Potgieter said 
that a specific ideology is at issue here to which the church is 
opposed and the church believes that its members should take 
this into consideration when they go to vote.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Hell Awaits on the Other Side of 27 April"] </F>
  [Text] The date of 27 April 1994 is an absolute date. The 
plan is to elect a so-called democratic parliament over a 
three-day period centered on 27 April. Have we given some 
careful thought as to how that "parliament" is going to look if 
it is ever elected? What follows here is a picture of what we 
can expect in that regard. 
  Satanic worshippers, Hindus, Muslims, believers in 
witch-doctors, atheists, and a bunch of people calling 
themselves Christians will be sitting in the same benches. It is 
alarming but not too far-fetched to call it a Satanic parliament. 
  That Satanic parliament, if it ever becomes a reality, will 
be making laws for us Christians. The country will be governed 
according to those laws. Those laws will regulate the education 
of our children and prescribe the kind of education for them. Do 
you think it is going to be a Christian national education? 
Those who think so are thinking like children. Do you think that 
that education is going to be given in your children's mother 
tongue? Do you think their teacher is going to be someone from 
the Boer-Afrikaner people? Do you think you are going to have 
any say on the school board of your children's school? Do you 
think that the neighborhoods are going to look any different 
than Soweto? Do you think that you will be able to go about 
outside of your fortified house or your squatter's hut after 
dark or even during the day? Do you think you are still going to 
have work and food for your family? 
  And furthermore: Do you think that you as a white person are 
going to have any rights before the law? When your children are 
assaulted and your spouses are treated in a manner that will 
shock you, do you think that someone is going to listen to you? 
Have you so quickly forgotten the outrages in the Belgian Congo? 
Just ask those people. They are still living among us because 
they fled here in their extreme humiliation and ruin. For you 
there is no more opportunity to flee. The southernmost tip of 
Africa is Cape Agulhas, and that is still a part of South Africa. 
  Just think carefully whether you want to participate in 
the creation of this Satanic parliament. 
  There is something that we must remember well: We readily 
call ourselves Christians. The Word expressly says that the 
righteous may never pull together with the godless in 
the same yoke. There is no way for us to evade this 
prohibition--it stands fast. Any person who calls himself or 
herself a Christian and participates in the Satanic parliament 
commits high treason against Christianity. Those who take their 
place in that parliament as well as those who even vote for it 
are participating in it and will have to answer to the Creator 
for that. 
  Those participants will just have to ponder whether a 
position and a big salary are perhaps the 30 pieces of 
silver. 
  We are proud to say that the blood of the French Huguenots 
also flows in our veins. These are the people who fled from 
France, their homeland, with only the clothes on their backs and 
their precious Bible, baked in a loaf of bread. They left behind 
family, friends, property--everything except their 
faith in their Creator. That was more precious to them than 
anything else. Do you think that they would have wanted a 
position in a Satanic parliament for all the money in the world? 
  Perhaps many of our people who call themselves 
Afrikaners or Christians should read the history of the 
Huguenots again. Perhaps they will then return in time to things 
that really matter rather than participating in a Satanic 
parliament for temporal gain and the hypocritical appearance of 
sacrifice. 
  We have pity in our hearts for these people. They were once 
part of the Afrikaner-Boer people. They also have children who 
should become part of our glorious people but whom they now want 
to sacrifice to an alien conglomerate [sic]. What answers are 
they going to give to those ruined, crushed little children when 
they begin to ask questions? They will have to start looking 
hard for answers right now. The time for finding answers is 
extremely short. With open arms we invite our people to come 
back. 
  Come back to your people who need you. Come, so that 
together we can build a free republic of the people where we can 
be ourselves, can govern ourselves, can serve our Creator in 
freedom and can raise our children as Christian Boer-Afrikaners 
for the next generation. 
  The time is short and the days until 27 April are few. The 
sun is hanging low in the west. Soon darkness will descend upon 
Azania while the light shall dawn over the republic of the 
people. 
  We know, we believe, we shall be victorious, we do not 
fight alone: While Azania fights in the darkness, we fight in 
the light.

<F P=106> [Report by Ingo Capraro on a commentary by Charles Moore, </F>
editor of the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, appearing in THE SPECTATOR; date 
not given: "Free White Press in South Africa Has Only Two Years 
Left"] 
  [Text] London--Today's free, white-managed press in South 
Africa has probably less than two years of freedom left, 
according to a British newspaper editor who attended the 
just-concluded conference of the International Press Institute 
in Cape Town. It is relatively apparent that Mr. Nelson Mandela, 
who addressed the conference, wishes to have a one-party state, 
writes Mr. Charles Moore, editor of the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH in the 
most recent edition of THE SPECTATOR. 
  The African National Congress (ANC) is already a huge system 
of patronage for millions who would like to get ahead in life. 
The ANC has the capacity for large-scale organized violence. It 
enjoys the sentimental indulgence of the outside world and it 
has a socialist program and a strong communist contingent. Why 
then should it allow the niceties of a multiparty democracy to 
stand in its path? 
  The ANC needs capital but not freedom as it is generally 
understood in the West. "When Mr. Mandela spoke to us--as an 
audience of journalists--he said he wants to have `diversity in 
the media.' This means that there must be important newspapers 
controlled by blacks and a black-controlled broadcasting 
system--natural things for him to want." Yet his vision is not 
one of "competition among titles" but of something less: He 
wants ANC control. 
  The greatest danger, writes Mr. Moore, is that President 
F.W. 
de Klerk gave away too much in the negotiations. Historians will 
focus on the last year or so of the talks and will question 
whether it was necessary for him to rush his own pace by setting 
a specific date for the election before agreement had been 
reached on the constitution--for the election is one in which 
the winners take all. That imposes a thoroughly centralized 
authority upon a profoundly nonunitarian nation. This is, in 
view of the fact that the ANC could perhaps get more than 
two-thirds of the votes and thus could modify the constitution, 
a proposition for a one-party state.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Mandela's Call To End Mass Action -- "Nelson Mandela 
correctly anticipates difficulty in bringing home to his 
supporters that the time for mass action is over," states the 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 April in a page-11 
editorial. This is because workers throughout the country "have 
become accustomed to walking out or downing tools when they 
cannot get their own way. Having encouraged mass action as an 
effective method of bringing pressure on the Government, the ANC 
is not now going to switch it off too easily." "Perhaps" the 
"most daunting" task for the future government is to convince 
people to stop thinking in "terms of resistance" and start 
thinking about "addressing problems." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Elections in KwaZulu-Natal -- "The eyes of South Africa and 
perhaps the world are likely to be on the KwaZulu-Natal region 
after the elections," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English 
on 27 April in a page-6 editorial. The violence in this area of 
the country is "obviously a symptom of socio-economic 
problems...and is not about to stop after the elections." 
Kenyan mediator Washington Okumu, who played a role in 
encouraging Buthelezi to join the elections, warned that "there 
is a tendency among victorious political groups in Africa to 
wipe out the losers. But we believe the elections could also 
serve to end the deep enmity between the ANC and the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] with King Goodwill Zwelithini playing a 
vital role. Our wish is that there should be a balance in the 
distribution of power which will give the king the chance to 
play a unique role in the history of South Africa." In 
conclusion the SOWETAN states that "Natal is a vital region and 
if things go wrong there, they are likely to take similarly 
unfortunate routes in the rest of the country."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Call To Extend Voting Day if Necessary -- "The election is 
teetering in some areas," begins a page 10 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 April. The list of 
"unsupplied ballots, unopened stations and unstuck stickers is 
proving much too long for comfort." It "seems unlikely that by 
tonight" all people will have voted, and the Independent 
Electoral Commission's (IEC) response has "thus far displayed 
the smack of the high horse. The Commission should swallow its 
pride. Its staff -- and South Africa knows they are exhausted, 
and is grateful -- should stiffen the sinews for what could be a 
long laaste skof [last shift]. If tomorrow must be a fourth 
day, let it be so. Neither the letter of the law nor the 
drooping of eyelids should lead to doors being closed as long as 
any voters are left standing in the cold." 
  Call for 'Firm Action' Against Bombers -- A second editorial 
on the same page says "nothing could have been more sickening 
for ordinary citizens making their way to voting stations 
yesterday than the news that another bomb had gone off, this 
time at Jan Smuts Airport." News of arrests "is a welcome 
indication that the police are pursuing their responsibilities 
with vigour." The perpetrators of these "cowardly" acts should 
be brought before the courts. "Only firm action will dissuade 
the similarly-minded from more of the same as the new order 
finds its feet." 
  U.S. Interest in South Africa -- On the same page Peter 
Fabricius writes "In Washington" on the amount of U.S. media 
attention to South Africa. Fabricius says that according to THE 
WASHINGTON POST, "by many of the traditional definitions of 
national interest, the U.S. might appear to have little stake in 
the SA elections. There are no oil fields to protect, no U.S. 
troops or bases in the region, no Soviet surrogates to contain 
and no colonial guilt to assuage." Fabricius therefore believes 
part of the explanation for the U.S. interest in South Africa 
"seems to be enlightened self-interest. The Clinton 
Administration has identified South Africa as one of the world's 
10 best emerging markets and is trying hard to buy in while the 
prices are low, so to speak." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  IEC `Not Totally To Blame' for Electoral Arrangement Faults 
-- "Some of the failings of the R 700m [million rand] electoral 
machine have been inexcusable, but tempting as it is to accuse 
it, the Independent Electoral Commission is not totally to 
blame," declares the page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 28 April. The IEC "was operating in a 
situation without precedent, necessitating guesswork and 
assumption about how many people would vote, and where." 
Inkatha's last-minute decision to participate in the election 
also "put a huge additional burden on an already pressed 
organisation." Therefore, "if an extra public holiday, 
additional polling hours, a few million more ballot papers and 
some careful negotiation about controversial ballot papers can 
overcome the problem, the nation will have come off lightly. 
The new South Africa was never going to be easy, but it is 
here." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  IEC Electoral Arrangements `Fine Job' -- "It would have been 
a miracle for yesterday's elections to have gone off without 
technical hitches," states a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 28 April. The paper notes that the IEC 
was blamed for "shoddy arrangements in various areas." "In the 
first place, such shortcomings are common to all elections. In 
the second place, this country undertook this gigantic exercise 
for the first time. Finally, the politicians should take much of 
the blame for hindering the process towards election day and 
making the work of the IEC difficult by the constant changing of 
deadlines. The IEC, in fact, must be congratulated for doing a 
fine job under difficult circumstances."

  [Text] East London April 27 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday [27 April] ordered the 
urgent printing of four million extra ballot papers for the 
Eastern Cape region, said regional monitoring director Mark 
Anstey. Earlier, several polling stations in the region were 
shut down because of a lack of ballot papers and boxes and an 
Independent Electoral Commission official described the position 
as "extremely serious". 
  Speaking to representatives of political parties and 
international observer missions in a long and often angry 
meeting at IEC headquarters in East London, Mr Anstey promised a 
full investigation into the reasons for the shortages. 
  "It appears the national plan simply underestimated the 
volume of equipment and resources for the (voting) exercise," he 
said. 
  There was simply no national reserve of ballot papers, he 
said. 
  Appealing for parties' co-operation, he said some areas had 
become "fairly volatile" and warned tensions could rise when 
voters found themselves temporarily unable to cast their votes. 
  There had already been an incident in Mdantsane on Wednesday 
when an impatient crowd became angry and troops had to be called 
in to secure the polling station. 
  IEC Eastern Cape spokesman Mr Mike Chandler said South 
African Defence Force helicopters had been seconded to take 
voting materials to the transkei. 
  Voting boxes from previous elections were being taken out of 
home affairs storerooms and pressed into service. 
  Mr Anstey said the four million extra ballot papers, 
including the Inkatha Freedom Party's listing, would be ready by 
Thursday morning. They were being produced by Port Elizabeth 
firms which would not be identified for security reasons. 
  All IEC sub-regions had been told to gear themselves to 
collect the ballot papers early on Thursday morning. 
  The under-supply of papers was so general that a 
redistribution of papers from less-heavily used polling stations 
was "simply not feasible". 
  Mr Anstey said it was the IEC's intention that everyone 
would 
vote and he asked party representatives to spread the word that 
steps were being taken to ensure this. "By tomorrow (Thursday) 
we believe we will be back on track," he said. 
  Provincial electoral officer Mr Dirk van Schalkwyk told the 
meeting it was clear the regional population figures used by the 
IEC were "completely under-estimated". He had pointed this out a 
long time ago, he said. 
  Party representatives at the meeting gave their approval to 
the printing and distribution of the extra ballot papers but 
said they were concerned about the security of the printing 
process. 
  IEC representatives said they would try to ensure that 
international monitors, rather than party representatives, 
oversaw the printing. 
  ANC representative Mr Hintsa Siwisa said the lack of ballot 
papers was not the only problem causing concern to his party. 
  The ANC had discussed its problems, including irregularities 
committed by electoral officers, with the IEC on Tuesday night, 
but they were still occurring on Wednesday. 
  The ANC was becoming ever more convinced there was a 
"conscious effort at undermining the process", he said. 
  Mr Chandler said earlier on Wednesday a decision by some 
district electoral officers in the Transkei to unilaterally 
increase the number of polling stations had added to the 
organisational problems. 
  The IEC had 1797 stations on its books for the territory and 
had supplied voting materials for this number. 
  "Today it appears there are more than 2,000. That's bloody 
ludicrous," he said. "We can't supply them." 
  People who had turned up to vote and been unable to do so 
were understandably angry, he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- South Africa's 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials worked through 
the night to ensure that where there were shortages of ballot 
papers on Wednesday, the situation would be remedied by Thursday 
morning, IEC chairperson Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said on 
Thursday. The printing of 5.4 million additional ballot papers 
began on Wednesday afternoon and were already reaching their 
destinations throughout the country. Some voting stations may 
open a little later than expected but most voting stations 
should open on time and in full supply of ballot papers and 
other vital election materials, Mr Justice Kriegler said. 
  He added that the IEC was grateful to the electorate for the 
patience it demonstrated on Wednesday despite the many hours 
spent by voters in long queues as they waited to vote. 
  Mr Yunus Mohamed, a director of the election administration 
directorate, has also issued special urgent instructions to all 
district electoral officers and presiding officers. He said all 
presiding officers who have experienced shortages are asked to 
get immediately in touch with their district electoral officers, 
preferably before they open their voting stations, to establish 
when and how they should receive their voting materials. Ballot 
boxes had to be properly guarded. Presiding officers would also 
keep their voting stations open to ensure that all voters 
intending to vote were attended to. 
  It was also decided that when ballot boxes were full, and if 
a station ran out of ballot boxes, presiding officers should, in 
the presence of voting agents, empty the contents of the full 
boxes into post office bags. Prior to the use of such bags 
approval must be obtained from the party voting agents present 
at the voting station. 
  National Peace Secretariat Chairman Antonie Gildenhuys has 
been requested by Mr Justice Kriegler to second peace monitors 
to the 9,000 voting stations around the country to help ensure 
orderly access to voting stations. 
  This urgent request will override the 500 metre restriction 
zone placed on monitors around polling stations until now.

  [Text] Pretoria April 28 SAPA -- The Army worked through 
the night printing extra ballot papers, then rushed them to Air 
Force planes before dawn for delivery to areas around the 
country where thousands were waiting to cast their votes. 
  A spokesman for the SA [South African] National Defence 
Force 
said, after a request by the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] on Wednesday afternoon [27 April] , the Army's 1 Military 
Printing Regiment had 375,000 ballot papers printed by 6AM on 
Thursday. It hoped to have another batch of 300,000 ready for 
dispatch by 9.30AM. 
  The operation had started at 6PM on Wednesday, and by 3.30AM 
the first batch of 210,000 had been delivered to Waterkloof Air 
Force Base for dispatch to areas designated by the IEC. A 
second batch of 165,000 had been delivered by 6AM, and was sent 
by the IEC to Ulundi.

  [Text] Durban April 28 SAPA -- A helicopter from 15 
Squadron in Durban left Newcastle on Thursday to distribute 
ballot papers throughout the rural areas of northern Natal, SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. An 
estimated 600,000 ballot papers will be distributed, following a 
massive shortage in the area. Helicopters have also been sent 
to southern Natal where a shortage of papers caused major 
problems on Wednesday. 
  Meanwhile angry voters were staging a sit-in at Nqutu in 
northern Natal in protest against the disorganisation at polling 
stations. Very little voting has taken place in the area. 
  At Charlestown on the Natal/Transvaal border, voting only 
started at 5PM on Wednesday while voting only got underway at 
Ingogo near Newcastle at 3PM.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler at </F>
IEC headquarters, Gallagher Estate --live, broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Right now, we are going to 
a press conference at the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC]. I am sorry that we have to interrupt you, but we are 
going to the IEC headquarters at Midrand, Gallagher Estate. 
  [Kriegler] ... valid ballot paper, however, when it became 
apparent yesterday already that there were certain voting 
districts where the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers had not 
arrived in time, we had to deal with the situation as best we 
could, and I want to read to you the instruction that was given. 
Voters wishing to cast their votes for the IFP, where no 
stickers were provided for the ballot papers, have been marking 
their preference in writing on the ballots. The IEC will deal 
with such ballots in due course, in terms of Section 47 of the 
Electoral Act which deals inter alia with voting irregularities. 
  This section empowers the commission to make such 
determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting of 
irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the 
circumstances. Two, the commission has decided that it will 
print additional ballot papers locally as they are required. 
This process has already begun and so forth. Now what that 
means is the following: In respect of yesterday's special votes 
those special votes will be separately kept at the voting 
station. Spoilt papers, spoilt as a result of the non- affixing 
of a sticker, will be included in that bundle. Those ballot 
papers will be counted in the sense that we will have a full 
tally, counting station by counting station, as to how many 
ballots were spoilt for this reason. 
  Likewise, in respect of the lesser number of voting stations 
where stickers were not available today a similar procedure will 
be applied, and I should add, and I think this should make Chief 
Minister Buthelezi's heart a little happier, in respect of 
foreign votes, where people have written in the IFP a similar 
procedure will be followed. Then we cannot, in terms of the 
Electoral Act, count those ballots, that is technically count 
them, but when ultimately we weigh up the total number of ballot 
papers in respect of which this shortcoming manifests itself, 
and the areas in which the shortcomings were prevalent, the IEC 
will be empowered in terms of the section that I have mentioned, 
Section 47, to take those technically spoilt ballot papers into 
account nevertheless. Whether that means that they will be 
taken at full count value or at a lesser value, I cannot tell 
you. That will depend upon the circumstances as we find them 
towards Saturday or Sunday this week, and in the second instance 
it will also depend upon the spread and the distribution of such 
spoilt ballots. I don't think I can make the point clearer than 
that and I hope it is now fully understood. 
  [Unidentified official] First to Kaiser, then to that lady, 
as I have said. I have noted your hands. 
  [Kaiser] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser from THE STAR. Now you 
told us yesterday that you had been in contact with Chief 
Minister Buthelezi virtually, in your words, on an hourly basis 
and that you have also spoken to the ANC's Cyril Ramaphosa and 
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer and they had 
raised complaints with you. You had also spoken to the 
Democratic Party. Have these parties been in contact with you 
today as well and have they also raised other complaints with 
you, which in your words, would seek to assail the integrity of 
the election? 
  [Kriegler] Well, can I deal with the two barrels of the 
question separately? In the operations room or in a room 
adjacent to the National Operations Center of the IEC, in the 
building where I am sitting, there is a permanent representative 
body of the political parties with whom we are in continuous 
contact. They have the information that comes into the 
operations center at their disposal and I spent several hours 
with them during the tense period this morning. During the rest 
of the morning other representatives of the IEC are there. I 
have seen or spoken to, on the telephone today -- I would think 
probably half a dozen political leaders -- and generally, the 
communications have been concerns or complaints, if you wish, 
with regard to particular voting stations, particular features 
at particular voting stations, and that's the very purpose of 
having this continuous consultation. The complaints are noted. 
They will be taken into account in the eventual evaluation as 
to whether the elections were substantially free and fair, and 
of course, on the more immediate scale they are addressed as a 
matter of urgency by our operations center and our special 
emergency task force. 
  [Official] I will now go over to the lady then I will come 
on 
this side on my right hand side. 
  [Correspondent Marion Wilkinson] I'm Marion Wilkinson from 
THE AUSTRALIAN newspaper. Judge, just going back to the question 
of potential interference in the distribution of the ballot 
papers. You said that you had called in the Commissioner of 
Police. Could you tell us: Was there any specific evidence 
that prompted you to bring in the commissioner and was there any 
evidence of a criminal matter involved? 
  [Kriegler] There was no evidence of any kind indicating a 
possible crime, save that one of the inferences that could be 
drawn from the shortage of ballot papers on such a widespread 
scale, was obviously that somebody had tampered with the 
supplies and that is why we, in consultation with the parties, 
decided: call in the most expert investigative branch in the 
country, namely the police, and ask them to pursue the matter. 
There was no clue, no specific pointer to criminality at all, 
let alone any particular kind. [sentence as heard] It was just 
one of the possible inferences to be drawn from the totality of 
the facts. 
  [Official The gentleman here, second row. 
  [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] Yes, I'm Sonny Raboch of Radio 
Nigeria. The events that....[pauses] In view of the number of 
ballot papers being printed now, is there likelihood that by 
tomorrow voting will not have stopped and looking at the 
situation where the IEC might say: Voting should continue on 
Friday. Will that be public holiday? [laughter] To what extent 
will the need to carry on voting affect the due process of 
electioneering here? 
  [Kriegler] Well, you asked me two questions and the first is 
based on a premise with which I do not agree. I do not agree 
that there is any necessity to consider Friday as an additional 
voting day. The evidence as it stands at the moment indicates 
that the overwhelming majority of voters presented themselves at 
the voting stations today, and it is a question of supplying the 
ballot papers in sufficient numbers and speeding up the process 
sufficiently and stretching the hours sufficiently to 
accommodate them. With regard to the possible prejudice to the 
freeness and fairness of the election, the only feature that I 
can see is that possibly, electoral officers and presiding 
officers and other agencies of the IEC may become very tired but 
that's just the price we've got to pay for wanting to be part of 
this glorious experiment in democracy. 
  [Official] The gentleman there. 
  [Correspondent Enoch Sexwale] I'm Enoch Sexwale of NEW 
NATION. Judge, you've been saying all along that all was okay, 
you're ready for elections, and now we have this problem of the 
Inkatha sticker. Surely it's going to raise dust. It's amazing 
that in Katlehong where I now come from there are no ballot 
papers as yet. Can you be more specific? What went wrong? 
  [Kriegler] Let's get a couple of things clear. I have made 
it abundantly clear from day one that this is a very, very 
difficult exercise. This election is unique in world history in 
that we are trying to conduct elections for an unknown number of 
people with an unknown distribution, any of whom can arrive at 
any voting station of their choice. We were certainly not so 
stupid as to think that that wasn't a very, very difficult 
exercise. Moreover, we had to provide infinitely more voting 
stations than this country has ever contemplated before and we 
had to do it largely with part-time, short-term employees. We 
never promised anybody a rose garden. I said from day one we 
will give you an adequate, respectable, election, not a 12 
cylinder, super-charged election, you may remember my saying 
that. That still is the position. We have achieved an over 80 
percent success rate as of today. I am satisfied with that 
although I readily accept and acknowledge that the millions of 
people who have not yet been able to vote may have a very, very 
different view on the matter. With regard to Katlehong your 
information is not up to date. They are voting in Katlehong 
right now. 
  [Official] The lady at the top there, then I'll come down. 
I've noted your hands. 
  [Correspondent Mel Jones] Judge Kriegler, it's Mel Jones 
from CBS News. In the districts where there were problems with 
the sticker for Inkatha, what was told to the voters in those 
districts, firstly. And secondly, is there any indication of 
how widespread this problem actually is? 
  [Kriegler] I cannot tell you as I sit here what was told to 
the voters in any particular voting station. The presiding 
officers have instructions in a case such as that to record what 
their announcement was and how that announcement was carried 
through. That will have to be checked once the ballot papers and 
the reports from the voting stations come in. With regard to 
the distribution or breadth of voting stations in respect of 
which the stickers were still a problem today I cannot be 
specific. I have not got all of that reporting at my fingertips 
at the moment. What I can say is that is significantly less 
than yesterday. But of course, still more than it should have 
been. There should have been none. 
  [Official] The gentleman over there. I've noted your hands. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us what position 
Chief Buthelezi has taken on the sticker question? Has he 
threatened to pull out of the election? 
  [Kriegler] He may well have done so. I have heard no such 
communication, and I may say that if the chief minister were to 
phone me or to speak to me, I would I am sure be able to satisfy 
him that the procedure upon which we have decided will not 
prejudice the IFP. 
  [Official] The lady down here. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] REUTERS News Agency. Judge, can 
you tell us approximately how many people have voted up to now? 
  [Kriegler] No, I'm sorry I can't. 
  [Official] The lady from SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] 
  [Correspondent Karen Mugglestone-Melville] I'd like to know 
where is the position of the IFP on this ballot paper? Is it 
still at the bottom, or is it alphabetical order? 
  [Kriegler] No, no. It is at the foot as it will be on the 
correct ballot papers bearing the affixed sticker. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Gentleman at the top. 
  [Correspondent Mike Suzman] Mike Suzman, FINANCIAL TIMES. 
You were saying earlier those ballot that don't have the 
Inkatha sticker properly fixed or written in will be put aside 
at polling stations and counted separately and then you will 
decide at a later stage how to tally those into the final count. 
Do you have any even rough estimates at this stage as to how 
many ballot papers that decision will affect? 
  [Kriegler] I have no idea at the moment. I think what I can 
say with considerable confidence based on the last two days of 
troubleshooting is that it is likely to be considerably less 
than first alarm on the part of political parties would have one 
to believe. But the actual figures we haven't got at the moment 
and will not have until probably some time on Saturday. 
  [Official] Question? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you. Judge Kriegler I'm 
not quite sure whether you touched on this issue, but the 
likelihood that of technically invalid papers is this not going 
to invite cries of unfairness? Have you consulted with the 
leader of the IFP, Dr. Buthelezi, on this issue and what are his 
views? The fact that these technically invalid papers can be 
counted at less than full value, is that not an invitation to 
cries of unfairness? 
  [Kriegler] Yes, and on the other hand it depends who cries 
the unfairness, because the ballot paper which has IFP written 
in it at the foot draws one particular party to the attention of 
the voter, and in terms of the act that paper is technically 
invalid. Similarly, in respect of foreign voting, where we have 
accepted for the purposes of the Section 47 consideration, 
ballot papers with IFP written in actually can be said to favor 
the IFP. We are not trying to squeeze anybody. We are not 
trying to benefit anybody. We are trying to run in difficult 
circumstances the freest and fairest election possible. 
  [Correspondent] Has Dr. Buthelezi been consulted on this? 
What are his views? 
  [Kriegler] No. He has not been consulted and there has been 
no reason to consult him. If there is an objection from the 
Inkatha Freedom Party that objection, in the terms in which it 
is put, will be fully investigated and if necessary will be 
canvassed with the IFP. But I suggest that we wait and see what 
actually transpires eventually. 
  [Official] I will take one more question, ladies and 
gentlemen. The lady on the left. 
  [Unidentfied correspondent] I would like to know how many 
cases are still outstanding in the electoral courts at the 
moment? 
  [Kriegler] No ma'am, I need notice of that question. Quite 
frankly, I haven't got it at my fingertips. I think that you 
could get that information from our press office quite easily. 
  [Offical] Ladies and gentlemen, I will give the gentleman 
there, because he has been trying, and the gentleman here has 
had two opportunities already. [sentence as heard] 
  [Correspondent Stephen Laufer] Thank you very much. Stephen 
Laufer from the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler I 
wonder 
whether we can just come back to this business of the write-in 
for one more minute, and stretch your patience a bit. Why is it 
not possible to say immediately if there is an IFP write-in with 
an X against it it is counted as a valid vote? Is this a 
quantity thing? If there are a hundred thousand of these then 
you will start counting, if there are only twenty thousand 
they'll be regarded as spoiled papers? What is going to be the 
basis of your decision? 
  [Kriegler] Quite clearly it isn't only a quantity thing? 
It's a distribution thing. It's a percentage thing. It is a 
general pattern thing. One will have to look at the thing from 
various angles, statistically, analytically, and eventually in 
common sense to see what does it add up to? Does it mean that 
in a particular voting district where the IFP got five percent 
of the votes which were not technically spoiled we should regard 
those that were filled in with the IFP which add up to five 
percent, as well? Do we take that as five percent? Do we look 
at what happened in the district next door? Do we look at what 
happened in the subregion generally? It is not a purely 
mathematical exercise. In terms of Section 47 of the act we've 
got to weigh a large number of circumstances. It may well be 
that very large numbers come in. As you say a hundred thousand, 
although I must say that would astound me. The likelihood is 
that it will be a very much lesser number than that. 
  [Official] I would like to express our thanks to Judge 
Kriegler and to all of you. Our next update is planned for 7 
o'clock this evening. 
  [Kriegler] Thank you.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC official Kumi Naidoo at IEC </F>
Headquarters, Gallagher Estate -- live, broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Naidoo]... at 3.30 when the chairperson of the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Justice Johann Kriegler 
pointed out that the problems that have been experienced today 
have substantially now -- we have put plans into place to 
actually address them. The purpose of this press conference is 
to actually take you through a few additional updates that have 
come through to us, and also to give you a chance to answer any 
questions that you might have. 
  One of the questions that we were asked earlier today was 
with regard to -- just an overview with regard to special 
voting. At the close of special voting yesterday, this is the 
overall situation as we recorded it. Only 16 percent of the 
3,409 of the voting stations deployed during special voting day 
experienced difficulties, of which 10 percent were major 
difficulties, and 6 percent minor. In 77 percent of the voting 
stations of special voting day, the progress was good, and in 
fact there was a routine general performance. We have some 
updated figures with regard to the overseas voting which I will 
take you through briefly: Argentina, 93; Austria, 405; Brazil, 
89; Bulgaria, 48; Chile, 86; China, 444; the Czech Republic, 
147; Denmark, 126; Finland, 45; France, 803; Gabon, 12; Germany, 
1,637; Greece, 50; India, 69; Italy, 774; Japan, 101; Jordan, 8; 
Korea, 28; Luxembourg, 60; Madagascar, 17; Malaysia, 108; 
Maldives, 149; Mozambique, 959; Namibia, 8,474; Pakistan, 110; 
Paraguay, 38; Russia, 75; Senegal, 8; Singapore, 365; Slovakia, 
17; Swaziland, 3,446; Sweden, 115; Switzerland, 1,089; Thailand, 
215; Turkey, 108; United Kingdom, 7,464; USA, 1,251; Uruguay, 
11; and Zambia, 708. 
  This morning and throughout the day we have been giving you 
updates with regards to reported problems. What we want to 
report now is that a substantial number of these problems have 
been addressed and are at hand, and we also want to report that 
in fact we have received 10,807 reports from voting stations 
around the country during the course of the day which indicate 
there were no hitches with the voting process. 
  There's one specific issue that has come up which we should 
report to you. In the Western Cape, in response to allegations 
by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of partiality by IEC 
officials in the Western Cape, the provincial electoral officer 
of the Western Cape, Mary Burton, has written to the PAC's 
candidate for the provincial premiership, Mrs. Patricia de 
Lille, giving the following assurances: 
  Firstly, presiding officers will be reminded of the need not 
to favor any one party over another. Secondly, the regulations 
dealing with the role and attendance of party agents will be 
strictly adhered to. Thirdly, the perimeters of polling 
stations will be clearly demarcated and the behavior of IEC 
officials strictly monitored, and finally, problems experienced 
with ballot boxes, rods and seals will be dealt with as a matter 
of greatest urgency. Additional monitors and observers will be 
dispatched on Thursday to voting stations identified by Mrs. de 
Lille as problematic. 
  Two commissioners, Mrs. Don Mokhobo and Dr. (Teckley) will 
accompany Mrs. de Lille to a voting station of her choice to 
observe that the measures are being adhered to. We also have a 
minor statement that has come in with regard to the situation in 
Alberton. Some of you have been asking questions with regard to 
that. Ballot papers arrived there four hours ago and are being 
distributed to polling stations and polling was expected to have 
started at 4 o'clock 
  There is further information regarding the supply of 
election 
materials to the East Rand stations. Delamika High School and 
Backen Park Community Center have now received adequate supplies 
of election equipment and are fully operative. Two other 
stations in Katlehong have also opened, we are awaiting names of 
the exact polling stations, and we will update you with these 
details later. The SADF are presently collecting supplies from 
Springs to take to Katlehong. I must point out that this report 
was -- that was the status at 6 o'clock. 
  I think we just want to return to one issue before I open 
the 
floor for discussion, for questions, and that is the issue of 
the IFP stickers, and I think just for clarity, we have been 
requested to read out what directive exactly went out to the 
presiding officers with regard to this matter. And if I can 
just read it out to you, this is the directive that went out 
from the IEC headquarters to presiding officers in the field. 
  It read as follows: Voters wishing to cast their votes for 
the IFP where no stickers were provided for the ballot papers 
have been marking their preference in writing on the ballots. 
The IEC will deal with such ballots in due course in terms of 
Section 47 of the Electoral Act dealing with voting 
irregularities. This section empowers the commission to make 
such determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting 
of irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the 
circumstances. The commission has decided that it will print 
additional ballot papers locally as they are required. This 
process has already begun. The two provinces already being 
addressed are the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and 
Orange Free State. 
  That's what went out to our presiding officers in the field. 
And the status report on this is that the printing is advanced 
and deployment about to begin with the SADF [South African 
Defense Force] providing assistance in this matter. Our 
assessment at this stage is that the difficulties that were 
encountered today are in hand and with our people on the ground 
working through the night, we would be able to have a smooth 
running operation first thing tomorrow morning, and just to note 
that, in many cases several voting stations will be opened 
beyond the 7 o'clock period. OK the floor is now open for 
questions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Naidoo what is the IEC 
doing about the IFP's threat of withdrawing from the election, 
especially from Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi? How is this thing 
addressed, and what's your reaction to it? 
  [Naidoo] The judge and -- Judge Kriegler and the other 
commissioners are presently in dialogue with the representatives 
of political parties. I think what is very important to place 
on record is that the concerns that have been raised by the IFP 
and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi are similar concerns 
that have been raised by the other political parties as well, 
and these are concerns that the IEC also shares in part, and we 
are hoping that in the discussions that will happen tonight we 
would be able to provide greater clarity on the situation, but 
that will have to be forthcoming from the commission itself, and 
we hope to be able to release that shortly. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Naidoo] OK. On the first question with regard to the number 
of problems or concerns that were raised during the course of 
the day, there have been close to 2,000. Most of these were 
regular concerns, like for example, if a monitor did not arrive 
on time that would have been recorded as a problem, as one 
incident. If there were communication problems between a 
monitor at a voting station and the sub-provincial operations 
center, that would also have been recorded as an incident, 
furthermore, if there were equipment problems. All these 
together with more substantive issues such as the problem of 
materials, which has been one of the major problems spoken about 
today. I think what is important to note is that of those 2,000 
plus incident reports, most of them have actually been addressed 
at this stage. With regard to the Inkatha Freedom Party sticker 
at the bottom of the ballot, I think it is quite important that 
we do not read it the way you have read it, and that is that the 
scale of the problem is enormous. I think what -- the 
initiative taken by Judge Kriegler and the commission is to put 
in place an enabling way of dealing with this potential problem, 
and a way in which we can address the problem, particularly at 
the counting stage. It is quite important that we reiterate 
that this statement does not suggest that for example, the 
ballots that are now being presently printed do not have IFP on 
it. It does have IFP at the bottom being printed, and secondly 
it does not suggest that attempts to get the IFP stickers to 
voting stations that at this stage do not have them are not in 
process as well. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Naidoo] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] My information is that originally there were 
88 million ballot papers printed. Now, another 9.3 million have 
been printed. Does this -- Judge Kriegler explained that there 
were some extra ones at some stations that could not be moved to 
other stations -- but, does this mean that 66 million ballot 
papers are stacked up somewhere not being used, or have some of 
these new ballot papers been printed to avoid the problem of the 
Inkatha sticker, because Inkatha will be on the ballot papers? 
Is that perhaps the thinking behind it? 
  [Naidoo] OK. I think you are right. That has been a factor 
that's taken into consideration, that obviously by printing the 
IFP sticker on the ballot it prevents us having to deal with 
trying to get the IFP stickers to the voting stations, but I 
think the other issue has been to ensure that at this time we 
rather have sufficient and excess ballots rather than less. 
  [Correspondent Lulama] Two questions, Mr. Naidoo. The 
first one is, you just rattled through those numbers of the 
special votes. Can we just get a total figure? And then the 
second question is, you said yesterday in one of the briefings 
that the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region was 
not necessarily a priority area, and I mean, in Natal for 
instance couldn't it have been foreseen? I mean, couldn't Natal 
and the PWV region have been made priority areas, especially 
with regard to the dispatching of ballot papers that had 
stickers? 
  [Naidoo] OK. I'll take your second question first, and I am 
very glad that you asked it, because I think that I was quoted 
out of context. Let me first reiterate what I said yesterday. 
What we said yesterday was that most of the problems with 
regard to deployment of materials were being experienced in the 
PWV. In the deployment plan of the IEC with regard to these 
material, we started deploying the materials from outside 
inwards, meaning that inward being the PWV because all the 
materials were in fact procured in the PWV region itself. So I 
think by no ways was anyone suggesting that the PWV wasn't given 
priority. I think just in terms of the deployment plan, it made 
sense to us to start with those outlying areas like the Northern 
Cape and move inwards, and unfortunately they weren't able to 
reach all the PWV locations and some of the other areas in time. 
With regard to the figures, we will make it available to the 
press at the media desk later this evening. 
  [Lulama] OK, my other question, a part of it was, couldn't 
there have been -- couldn't Natal have been the one area in 
which all the ballot papers with stickers on -- couldn't that 
have been the first area in which ballot papers could have been 
dispatched? 
  [Naidoo] OK. I think I need to clarify you on one area, and 
that is, you are suggesting that all the ballot papers with the 
IFP stickers should have been deployed in KwaZulu-Natal first. 
Is that what you are suggesting? OK, I think what needs to be 
clarified is that the way in which the IFP stickers were to be 
put on was as follows: Given the lateness of the entry of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party into the election, and the printing of the 
stickers itself, unfortunately we did not have the time to affix 
those stickers on the ballot papers prior to the ballot papers 
themselves leaving for the voting stations. So in the end we 
couldn't do it centrally, and what we needed to do was to 
appoint a voting officer in each voting station who was 
responsible for the specialised tasks of affixing this sticker 
on. So there were no ballot papers that left centrally with the 
IFP sticker on. All the affixng of the IFP stickers took place 
at voting station level. I am glad that you asked the question 
because I think that matter needed clarification. Sorry, there's 
the gentleman behind Lulama? 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. I was wondering whether you can 
explain to us why it hadn't been possible to have a contingency 
plan for the kind of situation that you encountered on the East 
Rand today? I mean, it's not a long drive to IEC headquarters. 
Why was it not possible for people to get into cars and go over 
there and get the equipment and go back and have the polling 
stations open within an hour? 
  [Naidoo] I think that the assessment of how the deployment 
is 
going -- the problems actually surfaced fairly late. We had 
anticipated that things would flow much more smoothly than they 
did, and that the supplies at the central deployment office, 
which is not in central Johannesburg, had been deployed out to 
the regions and to PWV sub-provincial regions, and we had 
anticipated that in fact there was sufficient supplies at PWV 
sub-provincial level, and hence the difficulty has been that the 
provision as -- particularly with the ballot papers -- just 
wasn't there and hence we have to produce more ballot papers. 
And I think in the main today the problem has been with ballot 
papers themselves in the PWV. 
  [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] I think we can all say that 
we don't want the IEC to fail, but I sense that there is an 
enormous amount of frustration both as reflected in media 
reports and public calls to radio, that people don't understand 
what is happening and they feel they are not getting direct 
responses from the IEC. I think this latest thing on the IFP 
stickers, the quoting of Section 47, is enormously fuzzy for 
anyone out there to understand, plus, it doesn't address the 
very obvious issue of illiteracy and the inability of people to 
write the IFP as a party onto the ballot paper. And I think the 
overwhelming sense of people who have been frustrated today is 
that their frustrations are not being answered and have not been 
not addressed, and no one is saying yes, this is the scale of 
the problem. For example, what is the scale of the IFP sticker 
problem? How many stations were affected, how many ballots were 
affected? I do feel that we are not getting the answers and 
perhaps we want to know why? 
  [Naidoo] I think it has been difficult to track the scale of 
the problem. It certaintly is not the intention of the IEC to 
deliberately withhold information from either the voters or the 
media. It has been a difficult situation in those areas that 
you've actually mentioned, and we have been attempting to assess 
the situation. In some cases I think its just been very 
difficult to get information on time and to process it 
sufficiently so that we can provide verified information to the 
press. I think the important point, generally, that we would 
like to make is that in fact yesterday, from the moment the 
special voting started, there were several rumors that almost 
became fact, in terms of the number of polling stations that had 
been occupied. Many of you would have heard of the Settlers Way 
example that was running for about two hours, so much so that we 
were confused as to whether it really was happening or not. 
This morning I can point to several members in the audience who 
came up to me and said: have you heard of this bomb blast in 
Rosebank and etc., etc. And I think generally our apparoach in 
terms of responding to the various problems has been one of 
caution, and one in which we are seeking to get absolute 
verification before we commit ourselves to a position. I think 
it wuld be undesirable for us to say that we are sure that there 
are X- number of IFP sticker problems when we are at this stage 
not able to verify it. So I think at the moment we do, we 
certainly would. I think it's also important that we make the 
point that we are certainly as concerned about the problems as 
the political parties and the community at large. Yes. We also 
want to place on record our appreciation for the fact that 
millions of voters actually conduct themselves with absolute 
patience, with understanding, and even though there have been 
frustrations, I think it's been remarkable, the level of 
patience and understanding that has been exhibited by the voters. 
  [Naidoo] The other point that we also want to make is that 
-- I don't want to, maybe for those of you who weren't at the 
earlier press conference I should just give you a statistic on a 
provincial by provincial basis in terms of the extent of the 
success, in terms of the operation of the voting stations in the 
different provinces. I can take you through that very quickly, 
because I think some of you missed that at the last press 
conference. In the Western Cape we are recording a 94 percent 
fully normal operational voting station situation, in the 
Eastern Cape 80 percent, in the Northern Cape 100 percent, in 
KwaZulu-Natal 75 percent, in Orange Free State 87 percent, in 
Eastern Transvaal 80 percent, in Northern Transvaal 75 percent, 
in the North West 95 percent, and in the PWV 70 percent. These 
figures were calculated at 5.30 PM this afternoon. Some of 
them, most of them have actually increased. The one, the two 
areas where there has been a decrease has been in the OFS 
[Orange Free State] and the Eastern Transvaal. [program switches 
back to studio] 
  [Announcer Penny Smythe] We have to leave the press 
conference at Gallagher Estate there. This concludes the 
English broadcast on Channel 1 for Election 94.

  [Text] Johannebsurg April 27 SAPA -- Journalists and 
Independent Election Commission [IEC] spokesman clashed at the 
IEC's Midrand Gallagher Estate headquarters on Wednesday [27 
April] over what was claimed to be the commission's evasiveness 
over its blunders. The row came to a head when a televised press 
conference on polling patterns of the day was ended before 
journalists had completed their questioning. 
  The questions, focusing on the failure of polling stations 
because of material shortages, became sharper when IEC spokesman 
Mr Kumi Naidoo failed to provide statistics and specific answers. 
  Questioners repeatedly said the legalistic jargon in which 
answers were couched did not relate to information continuously 
received by them. 
  Mr Naidoo said the IEC was loath to bind itself to specifics 
before it had verified the data available to it. 
  When the conference was halted at the end of the televised 
slot, journalists objected and demanded that all their questions 
be answered. IEC officials insisted, however, that a further 
press conference would follow in an hour and the questions could 
then be asked.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler in </F>
Johannesburg with foreign and domestic correspondents at IEC 
headquarters at the Gallagher Estate, Midrand; introduction by 
IEC spokesperson Pieter Cronje -- live] 
  [Text] [Cronje] Let me start off by saying that we're 
unfortunately on a tight schedule. Judge Kriegler has some 
other commitments tonight. Thus we have to wind up in 30 
minutes. I'm going to hand over to Judge Kriegler for an 
opening statement, and then I will take your questions. Please 
to facilitate it, introduce yourself and your organization. 
Let's limit it to one question per person, no supplementaries, 
no two double-barreled questions so we give everyone a chance. 
We need to be out by 30 minutes. Judge Kriegler, let me hand 
over to you. 
  [Kriegler] Good evening, Pieter, good evening ladies and 
gentlemen in the auditorium there and to viewers elsewhere. In 
view of the limited time at our disposal I'll be very brief so 
as to allow the maximum time for questions and answers. General 
view of the day -- excellent in parts, good in others, fair in 
others, and downright poor in others. The poor areas, the East 
Rand, some parts of Soweto, some parts of the Eastern Cape, some 
parts of the northern [Orange] Free State, some parts of the 
Northern Transvaal. A breakdown in detail at this stage I have 
in front of me. I'll deal with it if questions are asked about 
it. 
  Generally people stood very, very patiently for very long in 
queues. Some of them fruitlessly. To them the IEC wants to 
extend its apologies and its gratitude for forbearance and their 
patience. In respect of the problem areas, the major constraints 
were shortages of ballot papers, shortages of the marking ink, 
and in some areas shortages of ballot boxes which got 
overstuffed much quicker than we had anticipated because of the 
unusually high turnout. 
  With respect to those three problems, 5.6 million ballot 
papers are being printed tonight and being distributed to the 
problem areas. As I speak to you the first packages -- made up 
packages of ballot papers, both national and provincial are 
being dispatched from our central warehouse here to the East 
Rand and to Soweto, from pour Durban offices particularly up to 
Empangeni to service Northern Natal. 
  With regard to the marking ink, we have ordered and we have 
introduced overnight -- in fact I can't tell you how many 
thousand liters of the fluid, but an ample supply for all voting 
stations that run out. With regard to ballot boxes, we have 
made an arrangement with the political parties and with the post 
office, postal bags lacked and sealed and tagged will be used to 
empty ballot boxes in voting stations so that the ballot boxes 
can be reused. 
  That's as far as the measures being taken at the moment. If 
you ask me will all voting stations be opening tomorrow on time, 
the answer is no. If you ask me will they largely be opening, 
will the majority be opening, the answer is yes. Perhaps not 
sharp at seven, some will be later, it's a question of getting 
the supplies to the voting stations. 
  With regard to the third main issue of the day, Chief 
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's public intimation earlier this 
evening that he and his central committee of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party were considering their position, I have not only been in 
communication telephonically with the chief minister, so has my 
vice chair, I have written him a lengthy letter tonight, I have 
no reason to think that the Inkatha Freedom Party will indeed 
withdraw from the race. I should add that I would regard that 
as a tragedy in the light of the effort that has been put in by 
so many tens of thousands of people. Not only of the IEC and not 
even particularly of the IEC, but of the millions of people who 
stood patiently and waited for this election which they all look 
forward to. It would be a great pity for us to spoil it now. 
That is as far as the opening statement is concerned, if there 
are questions, please. 
  [Cronje] Your questions for the judge. Over there please. 
  [Correspondent Shaun Battersby] Shaun Battersby from the 
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR. Judge, I would like to ask you a 
question about two categories of ballot papers -- those that did 
not bear the sticker of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and yet 
people voted for another party, and secondly, those that did not 
bear the sticker of the IFP and people trying to indicate their 
preference for the IFP by making some kind of a mark on the 
ballot paper. My question in relation to these ballots is, as I 
understand, they will be considered as a special category in 
terms of Section 47 of the Electoral Act, which implies there 
has been some kind of irregularity. My question is that why 
should voters who have gone out, bona fide voters, and voters in 
good faith, for a party -- why should their votes be under any 
question at all - selections for the voters as I understand? 
  [Kriegler] I fully agree with you. They shouldn't be under 
any doubt. In terms of the letter of the Electoral Act those 
ballots have to be regarded as invalid. That's because of the 
letter of the law and it's precisely because the real purpose of 
the election is to test the view of the people, that we will be 
taking the way via Section 47, to take those ballots into 
account in any event. 
  [Cronje] Karen? 
  [Correspondent Karen Rijnaardt] Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT. 
Judge, yesterday there was a high turnout. Could you quantify 
that? How high was it? 
  [Kriegler] I can't give it to you in numbers. I am sorry. 
  [Correspondent Paulo Barnard] Paulo Barnard from Italy. 
Judge, what will happen to the electoral process if Inkatha, 
indeed, pulls out? 
  [Kriegler] The electoral process will proceed. There is in 
any event no way to pull out. They're in the race. They may 
pull out the horse but the race will continue and they'll still 
be in the race. They may come last. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, I'm a little confused as 
to why so many more vote papers have to be printed. I 
understood that 90 ...around about 90 million vote papers were 
printed originally. You're printing now an extra 9.3 million. 
That means that -- it seems an extraordinary high number of 
ballot papers, even if every polling station had twice as many 
ballot...[changes thought] expected people, there ought to have 
been enough polling...ballot papers. Can you explain this? 
  [Kriegler] There are a number of inferences to be drawn from 
the known data at the moment. The first and most probable is 
that the large-scale redistribution of population since the 
census figures entailed that we sent too many ballot papers to 
areas where the population is no longer as dense, and not enough 
to the areas where the population has since increased 
tremendously in density, more particularly in the major 
metropolitan areas. Now you can ... you may well then ask why 
don't you get the ballot papers from where there are too many to 
where there are too few. That's easier said than done. There 
are over 10,000 votings stations, many of them out in the bundu 
[isolated areas], in very, very inaccessible areas, very 
difficult to get to and believe you me, it's not so easy to get 
a presiding officer voluntarily to surrender ballot papers once 
they have been delivered to his voting station. He or she fears 
that there may be a shortage there and they hang on to them. 
That's the most probable. The second most probable inference 
to be drawn from the facts is that we, and everybody else, 
grossly under-calculated or underestimated the population of the 
country. It seems to me a less likely inference. The third 
inference is that there was some major hitch in the distribution 
pattern. That is a less likely probability. There is also a 
possibility that there was a deliberate attempt to upset the 
electoral process by disrupting the distribution process. I 
think that was the least likely of the possibilities but we 
have, in any event, as a precaution and to ensure that our 
activities are examined by an outside agency, invited the 
Commissioner of Police to appoint investigators to check the 
whole of our train of distribution of ballot papers. 
  [Cronje] Linda. 
  [SABC correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh, 
SABC. Judge Kriegler, people are worried about the fact that IFP 
leader is threatening to withdraw from the process. Can you 
divulge to us some of the details -- the letter you've written, 
the conversations you've had with him and his people, just to 
get some indication of what is the IEC doing to try to placate 
the chief minister. 
  [Kriegler] I would very much like to take you into my 
confidence but that would be breaching another one. I can't do 
that. 
  [Cronje] THE STAR please, over there. 
  [Correspondent] Justice Kriegler, I'm from THE STAR 
newspaper. This afternoon when you had (?press) briefing -- 
that there was no need for an extension in the number of voting 
days, and there was no need for voting to continue on Friday, 
but you have said just a few minutes ago that there is a 
possibility again that polls might open later tomorrow than they 
should be opening. Do you still hold the view that there is no 
need at all for the number of voting days to be extended to 
Friday? 
  [Kriegler] I still hold the view that at this stage it is 
not 
necessary to take a decision on that point. However, I want to 
make it perfectly clear that if toward noon tomorrow it is 
apparent that substantial numbers of people will not be able to 
exercise their democratic right, we will most certainly make the 
necessary recommendation to the authorities, but it is only if 
it transpires to be necessary. 
  [Cronje] WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN. 
  [Correspondent Steven Harbor] I'm from WEEKLY MAIL AND 
GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler, I wonder whether you could tell us 
something about the contingency planning that the IEC had in 
place for the possibility that there were going to be situations 
like the ones you encountered this morning, for example, on the 
East Rand, and perhaps as part of that whether you could explain 
to us why it was not possible, with in just a few minutes a 
presiding officer discovering in Katlehong, for example, that he 
didn't have what he needed, to jump in a car and drive over to 
IEC headquarters and get the necessary supply? 
  [Kriegler] Because the necessary supplies were not at IEC 
headquarters. Once we had to provision an extra 600-odd voting 
stations in the Transkei, and approximately an equal number -- I 
think a little more in KwaZulu -- we simply had no reserves at 
head office. We had to provision those voting stations and that 
depleted our reserves. 
  [Cronje] Over there, SOWETAN please. 
  [Correspondent Lola Maluti] Judge Kriegler, I'm Lola Maluti 
from SOWETAN. It would seem that despite your repeated 
utterances that, you know, this is not the IEC's election, you 
know, and that people would have to be patient -- at the end of 
the day people are putting the blame for what is happening at 
the moment squarely on the shoulders of the IEC. Now, with 
regard to the particular program of IFP stickers. Wouldn't it 
have been logical for provisions to be made to service areas 
such as KwaZulu-Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region, where there is a concentration of IFP 
people, in priority, you know, in terms of the other regions. 
  [Kriegler] Madam, let's get one thing quite clear. If we're 
looking for a place to put the blame, I'm not looking for 
anybody else. What went wrong today is the IEC's fault, but 
what I'm saying is the solution does not lie in our hands alone. 
With regard to the stickers, of course you're right and that's 
precisely what we did. That the logistics went wrong at the last 
moment, because of the urgent addition of a number of additional 
packs, in fact 10,000 extra packs of stickers to go to each 
voting station in the country, is unfortunate, but we most 
certainly did look to the provisioning of the voting stations 
where the logistics would be most difficult, communication would 
be most difficult, and of course we couldn't put stickers by 
preference in areas of presumed Inkatha support because that 
would not have been politically impartial. All ballot papers 
throughout the country must have those stickers. 
  [Cronje] Over there please. 
  [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] Judge Kriegler, Dale 
Lautenbach from the PRETORIA NEWS. Reading media reports that 
are coming in hourly and listening to radio stations taking 
calls from people out there, some of whom have had a great 
experience voting, others not, you ran a very upbeat ad at the 
weekend: You're Ready, We're Ready -- Let's Do It. It was an 
encouraging motivation from the IEC. Given the position today a 
lot of frustration out there, a lot of people confused by 
explanations regarding Section 49, and 47, etcetera. Would you 
have to revise the content of that ad, and say actually, in 
retrospect, we weren't ready? 
  [Kriegler] You're quite right, and the appeal at this stage 
is be patient with us, it's your election that we are doing our 
level best to offer you. 
  [Correspondent Mary Hammond] Earlier today you said that 
most 
of the problems had been in the rural areas, and this is because 
you didn't have good communication systems, or transport was 
difficult to those areas. Will the voting in rural areas be 
better tomorrow and have you yet found out ways to sort out 
these problems of communication and transport? 
  [Kriegler] Voting will be better tomorrow. We have not 
resolved all of the problems in communication and transport. We 
never hope to resolve all of them, there are voting stations in 
which we do not have telecommunications. It's just that kind of 
election. 
  [Harbor] Judge Kriegler, simple arithmetic tells us that 
even 
if all the expected voters voted today, there are some 30-35 
million ballot forms unaccounted for. It seems to me the reason, 
the five possible reasons you have given for the missing ballot 
forms cannot explain that many missing forms. It's an 
extraordinary quantity, 30 or 35 million. Surely that can't be 
just misplaced in the wrong station? 
  [Kriegler] No, Mr. Harbor, your arithmetic is not simple, 
it's simplistic. If you take 10,000 voting stations for which 
we have estimated a 3,000 per voting station turnout, plus 1,200 
for safety, you see already that we are well over the figure 
that you seem to have taken as a subtractive in your arithmetic. 
  [Harbor] But those forms are missing. They are not there. 
  [Kriegler] Not missing. You don't know they are missing, and 
I don't think they are missing. I think that they are up there 
in the sticks in 10,000 little voting stations, and I'm 
virtually prepared to put my head on a block that that is the 
ultimate answer. But I can't say that categorically because I 
don't know the facts. But I do not think it advances the public 
interest to make simplistic arithmetic and cast doubt on an 
electoral process that all of us sincerely hope will prove to 
have been a legitimate one. 
  [Correspondent Pierre Claasen] Judge, you have already said 
that you expect things to go better tomorrow, but can you tell 
us whether you think that tomorrow will be sufficient to finish 
off this election? 
  [Kriegler] I think that it should be clear from what I said 
earlier that I can't tell you now what the conclusion will be. 
There was an abnormally high turnout in the whole of the 
country. In some parts of the country which I have identified, 
we have not been able to meet that demand. In many, many other 
areas we did, and at this stage to speak of thinking about a 
general extension in those circumstances would be grossly 
irresponsible. 
  [Correspondent Patrick Ellery] Judge, apart from Chief 
Gatsha 
Buthelezi, have any other political party leaders expressed 
dissatisfaction to you directly for any procedure? If so, who, 
and what have they expressed to you? If not, does that imply 
that the rest of the political parties are quite satisfied with 
the way things are going? 
  [Kriegler] I don't know of a single leader of a political 
party that didn't have a complaint. I would be surprised if it 
were otherwise in the game of politics. There were complaints 
ranging for the trivial to the substantive, namely that a voting 
station did not open in a particular place whereas it should, or 
that the supply of stickers in a particular voting station area 
had not arrived. The gravity of your question as I really 
understand it, has anybody else adopted as firm a stance as 
Chief Minister Buthelezi? The answer is no. In fact the very 
reason why I have to be brief with this interview is that I want 
to go and meet with the representatives of the parties so that 
we can between us see how best to resolve the problems still 
facing the country as a whole. 
  [Correspondent Peet Kruger] Judge, would it be irresponsible 
to talk of a general extension, would it be responsible to talk 
of extensions in specific areas, and if so, what kind of 
extension are you looking at? Simply voting till say 12 o'clock 
tomorrow night or voting on Friday as well? 
  [Kriegler] Obviously both alternatives will have to be 
looked 
at if it proves to be necessary by approximately noon tomorrow. 
They are alternatives. 
  [Correspondent] Judge, you gave us figures earlier for the 
success rates at different polling stations. One of those 
success rates was a 70 percent success rate in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. If I said to you 
that if on the first day of voting there's a 70 percent success 
rate in the most populous region of the country, and on the 
second day of voting this improves to an 80 percent success 
rate, but that is not a free and fair election, would you agree 
with me? 
  [Kriegler] No. 
  [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] We understand that to a 
degree you have to appear confident, but to what extent is the 
entire process under threat, to what extent are you besieged 
right now? 
  [Kriegler] We are certainly facing problems. I am not under 
threat, and I'm not besieged. We have decided problems, we are 
addressing those problems. If we do not resolve them 
satisfactorily, then we may have a crisis. But at the moment, 
certainly not. 
  [Correspondent] These elections -- and I'm looking at this 
from the point of view of somebody who looks at South African 
politics from miles and miles away. If at the end of these 
elections, say 15 percent of the population of South Africa 
could not vote, will that be free and fair? 
  [Kriegler] It would not in itself render it unfree and 
unfair. If that 15 percent were distributed across the whole of 
the country, across all of the constituencies, more or less 
evenly, that would not per se, render the election unfree and 
unfair. However, if it were a selective disadvantaging of 
certain members of the overall electorate, particular sectors 
thereof, it may well result in such a finding being made. 
  [Cronje] Linda. 
  [Van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh again. Linked to the whole 
issue of possible missing votes, there's a rumor floating around 
that there's 22 million ballot papers missing. What would you 
say to that rumor? 
  [Kriegler] Madam, have you been present this evening. I 
thought I've addressed that as fully as it could conceivably be. 
There are not 22 million ballot papers missing. If you want to 
float that rumor some more, do it without my assistance. 
  [Cronje] Harbor? 
  [Harbor] Steven Harbor from the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN 
again. We were given a figure a little earlier in a press 
briefing here, of 70 percent functioning rate of polling 
stations in the PWV region. Turning that around that means that 
30 percent didn't function today. If that remains that way 
tomorrow, are you going to declare the PWV region not free and 
not fair, and if you are required to do that, what then? 
  [Kriegler] First of all I don't accept that it will remain 
the same tomorrow. Secondly, the fact that 30 percent of the 
electorate in a particular area did not manage to vote, if 
spread evenly across that society would not per se render it 
unfree and unfair. If it remains selective as it is at the 
moment, that would be a very serious consideration in the 
evaluation of the PWV election. That is not a disaster. It's 
not a national disaster. The Electoral Act makes express 
provision for what we do then as does the constitution. There 
will have to be a rerun in this particular province within 12 
weeks. 
  [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, if there are no further 
questions could we wind this up by thanking you all for your 
attendance. From the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate, 
thank you. Goodnight.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by IFP President Mangosuthu </F>
Buthelezi in Ulundi on 27 April] 
  [Text] We now cross over to Ulundi for that report that I 
promised earlier on. Gary Alfonso is standing by. 
  [Alfonso] Good evening. We have just returned from a news 
conference with the chief minister of KwaZulu and also the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and 
unfortunately our previous program cut out halfway due to a 
failure of power here, and we hope you can see it at the moment. 
So this is the news conference, as it happened a short while 
ago. It seems there's a crisis looming, the IFP could pull out 
of the elections. That's the scenario. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
said, when he said that the elections are not free and fair in 
this area, and unless something happens, that could change. We 
bring you that news conference as it happened. 
  [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] I think the crisis revolves 
around the IFP stickers, because that has been the case since 
yesterday that many elderly people who queued up in various 
places could not -- I was in Umlazi this morning and also here 
in Ulundi and other places, they are confused as most of our 
people, more than 60 percent I would say are either illiterate 
or semi-literate. They were told that those who support my 
party must go for the bottom, must go for the last party. But 
now we discovered that even in Cape Town people were supplied 
with papers which didn't have the IFP sticker. So there was a 
lot of anger among those people in Cape Town who would have 
liked to vote for the IFP. 
  But now Dr. Mzimela, who is in Johannesburg permanently in 
order to be available to the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission], has just reported to the head of my department that 
a suggestion has been made. It appears as if the IFP stickers 
are really running short, if they are not exhausted -- supplies 
already exhausted. Now that prevents a very serious crisis as 
far as I'm concerned because it seems that a suggestion which in 
fact we rejected on the 19th when we signed the agreement with 
the state president and Mr. Mandela on the basis of which we are 
participating in the elections, when someone suggested that 
people could just write IFP at the bottom. That was out of the 
question, first of all because most of our people are 
illiterate, and secondly, we believe that it interferes also 
with the secrecy of the ballot. 
  So, I have been informed by our information office in 
Durban that in fact such papers, you know, have been completely 
exhausted now. The supplies are exhausted, and if that be the 
case then we are heading for a very serious problem because I 
have already sent a fax letter to Judge Kriegler, as the 
chairman of the IEC. In this letter, I am asking him in fact 
whether we are really trying to foist that option of writing IFP 
at the bottom of the paper, when it was rejected, when it was 
rejected before we signed the agreement on the base of which we 
are participating in the elections, because quite clearly I 
think that I will have to ask for a very special meeting of the 
Central Committee to rule out whether, in fact, we can be part 
of that which is now...[pauses] if that is true, if we are going 
to be part of that, that it's going to be an operation now 
outside of the four corners of the agreement that was made on 
the 19th in Pretoria. So I felt that this matter was serious 
because all of you here are aware that these stickers, from the 
very word go, yesterday, in many parts they were not even 
available. But to actually hear now that the supplies have been 
exhausted completely -- they represent us with a serious ... a 
serious ... a serious crisis, I think, because there is no way 
... there is no way in which we will accept -- I don't know of 
course what the Central Committee will say if I put it to them, 
but as far as I'm concerned we made it clear on the 19th that, 
that was unacceptable, and there is no way in which we can 
accept that today, because quite clearly we would be losers. And 
Judge Kriegler of course was here, on television just now, after 
I had invited you already to come here, and he was saying some 
things about those papers that do not have this or those papers 
where people write IFP could be counted separately and they 
could decide how ... [pauses] what their value is and so on. I 
mean, there is a lot of confusion. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, don't say later that Buthelezi is now 
saying that I told you so. But really, all the difficulties 
that have been reported by some of you in the media that I'm 
being difficult, I'm being obdurate, I'm being stubborn, I'm 
being obstructive arose because I said purely on the basis of 
logistics, I could not see that in fact the 27th was an 
appropriate date because quite frankly, having grown among our 
people, the black people here, and knowing actually that the 
voter education hadn't gone far enough itself, I was very 
skeptical that one could have an election that has any chances 
of being declared free and fair. But nevertheless, in spite of 
the fact that we had only about seven days to campaign, in the 
interest of the country, once the king's matter and the issue of 
the KwaZulu kingdom was sorted then I thought that it would then 
confirm that we're all the names that we've been called, if we 
said that in spite of the fact that that has been sorted out, 
even a special session of parliament has been called, but 
nevertheless we still would not want to participate. [end 
recording] 
  [Alfonso] That's the news conference as it happened here a 
few moments ago here in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly just 
about half a kilometer from here, and maybe it's a bit strong to 
say that the IFP is threatening to pull out of the election if 
one looks at it in a summary sort of way, but it appears more 
that this is a warning from the IFP leader that if the situation 
here on the ground in KwaZulu/Natal where ballot boxes and 
ballot booths and polling stations are sadly lacking in many 
rural areas, if that's not sorted out, then maybe some meeting 
will have to be called with other political leaders to address 
how free and fair this election was. That's what I as a reporter 
read into it.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi by </F>
correspondent Gary Alfonso in Ulundi -- live] 
  [Text] [Alfonso] We are standing here with Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, who has expressed major concern at the fact that this 
election might not be free and fair. Dr. Buthelezi, what 
exactly are your sentiments at the moment about this election? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, at the moment my spirits are down because 
of the problems that we have encountered, and particularly the 
issue of the shortage of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
stickers, because the agreement, after all, that was made on the 
19th -- when the president and Mr. Mandela and myself had that 
discussion in Pretoria, where we made the agreement that we all 
signed -- actually was based on the fact that there would be 
only stickers with the IFP space at the bottom of the ballot 
paper, and that any ballot paper that didn't have a sticker of 
the IFP at the bottom would not be considered to be a valid 
paper, and would be regarded as spoilt. So now I have heard 
rumors that these ballot papers are getting short. But I am 
even more alarmed by the suggestion that is being made that 
people could scribble IFP at the bottom, because that is just 
not acceptable to us, and we reject that totally, because even 
on the 19th that was suggested and it was rejected by us 
completely. 
  [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, is this a warning that you might 
not 
view the election as a free and fair one at the end of the day, 
and that you would have to reconsider all the options you signed 
earlier this month in Pretoria? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, actually, it is not us who broke them, 
because the chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] was actually present when we made those agreements, 
and therefore it is not the IFP breaking these, but otherwise 
it's the IEC that is now deviating. I am not trying to 
apportion blame on them, I know that they are doing a very 
difficult job, but the point is that there is no way in which we 
can agree to what is being suggested now that our people should 
just scribble IFP at the bottom of the paper without the IFP 
sticker, because this has been a complaint of people everywhere, 
even in Cape Town. There are people who wanted to vote me in 
Cape Town. This morning I received some faxes from overseas, 
from Portugal and from America and from someone who has just 
been to London, who wanted to vote for me, but they were told 
that they should scribble my name, and these were white people 
who are even literate and educated, but they refused to do that 
because they say that infringes also the secrecy of the ballot. 
  [Alfonso] So what will it take for you to be happy with 
these 
elections? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, if we have enough stickers, and if the 
dates for the elections are extended. I have heard that, you 
know, tomorrow may be declared a holiday again, but I think that 
is not enough if you take into account that our old folk were 
here yesterday. Before old people were here, indigent people, 
pensioners and sick people were here and they stayed here for 
hours on end, and this is not only here, but everywhere. It has 
happened everywhere that these elderly people, sick people, have 
come and gone home without voting. Just now I have received a 
fax from Vryheid stating the same thing, from Mr. Mentz, you 
know, that in Vryheid they have hundreds and hundreds of these 
old people who didn't vote yesterday, but even today who find 
the situation unsatisfactory. That is why they have sent the 
fax to me. 
  [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, what people throughout the country 
want to know, are you seriously considering pulling out of the 
election if that doesn't happen? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, that is a function of the Central 
Committee, but I think I will have no option myself. If in fact 
they are trying to foist this decision that people should 
scribble the name instead of a sticker, then I will have to call 
a special meeting of the Central Committee because the Central 
Committee has the final word on this. But I think I would be 
duty bound to call that meeting because, quite clearly there is 
no way in which we can accept that. 
  [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much, and we cross 
back to the studio in Johannesburg.

<F P=106> [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk in </F>
Chatsworth, Durban--live; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [SABC announcer Lester Venter] Let's interrupt 
ourselves once again because I think we can get the opinion of 
yet another person. We are flying around the country, and we 
are making excellent contact here. In fact I understand that we 
are in touch with Jennifer Wilson, who is in Chatsworth and has 
Mr. De Klerk, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party 
there. Jennifer is that so. 
  [De Klerk]...and every effort is being made. May of the 
problems are caused by the late entry of the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party], and I am sympathetic towards the problems. I am 
also concerned and critical where things haven't gone as they 
should have gone, but we must seriously consider what will the 
implications be if this election does not succeed. For the 
country it will be bad. The mood of the people is -- they want 
this election to succeed. I want it to succeed and all of us 
must go out of our way to make it succeed and I would call upon 
Chief Minister Buthelezi to be cooperative in that regard and to 
... to advise his people to make use of tomorrow, a full polling 
day, which can stretch over 14, 16, 17 hours if necessary, to 
come and vote. The opportunity is there. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] If other political leaders may 
ask for some extension for voting dates, like, tomorrow is the 
last day -- what would be your advise to them? 
  [De Klerk] Well we have now made tomorrow also a public 
holiday to enable people who couldn't today vote -- without the 
problem of having to get off from work -- to do so also 
tomorrow. And I've been assured by Judge Kriegler and by others 
that I consulted, inter alia, also Mr. Mandela, that that 
concession, because it is a very late stage to call a public 
holiday, will facilitate the position of people to vote to a 
great extent, and with the extension of the hours, I think it 
will be possible for everybody to vote. 
  [Correspondent] The other complaint from Chief Buthelezi 
was that in some other KwaZulu areas, in rural areas, where he 
has got strong support, the voting booths were not installed in 
those areas. Are you looking forward to have some of the voting 
stations -- with discussions from...[pauses] after discussing 
with the IEC to you have those voting booths in that... 
  [De Klerk, interrupting] Well I've been supportive of it all 
along. Chief Buthelezi is of course in charge of most 
government buildings and semi-government buildings in 
KwaZulu-Natal, and I know that he said all magistrate's courts 
will be made available, and I have no problem if...if they open 
up new polling booths or if they bring in more mobile polling 
booths. I've received such a letter yesterday from Chief 
Minister Buthelezi and I asked Minister Schutte, the Minister of 
the Interior, to be as helpful as he can and to go out of his 
way. We must, if we cannot have a hundred percent-perfect 
election, I think we must go for having a 95-percent or a 
96-percent perfect election. This is the first time ever for 
many people. The fact of the matter is that at a certain stage 
there was a lack of cooperation, although it was offered, it was 
very cool and very reserved from within KwaZulu, with regard to 
their establishment, so everything which had to be done there 
was almost crisis management. It had a crash course element to 
it, and when he entered the election he knew it would be like 
that, because of his late entry and because of the late full 
cooperation between all the instances. My attitude is, and I 
think that should be the attitude of all South African leaders, 
is that we must exhort our people to use their opportunity and 
we must be helpful in overcoming whatever problems are remaining 
with regard to the operation of the election. We must make this 
election succeed. 
  [SABC correspondent Jennifer Wilson] Sir, in the meantime, 
our TV 1 viewers have joined us live on air. Could you repeat 
for us, your reaction to the Chief Minister's threat to withdraw 
from the elections? 
  [De Klerk] I am deeply concerned about the threat. I don't 
think that any political leader should at this stage of the 
election make such threats. All the legal avenues will be open 
afterwards to contest the election for somebody who would like 
to. My attitude is a positive and a constructive one. There is 
a full day left for voting, a full evening because hours, 
wherever there is a need, will be extended late into the night. 
A full day tomorrow, and already I have been given the 
assurance that, if there are people outside waiting to vote at 
7PM, the booths won't close. It will carry on even if it is 
late into the night to allow everybody to vote, and what should 
now be done is that all leaders should advise their followers, 
should actually motivate their followers to make use of this 
full day during which each and every South African has an 
opportunity to bring out his or her vote. 
  [Wilson] We've just had a situation here where they actually 
ran out of stickers. So what happens if that occurs throughout 
the rest of the country? 
  [De Klerk] Well, the fact is that they have proof that they 
are getting better because they didn't wait long for the 
replacements. The stickers are here, the people are voting again 
and they'll stay beyond the hours. Yes, it asks some sacrifice 
of the people who are standing in long queues and I am 
tremendously impressed by the way in which South Africans have 
shown patience. This election is the most historic event, 
maybe, in the history of South Africa. Let us not grouse and be 
difficult about the dots on the I and the strokes on the T. Let 
us look at the larger picture. We must make this election 
succeed. That is my message to my supporters. That is my call 
on all other political leaders, that they should also ask the 
same of their supporters. 
  [Wilson] Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
  [De Klerk] Thank you. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is there any possibility of the 
voting being extended to Friday? 
  [De Klerk] I think it would be very difficult to do so. If 
circumstances arise that there's a great percentage of the 
voters who have not been able to vote because of logistical 
problems, not because they were lazy but because of logistical 
problems, then one will be forced to look at it, but I think we 
should rather solve it through the extension of voting hours, 
and there's a full day left as I have said, and it can go on 
through to midnight tomorrow evening. Let us rather finish it 
now. There's a grave risk should we extend it. It has not been 
planned in advance -- of that also running into serious trouble 
-- and I've discussed this with Judge Kriegler, and he agreed 
with me. I discussed it with Mr. Mandela and he agreed with me 
that we should do our level best to avoid at all cost extension 
to Friday. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the ANC is 
already predicting a sweeping victory in all nine provinces, 
including the so-called marginal areas in Natal and Western Cape 
and northern Cape. How do you feel about the chances in Natal 
... 
  [SABC announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] Yes, indeed 
well 
we'll leave that conversation and those interviews there with 
Mr. de Klerk, leader of the National Party and we are crossing 
straightaway to Nyaka Sofako who is at an ANC press conference 
on the same subject.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi -- </F>
live; monitored in progress] 
  [Text] [Buthelezi] ...the letter that I received from the 
judge. The judge phoned me yesterday, and he also sent me a 
letter promising that the ballots would be sent this morning, 
etc. And I think there's been a distortion, of course, in the 
media about my statement yesterday when I said that if the 
ballot hasn't got the sticker for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] and people use it in spite of that, that would be an 
infringement of the agreement that we made on the 19th, which 
took place when we met with Mr. Mandela, and Mr. de Klerk in 
Pretoria, and that therefore if that is done in spite of, and 
also the insistence that people must write their names instead 
of insisting on the sticker, I said that I would place before 
the Central Committee and propose that we perhaps pull out of 
the elections. 
  But I think there is a mistake now because it seems that 
some 
people in the media say that I threatened. By making a 
statement like that that I threatened to pull out, I have no 
intention of pulling out. But quite clearly I mean if these 
very glaring things continue then I have to call a meeting with 
the Central Committee, but I've not threatened to pull out as 
appears to be the case. I saw a headline in one of the papers 
today stating that I, you know, I've threatened that we are 
going to pull out. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] About the holiday Mr. Chief 
Minister, some areas here are still open, do you think in fact 
people didn't know that it was a holiday today? 
  [Buthelezi] No, in fact even the way that was handled, for 
instance, I was told that this was discussed with some of the 
leaders, our leaders, I don't know which ones, but I'm one of 
those that were not consulted. I have no objection to the 
holiday as such, but I think it was really handled in a very 
inapt fashion, because I think all of us should have known, and 
we should have announced to the people that it is in fact a 
holiday.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] hinted on Thursday [28 April] it might not accept 
the outcome of the election, which it said were not free and 
fair. 
  At a news conference in Johannesburg, IFP Transvaal 
political 
director Themba Khoza said: "At the end of the day, we will 
remember this election as embarrassing -- the most embarrassing 
election this country has ever had." 
  He said there were feelings within the IFP that the party 
should either withdraw from the election or declare it unfair 
and not free. The IFP would do everything to avoid this. "Of 
course, we want to save the situation, else there will be chaos." 
  Mr Khoza said the main problem was ballot papers which did 
not include the IFP sticker. "Voters have their identity 
checked and go through the process at the polling stations. But 
at the last stage, when they want to make their cross they find 
no IFP name. Many people went away without making a cross -- 
now they have ink on their hands and cannot vote." 
  Mr Khoza urged IFP supporters to go back to the polls "ink 
or 
no ink" and cast their votes. The Independent Electoral 
Commission would have to accept this. 
  Asked how the IEC would be able to prevent voters who 
supported parties other than the IFP from voting a second time, 
Mr Khoza said: "We are open to suggestion." 
  In addition to the ballot paper problem, IFP supporters were 
being threatened by ANC members at the polls and were 
encountering a hostile attitude from IEC officials, Mr Khoza 
claimed. "Our people are also being tricked into voting for the 
National Party. Officials tell them if there is no IFP name they 
should make the cross at the bottom -- the space reserved for 
the NP." 
  The IEC should have heeded the IFP's request for a 
postponement of the election -- not only to give the party a 
chance to campaign, but to avoid the "inefficiency and chaos" at 
the polls. "We wonder whether or not we should accept the 
outcome of this election. While we have every reason to declare 
this election null and void, we are trying to avoid this by 
making other suggestions. The issue is sensitive and the 
slightest mistake could cost the country dear." 
  While he was "very depressed" at the way the election was 
being run, Mr Khoza said voters' attitude to the IFP was 
impressive. "If the election was based on constituency instead 
of proportional representation, we would be in Parliament 
running the show."

<F P=106> [Report by Solly Liefman] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- An Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] vehicle transporting ballot papers to 
a polling station in Eldorado Park, southwest of Johannesburg, 
was reportedly hijacked on Wednesday [27 April]. Police could 
not comment immediately. It is understood the vehicle was 
hijacked by four men on its way to a polling station at a school 
in the area. 
  The vehicle was later recovered by police, with only four 
boxes of ballot papers. The rest of the papers were missing. 
The IEC men in the vehicle were unhurt. Two men were 
reportedly arrested by police, but this could also not be 
confirmed. IEC officials, escorted by police, went to collect 
more ballot papers. 
  By just before noon on Wednesday, a 3km queue had developed 
at the polling station. Also in the queue were scores of voters 
from nearby squatter settlements and from Soweto and Pimville 
townships, outside Eldorado Park. 
  Voting at the polling station in the coloured area began 
just 
after 7AM.

<F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela at the ANC media </F>
center, Johannesburg, on the "Election 94" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mandela] Fellow South Africans, on Tuesday [26 
April] and yesterday you turned up in hundreds of thousands to 
bring out the vote that we have struggled and waited for so 
long. Unfortunately, many of you had to wait in queues for a 
long time, and some were unable to vote. We salute you for your 
patience and fortitude. The ANC is in constant contact with the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], and problems at polling 
stations are being addressed. 
  We appeal to you not to be discouraged. Where there are 
still problems, please be patient. No one will be denied the 
right to vote. Today is a public holiday. I appeal to all of 
you who have not yet voted to use this opportunity to go to the 
voting stations and exercise your right to vote. Where workers 
have come to work today, I appeal to employers to give them 
whatever time they need to vote. Your vote is sacrosanct. Do 
not allow anyone to take it away from you. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, do you think that 
there's still a large number of people who haven't cast their 
votes? 
  [Mandela] Undoubtedly, because in many areas where blacks 
are 
to be found -- that is, Africans are to be found -- ballot 
papers were either not delivered [one-second break in 
transmission] regrettable if that situation is allowed to 
continue, and a solution must be found to ensure that everybody 
who wanted to vote and was qualified to vote, exercises his vote. 
  I spent a lot of time yesterday discussing with the 
Transitional Executive Council, Mr. de Klerk, as well as the 
Independent Electoral Commission, addressing this problem, 
because it is clear to me that there has been a massive 
sabotage. It is striking that in areas occupied by whites, 
coloreds, and Indians, voting went smoothly. Ballot papers 
arrived on time, although there are one or two cases like 
Alberton and so on, where white areas had problems, but these 
are few and far between. The problem has occurred in African 
areas. It is a situation which is totally unacceptable. We 
have to address it. 
  But I can tell you that I am not alarmed. Apart from the 
fact that it is quite clear that there is this massive sabotage, 
nevertheless we are addressing it, and I think we are going to 
resolve it. And South Africans of all racial groups can look 
forward with hope and joy because we have men and women from all 
sections of our population who are prepared and ready to address 
such shortcomings. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, would you be in favor 
of 
an extension till tomorrow, perhaps, as a practical solution to 
the problem? 
  [Mandela] Absolutely. I think that if we come out today and 
make a statement that in the light of what has happened 
today.... [pauses] Because many people may not be aware that 
today was a public holiday, I think that is a problem, because 
the situation in areas where Africans live is totally different 
from the situation in the cities, where people are literate, 
where they have facilities like television and the radio. 
That's not the position in the African areas. I think that if 
we come out today and announce that tomorrow will be a public 
holiday people, will turn out in large numbers, and we will have 
addressed the question.

  [Text] Cape Town April 28 SAPA -- The allegation by African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela that problems had 
only occured at polling stations where blacks were voting was 
extremely serious and should be backed up by facts, State 
President F W de Klerk said on Thursday [28 April] afternoon. 
"It is a very serious allegation and he will have to back it up 
with facts. As far as I know, he has not provided one single 
fact for that allegation," he said at a press conference at the 
National Party [NP] offices in Cape Town. 
  Mr de Klerk was reacting to an earlier allegation of 
"sabotage" made by Mr Mandela in an interview with SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] television. "The NP has 
complained that the overwhelming majority of Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] officials at grassroots and polling 
station official level have been breaking the rules and have not 
been impartial. We have much to complain about. The IEC is 
sufficiently representative -- and on certain levels loaded in 
favour of the ANC -- of all political parties. I have travelled 
far and wide and have not heard -- apart from specific polling 
stations -- any accusations of malpractice which has the type of 
basis of Mr Mandela's statement. I'm shocked at it."

  [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- Shortly before 7.30AM 
KwaZulu Chief Minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi cast his vote at an Umlazi polling station. 
Few voters at the polling station knew about the IFP leader's 
unannounced arrival and there were only about 50 voters at the 
station. Just before Mr Buthelezi's arrival at Umlazi the 
ballot papers and necessary IFP stickers had been delivered.

<F P=106> [Interview with KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi </F>
by correspondent Caro Kriel and unidentified correspondent at 
Umlazi, Durban -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Kriel] We're back in Umlazi where IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi is still standing by 
for an interview. Mr. Buthelezi, the first thing we'd like to 
know from you is comment. We believe that a bomb has exploded 
at Jan Smuts Airport. We have no further details. It's 
absolutely not clear what has happened. What is your comment? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I'm distressed by it, because I think that 
today should be the dawn of a new South Africa, but I mean, if 
the new South Africa is born, you know, in the midst of bombings 
of the kind that we've seen in the last few days, then that 
doesn't augur well for the future peace and prosperity of this 
country, and therefore I'm extremely distressed that it's 
on-going, even now. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Dr. Buthelezi, what would your 
comment be on the reports that a bomb has exploded at Jan Smuts? 
  [Buthelezi] I'm very distressed by it, because I think that 
it is very tragic that the new South Africa should be born 
amidst the bomb blasts that we have seen in the last few days, 
and I'm distressed because I believe that that doesn't augur 
well for the future of this country, because quite clearly those 
who are doing so mean to destabilize the country, and once the 
country is destabilized, of course, we are not going to get 
prosperity and peace, which are the major objectives, and have 
been major objectives of our struggle. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think the police are doing more to 
arrest the perpetrators of this latest violence? 
  [Buthelezi] It's very difficult to judge them because I 
think 
that, very unwisely, Mr. de Klerk declared a state of emergency 
in this region, and therefore I think the police as such, and 
all the security forces, are spread very thinly on top, because 
some of them are here in Natal and KwaZulu, whereas, in fact, 
because of the political problems they have really abandoned 
their ordinary policing work to concentrate on the political 
problems, and the political violence, and therefore I wouldn't 
be judgmental and say that they are not doing enough, because 
I'm a realist. I realize that, you know, human beings, such a 
number of human beings can do just so much, and no more. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, who is responsible for 
this? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I really would be a prophet to say so. I 
wish I knew who did it, in fact. Just like you, I won't know 
that until one person is arrested, indicating from what group he 
comes. I've no idea.

<F P=106> [Interview with State President F.W. de Klerk and Marike de </F>
Klerk by SABC correspondent Conrad Burke at Arcadia, Pretoria -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Burke] Good morning, Mr. de Klerk. Good morning, 
Mrs. de Klerk. If you could share some thoughts with us on this 
historic day, really. People are buoyant here. 
  [F.W. de Klerk] It's a great day for South Africa. It is the 
day that we have been working for, for more than five years, 
really, but specifically, since I became president, I started to 
work for this day. We promised this day to the people, and with 
the help, through negotiation, also of others, we've achieved 
what we set out to achieve. Today is the beginning, really, of 
a new era. Yesterday already augured it in, but today all South 
Africans are flooding to the polls. I'm glad that there is such 
enthusiasm. It augurs well for the future. It will ensure that 
this government of national unity will be fully representative 
of all the people, and that those who boycott this election will 
be clearly identified as a very small minority. It will forge, 
also, all the people into the nationhood which we need to build. 
I'm confident that the next five years will be five formative 
years, in which South Africa will establish itself as a country, 
which offers great hope to all its people. 
  [Burke, in Afrikaans] A word from you, Mrs. de Klerk? 
  [Marike de Klerk, in Afrikaans] It's a wonderful day to be 
voting for the new South Africa. We hope that in the new South 
Africa we will be able to maintain the values which we have 
cherished up to now as very important, our cultural values, our 
family values, our religious values, and that there will be room 
in the new South Africa for everyone. 
  [Burke] Mr. De Klerk, you've always voted here at Arcadia. 
Has it got a special place in your heart? 
  [De Klerk] Well, I'm voting as a citizen today, not 
president. Everybody's vote counts exactly in the same manner 
and has the same weight. This is the nearest polling booth to 
where I live, to where I work. I've always voted here since I 
became president and a minister. I also live near here, and I 
decided not to make too big a show, and to vote where it would 
be natural for me to vote, and not make a roadshow out of it.

<F P=106> [News conference by State President F. W. de Klerk in </F>
Pretoria -- live] 
  [Text] [De Klerk] Ladies and gentlemen, having visited a 
number of polling stations and having been fully informed about 
the electoral process this morning, I can say that one is glad 
to be able to say that at the biggest percentage of all polling 
stations things are going well. 
  However, logistical problems are experienced at quite a 
number of.... [pauses] I would like to call upon, first, all my 
followers, but also all South Africans to please be patient and 
to assure that they bring out their vote. The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] -- I've just spoken to Judge Kriegler 
-- they're doing their level best to solve the logistical 
problems. They have all sorts of contingency plans in order. 
The government is rendering full assistance with regard to all 
the requests that we've received from them. Planes will be made 
available, helicopters, to deliver polling papers wherever 
there's a shortage. 
  What is necessary is that we now stick to it, and that we 
exercise patience. We have received requests to declare 
tomorrow also a public holiday. I am sympathetically looking at 
that request, but we are at the moment talking to organized 
business in order to also get their views with regard to the 
implications. If that can help to solve the problem, we will 
sympathetically consider it, and an announcement may be made 
later this afternoon. 
  The National Party will render its full assistance to the 
IEC 
in trying to solve the logistical problems, and the IEC need, I 
think, the support of all the parties. They are in charge of 
the election, but without the support of the parties and the 
public they also have a very difficult task. So let us help, 
let us be helpful, let us cooperate, and let us make use... 
  Can I lastly say that, to the best of my knowledge, extended 
hours is being considered for tonight and, if need be, tomorrow 
evening until very late, so that each and every South African 
willing to bring out a vote can do so. 
  [Unidentified official] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if 
you want to ask your questions, can you just wait for the loud 
speaker. First question? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] the security 
forces involved at the moment in a clamp down on certain party 
elements in the wake of the recent bombing attacks? 
  [De Klerk] Good progress is being made, and the moment they 
fell that announcements with regard to the progress won't 
negatively affect the rest of their investigations, they will do 
so. But I can say positively that progress has been made and is 
continuing at the moment. 
  [Correspondent] Does that mean...[pauses] Has there been 
some 
sort of a clamp down [words in distinct] reportedly have been a 
number of arrests. 
  [De Klerk] We're not talking...[pauses] It depends on how 
you 
define a clamp down. We are bringing the perpetrators of the 
last series of bomb attacks to book, and we are having success 
in doing so. It is not a blind clamp down in any sense of the 
word that people are being arrested just because they are right. 
People are being arrested because they are suspects with regard 
to specific crimes. 
  [Correspondent] We're hearing reports about people being 
told 
that they can't vote because someone in another area can't vote, 
and polling stations being closed, and people being turned away, 
hour after hour, because ballot papers aren't there. Do you 
think that there is a growing perception among many voters that 
this is becoming not a free election, not a fair election? 
  [De Klerk] It is true that in a number of instances, for 
reasons that the IEC can explain to you -- we are not in charge 
of this election, it is being run by an independent agency -- 
that polling papers were not available at a number of polling 
stations, that therefore there was a problem with the 
distribution. 
  It is for those reasons that steps are being considered such 
as lengthening the hours of voting today and tomorrow, such as 
flying in withdrawing ballot papers from certain ballot 
stations, flying it in, delivering it to the places where 
shortages have occurred or where it was delivered late. The IEC 
chairman assured me that they are getting on top of the problem 
with regard to the polling stations where they have problems, 
and I therefore don't think that it will affect the freeness and 
fairness of the election. What is required is patience and 
understanding by the voters negatively affected. 
  [Correspondent] If the far-right feels they are not being 
properly represented, as indicated by the bomb blasts, what can 
a government of national unity do to prevent a situation similar 
to Northern Ireland in the future in this country? 
  [De Klerk] Well, first, I think your premise that the 
far-right can in any way rightfully claim that they not being 
accommodated is a wrong premise, because the Freedom Front [FF] 
is participating, and all the feed-back that I'm getting is that 
in droves, even in areas which used to be totally CP 
[Conservative Party]-dominated, in droves, people who voted for 
the CP in the last election who voted no in the referendum, are 
coming to the polls and they're voting either for us or for the 
FF. 
  Therefore those who are not now participating is really a 
small minority of the far-right, which in itself is a minority 
among the whites, and they're not representative of a large 
group of people. Second, if we have to deal in future with 
elements such as the IRA -- I'm told the IRA is really 
controlled by 300 people; I don't know whether it is true or 
not, but somebody told me that on a visit to England, that it is 
really a handful of people -- then we will have to act very 
firmly against them. It would be terrorism, and we would have 
to take every possible step to assure that they don't 
destabilize the country against the will of 99 percent of all 
South Africans. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] After a string of 
political pardons, could we be assured that if the bombers are 
caught they wouldn't be running free in a matter of a few months 
or a year or two, for political expediency? 
  [De Klerk] Could you just repeat that please? 
  [Correspondent] I said, after a spate of political pardons, 
and people being released for sabotage, can we be assured that 
if these bombers are caught they will not be released in a 
matter of months or a year or two for political expediency? 
  [De Klerk] Well, in terms of the agreed-upon constitution, 
no 
cut-off date with regard to indemnity and releases for political 
crimes can go beyond December 1993. It would therefore require 
an amendment of the constitution with a two-thirds majority of 
Parliament, before that cut-off date can be shifted. 
  [Official] Thank you. The gentleman over there, and after 
that, Conrad Burke. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, reports [words indistinct] 
there were ballot papers in Botswana, for instance, where the 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] sticker was not there [words 
indistinct] If people did use the ballot papers without the IFP 
stickers, would those ballot papers not be regarded as spoiled 
papers? 
  [De Klerk] That question must be directed at the IEC. If you 
want an opinion from me, I would venture to say that they should 
be regarded as spoiled ballot papers. It has also been decided 
by the IEC when the decision was taken that the IFP would be 
accommodated by way of a sticker; that if that sticker is placed 
onto the paper in such a way that it obscures or intrudes on the 
space of any other party, that would also be regarded as a 
spoiled ballot paper. So on the basis of that, I would say yes. 
The IEC, of course, has wide jurisdiction, and one of the 
solutions which could be looked at, where the stickers are not 
available timeously, would be as has been done overseas, to 
allow voter to write the name, IFP, onto a ballot paper and in 
that way to indicate that he or she would like to vote for the 
IFP. But this is a matter in the hands of the IEC. I can only 
offer an opinion. 
  [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Mr. de Klerk, you've been to a 
range of polling stations. Is it your impression that the 
voters have been suitably educated, that they know what's going? 
  [De Klerk] Yes. Wherever I went, I inquired of the persons 
in charge of the polling stations whether they had any 
particular problems, and their reports to me indicated that 
things were going smoothly, and that they did not experience any 
particular difficulties. They were forced to make some 
difficult decisions: people unqualified to vote coming and 
insisting they would like to vote -- that sort of thing 
occurred. But with regard to the problem of illiteracy and so 
on, I get the overall impression that the people in charge are 
being very helpful and that they assist such people. It is 
having an effect, and other factors too, on the tempo of voting, 
and Judge Kriegler said it is going slower than they expected. 
  [Burke] Just to follow up. Have you had any contacts with 
Mr. Mandela? 
  [De Klerk] Yes. I've spoken to him twice in the past hour 
telephonically on this issue, on the request which is supported 
by his party with regard to the declaration of tomorrow as a 
public holiday, and I will, when I take a decision, also 
communicate with him again. 
  [Correspondent] Could you comment on your feelings when the 
flag changed last night? Did you have some feelings at one time 
at least about the old flag? Can you comment on that? 
  [De Klerk] Well, the old flag will always have a special 
place in my heart, but I'm part of the school which rather likes 
the new flag, and I don't have any problem with it.

<F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela after casting his </F>
vote at Ohlange Institute, north of Durban, Natal, on 27 April] 
  [Text] Well, as you might expect, this is, for all South 
Africans, an unforgettable occasion. It is the realization of 
hopes and dreams that we have cherished over decades. The 
dreams of a South Africa which represents all South Africans. 
It is the beginning of a new era. We have moved from an era of 
pessimism, division, limited opportunities, turmoil, and 
conflict. We are starting a new era of hope, of reconciliation, 
of nation-building. 
  We sincerely hope that by the mere casting of a vote the 
results will give hope to all South Africans and will make us, 
all South Africans, realize that this is our country, we are one 
nation. 
  Our message is that the basic needs of the masses of the 
people must be addressed: the creation of jobs, of houses, the 
introduction of electricity, building of schools and hospitals, 
providing free, compulsory quality education running water, 
paved roads. 
  These are our priorities, but we are also concerned about 
the 
minorities in the country, especially the white minority. We 
are concerned about giving confidence and security to those who 
are worried that by these changes they are now going to be in a 
disadvantageous position. 
  I again repeat that I have, throughout my life, as I pointed 
out in the Rivonia trial, I have fought very firmly against 
white domination. I have fought very firmly against black 
domination. I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all 
South Africans are equal, where all South Africans work together 
in order to bring about security, peace, and democracy in our 
country. I sincerely hope that the mass media will use its 
powerful position to ensure that democracy is installed in this 
country, and I thank you.

  [By Neil Lewis] 
  [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Eds: this is a partial 
transcript of an interview conducted on Tuesday [26 April] 
afternoon between African National Congress President Nelson 
Mandela and SAPA in the Presidential Suite of a Johannesburg 
hotel. The ANC avers that it is the final press interview before 
the election results are released: 
  SAPA: What are your emotions on the eve of casting a vote? 
  NM: "It is a very exciting moment because it is a 
realisation 
of our hopes and dreams. At last, our sacrifices are bearing 
fruit. (But) what makes one go through a painful period is the 
fact that some of those, who made this day possible, are not 
there to enjoy the fruits of their labour. I am thinking of such 
eminent persons as Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani, Dr Yusuf Dadoo, 
Alex la Guma and others who have sacrificed tremendously to make 
this day possible. I wish I could wake up all of them so that 
together we could celebrate the victory of a struggle which 
lasted for more than eight decades. My feelings are a mixture of 
joy because this day has come, and sadness because some of our 
heroes will not be here to celebrate. But naturally the dominant 
feeling is that of joy, hope and confidence for the future." 
  SAPA: What are the major failures of the ANC's 
electioneering 
campaign? 
  NM: "I don't think in terms of failure...I think in terms of 
success and hope. But one thing is that we have not been able to 
get our people to realise the importance of getting identity 
documents. But (our success has been that) we have rallied 
unprecedented crowds. There is no organisation that has been 
able to organise, rouse such massive support from all sections 
of the population -- `coloureds', Indians and Africans and a 
substantial number of whites in this country. Despite the fact 
that there have been some weaknesses, the dominating factor is 
one of a sterling campaign which puts us in a position to win 
this election if we can resolve the issue of IDs and temporary 
voter cards." 
  SAPA: But polling began this morning (Tuesday), how do you 
hope to resolve the question of IDs? 
  NM: "I was discussing the matter of IDs with Judge (Johann) 
Kriegler (head of the Independent Electoral Commission) about 30 
minutes ago. They are devising plans to deal with this 
situation. They think at least they will be able to provide IDs 
and voter cards for another million people. I also discussed the 
matter this morning with Mr de Klerk to request that the Home 
Affairs Department should not work as they do now, where they 
observe office hours. They must work 24-hours a day. He (Mr de 
Klerk) has undertaken to see to it that this request is 
accommodated." 
  SAPA: What percentage of the 22.7 million voters received by 
the ANC would disappoint you? 
  Nm: "I'm not thinking in terms of disappointment, I'm 
thinking in terms of hope and excitement. There are 22 million 
voters in this country...3.5-million whites, 2-million 
'coloureds', 600,000 Indians. That makes up a total of 6-million 
and even assuming that de Klerk -- which I don't accept -- has 
the support of the majority in these groups, I think the rest of 
the population of South Africa is going to vote overwhelmingly 
for the ANC. In that I include 'coloured', Indians and a 
substantial section of the white community." 
  SAPA: But if the ANC received only 51 per cent of the vote? 
  NM: "As long as that is the result of a free and fair 
election. We have to accept the results of a democratic process, 
which we have established...I would accept that." 
  SAPA: Which individuals across the political spectrum would 
you include in your cabinet of national unity? 
  NM: "I wouldn't do that. It is for each organisation to 
decide who should be in a cabinet of national unity. It would be 
presumptious of me to identify certain people and take on to 
myself a task which should be addressed by the leaders of the 
various organisations that will get five per cent or more of the 
total vote cast in the election. I will be satisfied with what 
(the organisations) give me." 
  SAPA: If an organisation received less than five per cent, 
but you wanted an individual from that party in your cabinet? 
  NM: "Well, that is a matter we will have to discuss with the 
Government of National Unity. Once we have a Government of 
National Unity, whatever problems arise, they are the collective 
responsibility of the entire cabinet of national unity." 
  SAPA: You recently spoke about the church having a 
constitutional role in the country. What type of role for the 
church do you envisage? 
  NM: "Already, we have established what was originally called 
a council of state -- now it is the social and economic council 
-- in which various organisations, traditional leaders, 
religious leaders, women and student bodies and workers will be 
represented. The church and religious groups are going to be 
represented in that body. What I'm stressing is that the church 
is a very powerful organisation, which has played an important 
role in our struggle for democratic changes and it is necessary 
for us to recognise that role. And the church is committed to 
high moral values...the Involvement of the church in government 
will help us to raise moral standards in government -- to a new 
democratic government, one of whose purposes is to wipe away 
corruption and to ensure that government is clean. These are 
things in which religious organisations can play a key and 
pivotal role." 
  SAPA: Will this mean religious leaders in cabinet? 
  NM: "Now that will depend on how my organisation and 
colleagues welcome this idea. My own view is that we should not 
put in government people who have not been democratically 
elected. But I am concerned with the fact that they (church 
leaders) should have a positive contribution proportionate to 
the role they have played and the force they are able to wield. 
I don't think we can deny them the role of having an impact in 
government to ensure the maintenance of high moral standards." 
  SAPA: The whole of Africa is watching...your comment? 
  NM: "I am happy to join those countries of Africa that have 
sucessfully fought for their independence. We are now part of 
that great fraternity and it is in that spirit that we are going 
to look at the problems of Africa." 
  SAPA: And Europe? 
  NM: "The people of Europe have a lot of goodwill for us and 
they have long gone through the period that we are going through 
now. Their experience is going to be very valuable to us. We 
would like them to share that experience with us...also to 
provide us with resources so that we are able to address the 
problems in our country." 
  SAPA: And the us of America? 
  NM: "The United States of America is the leader of the 
democratic world and it is very good that we should remain on 
friendly relations with that country. They have a tradition of 
democratic government. They can also help us in ensuring that a 
democratic government in our country is entrenched."

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by Shaun </F>
Johnson, Kaizer Nyatsumba, Esther Waugh, and Chris Whitfield at 
Mandela's Houghton home on 23 April] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On prospects for a peaceful election </H5>
  [Mandela] I have assurances from both the SAP [South African 
Police] and SADF [South African Defense Force] that they are 
going to be ruthless against anybody who tries to interfere with 
the elections. They have briefed me on detailed plans which 
they are adopting. That does not mean that there will not be 
areas where it will be difficult to (have a free and fair vote), 
because the country is very big. The SADF and SAP may not be 
strong enough to deploy men throughout the country, to cover 
every area. There many be isolated cases where it will not be 
possible for people to vote at all, but generally speaking I am 
convinced from the plans I have seen that we have taken all the 
precautions that are necessary. 
<H5>  On F.W. de Klerk </H5>
  [Mandela] In spite of all the quarrels we've had with Mr. de 
Klerk, he remains quite an interesting chap. He is big. Some 
of our most unpleasant quarrels have been on a one-on-one basis 
-- we've said very cruel things to each other. One of the 
things that (angered) me was the fact that he did not use his 
capacity to stop the violence, when he could do so. This was 
the major cause of conflict between us, but he has the capacity 
of quarreling with you, and the next moment shaking hands and 
sitting down to coffee. I don't think we're going to have 
trouble from Mr. de Klerk. I think we're going to work with him 
very smoothly. 
<H5>  On the mood of the country </H5>
  [Mandela] The people have high expectations and though we 
have warned them repeatedly that to address their basic needs is 
going to take years, nevertheless there are those expectations. 
It is something we must warn against. But the dominating thing 
is that we are entering a very exciting period and we are 
approaching that with real enthusiasm -- spirits are high. 
There's been a shift in the country's mood from fear to 
excitement. My impression is of a feeling of hope. 
<H5>  On fears of post-election anarchy </H5>
  [Mandela] There have been prophets of doom suggesting that 
after April 29, our people are going to run riot attacking 
property and individuals and that there is going to be chaos. I 
don't think so. I've been warning against that. People must 
not concentrate very much on what happened in Bophuthatswana. I 
condemned that in the strongest terms. I said if we find any 
member of the ANC to be involved in such activities, we will 
expel him because we don't want criminals in our organisation. 
So now we are taking precautions to ensure that our people are 
properly informed as to how to behave if we manage to be 
victorious in this election. Our people have written to all the 
regional executive committees indicating programmes in which our 
people should be involved, so they should not think in terms of 
looting and other forms of lawlessness. 
<H5>  On the future of whites </H5>
  [Mandela] We attach a great deal of importance to whites. In 
spite of all the criticism we have made about apartheid, the 
reality is that whites have had opportunities we have not had. 
They have had education, they have got knowledge, skills and 
expertise. We want that knowledge and expertise now that we are 
building our country. That is why I have appealed to them 
repeatedly not to leave the country at this particular moment, 
and even to ask those who have left to come back. Because we 
are going to need them, we are gong to rely on them. 
<H5>  On the Government of National Unity [GNU] </H5>
  [Mandela] We bring different approaches. De Klerk is brining 
the approach of an Afrikaner whose community has been dominant, 
specially since 1948. I bring into the GNU the tradition of a 
freedom fighter who has struggled against apartheid. I think we 
will be able to resolve the gap between the two of us. 
Especially because we will not be alone. We have a very good 
team from the ANC and from the NP [National Party]. There are 
men in the NP who are prepared to serve South Africa, very 
sincerely. So we must not concentrate on two people. 
  Organisations are not run by individuals, they are run by a 
team of men and women. We've got highly talented people like 
Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa. And strangely enough, in spite 
of the perceptions, a chap like Kobie Coetsee, people like Roelf 
Meyer -- what their record has been in the past. I don't think 
there are going to be such sharp differences as to paralyse 
government. 
<H5>  On the toughest challenges ahead </H5>
  [Mandela] We are faced with two problems. We are committed 
to form a Government of National Unity which brings in those 
people who for 46 years applied apartheid. We are bringing 
their conservatism into the GNU. That is one problem. 
  We have another coming from the liberation movement -- our 
people who have been brought up against the legacy of resistance 
and who, at a time when they should now be upfront in addressing 
the problems of the country (and be) preparing to govern, still 
think in terms of resistance, and oppose everything that comes 
from the other side. They are not yet attuned to addressing 
problems. 
<H5>  On national reconciliation </H5>
  [Mandela] The leadership should not now be engaged in 
fighting talk. We have made the breakthrough (with the IFP) and 
it is hoped that leaders...will have a better chance of uniting 
the country. What is encouraging is the emergence of men and 
women from all racial groups who are bound in their common 
loyalty and common love for their common fatherland. That is 
what we should be emphasising. Healing the wounds of the past, 
not opening wounds at this critical moment. I have been saying 
(to my followers) throughout this election: do not disrupt the 
meetings of other political organisations. Remember that these 
men, although we are fighting an election, we are going to work 
with them in the GNU. 
<H5>  On his acceptance speech </H5>
  [Mandela] It is of course difficult to know what form the 
(acceptance) speech would take, but the question of lawlessness 
is one that should be uppermost in our minds. Because what has 
concerned me throughout are the concerns of the minorities. 
Whenever there is a transformation in any country, the 
minorities are worried about their positions, what is going to 
happen to them and their families. It is worse in this country, 
and it is the duty of the leadership to address those fears and 
to make sure that the minorities feel they are involved in the 
transformation, that they are needed and that they will play 
their role in ensuring that we build the new South Africa. 
There's not going to be any discrimination against any groups. 
It's our task to make sure of that. 
<H5>  On criticism of ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] </H5>
links 
  [Mandela] It is of course difficult to convince people of 
the reality of our alliance with the Communist Party. The 
alliance between the ANC and SACP is based on mutual respect and 
some of the most important contributions have actually been 
made by members of the SACP, people like Joe Slovo and the late 
Chris Hani. They have been so productive in addressing 
problems that the whole question of an alliance between the ANC 
and SACP is a non-issue to us. 
<H5>  On amnesty for security force members </H5>
  [Mandela] This is a very sensitive question. A form of 
indemnity is unavoidable. At the moment here is a great deal of 
insecurity in the SADF, SAP and the civil service. Now we 
cannot even have free and fair elections if we do not get the 
support of the SAP and SADF. It is absolutely necessary for us 
to remove this state of insecurity. 
  I am discussing with (SAP commissioner General Johan van der 
Merwe) this question of indemnity and the question of making 
sure that we have the support of the police, because the people 
who have committed crimes before October 8, 1990, are really 
worried that a new government is going to put them on trial. We 
have gone further to say Parliament will have a discretion to 
grant an indemnity to people who have committed crimes between 
October 8, 1990 and December 6, 1993. We are saying let's 
forget the past, let's think in terms of the present and the 
future. (But) what we cannot do is give indemnity to people who 
after December 1993, have been killing people...We are working 
out details. In Chile for example, people were able to come 
forward and say we did so and so, without publishing their 
names. We (could) then look at what they have done and decide 
whether we should give indemnity. 
<H5>  On amnesty for Chris Hani's killers </H5>
  [Mandela] We have made a statement that we will abolish the 
death sentence, but this is a matter that has to be considered 
very, very carefully. I, as an individual, am against death 
sentence, but the feelings among the people are very strong. 
This is a highly sensitive matter. Our people are very angry, 
especially because of the arrogant statements that were made by 
the wife of (Clive) Derby- Lewis and his attitude in court -- 
that of gloating. 
<H5>  On Chief Buthelezi </H5>
  [Mandela] We have been able to get him to take decisions 
which he never thought he would take. He has (now) made a 
statement in which he said he will respect the result of an 
election. It is a very good statement. 
<H5>  On the ANC's election prospects </H5>
  [Mandela] I have said to our people that our greatest enemy 
is not the NP, it is the ANC itself. Because for us to proceed 
as if we are going to have a landslide victory is more dangerous 
than the opposition from the NP. And we have many problems. A 
surprising number of our people do not have IDs. 
<H5>  On his possible successor </H5>
  [Mandela] We have a lot talent in the ANC. People like Thabo 
Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, Valli Moosa, Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj. 
These are very capable people who stand head and shoulders above 
everybody else. Leaders will come and go but the policy of the 
organisation will continue. It is set in the Freedom Charter. 
It is not individuals that are crucial, it is the organisation. 
I have not the slightest doubt that if the president resigns 
either because of old age, or something happens to him, the 
policies of the organisation will continue. 
<H5>  On the ANC deputy presidency </H5>
  [Mandela] This is a question I have to decide. I have to set 
up the Cabinet and from the angle, I am not going to consult 
anybody. If I am elected, if my party emerges with a majority, 
I will decide who should fill what position. We have a wide 
choice. I can't go into the matter now, but I have an idea of 
who should be the first deputy president, if the ANC wins. It 
is not an easy thing to decide because we have people who have 
so many talents, who deserve that position. My problem is the 
talent that we have. I like all our people. 
<H5>  On possible volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] </H5>
  [Mandela] We have said we will not accept a volkstaat. But 
we have made a concession that, after the election, there can 
be referendum on the question because we would like to hear the 
views of the community on behalf of whom these people say they 
are speaking. We are convinced that they are in a minority but 
we would like that to be demonstrated by democratic means. 
<H5>  On General Viljoen for Cabinet </H5>
  [Mandela] Oh yes. General Viljoen is a very honest man, and 
I would welcome him in a Government of National Unity. It would 
strengthen the government. He may not be so astute politically 
-- he is a soldier -- but he is man of integrity and in all the 
meetings I have had with him I have come out feeling that this 
is a man with whom we can work and solve problems. And the fact 
that he has broken away from the Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front] indicates what a strong personality he is. I have a lot 
of confidence in him. 
<H5>  On his finger-pointing habit </H5>
  [Mandela] Well, I've got this habit of finger-pointing. I 
was warned very strictly that I should avoid that in the debate. 
But a habit that you've had for 75 years is not easy to get rid 
of! And I hope people will accept it in the way in which I mean 
it. I use it not to make a threat, but to emphasise a point. 
When I use the finger, I use it innocently. I regret that I 
reminded people of P.W. Botha.

  [Text] Pretoria April 27 SAPA -- Freedom Front leader 
Constand Viljoen was accompanied by a large group of former 
police and defence force generals when he cast his vote for his 
party at the Voortrekkerhoogte Town Hall on Wednesday [27 
April]. Gen Viljoen told the media that he condemned the Jan 
Smuts Airport bomb blast and urged those responsible to stop the 
bombings and rather vote for the Freedom Front to strengthen the 
party's hand in future negotiations. Gen Viljoen described his 
voting in the country's first ever democratic election as the 
"last possible peaceful way to achieve the goal of 
self-determination".

  [Text] Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock today said there 
had been no attempt by any of the parties in South Africa's 
general election to interfere "in any malign way" with voting 
procedures. 
  Asked if there had been any fiddling Mr. Kinnock, who is 
leading some 20 British parliamentarians acting as monitors and 
observers, said: "We have seen no evidence. Any problems have 
been inadvertent problems of distance or supply or simply 
inexperience. There has been no attempt by any of the parties 
to interfere in any malign way with voting procedures." 
  Mr. Kinnock, whose group has visited 19 polling stations 
over 
several hundred square miles, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme 
that an extension of voting to midnight tonight would be very 
sensible.

<F P=106> [Report by D. Issacson] </F>
  [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] intends to complain to American President Bill Clinton 
about remarks made by a U.S. election monitor on South African 
television on Wednesday [27 April] night. IFP spokesman Ed 
Tillet said the remarks were partisan and uninformed. 
  He said U.S. monitor Nellie Bailey referred to IFP President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi as having "colluded with the racist regime" 
and was also critical of the party's late entry into the 
elections. 
  "We do not expect foreign observers to interfere in South 
Africa's domestic affairs or deliver hostile political judgments 
against any political party or leader during the transition to 
democracy," Mr Tillet said in a statement. 
  The IFP would ask the U.S. ambassador to forward the 
complaint to Mr Clinton.

  [Text] The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, 
has published a list of petroleum products marketing companies 
with tankers found to be involved in the diversion of products 
entrusted to them for delivery to various destinations in the 
country. Addressing newsmen in Lagos today, the acting Group 
Public Affairs General Manager, Mr. Edem Duke, said 
investigations have proved that the products were not delivered 
at the approved stations and that the marketing companies could 
not officially account for the products. 
  [Begin Duke recording] That in our efforts to ensure that 
petroleum products are readily available for Nigerians, 
Nigerians are involved in subverting the efforts of this 
corporation in realizing that objective. You are all aware of 
the fact that there has been accusation and counteraccusation in 
the past. But today we will make bold to provide details to you 
that we have here, a list of 500 tankers carrying petrol which 
is needed by everyone of us -- tankers that are supposed to 
deliver products to all parts of the country. But these tankers 
have been diverted by people who cannot take responsibility for 
them. It is unfortunate that today, most of the major marketers 
have tankers that they employed, or in their employment, 
diverted to God knows where. And everybody sits by and passes 
the buck. 
  There is a list here showing Elf Oil, APPLC [expansion 
unknown], Unipetrol, Mobil Oil, Agip, Total PLC, National, and 
so many independent marketers and this is just the first set of 
500 tankers that are missing and we would like Nigerians to call 
those who should be asked questions to render and account of 
where these tankers are. [end recording]
