  [Text] Yinchuan, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region, a major animal husbandry base in China, has 
concentrated its strength on building ten animal husbandry 
production bases. 
  The bases cover 144 townships and 214 villages. They produce 
respectively 33.2 percent, 30 percent and 80 percent of the 
total meat, eggs and milk of the region. 
  The per capita milk share in the region is three times the 
average level of the country. 
  Ningxia, a Moslem province and one of the five autonomous 
regions inhabited mainly by minority nationalities, also 
attaches importance to relying on science and technology to 
improve its production. 
  The region has put into application over 30 research 
findings 
and items of technology, and developed new breeds of chickens 
and animals. 
  Its chicken-raising industry has a production value of 175 
million yuan (about 21 million U.S. dollars), and milk 
production is ranked among the top in the country. 
  At the same time, the region has invested over 30 million 
yuan (about 3.6 million U.S. dollars) in 37 infrastructure 
projects in the animal husbandry production bases. 
  According to statistics, more than 153,000 ha of grassland 
have been improved. 
  Last year, the region's total output value of animal 
husbandry was 750 million yuan, 4.65 percent up over the 
previous year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- This reporter has 
learned from the relevant department of the Chinese Space 
Technology Research Academy that the "Shijian [Practice] No. 4" 
space probe satellite, launched by China earlier, has been 
running safely in its fixed orbit for two months. All 
logistical systems on the satellite have been operating 
normally, and all payloads for probing the space environment and 
studying environmental effects have obtained important data. 
Currently, all instruments inside the satellite are 
continuously transmitted probing data to the ground. 
  "Shijian No. 4," which was developed by the China Space 
Designing Institute's Beijing Spacecraft General Designing 
Department, was launched to its predetermined orbit with a 
Changzheng [Long March] No. 3 rocket carrier on 8 February. 
After two months of tests in space, instruments inside the 
satellites have functioned normally and have obtained a series 
of useful reference materials. Through tests under adverse 
conditions in synchronous orbit for 20 days, the original data 
put into the "ultraviolet ray erasable and programmable read 
only memory," an instrument for measuring single particle 
effects in space, are totally wiped out by the secondary 
radiation caused by high-energy particles in space. After 
functioning for 19 days, the central processing unit's dynamic 
single particle monitor arrested a serious lock-in effect from 
an instrument inside the satellite. The "lock-in effect" caused 
an "overflow protection" phenomenon in the secondary power 
supply system inside the satellite. After the ground command 
rebooted the instruments, they resumed normal functioning. 
  It is understood that the preliminary results obtained from 
the current space probe can give technical explanations for 
computer breakdowns that occurred previously in satellites. The 
contingency measures taken by the "Shijian No. 4" under special 
circumstances will provide invaluable experiences for improving 
satellite computers' adaptability to the space environment. 
  According to a briefing, since 26 March the "Shijian No. 4" 
flight control group and the Xian Satellite Monitoring and 
Control Center have worked intensively for more than a week and 
used remote-control command to successfully switch the power 
supply system inside the satellite from nickel-cadmium to 
nickel-hydrogen accumulators. Used by China for the first time 
in spacecraft, the nickel-hydrogen accumulator is a kind of 
space energy with great potential.

<F P=106> [By Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Chen Xitong Conducts </F>
Investigation and Study Activities in the Municipal Nonferrous 
Metal Industrial Corporation and Xinyue Copper Tube Plant"] 
  [Excerpts] On 25 March, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, went to the municipal nonferrous 
metal industrial corporation and its subordinate Xinyue copper 
tube plant to investigate and study deficit-halting measures for 
the money-losing enterprises. He stressed: In a sense, halting 
deficits means maintaining stability. So, we should adopt real 
means to treat the problems by looking into both its root cause 
and symptoms, expand the dynamics of the deficit-halting work, 
and accelerate the pace of halting deficits. 
  Participating in the investigation and study activities were 
Wang Baosen, executive vice mayor of the municipality; Duan 
Bingren, member of the standing committee of the municipal party 
committee; Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and leaders 
of the relevant committees, offices, bureaus, banks, and 
Changping County. 
  The nonferrous metal industrial corporation is the largest 
money-losing enterprise of the municipal industrial front. To 
help the municipality's money-losing enterprises halt deficits, 
Chen Xitong established contacts with the nonferrous metal trade 
on a contracted basis and began his investigations first from 
Xinyue copper tube plant. On 25 March, Chen Xitong and his 
party inspected the workshops of the plant, held talks with the 
workers, and gained an understanding of the production and 
management situation. After that, he heard the reports by the 
corporation and plant leaders. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong stressed in his speech: Beijing should submit 
its work to and serve the overall situation of "grasping 
favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale 
of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability" 
as required by the central authorities; and correctly understand 
and handle the relationship of reform, development, and 
stability. At present, the municipality has a large number of 
money-losing enterprises. This tendency, if continues, will 
affect stability. In a sense, grasping deficit-halting work 
means maintaining stability. We must pay high attention to 
this, expand the dynamics of the work, and make real measures 
and opinions. In halting deficits, enterprises should treat the 
problems by looking into both their root causes and symptoms. 
That is, the workers of the enterprises whose production is 
totally or partially suspended should have work to do. By so 
doing, temporary problems will be solved. This means helping 
meet an urgent need. Simultaneously, we should exert great 
efforts to enable money-losing enterprises not only to halt 
deficits but also to be prosperous and well developed. There 
must be a process of eliminating "poverty." Fundamentally 
speaking, we should rely on reform to halt deficits. On the 
premise of increasing economic results, we should first rely on 
markets. We should eliminate the viewpoints of planned economy, 
readjust structures according to market demands, popularize the 
reform experiences gained by the first light industrial bureau, 
and use the favorable opportunities of setting up the market 
economic system to optimize the distribution of production 
factors, including the optimum organization of personnel. It is 
also necessary to carry out various methods, including the 
shareholding system, the joint investment system, the system of 
state ownership and civilian management, and the bankruptcy 
method. The key to carrying out these methods is to emancipate 
the mind, to firmly grasp favorable opportunities, to proceed 
from the actual conditions of Beijing, to expand the dynamics, 
and to accelerate the pace. 
  Chen Xitong also urged plant directors and secretaries of 
the 
money-losing enterprises to be inspired with enthusiasm and to 
unite with the broad masses of staff members and workers to 
spare no efforts and strive to "reduce deficits, strike a 
balance, make slight profits, and make development." On the 
premise of developing production and increasing economic 
results, we should increase the income of the staff and workers 
so that the staff and workers will have expectations and be 
inspired with enthusiasm. Enterprises should strengthen 
internal management and gain internal potential. We should 
positively use foreign capital and strive to enter the 
international market. 
  In his speech, Wang Baosen urged overall departments to 
proceed from stabilizing the overall situation to positively 
help money-losing enterprises halt deficits and increase 
profits. Meanwhile, money-losing enterprises should develop 
products with good economic results and process the materials 
provided by foreign countries. 
  Duan Bingren urged in his speech that the money-losing 
enterprises make good use of their limited funds, rely on their 
own forces, pool the wisdom and efforts of their staff and 
workers, and strive to tide over the difficulties.

theoretical level and more pages than other law publications. 
In the past 10 years, the magazine has closely linked reform 
and opening up with the building of democracy and the legal 
system, and has published nearly 1,000 theses totaling 10 
million characters. The magazine has played a positive role in 
promoting the studies and research of law science circles and 
the legal circles of China in the Marxist science of law and 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, as well as in providing theoretical bases, 
policy-making reference, and public opinion support for building 
democracy and the legal system in China. The magazine is highly 
spoken of by the law science circles and legal circles of China 
and has a considerable influence in foreign countries.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's prisons and 
reform-through-labor camps maintained good order last year, and 
the number of infringements committed by inmates was the lowest 
on record since 1984, an official of the Ministry of Justice 
said today. 
  "Only 1.4 per thousand inmates escaped last year," said Jia 
Jingping, the spokesman for the ministry, adding that the figure 
was one of the lowest in the past 45 years. 
  Jia said the country's judicial bodies made remarkable 
contributions last year in the aspects of reforming criminals to 
become useful persons to society and maintaining social 
stability. 
  He stated that "our ultimate goal is to convert criminals by 
combining punishment and reform." 
  China had more than 1,244,000 prisoners by the end of 1993, 
with 247,000 of them having their terms reduced on account of 
their good behavior in prison. Some 33,000 prisoners were 
released on probation in the same period. 
  Another 34,000 of them were released on bail to receive 
medical treatment, he said. More than 301,000 prisoners were 
set free in 1993 after they had finished their prison terms. 
  Jia said China's education-through-labor centers have also 
strengthened their work in educating, persuading, and saving 
inmates. The inmates are considered to have committed 
comparatively less serious offences. The spokesman said China 
had 153,000 such inmates, including prostitutes and 
drug-addicts, by the end of last year. Some 75,900 of this 
category of offenders were set free after they had finished 
their terms, and 55,800 had their terms reduced for good 
behavior.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (AFP) -- Friends of Tong Yi, the 
secretary of China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, 
expressed concern Wednesday that she had been detained, saying 
she had been missing for two days. 
  Tong has been out of contact since Monday afternoon, when 
police searched Wei's office here and took away many documents 
following the detention of the 43-year-old veteran dissident for 
interrogation about "suspected" new crimes since being released 
from prison in September. 
  "I'm worried she's been detained because I've heard nothing 
from here since the police came to Wei's office," Wei's sister, 
Wei Ling, said by phone, adding Tong usually went to the office 
daily. 
  Hong Kong radio quoted a public security official as saying 
that Tong had been taken in for questioning. Beijing public 
security bureau officials Wednesday denied any knowledge of the 
reported detention. 
  Tong has maintained contact with foreign journalists since 
Wei's nearly 30-hour detention in early March following a 
controversial meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State for 
Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck. The dissident subsequently 
left the capital for a four-week "vacation" in northeast China 
and was picked up by police again as he tried to return to 
Beijing Friday. 
  The Beijing Public Security Department said Tuesday Wei had 
"violated the law on many occasions and is suspected of having 
committed new crimes when he was deprived of his political 
rights and on parole." 
  Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of 
a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in 
the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement. 
  Since his release, he has met frequently with foreign 
journalists and remained outspoken in his advocation of 
democracy.

  [Text] China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, could 
be facing new criminal charges and a possible second prison term 
following his detention by the Beijing public security 
authorities. 
  The official Chinese media announced yesterday that Wei was 
being investigated by the police for what it called "suspected 
new criminal offences." 
  "Wei is being interrogated and placed under surveillance by 
the public security authorities in accordance with the law 
because he violated the law on many occasions and is suspected 
of having committed new crimes while on parole and while being 
deprived of his political rights," Xinhua (the New China News 
Agency) said. 
  "Surveillance," according to the Chinese legal code is a 
form 
of house arrest whereby "the judicial authorities will appoint a 
place for the criminal to live and use forceful measures to 
monitor his freedom of movement." 
  While a court official said Wei was being placed under 
surveillance "where he lived," his family said they had no 
information of his whereabouts. 
  Xinhua did not specify what crimes Wei was suspected of 
committing but it is understood his outspoken criticism of the 
Government and the Communist Party and his contacts with other 
members of the dissident community and foreign journalists could 
provide grounds for new charges. 
  Wei's original 15-year sentence was based on his alleged 
provision of "military secrets" to a foreign journalist and 
engaging in "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement," 
referring to his publications during the Democracy Wall movement 
of the late 1970's. 
  Analysts said that Wei's statements since his release on 
September 14 last year have been just as critical as those made 
during the Democracy Wall period but point out that the 
political climate in Beijing has changed considerably since 1979. 
  Most analysts believe Wei will be kept under surveillance at 
least until the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Beijing massacre 
so that he cannot take part in any new protests. 
  "What happens after that will very much depend on the 
political situation at the time," a diplomat said.

  [Text] Convicted reporter Xi Yang has a fair chance of 
winning his appeal and a cut in his 12-year jail term or even a 
suspended sentence, according to legal experts in Chinese law. 
University lecturer at the City Polytechnic's Faculty of Law, 
Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, said the 12-year sentence Xi received 
was not justified. "Twelve years of imprisonment was only 
qualified for a state secret of absolute confidentiality but we 
cannot see very serious consequences coming from the offence he 
was accused of committing," she said. 
  Therefore, Xi might be able to appeal for a reduction in the 
jail term to under three years and a suspension of the penalty. 
"It is possible. We have dealt with cases before that a Hong 
Kong defendant in China who had been sentenced to life 
imprisonment but had appealed for an immediate release 
successfully," she said. "The fact that Xi was allowed to 
choose a lawyer to represent him in the appeal can be considered 
as a gesture of a way out for him," she said. 
  But she criticised China's definition of "state secret" as 
too loose, and journalists who were not familiar with the legal 
system in China might be trapped. "There are a lot of loopholes 
in Chinese law. `State secrets,' for instance, needs a lot of 
explanation by the court," she said. 
  She also warned the Hong Kong media to be careful when 
covering Xi's case and avoid issues which might be considered 
"sensitive" by Beijing. 
  Another academic, Chang Hsin, of the Chinese University, 
said 
he was shocked when told about Xi's sentence. Mr Chang, who 
taught for many years in the Law Department of Beijing 
University, said Beijing may yield to international pressure and 
cut short Xi's sentence. "I think the authorities might change 
their minds and grant him a successful appeal," he said.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Beverly Chau] </F>
  [Text] Journalists and China's key advisers in Hong Kong 
yesterday kept up the pressure for Beijing to free or at least 
publicise details of the conviction of reporter Xi Yang for 
"stealing state secrets." More than 100 journalists staged a 
demonstration outside the local headquarters of XINHUA (the NEW 
CHINA NEWS AGENCY) as the New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists condemned the conviction as a "flagrant violation" 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
  Xi's father pleaded with local deputies of the Chinese 
National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) for their help in 
calling on the Government to reconsider the case. Xi Linsheng 
has been in hospital for treatment of a heart complaint since 
hearing that his son had been jailed for 12 years. 
  In a letter published in Ming Pao, Xi's employer, the elder 
Mr Xi wrote: "The (heavy sentence) is a severe blow to me and my 
family. It will ruin the whole life of Xi Yang." 
  Local NPC deputies Ng Hong-mun and Cheng Yiutong said they 
would liaise with colleagues, CPPCC deputies and Hong Kong 
Affairs Advisers to jointly seek clarification from the Ministry 
of Justice on what grounds the 12-year sentence had been given. 
They would then decide what to do next. 
  In Beijing, British Ambassador Sir Robin McLaren admitted 
that getting more information through diplomatic channels might 
be the most they could do. There were "limits of what we could 
do" because Xi was not a permanent resident of Hong Kong, he 
said. "We have to be realistic about that." 
  A veteran CPPCC deputy, Xu Simin, said "it was probably 
true" 
that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, head of the People's Bank of 
China, might have insisted on stiff punishment for Xi in a bid 
to defend the authority of the central bank following the 
leakage of bank reform stories. "Not a single banking official 
has been punished for the illegal raising of funds during the 
fiscal chaos last year. If he could give leniency to the banking 
cadres why can't he be lenient towards Xi Yang?" Mr Xu asked. 
"I will certainly grill him if I'm able to see him," he said. 
  In a letter addressed to the Supreme People's Court 
President 
Ren Jianxin, the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong urged Beijing to publish the text of the 
verdict and details of his case quickly to help dispel anxiety 
and worries of people from all walks of life. Signed by 
chairman Tsang Yok-sing, the letter called for leniency towards 
the reporter if he was found to have erroneously violated the 
law in his work. 
  Justice authorities, they said, should also issue guidelines 
on the definition of state secrets given the fact that Hong Kong 
journalists might be able to obtain "state secrets" from proper 
channels while reporting in China. 
  Shocked and saddened by the stiff penalty against Xi, about 
100 local journalists -- about 20 of them from Ming Pao -- 
voiced their concern for a free press in a petition outside 
XINHUA. They demanded the immediate release of Xi in a letter 
addressed to premier Li Peng. 
  An organiser, Lam Manchung from Ming Pao, said the 
encouraging turnout showed that journalists were concerned about 
press freedom and willing to speak up for the victims. Some 
said they wanted to express their fears over the "unjustifiable" 
measures by Beijing to control local press. 
  Ming Pao reporter To Fook-leung said he could not tell what 
was a "state secret" even after seven years of China reporting 
experience. "It is better to have written guidelines," he said. 
The journalists' plea was echoed by the newly-formed 123 
Democratic Alliance. Eighteen members of the group protested 
against the secret trial of Xi.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The Xi Yang case has raised grave questions about 
Beijing's policy on the control of information, the politicised 
justice system, and the stepped-up campaign of intimidation 
against the Hong Kong media. Since the Ming Pao journalist's 
detention on September 27 last year the authorities have never 
supplied evidence to support the claim that Xi had stolen and 
made roundabout inquiries about state financial secrets. There 
is little doubt, however, that the Beijing court could, in 
time-honoured Chinese fashion, justify the incrimination and 
even the 12-year jail term. 
  The key is what constitutes "state secrets," one of the 
murkiest concepts in a very muddled legal framework. The State 
Secret Law stipulates that anything having to do with "state 
security and interests" constitutes a state secret, leaving the 
authorities with arbitrary powers of interpretation. 
  In practice, the administration's definition of "state 
secrets," like those regarding "counter-revolutionary crimes," 
"antigovernment activities" and other aspects of security, is 
based on wartime considerations of the 1930's and 1940's, when 
the fledgling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under threat of 
extinction through persecution by the Kuomintang and the 
warlords. 
  Many in the party are aware these concepts have long become 
obsolete. However, it serves the administration's purpose to 
retain the archaic institutions. In the age of computers and 
mass media, knowledge is power. And the CCP is convinced that 
the less they let the people know about reality -- particularly 
its seamier aspects -- the more secure its hold on power. Thus, 
things every Chinese has a right to know -- ranging from the 
health of patriarch Deng Xiaoping to the shady business deals of 
the offspring of senior cadres -- are "state secrets." The 
system also provides the administration with a handy weapon to 
penalise foreign and Hong Kong journalists who might have got 
hold of information that is too close to the truth. 
  The Xi incident is also disturbing because it provides yet 
another illustration of the politicisation of the judicial 
process. It is an open "state secret" that for major cases, it 
was not the courts but the party Central Committee's Political 
and Legal Commission, the Politburo Standing Committee, and 
sometimes Mr Deng, who made the decision about guilt and the 
kind of punishment to be meted out. It was the patriarch who 
dictated the jail term of dissident Wei Jmgsheng as well as that 
of the principal secretary of ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang, 
Bao Tong, one of whose alleged crimes was "leaking state 
secrets". 
  Mr Deng and politburo heavyweights, including Premier Li 
Peng, had the final say over the treatment accorded the two 
"black hands" in the 1989 democracy movement Wang Juntao and 
Chen Ziming. Before the court cases on the two opened, Mr Li 
had said in internal meetings "the party cannot let the tigers 
go back to the hills." 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin personally looked into the 
circumstances of the "leaking" of his political report to the 
14th Party Congress in October 1992. Xinhua (the New China News 
Agency) editor Wu Shishen, who allegedly supplied the document 
to Hong Kong reporter Leung Waiman, was given a life sentence 
last year. 
  Sources said because the "state secrets" Xi allegedly 
published in Ming Pao were based on an internal address made 
last summer by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to the People's Bank of 
China (PBOC), Zhu was among several heavyweight politicians who 
laid down instructions that the Hong Kong journalist and his 
"informant," PBOC clerk Tian Ye, be mercilessly dealt with. 
  Only the politicised nature of Chinese justice could explain 
the shockingly stiff punishment slapped on Xi and Tian, who got 
15 years last week. Wei was given a 15-year term in 1979 -- 
when China was still recovering from the lawlessness of the 
Cultural Revolution -- for allegedly obtaining military secrets. 
  Bao, who was charged with leaking Politburo decisions to the 
student "rebels" at Tiananmen Square got seven years. 
  The "state secrets" Xi was found guilty of "stealing" were 
reportedly confidential documents concerning Beijing's plans for 
interest rate changes and its policy on international gold 
transactions. According to the better connected among Western 
bankers and brokers in Beijing and Shanghai, similar "state 
secrets" are bandied about on a daily basis in fancy karaoke 
bars in the coastal cities. 
  The severity of Xi's punishment is also obvious when one 
looks at the dozens of Western, Asian, and Taiwan journalists 
who were caught pilfering "state secrets" or engaging in 
"antigovernment activities" since the early 1980's. They were 
either given warnings or kicked out of the country after brief 
periods of detention. None received jail terms. 
  There is no escaping the conclusion that, as Ming Pao, the 
Hong Kong Journalists Association, and other press and human 
rights watchdogs have pointed out, the Xi case is a deliberate 
attempt by the CCP to gag the Hong Kong press. With the growing 
accessibility of satellite and Hong Kong television and other 
forms of broadcasts, news reported by Western and local 
reporters is available to a fast- growing Chinese audience. 
Because of language, culture, and connections, Hong Kong 
reporters have an edge over their Western and Asian colleagues 
in obtaining "state secrets". 
  Even more important is the 1997 factor. At a time when China 
is engaged in psychological warfare with Britain over the hearts 
and minds of Hong Kong, it is in Beijing's interest to ensure 
that, to use a Chinese axiom, the guns of the Hong Kong media 
are pointed in the right direction. After 1997, much of the 
Hong Kong media will become domestic Chinese media. Beijing's 
ideologues and censors are at a loss about policing hundreds of 
irreverent, muckraking Hong Kong newsmen. 
  Beijing's campaign of intimidation against the Hong Kong 
press began, of course, well before the June 4, 1989, crackdown 
in Tiananmen Square. And quite a few local media have already 
exercised ponderous self-restraint. The Xi case shows Beijing 
is not content with self-censorship; what it wants may be total 
control. 
  In a wider context, the Xi affair exposes not only the CCP's 
dubious desire of honouring the "one country, two systems" 
formula but its pledge to loosen its grip over the courts and 
the media. More than the preferential terms offered foreign 
investors, a developing country's track record in press freedom 
is the best gauge of its commitment to modernisation. China, 
along with North Korea, is among the few countries in the world 
still bent on "killing the messenger with unwelcome tidings".

  [Text] Police seized a Chinese student who tried to lay a 
wreath in Tiananmen Square yesterday. The unidentified man 
apparently entered the square -- focus of the 1989 crackdown -- 
at about 11 am. 
  One witness said: "The student was carrying an average-sized 
wreath of the kind used to commemorate the dead." Another said: 
"Police stopped him and requested his identification and he 
immediately produced a university identification card. He was 
then immediately bundled into a waiting police vehicle." 
  Tiananmen Square has been ringed day and night by police 
since Monday. 
  The incident coincided with Ching Ming, when Chinese honour 
their dead, and comes in a period of sensitive anniversaries, 
notably of the April 5, 1976, uprising after Chinese leader Zhou 
Enlai's death, and the April 15, 1989, start of pro-democracy 
protests in Beijing. 
  Police were yesterday keeping a close watch on the families 
of those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. "I haven't been 
able to go out for Ching Ming because there are too many 
police," said the father of one 19-year-old killed in 1989 whose 
urn is in Wanan Cemetery at the foot of the Fragrant Hills. 
"It's not that I'm afraid, just that I don't want trouble and 
the mood is too tense," he said. 
  The families of Tiananmen dead are close to each other and 
take turns visiting the cemeteries. Over Ching Ming, they meet 
and telephone each other. 
  Ding Zilin, a philosophy teacher, goes often to Babaoshan 
and 
Wanan to tend the urns of young people massacred by the Army. 
She lost her only son, Jiang Jielian, 17. But his remains do 
not lie in a cemetery. Mrs Ding, who recently signed an open 
letter demanding democracy and the release of dissidents, keeps 
her son's ashes at home. "For me, Ching Ming is every day," she 
said. 
  Hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents gathered at 
Baboashan Cemetery west of the capital to honour the memory of 
their ancestors. There were also a number of police, uniformed 
and in plain-clothes, carrying still and video cameras and 
portable telephones. 
  Families have been forbidden from burning incense for Ching 
Ming because of official fears the accompanying laments might 
degenerate into slogan chanting against the government. The 
authorities have also been confronted by increasingly active 
dissent, prompting a new wave of repression.

<F P=106> [By Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311): "China's Internally </F>
Circulated Data Reveal Maltreatment of Workers in 
Foreign-Invested Enterprises"] 
  [Text] (Editor's note: This year's February issue of the 
internally circulated CPC magazine NEICAN XUANBIAN [0355 0639 
6693 4882 -- Selected Reports for Internal Reference] includes a 
report by XINHUA reporter Li Niangui which reflects the fact 
that foreign-invested enterprises pay no attention to the safety 
of workers and that the workers are maltreated. The report 
enumerates shocking examples and statistics. We have reprinted 
the report here. Its original title was: Some Foreign-Invested 
Enterprises Seriously Encroach on the Legitimate Rights and 
Interests of Workers.) 
  The meeting of the presidium of the Second Session of the 
12th All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded not 
long ago, analyzed labor relations in foreign-invested 
enterprise and felt deep concern about how some foreign-invested 
enterprises had violated relevant Chinese laws and regulations, 
and had seriously encroached on the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers. It hoped that the departments concerned 
would attach importance to and concern themselves with this 
issue. 
  At present, 153,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been 
approved on the Chinese mainland, of which 47,000 enterprises, 
employing more than five million workers, have been completed 
and put into operation. On the whole, the labor relations in 
foreign- invested enterprises are stable, and most 
foreign-invested enterprises operate and organize production 
according to the law, but there are some quite serious 
labor-relations problems in some foreign-invested enterprises. 
According to surveys recently conducted by the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions, there are five conspicuous problems: 
<H5>  Safety Neglected, Labor Conditions Poor </H5>
  1. The labor and living conditions of workers are very poor. 
Even the most basic labor-protection measures in safety and 
sanitation are lacking. Accidents occur frequently and the 
safety of workers' lives is not guaranteed. Surveys conducted 
by provincial and city trade unions in Guangdong, Fujian, 
Shandong, and Zhejiang show that in many foreign-invested 
enterprises -- especially some labor-intensive enterprises for 
manufacturing plastics, toys, shoes, and textiles -- the 
workshops are crowded with people and equipment, and are hot and 
sultry. The air there is polluted, and the noise far exceeds 
permitted levels. Zhuhai carried out a survey in seven 
foreign-invested enterprises and found that the levels of such 
toxic gases as benzene, toluene, and dimethyl benzene in the air 
exceeded national standards by eight to 10 times. The 
quarantine departments in Xiamen carried out tests on the 
air-borne dust content at 21 points in 11 foreign-invested 
enterprises, and found that permitted standards were exceeded at 
14; air-borne toxic gases were tested at 23 points, at which 
permitted standards were exceeded at 18; and noise volume was 
tested at 69 points, with permitted standards exceeded at 33. A 
nonmetallugical limited company in Fuzhou carried out open 
operations, long- prohibited in China, at its pyrophyllite 
pencil stone crushing section. The dust concentration exceeded 
national standards by more than 100 times. Shenzhen checked the 
health check-up forms of 260 staff and workers in 
foreign-invested enterprises and found that 46 of them suffered 
from anaemia or had abnormalities in white blood cells or blood 
platelets, or had warning indications of other diseases in their 
blood. 
  What is even more serious is that some foreign-invested 
enterprises have ignored production safety, as well as China's 
labor protection laws and regulations. Serious man-made 
industrial accidents occur often and the safety of the workers' 
lives is not ensured. In a tableware company that employs 400 
workers in Xiamen, 38 industrial accidents have occurred since 
it started operation four years ago and 39 workers had their 
fingers crushed. Recently, two large fires occurred in Shenzhen 
and Fuzhou in less than a month, resulting in the deaths of 144 
people. 

<H5>    Insult, Punishment, and Beating </H5>
  2. Workers are insulted, punished, or beaten, and their 
personal rights are encroached upon at will. Some 
foreign-invested enterprises do not respect minimum human 
rights, ignore China's laws, and use extremely brutal and 
backward management methods. Some enterprises have established 
rules forbidding workers to go to the toilet, to drink water, or 
to see doctors during work hours, and offenders are asked to 
stand before the others wearing a placard. A shoe plant in 
Putian, Fujian, punishes workers by asking them to stand in the 
rain, stand in the sun, or leap like frogs. A foreign 
management supervisor at the Shenmei Household Necessities 
Company in Shenyang found that a glass item had not been cleaned 
properly. He went as far as forcing the worker concerned to lick 
it with his tongue. A Taiwan businessman in Guangdong even 
punished several dozen members of a work team for a mistake made 
by only one of them, asking them to kneel on the floor. In 
1993, case after case of male "security" personnel illegally 
searching women workers were found in Tianjin and Qingdao. A 
restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Shanghai once even 
illegally asked women workers to take off all their clothes 
during a search. Some foreign-invested enterprises even 
employed "supervisors" and "foremen" to serve as roughnecks. 
<H5>  Working Extra Hours </H5>
  3. Workers are compelled to work extra hours and labor 
quotas are set beyond the bodily strength of the workers. The 
eight-hour work day is the most basic right and interest the 
working class all over the world has struggled to achieve. The 
relevant laws and regulations in China also include explicit 
provisions on festivals, holidays, and days off. In quite a few 
foreign-invested enterprises, however, these legitimate rights 
and interests of workers have been willfully violated. In 
August last year, the Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau carried 
out a survey in 17 foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and Dongguan. It discovered that work hours at most of 
these enterprises were 10 to 12 hours daily, and there were no 
Sundays or days off. The Guangdong Provincial Federation of 
Trade Unions carried out a survey in 105 foreign-invested 
enterprises and discovered that with the exception of seven, in 
which the workers work three shifts, all the rest asked their 
workers to work extra hours. An enterprise even asked workers 
to work 36 hours at a stretch. Some foreign-invested 
enterprises increase workers' labor quotas at will. In a 
Sino-Japanese joint-venture watch company in Zhuhai, the labor 
quota per worker per shift in the the workshop turning out 
second hands is fixed at 4,000 pieces, while the quota set in 
Japan is only 2,500. 
<H5>  Wages Are Deducted, in Arrears, and Embezzled </H5>
  4. Wages are on the low side, and the wages and overtime pay 
of workers are deducted, in arrears, and embezzled at will. 
Regulations in China state that the wages of workers in 
foreign-invested enterprises are not to be less than 120 percent 
of the average of those of state-owned enterprises with similar 
conditions of the same trade in the same locality. However, the 
wages of workers in many foreign-invested enterprises are on the 
low side, and some of them are even lower than the lowest local 
wage standard. In Shenzhen's Shekou Industrial Zone, for 
example, the Kaida Enterprise Company Ltd, which employs more 
than 1,300 people, pays workers only five to seven yuan per day, 
nearly half the lowest wage standard of 11.2 yuan per day in 
1993 as announced by the Shenzhen City Government. According to 
a survey carried out in 75 foreign-invested enterprises in the 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou Special Economic Zones [SEZ], the 
lowest wage standard of workers in 41 enterprises is lower than 
that published by local governments of the SEZ's. These 
enterprises account for 55 percent of the surveyed total. The 
lowest wages of workers are only 140 yuan a month. 
<H5>  Not Signing Contracts and Not Fulfilling Contracts </H5>
  5. Workers are not recruited openly, but at will. Labor 
contracts are not signed with workers and signed labor contracts 
are not implemented strictly. 
  Some foreign-invested enterprises do not sign labor 
contracts with workers. As a result, workers' jobs are not 
safeguarded, the workers are not insured against unemployment, 
and workers' legitimate rights and interests are not protected 
by law. The Qingdao City Federation of Trade Unions carried out 
a survey in 48 foreign-invested enterprises and found that 11 
had signed labor contracts with only some workers, and four had 
not signed any labor contracts at all. In 1992, Shenzhen 
carried out a general inspection on enforcing labor laws, made 
selective examinations among 280,000 workers and 205 
enterprises, and discovered that 17 percent of workers had not 
gone through any labor formalities. The number of 
foreign-invested enterprises in the Shantou SEZ and Zhuhai which 
have not signed labor contracts accounts for 70 and 90 percent, 
respectively, of the total of such enterprises. Although some 
foreign-invested enterprises sign labor contracts with workers, 
the rights and obligations of the two sides are not on an equal 
basis. The contents of some contracts clearly violate the law, 
while those of others are self-contradictory. In the contracts 
of a joint-venture enterprise in Shanghai, there are articles 
restricting the time for workers to go to the toilet, stating 
the number of years during which workers may not fall in love 
with others, and giving enterprise management the power to 
dismiss any worker who does not follow the arrangements for 
working extra work hours. The labor contracts of a large 
restaurant in Shanghai had two versions, in Chinese and English, 
but the contents of these two versions were completely 
different. The boss let the workers read the Chinese version, 
but asked them to sign the English one. Before the probation 
period was over, some workers could no longer stand the illegal 
practices of using detectors to search them or to search their 
bags, and wanted to terminate their contracts although they had 
to forfeit 340 yuan of cash pledge as stated in their Chinese 
contracts. However, the administration of the restaurant took 
out the English versions of the contracts, which stated that the 
workers had to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation, in addition to 
the cast pledge. A Shenyang enterprise, which was entirely 
owned by a businessman from the Republic of Korea, took 
advantage of the six- month probation period for new workers. 
It recruited workers secretly, dismissed them in less than six 
months, and recruited other workers in a bid to avoid signing 
labor contracts or paying workers' insurance fees. At present, 
most foreign-invested enterprises recruit young workers, then 
dismiss them within a few years. In reality, this is to shift 
the responsibility for paying workers' pensions onto society, 
and will constitute a problem for China in the future. 
<H5>  Work Stoppages, Strikes, and Go-Slows </H5>
  Owing to frequent conflicts between labor and capital in 
some 
foreign-invested enterprises and because of tense labor 
relations, some unexpected events have occurred, such as 
suspension of work, strikes, and large numbers of people 
applying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal 
for help. They have affected social stability and security. In 
1991, the Shanghai municipal arbitration organs handled 70 cases 
of major labor disputes at foreign-invested enterprises; in 
1992, the number increased to 111. In Fujian Province, the 
number of major labor disputes occurring at foreign-invested 
enterprises in 1993 was 582 cases more than in 1991, an increase 
of 82.7 percent. In Shenzhen from January to May 1993, there 
were 185 cases of large numbers of workers applying for an 
audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help, as well

"Zhu Rongji Warns Against Inflation, Saying Worsening Inflation 
Will Affect Social Stability"] 
  [Text] Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council on 
the mainland, recently warned against inflation on the mainland. 
He said that the macro environment is so tight, and reform is 
developing in such depth and width, that if the inflationary 
pressure at this moment continues to increase or if serious 
inflation takes place, then social stability will be affected. 
  At a recent meeting of experts, Zhu Rongji warned against 
the 
bad situation that price increases in some mainland cities 
exceeded 40 percent and that grain prices were skyrocketing. 
Zhu Rongji said: Without stability, there is no point in 
talking about anything, and a small incident can disrupt the 
historical process, so we must not pursue speed only, our work 
must be solid. 
  At the meeting, Zhu Rongji said citing Deng Xiaoping's words 
that an overheated economy can easily lead to mistakes, 
development speed must be moderate. When it is too fast and 
completely out of the question, we can do nothing but increase 
the price of goods, but the masses already have fears about 
prices and inflation, and in an economic environment which does 
not allow much room for maneuver, we must correctly handle the 
relations among reform, development, and stability, and the 
overall situation. 
  Summing up the problems arising from the economic 
development 
of last year, Zhu Rongji stressed that the socialist market 
economy needs macroeconomic regulation and control, which is 
very important to the reform of the socialist market economy 
system which will be launched thoroughly this year, but the 
problem is, for a long time we viewed socialism as planned 
economy and capitalism as anarchy. 
  In light of this, Zhu Rongji once again cited Deng 
Xiaoping's 
unpublished words that a market economy is not a sign 
distinguishing a country's social system. Last year, some 
problems emerged from the national economy and financial 
discipline was chaotic while the investment scale was too large, 
which requires us to keep exploring in future practice so as to 
clear a real road. 
  Zhu Rongji also criticized some people's idea that a market 
economy is the special feature of capitalist economy which is 
difficult to link to socialism. He said: Up to now, many 
economists in the world unanimously think that the market 
economy on the mainland has been run very well. At the end of 
the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: From the stance of a socialist 
country, we think our own road is right.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Forex Market Opens Smoothly"] </F>
  [Text] The country's first interbank foreign exchange 
market has been operating smoothly since it started trading on 
Monday. 
  And the price of the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars remained 
fairly steady the past two days at the Shanghai-based China 
Foreign Exchange Trading Centre. 
  The US dollar opened at 8.6889 yuan and edged up to 8.6948 
yesterday. 
  The average weighted price of the U.S. dollar yesterday was 
8.6999 yuan, slightly higher than the previous average of 8.6967 
yuan. 
  Total transaction value on Monday and Tuesday was $89.77 
million. 
  More than 2 million Hong Kong dollars ($256,000) changed 
hands yesterday and the average price closed at 1.1275 yuan, 
slightly up from 1.1273 on Monday. 
  The centre only handles U.S. and Hong Kong dollar 
transactions. 
  But it has been hailed by market analysts as a major step 
forward in China's foreign exchange reform. 
  They say it will help make the country's rate truly reflect 
the supply and demand of foreign exchange. 
  Daily trading prices quoted on the market are referred to 
the 
central bank to set the next day's rate. 
  The central bank adjusts the exchange rate by buying and 
selling hard currencies on the market. 
  The official said it is hard to predict how the rate will 
change in the coming months, adding that its stability depends 
on the economy.

<F P=106> ["Procedures for Managing the Capital Construction of Units </F>
Directly Under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and 
Trade (MOFERT) -- promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on October 5, 1993"] 
  [Text] In light of the new situation that has emerged along 
with reform in the foreign trade system and the management of 
capital construction, these procedures have been formulated for 
the purpose of strengthening the management of capital 
construction in units directly under MOFERT and better 
implementing state policies on capital construction, in 
accordance with related regulations of the state and the actual 
situation in MOFERT. 
<H5>  I. Making and Issuing of Plans </H5>
  1. All units, consonant with the development plan of their 
particular business, are to draw up long-term (three- or 
five-year) capital construction plans in accordance with the 
requirements issued by MOFERT, and to submit them to MOFERT in a 
timely manner. 
  2. All units, according to the needs of their business and 
the fulfillment of the capital construction budget for the year, 
are to complete and submit to MOFERT every August their plans 
for application for investment in capital construction for the 
coming year (together with the application form), along with the 
necessary explanatory notes (including reasons for the 
construction of major projects, equipment available, and 
location of construction; in cases of production projects, a 
description of raw materials and resources used and of the 
economic results following completion of the projects also is 
required). Should application plans of units located in Beijing 
include new projects to be constructed, these units at the same 
time are to complete and submit the relevant forms for building 
construction in Beijing. 
  3. All units, in accordance with the figures for controlling 
investment in capital construction for the year, as released by 
MOFERT, are to compile and submit to MOFERT their draft plans 
for annual investment in capital construction. 
  4. Following evaluation and adjustment for overall balance 
by MOFERT, the annual capital construction draft investment 
plans submitted by all units are to be issued as formal plans 
for implementation by the units. On receiving the plans, all 
units are to immediately assign construction units to study 
concrete measures for carrying them out, and should lose no time 
in acquiring the necessary land, doing the design work, 
preparing materials, and launching construction, so as to 
guarantee fulfillment of the plans. 
  5. National corporations with subsidiary companies are to be 
responsible for examining and summarizing the long-term plans, 
application plans, and draft plans of their subsidiaries, and 
for submitting them to MOFERT. 
<H5>  II. Compilation, Submission, and Approval of Design </H5>
Documents 
  (I) Project Proposals and Design Reports 
  1. With regard to the construction of large- and 
medium-sized projects and of projects with investment 
limitations set by the state (cold storage warehouses having a 
capacity of more than 10,000 tons or projects involving a total 
investment of more than 30 million yuan) -- if they fall into 
the category of production projects -- all units, when making 
long-term plans, are to submit five copies of the project 
proposal to MOFERT and one copy to the State Planning 
Commission. After conducting a preliminary evaluation, MOFERT 
is to submit the proposal to the State Planning Commission for 
evaluation and approval. With regard to nonproduction projects, 
prior to submitting the application plans, all units are to 
forward design reports to MOFERT, which is to refer them to the 
State Planning Commission for evaluation and approval. Once 
project proposals or design reports have been approved by the 
State Planning Commission, the projects may be included in the 
annual capital construction and investment plans. 
  2. With regard to construction projects involving a total 
investment between 10 million and 30 million yuan, design 
reports are to be compiled and submitted to MOFERT -- together 
with the application plans -- for evaluation and approval. Once 
approved, such projects may be included in the annual plan. 
  3. With regard to projects involving a total investment 
between five million and 10 million yuan, the design report 
compiled by the units is to be approved first by the departments 
concerned and then submitted to MOFERT for the record. 
  4. With regard to projects involving an investment of five 
million yuan or less, a simple design report will suffice, and 
once approved by the departments concerned, may be kept in the 
files of the applicant units. 
  5. Project proposals and design reports should be simple and 
clear, and should include the following: name of the project, 
its content and scale, the basis and conditions for its 
construction (location, resources, water and electricity 
supplies, communications and transportation), pace of 
construction, source of investment, estimated amount of 
materials and equipment, construction site, land to be occupied 
by the project, and economic results. If necessary, a copy of 
the total layout plan of the construction site may be required. 
  (II) Preliminary Expansion Designs and Engineering Budget 
Estimates 
  1. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget 
estimates are to be made by design departments in accordance 
with the project proposal or design report (mainly concerning 
construction scale and total investment) and submitted to MOFERT 
by the applicant units, either for evaluation and approval or 
for the record. 
  2. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget 
estimates of large- and medium-sized projects or projects 
involving investments exceeding state-set limitations are to be 
submitted to MOFERT by the applicant units for evaluation and 
approval conducted by MOFERT in conjunction with the departments 
concerned. 
  3. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget 
estimates for projects involving a total investment between 10 
million and 30 million yuan are to be submitted by the applicant 
units for evaluation and approval by MOFERT. 
  4. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget 
estimates for projects involving a total investment between five 
mi@lion and 10 million yuan are to be examined by departments 
entrusted by the applicant units, then submitted to MOFERT for 
the record. 
  5. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget 
estimates for projects involving a total investment under five 
million yuan are to be examined by the applicant units, together 
with the departments concerned, and are to be kept in the files 
of the applicant units. 
  6. Once the preliminary expansion designs and engineering 
budget estimates have been evaluated and approved, they are to 
be the basis for controlling project investment and for drawing 
up construction budgets and engineering blueprints. 
  (III) Construction Drawings and Budgets 
  On completion of the construction drawings and the budget 
for 
a construction project, the construction unit will entrust the 
departments concerned with evaluating and approving them. 
<H5>  III. Planned Management </H5>
  1. Planned management of capital construction projects is to 
be strengthened. All capital construction projects are to be 
included in the plan, and no extra-plan projects are to be 
allowed. For projects financed by units themselves, there must 
be effectively guaranteed financing, obtained through the proper 
channels, before the projects can be included in the plan. 
  2. Once the annual investment plan for capital construction 
is finalized, no expansion of the scale or other alteration of 
the project is to be allowed. When changes are necessary, an 
application for approval of the changes must be submitted to the 
unit that approved the project. 
  3. Once the project proposal, design report, and preliminary 
design are approved, no changes are to be made without 
authorization. If changes are necessary in total investment, 
construction scale, construction site, or any single item of the 
project, an application for such changes must be submitted to 
the unit that approved the project. 
  4. Examination of the implementation of the plans must be 
strengthened. Questions that arise during the implementation of 
a plan must be dealt with in good time. If the plan cannot be 
fulfilled, or if an increase or an adjustment to the plan is 
necessary, a report must be submitted to MOFERT for examination 
and approval. 
<H5>  IV. Construction Management and Acceptance of Work </H5>
  1. Efforts must be made to improve construction management 
and increase return on investment. The policy of concentrating 
resources for completing projects must be adhered to. Projects 
should be listed according to conditions with regard to 
materials, equipment, investment, and work forces, and 
construction work carried out in different phases in line with 
the degree of their importance and urgency. During 
construction, attention must be paid to economic results. There 
must be specific rates of consumption, standards for expenses, 
and verification of cost accounting, so as to reduce 
construction costs. 
  2. The quality of projects must be guaranteed and quality 
control must be improved. On completion, a project must be 
checked and accepted according to the regulations, and reports 
of project completion and final accounts of expenditure must be 
made. At the same time, a list of property transfers must be 
compiled and should be supplemented with drawings indicating the 
completion of the project and with technical archives -- 
including records of concealed engineering works -- for 
safekeeping by construction units and for the convenience of 
later maintenance and expansion. 
  3. Large- and medium-sized projects, as well as other 
projects involving investment in excess of state-set limitations 
are to be checked and accepted by MOFERT, together with the 
departments concerned. Projects involving investment under 30 
million yuan are to be checked and accepted by the departments 
concerned at the invitation of the applicant units, and when 
necessary, with the participation of MOFERT personnel. With 
regard to projects involving investment over 10 million yuan, 
the applicant units are to submit reports on completion of 
construction and final accounts of expenditure to MOFERT for the 
record. 
<H5>  V. Tables of Capital Construction Statistics </H5>
  1. In order to promptly make known the implementation of the 
capital construction plan and existing problems, all applicant 
units are to complete every month the "Monthly Table of Capital 
Construction Progress" and submit it to MOFERT no later than the 
10th of the following month. 
  2. At the end of each year, all aplicant units are to 
complete the "Annual Table of Capital Construction Progress" 
(similar to the Monthly Table) and submit it to MOFERT before 
the end of January of the following year. 
  3. All monthly and annual tables of capital construction 
progress should be accompanied by notes explaining the reasons 
for rapid or slow progress, the existing problems, and measures 
to be taken. The tables should have accurate figures and be 
completed in full. 
  4. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies are 
responsible for evaluating and checking the monthly and annual 
tables of their subsidiaries, and for submitting summary reports 
to MOFERT on schedule. 
<H5>  VI. Capital Construction Finances </H5>
  1. All units directly under MOFERT are to compile annual 
capital construction finance plans and submit them to MOFERT 
within the prescribed time, in accordance with the annual 
planned investment for capital construction prescribed by MOFERT 
and with the requirements and tables stipulated and described in 
the notice issued by MOFERT with regard to the compiling of 
annual capital construction finance plans. 
  2. Limitations are to be set for nonoperational investment 
included in the funds for invesstment. In accordance with the 
progress of the construction and actual need for funding, 
investment is to be allocated and made available by MOFERT to 
the units using the investment through the head office of the 
Construction Bank of China in accordance with the capital 
construction plans approved by the State Planning Commission and 
the finance plans compiled and submitted by various units, and 
within the prescribed limit of phased appropriation of funds 
approved by the head office of the Construction Bank of China. 
All units using such investment must open accounts at the head 
office of the Construction Bank of China, as required by the 
regulations. 
  3. In the case of construction projects financed by 
operational investment, construction units, on receiving capital 
construction plans issued by MOFERT, are to sign loan contracts 
at once with branches of the Construction Bank of China, which 
will serve as evidence for obtaining and repaying the loan. 
  4. In the case of construction projects financed by units 
themselves, construction units are to deposit at the 
Construction Bank of China the funds they have raised. They 
must observe the principle of "depositing the fund before 
obtaining approval, and obtaining approval before making use of 
the fund." The fund must be kept at the bank for no less than 
six months before it can be used under the supervision of the 
Construction Bank of China. 
  5. In the case of construction projects financed by loans 
from the Construction Bank of China -- and if they are projects 
with renewed loans -- construction units may go through loan 
procedures immediately with the local office of the Construction 
Bank of China, once the head office of the Construction Bank of 
China has notified its local offices of the loan plan. If they 
are new projects to be financed by bank loans, construction 
units are to cooperate with local bank branches to complete 
project evaluations and go through loan procedures after the 
head office of the Construction Bank of China has approved and 
issued the loan plans. Units using loans from other banks to 
finance their construction projects are to complete the 
procedures for obtaining and paying the loans in accordance with 
the regulations of the banks concerned. 
  6. The monthly capital construction finance reports are the 
main basis for appropriation by MOFERT, and all units are to 
submit them to MOFERT within eight days folloing the end of the 
month. (If there is not enough time to complete the paperwork, 
a report may be made by telegraph or telephone.) 
  7. The annual final accounts of capital construction 
expenditure are tables reflecting the entire economic 
performances of the construction units and departments. They 
are a summary of the implementation and execution of the annual 
capital construction and finance plans. All units are to 
compile the annual final accounts of capital construction 
expenditure in a timely and accurate manner and in accordance 
with the requirements and tables stipulated and prescribed by 
MOFERT and are to submit them to MOFERT for evaluation and 
approval. 
  8. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies should 
appoint people to take special charge of evaluating and checking 
the financial plans, monthly financial reports, and annual final 
accounts of expenditure of their subsidiaries, and should submit 
summary reports to MOFERT. 
<H5>  VII. Supplementary Regulations </H5>
  1. Units directly under MOFERT may draw up implementation 
regulations in accordance with these "Procedures." 
  2. These "Procedures" go into effect on 1 January 1989.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column article by staff reporter Fei </F>
Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "Offshore Oil: From 100,000 Tonnes to 
4.6 Million Tonnes"] 
  [Text] China had just begun its oil industry when the 
Daqing oilfield ranked among the world's 10 million-tonne oil 
fields in 1967. On 14 June, crude oil spurt from Bohai Offshore 
Well Number One, China's first offshore-oil exploration well. 
The State Council sent a special cable of congratulations. 
  Ten years elapsed. On the eve of China's reform and opening 
up, offshore oil still only came from one simple offshore well 
whose annual output was no more than 100,000 tonnes. 
  "The spring wind has come overnight and pear trees blossom 
everywhere." In 1980, China signed contracts with Japanese and 
French oil companies on cooperation in the offshore oil 
industry. Since then, China has opened the doors to the outside 
world on cooperation in the offshore oil industry. From Bohai 
Bay to Beibu Bay, China's extensive waters have entered a new 
period of attracting foreign capital and advanced equipment and 
technology from around the world and of large-scale prospecting 
and exploitation. 
  Another 10 years elapsed. As of the end of last year, the 
China National Offshore Oil Corporation had signed 74 contracts 
and agreements with 55 oil companies from 13 countries and 
attracted foreign capital totalling $3.8 billion. The story of 
Offshore Well Number One has been integrated with roaring 
machines in the offshore oil cities. At present, 10 offshore 
oil and gas fields have been erected and 10 others are being 
erected. In fact, hardly anywhere in the world are so many 
offshore oil and gas fields exploited on such an extensive a 
scale. Last year, China's offshore oil output already reached 
4.6 million tonnes. 
  Percussion drills, the most primitive of drills, plus the 
steel frame resting on two 500-tonne salvage floats, the most 
primitive of drilling vessels, were a primitive form used in 
China's offshore oil industry for many years. Today, the 
equipment and technology of the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation are so impressive that none of the oil companies 
around the world dare to look down on them. From prospecting to 
exploitation to production, various pieces of equipment are 
complete and match one another, and there are 90 big and small 
vessels, most of which reach the world's advanced levels, 
including a 200,000-odd-tonne floating production and storage 
vessel. Technologically, China has developed from sending a few 
technical personnel abroad as employees of foreign companies to 
completely relying on its itself to design, establish, and 
manage offshore oil and gas fields. 
  China's offshore oil industry has stood lofty amidst reform 
and opening up. Before reform and opening up, a work force of 
30,000 could produce no more than 100,000 tonnes of crude oil a 
year. Today, a work force of 30,000 can produce 46 times as 
much. "In 1997 when our annual output of crude oil reaches 12 
million tonnes and our natural gas 4 billion cubic meters, our 
work force will not exceed 30,000." Looking ahead, Wang Yanman, 
general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, 
said with full confidence: "We are stepping into the ranks of 
the world's advanced oil companies."

  [Text] Hefei, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Over the past 15 years, 
China has approved more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises, 
involving 40 percent of the total foreign funds invested in 
developing countries. 
  These figures were disclosed at a national conference on the 
registration and management of foreign-funded enterprises held 
today at Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province. 
  By the end of last year, China had 107,800 jointly-funded 
enterprises, 25,500 cooperative enterprises and 34,200 solely 
foreign-funded enterprises, involving more than 150 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign funds. 
  China began to open its door for foreign investment in 1978. 
  In 1984, fewer than 2,000 foreign-funded enterprises were 
registered in China and over half of them had an investment of 
only scores of thousands of U.S. dollars each. 
  As laws and regulations concerning foreign investment were 
improved, foreign funds in the country multiplied rapidly. 
  In 1991 alone, the number of approved foreign-funded 
enterprises equaled the total in the previous seven years. 
  By the end of 1993, 56 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds 
had poured into China, and the share of foreign investment in 
the country's total investment in fixed assets increased from 
2.5 percent in the 1980s to 13 percent. 
  Of the over 80,000 foreign-funded enterprises which have 
already started operation, industrial enterprises yielded 302 
billion yuan in output value last year, about 30 percent of the 
domestic gross product of the country. 
  At present, foreign-funded enterprises have prevailed in the 
production of sedan cars, elevators, color TV tubes, computer- 
controlled exchange systems and optical fibers and cables, for 
which China used to depend on imports. 
  Meanwhile, China now exports audio systems, color 
televisions, cameras and watches in large quantities and has 
become one of the largest household electronic apparatus 
exporters in the world. 
  In 1993, foreign-funded enterprises contributed 34.4 percent 
of the nation's import and export volume, which was about 67 
billion U.S. dollars. They produced an export volume of 25.4 
billion U.S. dollars, 27.5 percent of the nation's total. 
  By the end of 1993, 146 countries and regions had already 
invested in China, and businessmen and organizations from over 
120 countries and regions had set up resident missions in China. 
  According to statistics for 1993, more than 20 million 
Chinese worked in foreign-funded enterprises.

<F P=106> [Report: "Ministry of Finance Formulates Three New Polices </F>
on Contracting for Responsibility by Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The main contents include: 1) Correctly fixing 
the base for contracting. Enterprises which have realized a 
steady increase in profits in the previous three years should 
increase tax and profit payments by 8-15 percent; enterprises 
which have experienced falling profits in the previous two years 
should take the amount of taxes and profits they handed over 
last year as a base for contracting, which will remain unchanged 
for three years, and when an enterprise has surplus income, a 
portion of it should be retained by the enterprise and a portion 
of it should he handed over to the state; enterprises which have 
experienced both increasing and decreasing profits in the 
previous three years, should fix their base for contracting 
according to the amount of taxes and profits handed over in 
those three year. 2) Establish an enterprise risk fund. From 
profits retained by enterprises, 10 percent should be earmarked 
to reserve contracting in case enterprises earn no profits. 3) 
Upgrade the appreciation rate of assets as a main target when 
considering enterprises' contracting activities.

<F P=106> [Report: "Beijing Municipality Makes Six-Point Suggestions </F>
on Completing, Perfecting Reform of Nongovernment-Run 
State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] First, improve understanding of the necessity of 
state ownership with private management. The reform of state 
ownership with private management is a product of when small 
state-run commercial enterprises change from the planned 
economic system to the market economic system and is an 
innovative choice for small enterprises to get themselves out of 
a difficult position. 
  Second, strengthen guidance for the reform of state 
ownership 
with private management so as to standardize it. Judging from 
practical results, we should lead, to the best of our ability, 
staff and workers to choose the management form of leasing, 
particularly individual leasing and partnership leasing. 
Compared with the contract responsibility system for profits, 
the leasing system conforms more to the requirements of the 
socialist market economy and the rights and obligations of the 
two parties to the lease are more clearly defined. 
  Third, thoroughly promote the method of inviting bids and 
choosing leaseholders and enterprise managers. 
  Fourth, guarantee the independent decisionmaking rights of 
the leasing enterprise and the contracting enterprise. 
  Fifth, improve the statistical methods of state-owned 
privately run enterprises. Change the statistical system in 
which enterprises report their management situations to higher 
authorities to a method in which enterprises report their 
management situations to taxation organs. Taxation authorities 
together with individual associations make appraisals of the 
same trade or industry and match them with verification by 
taxation organs to confirm the reported figures, and 
enterprises' management situations are summed up and reflected 
on by the taxation authorities. 
  Sixth, party committees and governments at all levels should 
create a fine macropolicy environment for the reform of public 
ownership with private management.

"Detailed Regulations on Land Value-Added Tax To Guarantee 
Profits for Investors"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--News from 
different quarters shows that the detailed regulations on the 
implementation of the land value-added tax, which are to be 
adopted soon, will be more liberal than the "Interim Regulations 
on Land Value-Added Tax" and will respond to the rational views 
of domestic and overseas investors. The upper ceiling for 
investment return and the land value-added tax rate set by the 
detailed regulations are likely to be around 50 percent, which 
is lower than the original ceiling, and thus guarantees that 
investors will make profits. 
  When China issued the "Interim Regulations on Land 
Value-Added Tax" at the end of last year, there were strong 
repercussions among real estate investors at home and abroad. 
Property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, in particular, 
poured out endless grievances and reacted strongly, with 
numerous queries and criticisms. They pointed out: By setting 
the value-added tax at 30-60 percent and collecting income tax, 
property investment companies will have to pay 73 percent of 
taxes at the high end or 53 percent at the low end, which makes 
business practically unprofitable. Over the past few months, 
both developers and professionals have raised many views with 
the mainland authorities through various channels. Many 
property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan said: Property 
investment involves high risks, a huge volume of investment, and 
a long cycle of investment. If the mainland authorities 
overlook developers' loan interest rates, inflation, and other 
factors and deliberately bring down investment returns, it will 
be difficult to attract foreign capital. 
  According to many overseas property developers and 
professionals, the speculation and huge-profit-making activities 
on the mainland property market are primarily caused by man-made 
factors. Taking advantage of their positions to seek private 
gains, some local officials collude with businessmen eager for 
quick success and instant profits. As a result, the phenomena 
of indiscriminately enclosing or approving lands for property 
development and speculating on building lots have emerged in 
some localities. Even the practice of obtaining "building lots 
through favors or brief informal notes" has been observed. This 
phenomena has significantly contributed to the dramatic loss of 
state-owned land revenue. These problems cannot be solved by 
relying exclusively on the collection of land value-added tax, 
but should be restricted and standardized by strict measures and 
regulations. 
  On a public occasion the other day, Ma Kewei, deputy 
director 
of the State Land Administration Bureau, admitted that there 
were indeed serious cases of non-observance of the law in the 
mainland property market. He said: Most of those speculating 
on building lots and making huge profits are those who have 
backgrounds, connections, and brief informal notes. These 
people can speculate on building lots without using capital. Ma 
also pointed out: Some local officials are eager to develop the 
economy and have an inappropriate understanding of land. 
Thinking that the economy can be developed by releasing land, 
they approve vast pieces of land at extremely low prices, thus 
providing some foreign businessmen with an opportunity to make 
huge profits. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the relevant department 
officials have repeatedly stated that the aims of introducing 
the land value-added tax are as follows: First, we must 
stabilize land and property market development and suppress 
speculation and profiteering so that the real estate industry 
can develop in a healthy manner and so that only the best 
survive on the market. Second, we must rationally regulate land 
appreciation earnings by returning to the state the portion of 
natural land appreciation belonging to the state, i.e. the 
portion of land appreciation due primarily to government 
investment in the infrastructure; and third, to protect the 
legitimate business of investors and ensure the legitimate 
profits of developers. Although mainland officials are prudent 
about the detailed regulations, they have explicitly indicated 
that the regulations will fully embody the rational views of 
developers and professionals and try as far as possible to make 
tax burdens fair and rational, so that developers can make 
profits. 
  As the detailed regulations for the implementation of land 
value-added tax have yet to be made public, there is still some 
uncertainty. For the first three months of this year, overseas 
developers have been adopting a wait-and-see attitude. This has 
prompted local governments and Hong Kong and Taiwan developers 
to call for the early release of the detailed regulations, lest 
it dampen investment enthusiasm and hinder the normal growth of 
the property market, which is still at an early stage of 
development.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- China is one of the 
world's largest potential markets for autos, indicating that 
both Chinese and foreign carmakers have a lot to do in this 
sector. 
  This is the finding of a nationwide survey of 3,000 owners 
of 
Chinese-built cars over a period of three months. Results of 
the survey, conducted by the State Statistical Bureau and the 
China Automobile Industry Corporation, were announced here today. 
  Improvement in the Chinese people's living standards will 
give a major push to the buying of family cars, the survey says. 
  It indicates that a growing number of well-to-do Chinese 
have 
bought cars for private use. And more and more autos are 
expected to be driven home in China in the coming decades. 
  The survey shows that the most popular Chinese-built cars 
are 
the Audi from the China First Automobile Group Corporation 
(CFAGC), the Santana from the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto 
Corporation, Ltd. (SVAC), and the Jetta from the Fow-Volkswagen 
Auto Corporation, Ltd. (FVAC) [name as received]. 
  Heavy-duty trucks praised by consumers surveyed are the 
Huanghe from the Jinan Heavy-Duty Motor Works (JHMW) and the 
Jiefang from CFAGC, it says. 
  A few enterprises such as CFAGC and SVAC were valued by the 
consumers as the best automobile enterprises in China. 
  China has 116 motor works, but their output and 
manufacturing 
technology lag behind world standards. The survey was aimed at 
helping China's auto corporations to adapt to the market and 
improve their manufacturing technology and quality so as to 
raise their competence on the world market. 
  The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in 
China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993, 
China produced 1.31 million autos, an increase of 20 percent 
over 1992. 
  Statistics show that China had 8 million Chinese-built autos 
by the end of 1993, 16 percent higher than the 1992 figure.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- China is to set up a 
standardized unemployment registration and supervision system 
within two years, according to Zhang Xiaojian, the head of the 
Employment Department of the Labor Ministry of China. 
  Speaking at the national employment meeting here, Zhang said 
that the expected system will help create a solid labor market 
for the development of China's market economy. 
  He said that China will this year choose 100 enterprises and 
ten cities nationwide to try out the system and will trace the 
development of their overall unemployment rate, long-term 
unemployment rate, under-employment rate and other economic 
figures. 
  Meanwhile, China will refer to internationally adopted 
practices in analyzing and supervising labor markets, the 
official said. 
  China will also promulgate a set of macro unemployment 
insurance regulations that suit the country's real conditions so 
as to standardize management of the labor market. 
  Official statistics show that, in addition to 130 million 
surplus rural laborers, China has 4.1 million jobless urban 
workers, or 2.6 percent of the total urban workforce. 
  China's employment situation is extremely difficult, and the 
country now is faced with unprecedented challenges in deploying 
all the jobless, said Li Boyong, Chinese minister of labor. 
  To keep the government well informed on the true picture of 
the country's unemployment and labor supply and demand, China 
will strive to register the unemployed and give out unemployment 
relief and employment services according to their particular 
circumstances. 
  Zhang said that economic progress is the way to provide for 
expanded employment, adding that the collective economy and the 
service sector are expected to be the chief absorbers of the 
unemployed. He said that China will do its utmost to keep the 
unemployment rate in the vicinity of three percent.

<F P=106> [Report: "Main Points of `Chang Jiang Strategy' Plan </F>
Revealed by State Planning Commission"] 
  [Text] This plan sets detailed future development goals 
for various regions along the Chang Jiang. 
  According to the plan, within the next six years from now to 
the end of this century, the state will build a number of key 
projects in regions along the Chang Jiang, and the scale of 
investment will be huge. 
  According to sources, a relevant department in the State 
Planning Commission has formulated the main contents of the 
"Chang Jiang strategy" and concrete procedures for implementing 
the strategy, and they include: 
  With Shanghai's Pudong as the driving force, establish an 
economic sphere which includes eight regions and 28 large and 
medium cities from Chongqing to the Chang Jiang estuary. 
  Expedite construction of infrastructure and key projects in 
these regions. There will be over 100 core projects each of 
which will entail investment exceeding 200 million yuan, 
including Shanghai's 1-million-tonne Jinshan oil refinery 
project, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai's project to 
produce 300,000 cars each year, Shanghai's acetic acid project, 
the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant, the Panzhihua 
nonferrous metals project, the Beijing- Shanghai Expressway, 
Hubei's project to produce 300,000 cars a year, and the 
world-famous Three Gorges Project. 
  Expedite the utilization of foreign funds by the regions 
along the Chang Jiang and broaden the scope of the utilization 
of foreign funds. Except for the state's first-grade 
communications facilities, which are not open up to the outside 
world, in principle, other areas may utilize foreign funds, 
which must not be used however to construct pornographic or 
gambling businesses. It is estimated that the utilization of 
foreign funds could reach $10 billion. 
  Open up domestic markets to foreign businessmen and, 
according to the prevailing international practice, that is 
through the BOT [build-operate-transfer] [preceding three 
letters in Roman script] style, utilize foreign funds. Foreign 
businessmen will be responsible for the investment, 
construction, and operations for 15 years, and products produced 
by foreign-invested enterprises can be purchased by the Chinese 
side. 
  Abolish "restricted areas." On the premise of not hurting 
the state's interests, foreign businessmen will be allowed to 
invest in trades which they deem appropriate.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Hard work, the 
traditional way for the Chinese nation to become prosperous, is 
no longer regarded as the only way to get rich, especially by 
the new generation of peasants. 
  Young peasants are finding that scientific and technological 
means are more important in their farm production, as a craze 
for new farming skills and advanced methods of production 
emerges in the vast rural areas of this huge agricultural 
country. The progress of the state "Spark Program", which is 
aimed at using advanced but suitable technology to promote the 
local economy in the rural areas, has helped train large numbers 
of young peasants in Central China's Henan Province. They have 
been equipped with modern know-how and land management knowledge. 
  The province's over 13 million young farmers are now very 
active in technical training. 
  More than 50 percent of young people in rural areas have 
mastered one or two skills. 
  Lou Tingfeng, a young peasant in Baofeng County, Henan, now 
earns 50,000 yuan (about 5,882 U.S. dollars) each year by 
raising scorpions after attending a training course. 
  He and the neighboring township government jointly founded a 
specialised scorpion farm with a total investment of 800,000 
yuan (nearly 100,000 U.S. dollars). 
  The farm is expected to produce an annual production value 
of 
six million yuan (about 700,000 U.S. dollars) and make a profit 
of one million yuan. 
  Following his example, many local villagers have come to him 
for technical advice. Lou has held four training classes on 
scorpion raising, with the attendance of over 500 people. 
  Now his students are scattered in surrounding counties, 
spreading the technique. Lou has been called by local 
government an outstanding young man in helping others to get 
well-off. 
  Henan now has over 20,000 such young people engaging in 
various types of specialised production such as fish raising, 
farm product processing, and fruit tree and vegetable planting. 
They play an exemplary role in the local economy. 
  Statistics show that 180 technical projects have been 
carried 
out in the rural areas of henan. 
  The provincial government has carried out a demonstration 
campaign on rural comprehensive development among young people 
in its seven cities, 25 medium-income counties and 20 
poverty-stricken counties in the Funiu and Taihang mountains. 
  A total of 45.5 million yuan (about 5.5 million U.S. 
dollars) 
has been invested in 401 rural development projects involving 
thousands of young peasants. The projects have made profits of 
850 million yuan (about 100 million U.S. dollars). 
  At the same time, various forms of special technology 
associations, research societies and technical service firms 
have mushroomed in the province to serve the campaign. 
  In such organizations, young farmers are learning new 
techniques with great enthusiasm. 
  Local officials hold that there will soon be an average of 
6,000 young peasants trained in the province in the province 
each year.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today the maintenance of 
relaxation and stability of the Korean Peninsula conforms to the 
common interests of both the Korean people and all other parties 
concerned. "We oppose any action harmful to the relaxation and 
stability in the Korean Peninsula, be it military exercises or 
deployment of missiles." 
  He said: It is necessary to refrain from taking actions that 
will sharpen the contradictions, especially under the current 
circumstances. 
  He made the statement at a news briefing this afternoon when 
asked by reporters to comment on the fact that the United States 
has begun shipping "Patriot" missiles to the Republic of Korea 
[ROK] and that the United States and the ROK are planning to 
resume their Team Spirit joint military exercises. 
  In response to a reporter's question on the nuclear issue 
involving the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], he 
reiterated that China has all along maintained that the DPRK's 
nuclear issue should be settled through dialogue. All parties 
concerned have expressed the willingness to settle the issue 
through continued dialogue.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China, as 
a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, 
will do its best to strengthen the UN role in safeguarding peace 
and promoting development. 
  It will, as always, together with the world community strive 
to enhance international cooperation in the field of human 
rights, said Qian at a meeting with Dr. Kurt Waldheim, former UN 
secretary general and president of the UN Association of 
Austria, here this afternoon. 
  Qian told Waldheim, also former federal president of 
Austria, 
that the Chinese Government has given consistent support to the 
UN's efforts for promoting and protecting human rights and basic 
freedom according to the UN Charter's aim and principles. 
  He said that China holds the "Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights" approved by the UN in 1948 as the first international 
document to systematically put forward specific premises for 
respecting and protecting basic human rights. He added that the 
declaration has exerted far-reaching influence on and played a 
positive role in the development of international human rights 
activities after the war. 
  Qian said the Chinese Government has time and again stated 
that it will contribute to protecting human rights and basic 
freedom by abiding by the "Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights" and in accordance with stipulations related to 
international documents on human rights formulated according to 
the declaration. 
  He said that, as a member state of the UN Commission on 
Human 
Rights, China actively takes part in all UN activities on human 
rights, including its involvement in drawing up and formulating 
UN documents on human rights. 
  China has joined in drawing up the eight international 
documents on human rights and respected the "Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights", the "Teheran Declaration" and the 
"Declaration on the Right to Development", he said. 
  Qian noted that China was actively involved in discussing 
and 
formulating the "Vienna Declaration and Program of Action" 
approved by the World Meeting on Human Rights last year and has 
made important contributions in this regard. 
  He said China is willing to cooperate internationally on the 
human rights issue, adding that such cooperation should be based 
on equality and mutual respect. 
  Meanwhile, he said, it is China's view that it cannot 
politicize the human rights issue or regard it as a means for 
political struggle and exerting political pressure, nor turn it 
into a tool for interference in other countries' internal 
affairs. 
  Waldheim, who visited China on four occasions as the UN 
secretary general, said that he appreciated Qian's statement 
that China is willing to conduct international cooperation in 
the human rights field. 
  It is of vital importance to strengthen cooperation and 
exchanges among countries in all the world, he said. 
  Waldheim and his party arrived here on Monday for a 10-day 
visit to China at the invitation of the UN Association of China. 
  During his stay here, Waldheim delivered a speech on the 
international situation at the headquarters of the host 
association.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Song Jian, Chinese 
State councillor and minister in charge of the State Science 
Commission, is to fly to Washington on Saturday [9 April] for a 
Sino-U.S. meeting on science and for a visit. 
  According to a spokesman of the State Science Commission, 
Song will go to the States as guest of John Gibbons, director of 
the Office of Science and Technology Policy. 
  During his stay in Washington, Song will co-chair with 
Gibbons the sixth meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on 
Scientific and Technological Cooperation. 
  Scientific and technological cooperation weighs heavy in 
Sino- U.S. relations. 
  Since China and the United States signed an agreement on 
scientific and technological cooperation in 1979, much progress 
has been made in the fields concerned, with bilateral economic 
cooperation promoted and Sino-U.S. relations improved. 
  The agenda of the Washington meeting is understood to 
include 
a review of achievements of Sino-U.S. scientific and 
technological cooperation, intensive discussions on medical and 
health matters, environmental protection, energy and materials, 
besides probing ways for businessmen's involvement in these 
aspects. 
  The two countries will strike new protocols and renew old 
ones for scientific and technological cooperation. 
  Song will meet American senior leaders to exchange views on 
issues of common concern. 
  He will also visit Harvard University, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, the Ford Automobile company and General 
Motors. 
  Among the delegation are Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, 
Yan Hongmuo, director of the National Oceanography Department, 
and Hu Qiheng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--China warned the United 
States on Thursday not to interfere in the case of celebrated 
dissident Wei Jingsheng, who is facing fresh investigations. 
  The U.S. State Department expressed deep regret Tuesday over 
the latest arrest of Wei and said it had conveyed its concern to 
the authorities in Beijing. 
  Reacting to the US statement, a foreign ministry spokeswoman 
said the 43-year-old pro-democracy activist had "violated 
regulations when he was on parole and deprived of his political 
rights." Describing the case as China's internal affair, the 
spokeswoman said it was "inappropriate for any foreign countries 
to make irresponsible remarks on this matter." 
  "China's public security organ is interrogating (Wei) 
according to the law," she added. 
  The Beijing Public Security Bureau announced Tuesday that 
Wei, who had been picked up by police last week, was being 
investigated for "suspected new criminal offences." 
  The announcement carried the threat of criminal charges and 
a 
second jail term for Wei, who was only released on parole in 
September, six months short of a 15-year prison term for his 
"counterrevolutionary" role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall 
movement.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Xu Hong (1776 3126) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 6 April (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- In an 
interview with a correspondent of this news agency, Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, pointed out 
today that properly solving the issue of most-favored-nation 
[MFN] status is a key premise for developing Sino-U.S. trade and 
economic cooperation. China hopes that bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation can cast off the shadow of the MFN status 
issue and achieve greater development. 
  The female minister, who will shortly head a delegation to 
the United States, said that MFN status is only a trade issue 
and trade should not be linked with other unrelated issues. 
  Wu Yi believes that the revocation of China's MFN status 
would work against the interests of all parties concerned. 
China would suffer certain damage, but the United States would 
also be hurt, and the extent of this, moreover, would not be 
smaller than for China. 
  According to data released by a relevant international 
organization, if China's MFN status is revoked, about 200,000 
people in the United States would lose their jobs; many American 
firms specializing in trade with China, especially small and 
medium-sized firms, would likely be closed down, and American 
consumers would spend $18 billion more each year buying 
substitutes for Chinese products. 
  Wu Yi said: In this way, the United States would lose China, 
a market with enormous potential. Middlemen in Hong Kong and 
foreign- invested firms engaged in the processing industry in 
China, including U.S.-invested firms, would be hit. 
  The female minister believes that the Chinese and U.S. 
governments should rise above the MFN issue and should pay more 
attention to common economic benefits. 
  She said: China's economy is developing in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy manner, and the market is continuously 
expanding. In the next seven years, China's total import value 
will reach $1,000 billion [figure as received]. Transport, 
telecommunications, and energy -- all of them key development 
sectors in China -- are precisely where the strengths of the 
United States lie. U.S. economic sectors are facing a historic 
opportunity for developing trade and economic cooperation with 
China.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, said today: China hopes 
that the United States will "take positive and pragmatic [ji ji 
wu shi 4480 2817 0523 1395]" steps to cast aside man-made 
obstacles and make joint efforts with China to push forward 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  Wu Yi will lead a Chinese Government economic and trade 
delegation to visit the United States 11-20 April. On the eve 
of her U.S. trip, she told XINHUA that China's sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic growth and its grandiose economic 
development plan will create even more favorable trade and 
investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises. 
<H5>  The Upcoming Session of the Joint Committee on Commerce and </H5>
Trade [JCCT] Is Very Important 
  As for the purpose of her U.S. trip, Wu Yi said that the 
most 
important thing during her mission is to co-chair, with U.S. 
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the Eighth Sino-U.S. JCCT 
Session scheduled for 13-14 April in Washington. 
  According to her, the JCCT session, as an annual meeting 
between the Chinese and U.S. Governments, is a most important 
occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations. 
She called the session another major event following the 
Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the talks between 
finance and foreign ministers of the two countries. 
  She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two 
sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and 
cooperation and legal matters in such areas as information, 
energy, transportation, the chemical industry, and environmental 
cooperation. 
  During its visit to the United States, the Chinese 
delegation 
will hold trade and investment negotiation meetings in Los 
Angeles and New York on 11 and 19 April, respectively. 
<H5>  To Discuss 800 Investment Projects and Purchase Goods Worth </H5>
Hundreds of Millions of U.S. Dollars 
  Wu Yi said: The trade and investment negotiation meetings 
will be China's first large-scale trade and investment promotion 
activity to be held in the United States in the past 15 years. 
The activity is sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation with assistance from the U.S. law 
firm Graham and James and the U.S. Asian Association. The 
Chinese trade negotiation group will be made up of senior 
officials, experts, and business executives from eight 
ministries and commissions of the State Council, three national 
corporations, and 26 provinces and municipalities. Meanwhile, 
the ministry's four affiliated corporations, which will be in 
the United States to negotiate exports and imports, plan to buy 
U.S. goods worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. 
  She said: To further promote investment and trade 
cooperation between the two countries, the trade negotiation 
group will mainly brief U.S. businessmen about China's reform, 
opening up, and economic development, and will help prospective 
U.S. investors find opportunities in China. 
  She revealed that China will offer about 800 key investment 
projects at the negotiation meetings, including the construction 
of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways, 
airports, and wharfs; and projects in industrial raw and semi- 
finished materials for the machine-building and electrical, 
electronics, petrochemical, and metallurgical industries; as 
well as in agriculture, livestock breeding, and forestry. 
  It Is Imperative To Remove Obstacles in Developing 
Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations 
  After briefly reviewing the development of economic and 
trade 
relations between China and the United States, Wu Yi said 
bilateral trade and U.S. investment in China have grown 
continuously in recent years despite some problems that have 
cropped up. 
  Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 
1979, trade between the two countries has developed rapidly. 
According to statistics from the General Administration of 
Customs of China, bilateral trade jumped from $2.45 billion in 
1979 to $27.65 billion in 1993, an increase of more than 11.3 
times. Meanwhile, U.S. businessmen's investment in China has 
been increasing each year. As of now, the number of U.S.-funded 
projects in China exceeds 8,000, involving an agreed upon total 
investment of $11 billion, topping the list of all foreign 
investment. More than 50 of the U.S. major firms have opened 
business bases in China. 
  Wu Yi held that a major reason for the rapid development of 
bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation is the fact that 
the two economies are highly supplementary to each other. 
  However, she stressed that if the bilateral trade and 
cooperation are to develop further, the U.S. side should take 
further steps to remove man-made obstacles. The United States 
should relax controls on U.S. technology exports to China, 
resume financing for feasibility studies for projects undertaken 
by the U.S. Trade Development Agency, resume risk guarantees by 
the private U.S. Investment Company for U.S. Investment in 
China, and resume preferential loans by the American Import and 
Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China, so as to 
further tap the the potential of China's imports from the United 
States and U.S. investment in China. 
<H5>  Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] Status and China's Rejoining the </H5>
GATT 
  Touching on the issue of MFN status, Wu Yi said: This is a 
purely trade issue and it should not be entangled with issues 
with which it has nothing to do. Proper handling of MFN status 
is an important condition for the further development of 
bilateral trade and economic coopeation. China hopes to remove 
the shadow of MFN status and achieve greater development in 
bilateral economic and trade relations. 
  Wu Yi said: China has always opposed the practice of linking 
MFN status to the human rights issues, as views on human rights 
and explanations on the meaning of human rights differ from 
country to country. China and the United States have 
differences of view on the human rights issue, and they may 
discuss them through other channels on the basis of mutual 
respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and 
seeking common ground while preserving differences. The two 
sides should in no way let this nontrade factor stand in the way 
of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party 
status in GATT, Wu Yi said that major progress was made at the 
16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China last month. 
Most GATT members voiced support for China's "reentry into the 
GATT" orally and in action. 
  Minister Wu Yi said: During bilateral talks, the United 
States has said it will firmly support China's reentry into 
GATT. She hoped that the U.S. side would effectively fulfill 
its promise, take a positive attitude in handling the matter of 
China's reentry into the GATT, promote the course of negotiation 
for China's "reentry into the GATT," and will truly keep its 
promise and be as good as its word.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Gao Haorong (7559 3185 2837): "The </F>
United States Deploys Guided Missiles and the DPRK Opposes the 
Exertion of Pressure"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Acting on U.S. 
President Clinton's 21 March orders, two U.S. transport ships 
carrying 48 Patriot missile launchers set sail from Oakland in 
early April and are scheduled to arrive in the ROK before the 
end of the month. It has been reported the Patriots will be 
deployed around Seoul. 
  As early as the beginning of this year, the United States 
and 
the ROK agreed in principle to deploy Patriot missiles on U.S. 
military bases in the ROK to deal with "threats from the North." 
The missile deployment plan was strongly criticized by the 
DPRK. Later, the situation on the Korean Peninsula became 
relaxed; the Patriot missile deployment plan was shelved after 
the DPRK reached agreements separately with the IAEA and the 
United States on the settlement of the nuclear issue, and North 
and South Korea resumed consultations on an exchange of special 
envoys. 
  Recently, the settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue again 
encountered difficulties as the various parties have completely 
different appraisals of the results of the IAEA's early March 
inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. Against such a 
background, the United States has revived its plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles in the ROK. 
  The U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles aroused strong 
opposition from the DPRK. On 28 March, a DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman issued a statement saying the Patriot missiles to be 
deployed to the ROK are an improved model, which can be used as 
an offensive weapon and can hit any target on the Korean 
Peninsula due to the local terrain. For this reason, the U.S. 
description of the Patriot deployment as "purely defensive" is 
groundless. Moreover, the deployment seriously violates 
relevant provisions of the Korea armistice agreement and it is a 
"dangerous military action" intensifying the situation on the 
Korean Peninsula. The DPRK has repeatedly reiterated that it 
hopes the nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue, and 
the exertion of pressure will not resolve the issue but will 
only make it more complex. 
  Over the last several days, there have been mass rallies in 
Pyongyang, Haeju, and Kaesong Cities, opposing the U.S. 
deployment of nuclear weapons in the ROK; and criticizing the 
U.S. action as an "open threat" to the DPRK and as an 
intentional act to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Participants in the rallies have demanded the United States 
halt the Patriot missile deployment immediately, and have said 
they will be on the alert against the U.S. action.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng held 
talks with visiting Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho here this 
afternoon. They exchanged views on bilateral ties, international 
concerns and other issues of common interest. 
  During the talks, Li recalled his meeting with Aho in 
Finland 
in 1992, when he stopped over on his way back from the Rio 
Conference on Environment and Development. 
  "I had a fruitful meeting with you," Li told Aho. 
  "Though the visit was short, it was very successful," Aho 
said. 
  The two countries have cooperated well in political, 
economic 
and other fields in recent years, Aho said, and there remains 
great potential for further economic and trade cooperation. 
  Li Peng agreed with this. He said that in recent years, the 
bilateral ties have been developing smoothly and that the 
economic and trade ties have scored relatively fast development 
and the trade volume has been increasing at an average two 
percent yearly. 
  And the number of scientific and technological cooperative 
projects have reached some dozens, Li said, adding that the 
majority of them perform well. 
  The two countries have also had good cooperation in the 
fields of culture and education, Li said. 
  He noted that Finland has rich experience in forestry, wood 
processing and environmental protection. There are lots of 
opportunities for the two countries to cooperate in these 
fields, he said. 
  The current visit here by many Finnish businessmen will help 
promote the contacts and cooperation between the two countries' 
enterprises, he said. He expressed the hope that more Finnish 
entrepreneurs would come and participate in China's economic 
construction. 
  Talking about the world situation, Aho noted that although 
the Cold War is over, the new world order has not been 
established and there still exist many regional problems in the 
world. The United Nations should play an important role in 
solution of these problems, he said. 
  Li said that although the world situation is moving toward 
relaxing of tensions, there are still many unstable factors, 
such as economic regression, national conflicts, and territorial 
disputes. 
  A new world order should be built in which all nations, 
whatever their ideologies, social systems or economic 
development levels, can live in peace and make joint efforts to 
tackle the peace and development issues facing today's world, Li 
said. 
  During the meeting, Li also elaborated on China's stance on 
human rights. 
  Li noted that the rights to survival and development are 
crucial to developing countries, a proposition recorded in the 
Vienna declaration and program on action. 
  When talking about human rights, differences in culture, 
history, traditions and economic development levels in different 
countries cannot be ignored, he said. 
  He noted that China is willing to conduct dialogues in this 
respect with other countries on the basis of equality, mutual 
respect and understanding. 
  Finland holds that the human rights issue should be 
discussed 
in a frank and friendly manner, rather than through criticizing 
and censuring, Aho said. 
  Touching on China's domestic situation, Li said that 
maintaining stability is an overwhelming task. Only with a 
stable domestic political situation and peaceful international 
environment can a country develop its economy and raise people's 
living standard, Li stressed. 
  During the talks, Aho showed much interest in China's 
economic performance. He told Li that the economy is growing 
slowly in Europe and that Finnish businesses want to intensify 
their cooperation with China and participate in its economic 
construction. This is very important to Finland's economy, he 
said. 
  Aho invited the Chinese premier to visit Finland at his 
convenience. Li received the invitation. 
  After the talks, the two sides signed an agreement for a 
cultural exchange program and a contract for the building of a 
disaster reduction system along the Yellow River. 
  Among those participating in today's talks were Chinese 
State 
Councillor and Minister in Charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission Song Jian, Director of the Foreign Affairs 
Office under the State Council Qi Huaiyuan and Finnish Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Veli Sundback. 
  Aho arrived here this morning for a six-day official visit 
to 
China at Li's invitation. 
  Prior to the talks, Li hosted a welcoming ceremony in Aho's 
honor. 
  After the talks, the two prime ministers met with Finnish 
businessmen and press representatives. 
  Asked about the talks, Li and Aho both responded that the 
talks were successful.

both say that political and economic relations between Finland 
and China have developed in a favorable way. Aho started an 
official visit to China today. The premiers concentrated on 
economic matters at their meeting. Aho hoped that China's 
willingness to curb the overheating of its economy would not 
have negative consequences for Finland's traditional cooperation 
projects. 
  China's human rights policy was also discussed. Aho 
reiterated Finland's stance that human rights are universal and 
everybody must respect them. According to Premier Li, China 
wants to adhere to the principles accepted at the UN human 
rights conference last year. China is of the opinion that these 
principles give China the right to apply its own cultural 
traditions in this matter.

  At the discussion today, German businessmen were satisfied 
with the investment environment in Beijing and showed great 
interest in some projects, sources said. 
  Yesterday, Beijing and Berlin signed a memorandum for 
becoming sister cities. 
  Under a related agreement, the first economic delegation, 
including siemens and benz, and headed by Berlin Mayor Diepgen, 
has started an inspection tour in Beijing. It will also go to 
Shanghai and Shenzhen.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Li Wenzheng (2621 2429 2398): </F>
"Impact on John Major's Position"] 
  [Text] London, 3 April (RENMIN RIBAO)--British Prime 
Minister John Major's inconsistent attitude toward voting 
mechanism reform in the European Union has strongly shocked 
British political circles and has also seriously rocked his own 
status. Because of uncertainty in the political situation, the 
money markets were upset, and the pound-mark exchange rate fell 
to its lowest point in five months. 
  On the afternoon of 29 March, Prime Minister Major delivered 
an official statement to Parliament, saying that Britain would 
accept a package from the Council of Ministers of the EU to 
reform the current voting mechanism. In his statement, Major 
defended himself by arguing that the EU had made concessions to 
Britain by agreeing that, although veto power remained at 27 
votes, a resolution could be postponed "for a reasonable time" 
if there were 23 opposition votes and that Britain would enjoy 
the prospect of additional provisions in the social charter. 
Major also explained that this was just "a transitional 
arrangement," as the EU would renegotiate the voting mechanism 
in 1996. He said that the EU would be expanded according to 
schedule in line with Britain's interests. 
  People remember that only one week ago, Major was still 
using 
tough words to indicate that he would not make any concessions 
on reforming the voting mechanism, and announced that he would 
"fight for Britain's interests." Just one week later, he made a 
180-degree turnaround and accepted the voting reform package. 
Although he tried hard to play down the impact of such a change 
in position, he still faced strong criticism from MP's. Labour 
MP's said that Major was "struggling in vain as he knew he could 
not win" and once again showed the "political stupidity of the 
Major cabinet." Conservative MP's put Major in a more 
embarrassing position. Conservative MP Tony Marlow, who has 
doubts about the European Community, said that this showed John 
Major had lost his "credibility" and "ability to lead the 
Conservative Party." He demanded that Major step down and give 
up his office to a more capable person. His speech was 
described by the mass media as the "fiercest attack on an 
incumbent prime minister in the past 30 years," and aroused 
strong repercussions in the Parliament. Other Euro-skeptics 
said that he "said what they wanted to say." Some celebrities, 
newspapers, and magazines in Britain also commented and held 
that John Major had lost the trust of the Conservative Party and 
the British public, and it seems it is hard to restore people's 
trust. In British political circles, a gust of strong wind is 
blowing to drive Major out of office. 
  The trend to unseat Major has also appeared inside the 
Conservative Party. Not long ago, four or five members of the 
British cabinet disagreed with John Major's idea about 
"returning to basic values"; after that, in an investigation of 
British arms sales to Iraq, Secretary for Trade and Industry 
Michael Heseltine, who played a key role as "political assassin" 
in the action to topple Mrs. Thatcher, held a different attitude 
from Major and other cabinet members, and this attracted 
extensive attention from the mass media. It is generally held 
that Heseltine has ambitions to "make a comeback" and has become 
a strong threat to Major. Reportedly, in a televised interview, 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also admitted that 
"when Major has no intention of being leader of the Conservative 
Party," he would "be willing to succeed Major." Reportedly, 
four members of Major's cabinet expressed doubts about the EU 
voting mechanism reforms. Although Heseltine and Clarke 
indicated separately on 31 March that they would continue to 
support Major, differences among senior officials of the 
Conservative Party were exposed. Authoritative people here said 
that as Major has no definite views of his own, his leading 
position inside the party would certainly be challenged at the 
party's annual conference next fall and would be in danger. 
According to the result of an opinion poll conducted by THE 
SUNDAY TIMES, one quarter of Conservative MP's agree that Major 
should step down. 
  In fact, Major was facing unmentionable difficulties when 
changing his position from strongly opposing the EU's voting 
mechanism reform to making a compromise. Britain has always had 
deep misgivings about the process of European integration, and 
the skeptics have a strong influence. Although Major upheld the 
point of "returning to the center of Europe," he cannot but make 
certain concessions to the skeptics from time to time; 
otherwise, his cabinet would often run into snags in the 
legislative process and his position would become more unstable. 
However, while holding a tough attitude toward the European 
Parliament, his foreign secretary demanded that concessions 
should be made toward the EU, and this forced Major to make the 
compromise he was not ready to make. Otherwise, Hurd would have 
submitted his resignation, which would have led to a cabinet 
crisis and would have also caused discontent in Germany and 
France. Moreover, the four new members of the EU would have 
been further pushed to Germany's side and Britain would have 
made itself more isolated. Recently, Major indicated that he 
had no intention of resigning from office; Secretary for Trade 
and Industry Heseltine and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth 
Clarke also put on a posture of safeguarding party unity. It 
seems that Major has ridden out another crisis. However, as 
some people in the ruling and opposition parties still call for 
deposing Major, it is also an undisputed fact that Major's 
leadership position has been further weakened.

  [Text] Xian, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, recently urged local officials here to 
better protect the Huangdi Mausoleum. 
  Li Ruihuan is a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China and honorary chairman of the China Huangdi Foundation. 
  Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) is a legendary ancestor of the 
Chinese nation and yesterday was a traditional festival on which 
Chinese commemorate their ancestors. 
  The Huangdi Mausoleum was of great significance for 
fostering 
Chinese culture, stimulating patriotism, strengthening national 
integration and advancing the modernization drive, Li said. 
  In the course of the Chinese modernization drive, how to 
unite overseas compatriots to the maximum extent and give full 
play to their potential and intelligence has always been a major 
topic, Li said. He pointed out that Huangdi is a highly 
representative figure in the history of the Chinese nation. 
  He called on the local government to give strong support to 
the repair and renovation of the mausoleum and to collect funds 
through public donations. 
  He noted that there must be a long-term plan for the repair 
and protection of the mausoleum. 
  Li Ruihuan conducted an investigation in Shaanxi Province on 
April 3-6. He inspected the No. 2 pit of the terracotta 
warriors being excavated and attended the public rites in honor 
of Huangdi yesterday.

<F P=106> [By Wang Tie (3769 6993): "A Review of the Combat Against </F>
Corruption and Its Outlook"] 
  [Text] Aiming at the rampant and extensive corruption 
emerging in the new era, China launched a new round of struggle 
against corruption in 1993. For a while, "fighting against 
corruption" appeared in the newspaper almost everyday and was 
quoted quite frequently in Chinese political life. Foreign 
media generally believed that China was unleashing another 
attack at corruption. 
<H5>  Results Scored by Anticorruption Drive '93 Marks the </H5>
Completion of One Stage 
  Broadly speaking, anticorruption work in 1993 consisted of 
three main tasks: Leading cadres maintaining self-discipline 
and staying clean themselves; investigation of serious and 
important cases; and correcting unhealthy practices in trades 
and professions. It can safely be said that in all three tasks 
the planned objectives have been achieved. 
  The requirement of staying clean and maintaining 
self-discipline for leading party and government cadres at or 
above the county and departmental levels stood out as more 
important than the other two parts in 1993 anticorruption 
work. The requirement was made directly of leading cadres 
at the county and departmental levels. Media generally believed 
that this was the key as well as the difficult point for the 
three main tasks and would determine the outcome of the 
struggle. It was also the area which the masses were most 
concerned about. 
  Stories from authoritative organs show that leading groups 
at or above the county and departmental levels across the 
country all made self-inspection in terms of "11 prohibitions" 
in 1993, and dealt with the problems thus uncovered according to 
relevant provisions. Leading cadres throughout the country 
handed in a great variety of gifts and largess: renminbi, Hong 
Kong dollars, US dollars, credit cards, various high-grade 
merchandise such as cameras, wristwatches, small video cameras, 
miniature color televisions, and gold coins, necklaces, rings, 
scissors, monkeys, and rams. In Shanghai, 318 bureau-rank 
cadres returned largess, gifts, credit cards, and securities 
worth about 272,900 yuan. News from Hunan revealed that by 
early November 1993, 18,000 cadres at or above the county and 
departmental levels in the province had by themselves uncovered 
2,563,700 yuan of largess and securities, 3,380 Hong Kong 
dollars, 14 gold necklaces, 39 gold rings, 26 miniature 
televisions, 21 cameras, and so on. 
  Concentrating on investigating serious and important 
cases was the second of the three parts of anticorruption work 
in 1993. The central authorities demanded vigorously 
pursuit of law- and discipline-breaking cases perpetuated by 
leading party and government organs, leading cadres, and 
judiciary, administrative and law-enforcement organs, especially 
cases involving serious abuses of power. Notable results were 
scored in this area. Localities and departments investigated 
and handled a number of cases: Xu Zhonghe, former mayor of 
Ruzhou City, Henan, accepted and solicited some 475,000 yuan in 
property and embezzled 10,000 yuan in public funds. Hong 
Yonglin, former chief of the Huizhou City Public Security 
Bureau, Guangdong, accepted 914,000 Hong Kong dollars and 
348,000 yuan in bribes, and failed to account for another 1.444 
million Hong Kong dollars and 693,000 yuan. Chen Binggen, 
former head of the Shenzhen City Housing and Property 
Administration, accepted a bribe of 12,000 yuan and a house and 
embezzled 110,000 yuan. Cases involving staff in 
law-enforcement and supervisory organs are as follows: Li 
Jianhui, an inspector of lieutenant rank with the Beijing 
Municipality Border Defense Bureau, and Zhao Dong, a deputy 
section head of major rank and a lieutenant-ranking inspector 
Wang Lin at the same bureau, accepted a total of 1,601,800 yuan 
in bribes. Parasites in the banking sector include: Xue Gen, 
former accountant at the Dongfeng Office of the Haikou Branch of 
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and co-conspirator 
Chen Yiquan together accepted 33.44 million yuan of corrupt 
money. Feng Yang, former financial planning section head of the 
Huzhou City Trust and Investment Company of the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China, and his co-conspirator Xu Jianxin 
together accepted 5.1 million yuan of corrupt money. Luo Yuhai, 
a former staff member of the operation section of the Bank of 
China head office, took some $400,000 in bribes and embezzled 
some $776,000 public funds.... Other economic crimes include: 
Wu Weidong, former transport section head of the material 
supply company of the China Huabei Electric Power Allied 
Corporation, took some 498,000 yuan in bribes. Guo Min, former 
operations section head of the Beijing Branch of the China 
National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, took 
some 960,000 yuan and embezzled some 880,000 yuan public funds. 
The Supreme People's Court upheld in the first half of November 
the death sentences for the five main offenders in million yuan 
corruption cases, who are: Lu Lanzhen, Liu Guifen, Jiang Jiaxu, 
Li Qiang, and Chen Haiqiang. 
  The investigation and bringing to justice of once-notorious 
corrupt elements greatly enhanced the deterrent power of law and 
discipline, prompting hundreds with serious economic offenses to 
confess and surrender themselves to law- and 
discipline-enforcement organs. 
  The third job in the 1993 anticorruption drive was to 
curtail a few unhealthy practices which the masses had reacted 
to most strongly. Following the second plenary session of 
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, administrative 
fees charged by central state organs since 1991 were screened, 
and some considered to be arbitrary levies were subsequently 
revoked over time. In the second half of October, the Ministry 
of Railway was the first to cancel 272 unreasonable charges and 
stop 84 surcharges levied on behalf of local governments. In 
the first half of November, the Ministry of Finance and State 
Planning Commission jointly announced the abolition nationwide 
of the first batch of fees, 75 in all, charged by the eight 
departments of public security, labor, personnel, railway, 
transport, post and telecommunications, banking, and civil 
aviation. In the second half of the same month, the State 
Education Commission abolished 21 arbitrary fees in secondary 
and primary education, and localities screened and abolished 
arbitrary local fees. 
  Regarding curbing publicly sponsored overseas trips (or 
those 
outside the borders), figures from 21 central departments, 11 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities show that up 
to mid-November, 1993, 715 publicly sponsored travel groups of 
about 7,555 people were canceled, saving the state enormous 
amounts of foreign exchange. By the end of the year, the 
unhealthy practice of sponsoring overseas (or 
outside-the-border) travel with public money had basically been 
halted. 
  Many professions and trade also singled out and dealt with 
unhealthy practices the masses reacted to strongly, and scored 
notable results. The railway sector dealt with the procurement 
of personal gain by illegitimately offering freight cars and 
train tickets; the post and telecommunications sector did the 
same with abuses in telephone installations; the banking sector 
dealt with the same problem with loans and discounts; the 
publication sector tackled the problem of "selling ISBN [book] 
numbers"; the news sector was against "news stories written for 
a price"; the public health sector addressed the problem of 
medical workers accepting "red packets"; agricultural 
departments made efforts to reduce peasant burdens, and so on. 
All these efforts addressed people's complaints and improved 
relations between the people and the party and government. 
<H5>  There Are Still Problems We Cannot Ignore </H5>
  All the three anticorruption tasks in 1993 achieved their 
targets. But there are still problems we cannot ignore, and the 
anticorruption mission remains very arduous. 
  Regarding cadres staying clean and maintaining 
self-discipline, some cadres are not taking this requirement 
seriously enough, or are just going through the motions. One 
situation that is often seen is: Revealing lesser offenses and 
avoiding serious ones or those that have been seen and not those 
that have not been seen, and addressing general problems instead 
of particular aspects of them. Some cadres revealed that 
they had received gifts such as fountain pens, briefcases, 
neckties, and shirts; but not cash, gift coupons, credit cards, 
and high-quality consumer goods. Some admitted to the things 
and money they had received from attending ribbon-cutting and 
various ceremonies, but not those secretly sent to their homes. 
Some looked at only the general aspect of the problem, such as 
grass-root cadres accepting party invitations and indigenous and 
special gifts such as tea and fruit, but not benefits and 
advantages received by individuals. In short, most of the 
problems exposed did nothing to the reputation or interests of 
the accused; only a few were followed with rectification, 
refunds, or investigation. 
  Some localities and departments refused to meet the central 
authorities' requirement of soliciting mass opinion prior to 
regular democratic-style party activity meetings, and failed to 
ask discipline inspection committees and organizational 
departments of a higher level to attend such meetings and to 
report to the masses the results of self-inspection. They only 
conducted such meetings perfunctorily, blatantly just going 
through the motion. 
  We should draw our attention to this situation: The 
monitoring mechanisms of supervisory departments do not follow 
closely enough the state of cadres staying clean and maintaining 
self-discipline. As a norm for conduct and education, staying 
clean and maintaining self-discipline is a measure that relies 
only on self-awareness. As such, its effect is very limited, 
and almost none for people with serious problems. That is why 
it has been called a method "binding only on gentlemen, not on 
scoundrels." So far self-inspection and self-correction have 
not made any corrupt elements come forward with confessions of 
their wrongdoings. 
  Extra-judicial pleas for mercy seriously obstruct 
investigations into big and important cases, making the 
investigations very difficult. This is a glaring problem 
in current anticorruption struggle. The popular practice of 
pleading for mercy points to many deep-seated problems. First, 
there is not a direct command chain running from top to bottom 
in the supervisory system. Judiciary and discipline inspection 
organs are under and run by local authorities, much of their 
work depends on the support and help of various departments. 
When someone pleads for an accused, especially when he is a 
leading cadre, the investigators are under pressure to weigh up 
the matter, thus affecting the impartiality of their 
investigation. Second, there is nothing in our law and 
discipline to stop or curb extra-judicial pleading. The person 
who pleads for an accused does not commit any crime or a 
discipline-breaking act, but he may gain gratitude without too 
much effort. Third, in some departments and units, some people 
are actively building personal networks, forming factions and 
sects, resulting in a situation of "officials protecting each 
other." 
  As regards correcting unhealthy practices in trades and 
professions, there are the following situations: Orders and 
bans are openly defied in some localities; some people have 
reined themselves in but are waiting for a chance to spring into 
action again. The central authorities and departments have 
issued circulars stipulating the items on which arbitrary 
charges are to be stopped, only to see them ignored by local 
authorities, who have continued to charge arbitrarily. Some 
local authorities committed fraud and forgery in order to 
legalize their arbitrary charges. A county falsely reported its 
per-capita income to be twice as high as its actual amount to 
make it look as if the money it levied in fund raising was no 
more than five percent of its per-capita income, as set by the 
State Council. 
  These problems cannot be ignored if the fight against 
corruption is to be pursued on a long-term basis and to come up 
with results. 
<H5>  Further Improve Policies, Laws, and Regulations </H5>
  One big problem in the current anticorruption effort is the 
lack of explicit legal and policy provisions on new problems 
thrown up by changes in the economic situation. Some policy 
and legal provisions are too rigid and not amenable to 
application. 
  Of the "11 prohibitions" concerning leading cadres staying 
clean and maintaining self-discipline made in last year's fight 
against corruption, people had complained most strongly against 
"prohibiting stock trading." First, though leading cadres were 
barred from buying stocks, there were no explicit bans on stock 
purchases by their spouses and sons and daughters. Second, 
there were no provisions stating whether there were refunds for 
returned internal worker stocks. Third, the spirit of the 
relevant regulations was that cadres at or above county and 
departmental levels with government duties were barred from 
buying or selling stocks. But there were no specific provisions 
advising ways to deal with changes in the identity of 
stockholders. A discipline inspection cadre in charge of stock 
screening told this writer the following similar cases: A 
person was transferred to a government unit, where he now works, 
after he had purchased some stock as a leading cadre in an 
enterprise; another was a serving cadre when buying stocks, 
though now he is retired; a cadre -- a department head -- was 
the head of a section when he bought in stocks; and a cadre had 
bought stocks before being demoted from department head to 
section head for some mistakes he made. It has been said that 
the ranking was not a scientific guideline deciding who can and 
cannot trade in stocks. Some section head-rank cadres wield 
enormous powers, and there are strong complaints against failure 
to inspect their corrupt behavior. 
  There is also the question of properly defining high 
consumption. Are the many local authorities' policies of 
rewarding bids that have successfully attracted capital and 
projects in order to develop local economies to be counted as 
paid intermediary activity? How do we handle the capital (from 
government unit investments, bank loans, money raised by cadres, 
and so on) sunk into party- or government-sponsored economic 
entities? All these problems call for investigations and study, 
corresponding measures, and explicit policies and legal 
provisions. 
<H5>  Anticorruption Efforts Must Solve Deep-Seated Problems </H5>
  The fight against corruption is a long-term, arduous, and 
complicated mission. For it to get real results, it is 
necessary to create a supervision and management system at a 
deep level. 
  Regarding supervision, our guiding thought has been that 
most 
of the people are good, and only a very few need to be punished. 
The shortcoming of such thinking becomes obvious when used to 
guide the effort to correct unhealthy practices. Most people 
caught in unhealthy practices are involved in general, minor 
corruption offenses. If we concentrate on only corrupt elements 
and leave most of the people unguarded, we would be letting 
these people committing minor corruption offenses escape our 
supervision, in effect encouraging them to continue making 
offenses. This is the reason many units, especially monopolies, 
law-enforcement and supervisory departments, and positions with 
financial or personnel powers, have without exception, many 
anticorruption provisions, which, however, were enacted to fool 
inspection from higher levels rather than supervise and bind the 
leaders themselves to rules. These anticorruption rules are 
written on paper and posted on walls, but are hardly 
implemented. In particular, when unhealthy practices such as 
arbitrary levies are linked with the awards, welfare, and work 
conditions of a unit, these unhealthy practices will be hardened 
into interest group behavior and become even more entrenched for 
the unit to do anything on its own. Social supervision, 
including media and public opinion, has only made vague 
criticisms and provided general guidance, or has exposed some 
typical incidents, none of which has had much practical 
supervisory impact on widespread unhealthy practices. 
  As for management, the biggest loophole is that under the 
new 
situation, we do not have a full package of methods to ensure 
rational employment of state-owned assets. In the eyes of many, 
the least valuable assets are public funds. There have been 
incidents of reckless spending of public funds, funneling state 
funds to unit coffers, and lining one's own pocket with public 
money. So widespread and frequent are these incidents that no 
amount of prevention and crackdown seem to be able to stop them, 
with the result that state-owned assets are actually providing 
the material basis for some unhealthy practices. 
  Regarding the economic structure, changes in governmental 
functions have been slow. Powers that should be delegated 
remain concentrated, streamlining and personnel cutbacks have 
not been carried out, and cumbersome procedures have not been 
simplified. Economic administrative departments do not 
coordinate among themselves in work and set up barriers against 
each other and complicated procedures, lowering efficiency. For 
their own local or departmental interests and to get things 
done, people have to "burn incense to pay homage to buddhas," 
and suffer the consequences if they forget to worship a certain 
budhha. People compete in holding banquets, giving gifts, and 
building up networks. The general standards for gifts become 
"giving the kind of gifts others do not have; new ones when 
others do have the same; or gifts in amounts larger than those 
given by my rivals." Gifts become increasingly expensive and 
banquets more upmarket, and in this twisted competition certain 
unhealthy practices gain ground and become generally acceptable 
"normal" behavior. 
  In the area of the financial system, one noted problem is 
the 
difficulty of maintaining regular funding for state organ 
expenditures, especially for organs related to social stability 
such as the public security apparatus, which has not been 
getting even remotely enough appropriations. Some public 
security organs cannot pay travel allowance to their personnel 
handling women's and children's abduction cases, and have to 
rely on "arbitrary levies" to subsidize operating expenditure. 
Such a situation, in which "another loophole appears shortly 
after one has been plugged," has caused some units to rely on 
arbitrary levies for both their regular and irregular 
expenditures. When departments of higher levels cannot solve 
problems, they can only turn a blind eye, in effect encouraging 
the unhealthy practice of arbitrary levies. The current travel 
allowance arrangement for government cadres are also very 
unreasonable. When a government cadre pays a work visit to 
organs at a lower level, cadres at that level without exception 
have to pay for his accommodation and food allowances, which 
forces them to engage in unhealthy practices. 
  There are also numerous problems in the cadre personnel 
system. In some units, promotions and dismissals depend entirely 
on certain individuals. When many who are ideologically 
unhealthy want to advance their official careers, they become 
eager to spin relationship networks, look for backers, pave 
their way by giving gifts, and recklessly spend public funds 
instead of making real efforts at their work, thus corrupting 
officialdom and fanning unhealthy practices. 
  There are also numerous loopholes in law and policies. Some 
tend to be too simple and exist merely as general principles, 
and therefore fail to clearly define encouragement, permission, 
and prohibition and areas between them. As such they cannot 
effectively regulate government workers. The scope and severity 
of punishments for some law- and discipline-breaking acts vary 
considerably, are hard to operate under, and therefore mutilate 
against the purposes of punishment. In particular, there are 
almost no constraints on collectives intent on engaging in 
unhealthy practices, with the result that many unhealthy 
practices are made under the excuse of providing welfare for 
workers and in the name of units and collectives to ensure that 
they will not be banned. 
<H5>  1994: The Fight Against Corruption Will Deepen </H5>
  Looking back at the 1993 anticorruption struggle, we have 
scored certain results in the three tasks proposed by the 
central authorities. Localities and departments which did well 
achieved outstanding results in some areas, where various 
negative and corrupt phenomena have been stopped or curbed. 
More importantly, through the year's anticorruption effort, 
people are now more confident. In the second half of February 
1994, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection convened 
its third plenary session to sum up experiences of the early 
phase of anticorruption drive and plan for anticorruption work 
in 1994 according central instructions. The anticorruption work 
this year will have the same format of concentrating on three 
tasks, which will, however, have new content as the situation 
has changed. 
  The work of enabling leading cadres of party and government 
organs at or above the county and departmental level to stay 
clean and maintain self-discipline will continue to implement 
last year's "five regulations" and reiterate the following 
regulations: 1) There is to be no buying or exchanging imported 
luxury sedans; there is to be no abuse of powers to exchange or 
borrow cars from enterprises and subordinate units or have them 
contribute money for car purchases. Cars used by leading cadres 
cannot be purchased with loans, money from raised funds, or 
special-purpose appropriations. Leading organs and units at the 
county (city) level owing workers pay are not allowed to buy 
sedans. 2) Cadres are not allowed to use their powers to 
depress prices of residential houses they intend to buy--that 
will be a violation of the State Council's regulations for 
housing reforms; or to provide better house buying terms for 
themselves, their sons or daughters or relatives; or to renovate 
their own houses with public money on a scale exceeding official 
limits. 3) Leading cadres must be economical in conducting 
domestic business travel, their lodging and meals must not cost 
more than set by local reception standards. No one is allowed 
to hold functions specially for leading cadres. 4) No one is 
allowed to make use of his or his family members' weddings, 
funerals, job transfers, birthdays, or house removals to spend 
recklessly or too much for the occasion, nor to hold 
celebrations for these occasions with public money or public 
property, with or without a view to pocketing money from such 
celebrations. 5) No one is allowed to use his powers to delay 
or refuse to pay back public money, to buy or build houses for 
themselves or their relatives or friends, or to engage 
profitmaking activities with borrowed public money. Subject to 
local situations, localities and departments can increase some 
other regulations as they see fit. 
  Case investigators must remain firm in their insistence on 
focusing on the law- and discipline-breaking cases involving 
leading party and government organs, leading cadres, judiciary 
departments, administrative and law-enforcing departments, and 
economic administrative departments and their workers. 
Investigators must concentrate their effort on big and serious 
cases and focus on bribery, corruption, and power abuse by 
leading cadres; jobbery, stealing confiscated goods, obstruction 
of justice, and law and discipline breaking by law and 
discipline enforcers; and law- and discipline-breaking cases by 
legal entities. 
  In the effort to correct unhealthy practices in professions 
and trades, it is necessary to continue to curb arbitrary levies 
vigorously. The focus is on implementing provisions of the 
central authorities' policy of "parallel lines between income 
and expenditure" in connection with administrative fees and 
income from fines and confiscations, and adopting effective 
measures to detach economic entities launched by government 
organs. This year, we also need to seriously screen and tackle 
the problem of party and government organs and their workers 
abusing their powers in using firms' cars, computers, and 
telecommunications without payments, and the problem of whether 
or not this equipment belongs to organs or individuals; screen 
and inspect the practice of funneling firms' funds into the 
pocket of units or spending these funds on workers' welfare 
under various excuses. We must resolutely curb the bad practice 
of asking sponsorships from enterprises under various excuses 
and continue to pursue the task of reducing peasants' burdens. 
We must conscientiously implement the "circular from the 
Central Committee General Office, State Council General Office 
on strictly forbidding overseas (or outside-the-border) travel, 
in whatever forms, which is sponsored by public funds" jointly 
issued by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection 
supervision department and six other departments. Moreover, we 
must make special efforts to tackle outstanding problems in this 
regard. The review and approval of travel under the 1994 
official overseas (outside-the-border) travel scheme will also 
be tightened up.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 7 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province is encouraging economic co-operation between the 
coastal and mountainous areas where developments are uneven. 
  The coastal cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou concluded 
hundreds of agreements on economic co-operation with the 
mountainous prefectures of Ningde, Longyan, Sanming and Nanping 
last year, with the former providing capital, technology and 
information to the latter. 
  The Sanming city alone signed 154 contract on economic 
co-operation with the coastal cities of Putian, Quanzhou and 
Xiamen, involving a total investment of 400 million yuan. The 
contracts cover the building materials, forestry and chemical 
industries, according to Guan Qing, chairman of the provincial 
economic cooperation office. 
  The economy in the coastal areas of the province is growing 
faster than the mountainous thanks to the policy of opening to 
the outside world. The provincial move is believed to be part 
of the nation-wide bid to narrow the gap between those 
comparatively developed and underdeveloped areas.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Weidi (1728 0251 1717)] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 110,000 township 
enterprises established by peasants in Jiangsu Province have 
said good-by to the small-scale production and low-level 
management that prevailed in their initial stage and begun to 
participate in the market competition at home and abroad with a 
fairly high level of productive forces. 
  Jiangsu's township enterprises have so far absorbed more 
than 
7.3 million workers, accounting for 80 percent of the total 
staff members and workers of the province, and their economic 
scale has rapidly expanded. Jiangsu Province established 110 
provincial-level township enterprise groups in the past few 
years. All these trans-regional and even trans-national large 
groups have fixed assets worth over 50 million yuan, and more 
than a half of them sell over 200 million yuan worth of goods a 
year. In the southern part of the province, which has become 
one of China's most important industrial areas, counties 
(cities) whose township enterprises create more than 20 billion 
yuan in industrial output value account for 50 percent of the 
total, and those where township enterprises' industrial 
aggregate exceeds 100 million yuan account for over 90 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990's, Jiangsu's township 
enterprises have greatly enhanced their capacity for 
participating in the international economic exchanges. 
According to statistics, they provided over 56 billion yuan 
worth of goods for export in 1993, accounting for about 30 
percent of the total value of the goods provided by all the 
township enterprises in the country for export. So far, 10,000 
township enterprises of Jiangsu Province have developed joint 
investment and cooperation with foreign firms, and the foreign 
capital to be brought in according to contracts totals more than 
$7 billion. In addition, they have established 230 enterprises 
in 36 countries and regions in the world. As was learned, 
one-third of the township enterprises in Suzhou city had been 
transplanted with the funds and technology from abroad, and 
one-fourth of the income of the city's industrial township 
enterprises was earned through the world market. 
  The technology and equipment and the technological 
development capacity of Jiangsu's township enterprises are also 
gaining more respect. According to pertinent departments, 
Jiangsu has invested more than 10 billion yuan in the technical 
transformation of its township enterprises over the past few 
years to enable over a half of them to purchase advanced 
domestic and foreign equipment. In Wuxi County, which is at the 
top of China's 100 strong counties, all the enterprises whose 
annual output value exceeds 50 million yuan have established 
research institutes to make the county China's largest rural 
scientific research base, with several hundred new products with 
fairly high technology content being developed yearly. 
  Since last year, Jiangsu Province has begun to reorganize 
the 
property rights of its township enterprises and has promoted the 
innovation of their systems through the shareholding system and 
the shareholding cooperation system. Nearly 10,000 township 
enterprises have experimented with the shareholding system. 
They have drawn in over 2 billion yuan by selling stocks, and a 
large number of rural private and individual enterprises have 
also purchased stocks from township enterprises. As was 
learned, Jiangsu's township enterprise groups organized through 
the holding and buying of shares and joint investment possessed 
10 percent of the total assets of all the province's township 
enterprises. 
  The high-quality development of Jiangsu's township 
enterprises is effecting a change in local rural society and 
accelerating its rural industrialization and modernization. 
According to a research report provided by the Jiangsu 
Provincial Academy of Agricultural Science, judging from the 
economic level, social structure, population quality, life 
quality, and other indicators adopted in the world, the rural 
areas in the southern part of Jiangsu Province have entered a 
stage of modernization ahead of others. As was learned, Wuxi 
city's per capita GNP exceeded 10,000 yuan last year, and the 
per capita income of its peasants was 2,240 yuan.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in east 
China's Jiangxi Province who have developed agriculture with 
funds from the World Bank are paying off the loans ahead of 
schedule. 
  A provincial government official in charge of agriculture 
said that the Jihu project, with a total investment of 445 
million yuan including 60 million U.S. dollars loaned by the 
World Bank, began four years ago. It was aimed at setting up 
production bases for domestic animals, poultry and forestry and 
developing the processing industry for farm and sideline 
products. 
  To ensure the smooth operation of the project, local 
governments have offered a package of 
production-supply-marketing services for farmers. 
  One who has benefited from the arrangement is Wang Doubin, a 
farmer in Zhangshu City who borrowed 95,000 yuan in loans to set 
up a pig farm in late 1990. 
  By the end of 1992, he had sold 828 lean meat pigs and had 
38 
breeding hogs and 277 meat pigs in stock. His net income that 
year amounted to 42,000 yuan. 
  The farmer paid off all the loans within three years. 
  Wang is a typical example of 1,800 households that have 
begun 
to pay off loans ahead of schedule. 
  A survey shows that the project has enabled local farmers to 
create an annual output value of more than 600 million yuan and 
generate profits and taxes totalling 150 million yuan. 
  The annual income of farmers involved in the project 
averages 
3,000 yuan per participant, about five times that of local 
farmers. 
  By the end of last year, the project had recovered 3.134 
million yuan to go toward retiring World Bank loans.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province has taken measures to promote grain 
production. 
  In recent years, the grain output in Guangdong has seen a 
decline due to a decrease of crop-growing area. As a result, 
the imbalance between grain supply and demand is worsening. 
  Guangdong Provincial People's Congress promulgated a set of 
regulations on a minimum size for a protection zone of farmland, 
which stipulated that the total area of the farmland protection 
zone should be more than 2 million hectares. 
  The provincial government also set a target of increasing 
the 
area of the farmland protection zone to more than 2.5 million 
hectares by the end of 1997. 
  It stressed that the crop growing area, including the double 
cropping area, should be about 3.3 million hectares in the 
province and the annual grain output should be maintained at 
17.5 million tons. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong Provincial Government and the 
government 
in some cities and counties will jointly invest in a grain 
development program for constructing 50 commodity grain bases in 
three years. 
  Jiangmen city has increased more than 20 percent of 
investment in farming production and it has decided from this 
year on to allocate 2 million yuan annually to aid farm 
production.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 6 (CNS) -- Illegal futures broking, 
speculation on foreign exchange and fund-raising have become 
rampant in Shenzhen in recent times, seriously disrupting 
economic order there and arousing great concern. 
  Information released by the Shenzhen Industrial and 
Commercial Administration shows that some unscrupulous elements 
from outside the country collaborated with others to engage in 
illegal futures broking, speculation on foreign exchange and 
fund-raising without prior authorization. The administration 
had on several occasions investigated some 230 cases of illegal 
futures broking during 1992 and 1993 alone with the seizure of a 
lot of computers and facsimile machines. Some of the suspects 
rounded up were dealt with by the judicial department. 
  An official from the administration said that it would soon 
launch a rectification of the futures market here in a bid to 
crack down on illegal futures broking and speculation in foreign 
exchange with the eventual aim of protecting the interests of 
investors, purifying the market there and safeguarding normal 
economic order. The official stressed that entities and 
individuals were not allowed to carry out futures broking 
without prior consent from the State Securities Commission and 
registration with the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce. He added that neither were they allowed to engage in 
financial futures business or foreign exchange trading as well 
as fund-raising without the approval of the People's Bank of 
China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control. 
People found in violation of these stipulations will be 
seriously dealt with in accordance with the law while those 
found breaching them repeatedly will be harshly punished and 
even will be sent to the judicial department for legal action.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The task force in charge 
of cracking down on smuggling across China recently held its 
third meeting, proposing: The tasks of China's antismuggling 
drive in 1994 follow: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and of the party's basic line, we should further 
implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and the national antismuggling work 
meeting in 1993, consolidate and develop based on past 
achievements, persistently and unwaveringly keep up our efforts, 
strengthen administration in an all-around manner, and 
resolutely and steadfastly intensify the antismuggling drive. 
  Li Lanqing, standing committee member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, State Council Vice Premier, and head 
of the task force in charge of cracking down on smuggling across 
China, chaired the meeting. 
  The meeting held: Since August 1993, various localities 
across China have conducted a large-scale antismuggling drive. 
Party and government leaders at various levels, customs, public 
security, the administration for industry and commerce, and 
judicial departments have earnestly implemented the instructions 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council; have 
unified common understandings; strengthened leadership; have 
coordinated concerted actions; reinforced discipline; and upheld 
the policy of "arresting culprits at sea, blocking them on land, 
checking them in ports, controlling them at markets, and 
severely punishing them." We have taken concerted antismuggling 
actions; have integrated joint efforts to crack down on 
smuggling with improved comprehensive administration over the 
antismuggling drive; have stopped rampant smuggling activities 
in some localities; have screened and rectified markets of 
smuggled goods; and have penalized a group of smugglers. 
Consequently, the antismuggling drive has yielded interim 
results. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six 
months China has uncovered 10,062 cases involving smuggling and 
sales of smuggled goods amounting to 2.64 billion yuan. 
  The meeting proposed: While conducting the nationwide 
antismuggling drive in 1994, we should further improve our 
understanding of the important significance in the antismuggling 
drive and should strengthen leadership in organizing work in 
this regard. We should promptly and specifically launch special 
antismuggling campaigns in accordance with popular issues in 
smuggling activities to prevent another new wave of smuggling 
activities from recurring. We should strictly prevent car- 
smuggling, which has already been stopped, from recurring; and 
should severely crack down on illegal activities at sea, 
including smuggling of cigarettes and home electric appliances. 
We should further intensify the investigation and handling of 
major and important smuggling cases; should severely penalize 
smugglers according to law; should strictly enforce the law, 
supervise, and inspect; and strengthen the development of 
antismuggling personnel. 
  Li Lanqing said in his speech: The antismuggling drive is a 
protracted and arduous struggle. It yielded interim results 
after we have worked hard for more than six months. However, we 
definitely cannot lower our guard against the serious situation 
facing the antismuggling drive, and future antismuggling tasks 
are still quite arduous. He stressed: In 1994, we must 
realistically improve the understanding of leaders at various 
levels that the antismuggling drive is a protracted and arduous 
struggle; further improve our self-consciousness to carry out 
the antismuggling drive and regard the drive as an important 
component of the anticorruption struggle; and persistently and 
unwaveringly keep up the efforts so as to accomplish greater 
achievements.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The China Automobile 
Import and Trading Center should be the main channel for 
importing automobiles, said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing. 
  He told a working conference of the center that the center 
should do well in services and not seek profits. 
  The premier said that there should be other channels for 
importing automobiles but they should be subject to 
macro-economic control. 
  He encouraged automobile importing firms to import more 
technology in order to upgrade China's auto industry which is on 
the road to maturity. 
  The China Auto Import and Trading Center, a legal entity, 
was 
approved by the State Council in June last year. Since then, it 
has imported 14,000 automobiles from the United States and 
formulated relevant marketing rules. It has also carried out 
bonded businesses for imports and barter trade.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's management 
rules on assessing foreign investment in kind will start taking 
effect on May 1, official sources said here today. 
  Promulgated and issued jointly by the State Administration 
for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities and the 
Ministry of Finance, the rules break down into 28 clauses, which 
clearly state the aims and application scope of the rules and 
other related matters, such as who to appraise, what to appraise 
and how to appraise it as well as what the legal 
responsibilities are for the parties concerned. 
  The administration will use spot examinations, technical 
surveys and check-ups, value appraising and other methods mapped 
out by the rules to assess foreign-supplied equipment, whose 
value will be measured according to their existing conditions, 
performance indicators, technical parameters and profit-making 
power. 
  The value appraising method is based on three factors: the 
market situation, cost and profitability potential. 
  According to the rules, the administration will refer to the 
current market prices for the same or similar assets to decide 
the value of foreign assets. 
  The assessing process will also take into account the 
assets' 
real condition, life expectancy, functional development, 
projected profit-earning power and appropriate discounting rate, 
the rules added. 
  An official from the administration said that 
foreign-invested enterprises have flourished in recent years, 
and China has so far actually utilized more than 60 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign investment. 
  However, the official said, the proportion of foreign 
investment in kind has been increasing over the years to reach 
more than 40 percent of the total at present. 
  He noted that inaccurate appraisal, overvaluing of foreign 
assets, substituting the new with the old and high-quality 
assets with low-quality items and other foreign investment 
cheats have taken place frequently. 
  The official said that the healthy development of China's 
foreign-invested enterprises will be harmed if such problems are 
not solved promptly, adding that fairly and accurately assessing 
foreign assets has become a major guarantee for the legal 
interests of all parties involved.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently issued a circular on strengthening supervision over 
prices of daily necessities and fees of various services for 
citizens. The circular pointed out that, to suit the need for 
establishing a socialist market economy, guide the adjustment of 
prices and guarantee the stability of people's living 
conditions, the State Council decided to supervise the prices of 
daily necessities and fees of various services for citizens. 
  The prices of daily necessities and fees of various services 
mean the prices of important consumer goods and services that 
have very close links to citizens' daily lives. Changes of 
those prices will affect the people's living conditions. The 
supervision over prices of daily necessities and fees of 
services for citizens is to watch the trend of prices and fees 
through a system of reporting and keeping track of changes of 
prices and fees to provide information for making macroeconomic 
decisions, and, if necessary, examine the behavior of price 
increases and excercize appropriate intervention. The prices and 
fees of 20 categories of goods and services will be supervised, 
namely: flour; polished long-grain rice; polished round-grain 
rice; edible vegetable oil; pork, beef, or mutton; eggs; milk; 
salt; sugar; soy sauce; detergent; coal; propane gas; natural 
gas for household use; housing rent; running water; school 
tuition and fees; childcare fees; medical care fees; and public 
transportation fees in cities. Various locales may decide 
specific items of each category to be examined in light of their 
local conditions. 
  The circular points out: If the prices and fees of items 
under these categories are decided by the local government, the 
change of prices and fees should be reported to the department 
in charge of prices at the next higher level. The adjustment of 
prices or fees of items administered by the provincial 
department in charge of prices should be reported to the State 
Planning Commission 10 days before the change of price or fee. 
The change of prices of items of which the prices are regulated 
by the market should be reported to local departments in charge 
of prices five days before the change by production or 
operational enterprises. 
  The circular points out: It is necessary to strengthen and 
improve the means of controlling the adjustment of prices of 
daily necessities and fees for services. It is necessary to 
establish a storage system for grain, oil, meat, and other 
important commodities. It is necessary to quicken the 
establishment of risk funds for grain at central and provincial 
(autonomous region and municipality) levels, and waste no time 
in developing a regulatory fund system for supplementary food 
products. Departments in charge of prices in various locales 
should formulate appropriate rates of differences in purchasing 
and selling, the rate of differences of wholesale and retail 
sales of certain important commodities, the rate of processing 
fees, and the rate of profits for reference by enterprises in 
deciding prices. If necessary, the departments in charge of 
prices may ask concerned enterprises to follow those rates with 
the approval of the local people's government. In times when 
the prices of daily necessities and fees of services fluctuate 
in a drastic manner, the departments in charge of prices may 
temporarily limit the price change with the approval of the 
local people's government. Departments in charge of prices in 
various locales may periodically announce sales reference prices 
for vegetables and other perishable products according to the 
prices of the wholesale market in various locales, and provide 
guidance for the trend of market prices. 
  The circular also asks departments in charge of prices in 
various locales to periodically examine the prices of 
commodities and fees of services that should be watched, to 
check enterprise implementation of the state price policy, to 
check the situation of making reports on price changes by 
various enterprises, and to check on controlling the rates of 
price differences. The departments in charge of prices should 
strengthen supervision and inspection of prices of daily 
necesssities and services fees, and strictly investigate and 
handle cases in violation of related stipulations according to 
the law.

<F P=106> [By Kent Chen] </F>
  [Text] China plans to introduce new rules governing the 
settlement of business disputes on June I [as published] in a 
move to improve the efficiency and authority of the country's 
arbitration mechanism. 
  The revision of the rules governing the China International 
Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) follows an 
increase in the number of disputes in recent years with the 
influx of foreign investment. 
  Last year, CIETAC dealt with 504 cases, an increase of 88 
percent over 1992. The surge in the number of disputes going to 
arbitration underscores the inadequacy of the current rules 
which were last amended in 1989. 
  "Because of the increased number of cases, CIETAC needs to 
adopt clearer rules and bring its procedures into line with 
international practices," said Michael Moser, a resident partner 
at the Beijing office of international law firm Baker &amp; 
McKenzie. 
  Mr Moser is one of five foreign nationals appointed by the 
Chinese Government to CIETAC's panel of arbitrators. 
  Mr Moser said that in recent years, more foreign companies 
had been involved in disputes compared with five years ago, when 
most cases involved mainland and Hong Kong firms. 
  Moreover, the scale of the disputes being brought to CIETAC 
has increased and multi-million dollar sums are not uncommon. 
  Five years ago, most disputes involved the sale or purchase 
of goods, but increasingly they involved joint ventures. 
  To cope with the growing demand for arbitration, about 290 
arbitrators will be appointed, a substantial increase from the 
current 90. Of the new line-up about 80 will be foreigners. 
  Previously CIETAC's powers were ill-defined, but the new 
rules will substantially expand its role, empowering it to deal 
with international and foreign-related disputes and those 
between foreign companies operating in China. 
  "When both parties in a dispute are foreign companies, 
CIETAC 
can accept the case under the new rule and if the dispute is 
between two Chinese companies, it can also be arbitrated if the 
issue in dispute is foreign-related. The old rules never made 
this clear," said Mr Moser. 
  A second major change tightens up the CIETAC rules with 
regard to conflict of interest on the part of arbitrators. 
Under the old rules, either party could object if an arbitrator 
had a conflict of interest in a case. However, the old rules 
did not require voluntary disclosure of a conflict of interest. 
  The new rules make it clear that an arbitrator appointed to 
handle a case must voluntarily disclose any conflict of interest 
and refuse to handle the case. 
  "This is important to bring CIETAC up to international 
standards," said Mr Moser. 
  A third area of change covers the power of arbitrators to 
collect evidence independently. The old rules stated that 
during the arbitration, the arbitrator could collect his own 
evidence but was not required to show it to the parties in the 
dispute. 
  "Many people think this is unfair. So the new rules require 
that the arbitrator must show his independent evidence to the 
parties and allow them to comment on that," Mr Moser said. 
  A fourth amendment puts a time limit on the giving of a 
ruling. "Five years ago when there were not so many cases, 
CIETAC arbitration was relatively speedy and most cases were 
resolved within a year. Now, because of the large number of 
disputes, cases can take two years or longer before a ruling is 
made. 
  "The new rules require that the arbitrators must issue a 
decision within nine months from the date the arbitration 
tribunal is formed to guarantee cases are handled without 
delay," said Mr Moser.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Ten years ago, a 
person who left a state-owned unit to join a township or private 
business would soon become a local celebrity described as daring 
to "swim" in China's economic reform. 
  But now, taking the dive has become a daily occurrence. 
  Last year, tens of thousands of technicians in economically 
strong east China broke their "iron rice bowls" and found jobs 
in enterprises not run by the state. 
  Experts held the enforcement of retirement insurance as one 
of the determining factors in this conceptual revolution, as 
people in collective or private businesses can also draw old-age 
pensions. 
  It is a far cry from the old labor insurance regulations, 
which were drawn up in the early 1950s and providing that only 
the staff in state enterprises could enjoy free medical 
treatment and old-age pensions. 
  So far, 85 million employees throughout the country have 
taken out the new retirement insurance. 
  The new system, under which premiums are shared between the 
government, employers and retirees, has covered more than 
500,000 businesses, giving benefits to 17 million retirees. 
  In 1990, trial operation of the new pension insurance 
started 
in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province. 
  Seeing its initial success, over 300 cities have followed 
suit. 
  As early as three years ago, over 90 percent of Nanchang's 
enterprises and 500,000 people were included in the system. 
  Now, about 90,000 persons have retired on an annual pension 
of 20 million yuan raised in the new way. 
  People welcome the new rules, for they have removed or 
reduced an obstacle to changing jobs. 
  Statistics show that from January to August last year, 70 
percent of over 10,000 job hunters in Nanchang city streamed 
into non-state firms. And more than 3,000 engineers and 
managers flowed to township businesses in Zhejiang Province. 
  Even people in state-owned enterprises have realized that 
the 
system can help them hold the "iron rice bowl" more firmly. 
  For example, workers in the Nanchang No. 1 Linen Textile 
Factory, which suffered losses for several successive years, 
have had a hard time, while the retired can obtain full pension 
from the municipal social insurance bureau. 
  Xiong Xiaofeng, an official with the city's labor bureau, 
surmised that China's fast developing market economy has 
necessitated the system. 
  At present, the insurance sector in Nanchang has extended 
into such areas as unemployment, maternity and industrial injury 
coverage. 
  Last year, the city paid two million yuan in compensation to 
900 lying-in women, people injured on the job and people out of 
work. 
  Xiong said that there is a long way to go for China to set 
up 
a sound insurance system, to relieve the heavy financial burden 
on enterprises which have to cover big-number medical bills and 
old-age pensions for their employees.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's mobile 
telecommunications business has maintained rapid development in 
the first season of this year. The first three months saw 
nearly 150,000 new mobile telephone subscribers, bringing the 
total figure of national subscribers to 784,500. 
  Meanwhile, wireless paging subscribers increased by more 
than 
852,000, bringing the total number of wireless paging 
subscribers to more than 6.456 million. 
  Mobile telecommunications appeared in China's mainland but a 
few years ago. However, the rapid development of the sector has 
been fairly surprising. 
  In 1993 there were 461,000 new subscribers of mobile 
telephones, 2.7 times the total figure for previous years, while 
wireless paging had 3.384 million new subscribers, 1.5 times the 
total figure for previous years. At present China's wireless 
paging system has become the third largest in the world after 
those in the United States and Japan. 
  Experts believe that China's mobile telecommunications 
business is now enjoying a golden time for development. 
  For several years in succession, China's economy has been 
steadily developing at a fairly high speed, which poses an 
urgent demand for speeding up the development of 
telecommunications business. And the state has also been paying 
special attention to this field, with some 40 billion yuan put 
into posts and telecommunications fixed assets last year. This 
year the planned investment in fixed assets has been raised to 
53.6 billion yuan, in a bid to reinforce the capital 
construction of telecommunications. 
  So far, all Chinese provincial capitals have begun mobile 
telephone service, and over 300 cities have opened mobile 
telephone systems. 
  The development of mobile telephones will at last realize 
the 
goal of national automatic roaming service. Sources said some 
provinces, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, 
Guangdong, Liaoning and Shandong, have already provided roaming 
services within their own territories, while the Zhujiang River 
delta, including the cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen, 
has taken the lead in the country in carrying out inter-regional 
roaming services. 
  At the end of last year, automatic roaming services also 
opened in the Chang Jiang River delta, with Shanghai city, 
Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces included. 
  Sources from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
said that at present the country is making efforts to construct 
a national mobile telephone network. By the middle of this 
year, over 80 percent of coastal cities and towns will be 
covered by the network; by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
(1991-1995), cities above the prefectural level will all open 
their own mobile telephone services, and at that time the 
network will cover all of the country's medium-sized cities. 
  The rapid development of mobile telecommunications business 
also provides a good development opportunity for China's mobile 
telecommunications industry. 
  Facing the present situation in which 90 percent of the 
country's mobile telecommunications market has been occupied by 
Motorola and other foreign companies, related Chinese 
departments have marked the research and production of advanced 
mobile telecommunications equipment as a field for key 
development. 
  Materials show that in the past two years China's mobile 
telecommunications industry has achieved considerable results. 
The Hangzhou Telecommunications Equipment Factory has 
constructed a production line capable of producing 200,000 
mobile telephones a year. Last year it produced more than 
80,000 mobile telephones, while this year it plans to turn out 
105,000. 
  In addition, the Beijing Telecommunications Equipment 
Factory 
has just finished a production line, with an annual output 
capacity of 150,000 digital mobile telephones; some 
telecommunications enterprises in Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan, 
Shanghai and some other places have also introduced foreign 
production lines and will start production in the near future.

<F P=106> [Report: "10 Major Exchanges Take Shape in Shanghai"] </F>
  [Text] Following the establishment of its stock exchange 
in 1990, Shanghai has set up 10 major exchanges including those 
for stocks, metals, chemicals, cereals and oils, automobiles, 
petroleum, building materials, technology, coal, and 
agricultural means of production. By extensively applying 
hi-tech, advanced world standards, such as high-capacity 
computers and satellite communications, as well as standardized 
managerial systems, these exchanges have realized paperless 
operations. Of the 10 exchanges, the stock exchange can handle 
as many as 1,800 transactions a second, with a daily average 
transaction volume of 900 million yuan, and the cereals and oils 
exchange handles a daily average volume of 800 million yuan. 
Equipped with a complete range of functions covering a wide 
area, these exchanges are exerting an increasingly conspicuous 
influence. Shanghai has become China's biggest stock and 
futures exchange and has taken another step toward becoming an 
international financial and trading center.

  Enterprises removing identity divisions include public 
enterprises, collective enterprises, domestically associated 
enterprises, foreign-funded joint-stock enterprises, and private 
enterprises. Employees of the aforesaid enterprises are 
referred to as enterprise employees and enterprises are 
implementing a system where all employees sign labor contracts. 
However, instead of signing a labor contract, an enterprise 
director, manager, or chairman of the board will sign a contract 
to attain given objectives during his or her term of service or 
a written statement listing the responsibilities of the chairman 
of the board. Enterprises will be classified according to their 
size and their grades designated according to their performance. 
They will institute a system of classifying, rating, examining, 
and assessing enterprises on the basis of prevailing 
international indexes. Entrusted by the city party committee and 
the city government, the organization department of the city 
party committee and the city investment management company will 
manage leading cadres in state-owned enterprises according to 
different categories.

  [Text] Urumqi, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Turpan-Hami oilfield 
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be 
able to pump 24.5 million bbl (over three million tons) of crude 
oil annually by the end of 1995, according to an oilfield 
official. 
  Located in the 48,000 sq km Turpan-Hami basin, the oilfield 
is currently capable of producing 1.58 million tons a year, the 
official said, adding that it pumped 1.15 million tons in 1993. 
  The recoverable oil reserves of the oilfield are estimated 
at 
1.6 billion tons, and its natural gas reserves at 365 billion cu 
m [cubic meters]. 
  Drilling of the oilfield began three years ago. So far six 
oil- gas-fields and nine oil- and gas-bearing structures have 
been discovered.

<F P=106> [By Chao Wen (6872 2429)] </F>
  [Text] In order to implement the spirit of the work 
conference sponsored by the CPC Central Committee, the Ministry 
of Agriculture recently and further made arrangements in line 
with the situation in agriculture and rural areas for easing the 
burdens of peasants. In its arrangements, the ministry urged 
the relevant departments of various localities to unswervingly 
implement a series of policies and measures issued by the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council with regard to easing 
peasants' burdens. It also urged them to consolidate their 
achievements in this regard, to prevent relapse, to enhance the 
standardized and legalized management over peasants' burdens, to 
protect the economic interest of peasants, and to safeguard the 
social stability of rural areas to promote the increase of 
peasants' income and the decrease of their expenses. 
  The six specific measures put forward by the Ministry of 
Agriculture are as follows: 
  1. Successfully grasping examination and verification. The 
Ministry of Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments 
will strictly examine and verify in line with the law the items 
that have been abolished or postponed for implementation by the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Local supervisory 
and managerial departments in charge of easing peasants' burdens 
at all levels should actively coordinate with the relevant 
departments to implement in a down-to-earth manner the policies 
for easing peasants' burdens under the leadership of local 
governments. Efforts should be made to strictly check and handle 
documents and items related to giving burdens to peasants, which 
have not been approved through legal procedures. 
  2. Successfully managing and using the funds retained from 
peasants for overall projects. In line with the State Council's 
"regulations on the management over charges and labor work 
undertaken by peasants" and the provision on the 5-percent fixed 
volume, we should enhance auditing of specific items of 
peasants' burdens and prevent indiscriminate transfer and 
misappropriation of funds collected from peasants and from their 
labor work. We should achieve results in using the special 
fund for special purposes and having peasants take up special 
labor work for special projects. Efforts should be made to 
resolutely correct faulty collections in 10 fields, which are 
proscribed by the formal decree, and to improve managerial 
methods on these collections. No one is allowed to collect more 
charges from peasants by exaggerating the per peasant income. 
  3. Earnestly investigating and handling the vicious cases of 
adding to peasants' burdens. The relevant departments should 
strictly investigate and handle the vicious cases that occurred 
in their own locality in 1993 and the prominent problems exposed 
in the course of judicial inspection. Efforts should be made to 
strictly deal with the vicious cases cropping up this year so as 
to further safeguard the stability of rural society. 
  4. Carrying out consolidation over specific items. By 
bearing in mind the current work of anticorruption and workstyle 
rectification, we should conduct the management of specific 
items in line with the demand put forward by Premier Li Peng in 
his "government work report" made at the second session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress with regard to "continuously 
implementing the measures of easing peasants' burdens and 
carrying out consolidation over the specific items to deal with 
the prominent problems". We will continue to conduct judicial 
inspection over the work of easing peasants' burdens this year. 
  5. Realistically enhancing the construction of legal 
systems. 
The Ministry of Agriculture and relevant departments will firmly 
grasp the formulation of the "regulations on auditing the 
specific items for charges and labor work undertaken by 
peasants" and the "regulations on punishing the acts of adding 
to peasants' burdens". They will enforce the card system of 
supervising peasants' burdens and the system of formulating 
budget for peasants' burdens as well as gradually enforce the 
system of assigning full-time personnel to supervise peasants' 
burdens. 
  6. Conducting the pilot work of setting an example for and 
monitoring peasants' burdens. In line with the directives given 
by the leading personnel of the State Council, the Ministry of 
Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments will select 
counties (cities) according to their regional economic 
situation, which have representative characteristics, to carry 
out deep-rooted reform in the pilot and demonstration work in 
this regard. In line with the level of peasants' incomes, they 
will establish the network and centers of monitoring peasants' 
burdens so as to grasp, in a timely manner, the level of their 
production, business, and incomes, as well as the trends of 
their burdens, so that they can render service for macroeconomic 
policies.

<F P=106> [Speech by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party </F>
committee, at the regional meeting on propaganda and ideological 
work on 2 March] 
  [Text] The regional meeting on propaganda and ideological 
work is a very important one. The major tasks of the meeting 
are to conscientiously carry out the guidelines of the national 
meeting on propaganda and ideological work, and to mobilize all 
levels of leaders, all Communist party members, and all comrades 
on the propaganda and ideological front in the region to further 
seek unity of thinking, enhance morale, grasp the overall 
situation, and do a solid job to create a new situation in 
propaganda and ideological work in order to continuously push 
forward reform, opening up, and modernization of the region. 
  At this point, I would like to dwell on three issues. 
  1. The issue of the important significance in doing the 
propaganda and ideological work well during the new situation. 
  An important meeting with overall significance, the national 
meeting on propaganda and ideological work was held not too long 
ago by the CPC Central Committee at a critical moment when China 
was building a new socialist market economic system and carrying 
out the modernization drive. Important speeches made by central 
leading comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding 
Guangen at that meeting have profoundly expounded upon the 
importance of the propaganda and ideological work during the new 
period, have set forth major missions that should be shouldered 
by propaganda and ideological work departments in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and have called on the 
whole party to strengthen and improve leadership over propaganda 
and ideological work in a bid to raise propaganda and 
ideological work to a new level. The fundamental principles and 
the major tasks set forth by that meeting are characterized by 
the distinctive feature of the times, are major policy decisions 
adopted by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
its core, to carry out the principle of "taking a two-handed 
approach and being tough with both hands," and are the strategic 
dispositions for ensuring the triumphant progress of the cause 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully 
implementing the guidelines of that meeting in line with the 
realities of the region is of great, immediate and far- reaching 
historical significance in carrying out the work principle of 
"seizing favorable opportunity to deepen reform, expand the 
scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability," in promoting the reform, development, and stability 
of the region, in bringing up new generations of people who are 
politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and 
well-disciplined, in consolidating and developing socialist 
relations among all nationalities, and in building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. All Communist party members in 
the region, leading cadres at all levels in particular, must 
fully understand the great significance of the national meeting 
on propaganda and ideological work, conscientiously study the 
documents of that meeting, profoundly comprehend the guidelines 
of that meeting, and make great efforts to truly implement the 
work ideas and various dispositions defined by that meeting in 
doing practical work. 
  Within the magnificent cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and ideological front is 
an important front shouldering the important task of providing 
spiritual motivation, ideological guarantee, and intellectual 
support. Our party has always attached high importance to 
propaganda and ideological work. Since the third plenary 
session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has made many brilliant and distinct expositions on 
strengthening the party's propaganda and ideological work. He 
has repeatedly stressed the necessity of putting propaganda and 
ideological work in an extremely important place and actually 
paying attention to the work without any slackness. The third 
generation of the party's leading collective, with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as its core, has paid extremely high attention to 
propaganda and ideological work and has set forth a series of 
correct principles, policies, and demands on the propaganda and 
ideological work under the new situation. We should profoundly 
comprehend and earnestly implement these principles, policies, 
and demands. 
  As far as our Inner Mongolia Region is concerned, 
strengthening propaganda and ideological work is of especially 
important significance. First, our region is located in the 
border area where the economic and cultural conditions are 
relatively backward, the reform and economic development tasks 
are very heavy, and the tasks of emancipating the mind and 
changing concepts are more arduous than any other place. Thus 
we are required to widely create public opinions and open a path 
for unceasingly emancipating the mind, changing concepts, and 
accelerating reform and development through our propaganda and 
ideological work. Second, as China will issue the greatest 
number of reform measures this year than in any previous year, 
we will face many difficulties. Particularly in places like our 
region, which is restricted by conditions in various aspects, 
people are relatively weak in withstanding the reform strain and 
will thus have more ideological problems. This requires our 
efforts to strengthen guidance through our propaganda and 
ideological work, help the people correctly recognize the 
situation, and understand reform in an effort to more 
extensively mobilize the masses to support and participate in 
reform and to guarantee success in reform. Third, ours is a 
regional autonomous region of minority nationalities and a major 
region where the current international hostile forces have 
stepped up their efforts to implement the strategy of 
"westernization" and "disintegration" in our country. The 
activities of "Pan-Mongolism" have been aggravated abroad and 
class struggle still exists to a certain degree in China. We 
are facing a fairly complicated struggle in political and 
ideological spheres. Thus we are required to strengthen 
propaganda and ideological work and strengthen education on the 
political situation, on the Marxist nationalities concept and 
the religious concept, and on our party's nationalities policy 
and religious policy. Only thus, can we effectively resist the 
plots of " westernization" and "disintegration" of the hostile 
forces at home and abroad, consolidate and develop an excellent 
situation of stability and unity in our region, and effect a 
long period of order and stability in the border areas. In the 
face of this new situation and new task, we must pay greater 
attention to propaganda and ideological work. This work must be 
strengthened and not weakened; and be improved and enhanced and 
not be allowed to remain stagnant. 
  During recent years, our region has made great achievements 
in propaganda and ideological work, and played a positive role 
in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Party committees at all levels have paid 
attention to promoting and guaranteeing the accomplishment of 
all tasks through propaganda and ideological work. The 
situation in which the whole party attends to propaganda and 
ideological work is being formed. Generally speaking, all 
departments on the propaganda and ideological front are capable 
of carrying out their work in line with the party's basic line, 
and have submitted themselves to and served the central task of 
economic construction, conducted education on the party's basic 
theories and basic line, on patriotism, collectivism, socialism, 
and national unity, done much work to introduce our region's 
typical cases and experience in reform and development, to 
strengthen spiritual civilization in the urban and rural areas 
and external propaganda work, and to invigorate the cultural 
sphere, and made new progress in many aspects. The regional 
party committee and government are satisfied with the propaganda 
and ideological work and trust the ranks of propaganda and 
ideological workers. 
  While recognizing the achievements, we should also recognize 
that our propaganda and ideological work is not compatible with 
the development of the current situation. The party and 
government leaders in some localities have failed to pay 
sufficient attention to propaganda and ideological work, and 
have the problem of being "soft with one hand and tough with the 
other hand" in practical work. Efforts are needed to adopt a 
clear-cut stand and further enhance the ability to specifically 
conduct propaganda and ideological work; strengthen theoretical 
study and propaganda in close connection with reality, and 
provide support and guarantee for reform, development, and 
stability; and further improve cultural and economic policies. 
To solve these problems, we must further conscientiously study 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, profoundly understand its essence, and 
strive to enhance our awareness and steadfastness in 
implementing this theory. 
  Persisting in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach 
and ensuring that both hands are tough" is the basic principle 
of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as set 
forth by Comrade Xiaoping under the new historical conditions. 
This basic principle demonstrated gigantic forces and produced 
profound influence when there was severe unrest in the 
international situation, major domestic reform was being carried 
out, and the western hostile forces were launching 
"westernization" and "disintegration" strategies against us. We 
should proceed from reality to study this important idea of 
Comrade Xiaoping and emphatically solve the following three 
ideological and practical problems. 
  First, we should firmly define the awareness of "taking a 
two- hand approach." In building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we should not only replace poverty with wealth 
but also replace ignorance with civilization to form a healthy, 
scientific, and civilized way of life. Comrade Xiaoping pointed 
out during his inspection of south China in 1992: "To catch up 
with the `four little dragons of Asia' in the next 20 years, 
Guangdong should not only promote its economy and improve the 
social order and the general mood of society but also surpass 
them in building material and spiritual civilizations. This is 
the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics." The 
party as a whole is warned that socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a socialism characterized by highly developed 
material and spiritual civilizations. In their real life, some 
comrades regard economic construction as a "tangible task" and a 
"real target" and the improvement of party style and 
administrative honesty and the ideological and political work as 
an "intangible task" and an "impractical target." So, they 
placed the improvement of party style and administrative honesty 
and the ideological and political work in a marginal position. 
We must clearly define that the basic line of the party is to 
take the economic construction as a key link. This key link 
must be neither obstructed nor attacked. The work in various 
spheres must be focused on, be submitted to, and serve this 
link. The stress on "taking a two-hand approach" is aimed at 
ensuring the central link of economic construction through the 
improvement of spiritual civilization. We must profoundly 
understand that when the spiritual civilization is ignored, the 
material civilization will not develop well and we will be 
divorced from the party's basic line of "one center and two 
basic points." Comrade Xiaoping said that "if the spiritual 
civilization is not strengthened, the material civilization will 
be damaged and we will regress in the course of building the 
material civilization. It will be impossible for us to win 
success in revolution and construction if we only rely on 
material conditions." At a meeting of political bureau standing 
committee members that was held in 1986, Comrade Xiaoping 
further stressed: "If common practice regresses, the success in 
economic construction will become meaningless. The 
deterioration in other aspects will bring about economic 
deterioration. If the tendency spreads unchecked, a world where 
corruption, theft, and bribery run rampant will take shape. 
Comrade Xiaoping's statement is pregnant with meaning and 
provides the people with food for thought. The party committees 
at various levels should approach from the high plane of the 
successful strategy of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to fully understand the importance and urgency 
of building the party's propaganda and ideological work and 
firmly foster the awareness of "taking a two-hand approach." 
This is the prerequisite as well as the ideological foundation 
for realistically and consciously paying attention to the 
propaganda and ideological work. In principle, some comrades 
understand the importance of strengthening the construction of 
the spiritual civilization and the ideological and political 
work. However, in doing their practical work, they think that 
the party and the government should divide the work of building 
spiritual and material civilizations. They think that the 
ideological and political work is a matter for party committees 
and propaganda and ideological work departments and that the 
ideological and political work is not related to their 
professional work. Thus, the phenomena of "the two hands" 
divorced from each other results. We must understand that 
although our comrades work at different posts and their specific 
tasks are different, their major target is identical and all of 
them are working to liberate and develop productive forces, 
safeguard the reunification of the motherland and the great 
unity of various nationalities, and build a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Therefore, the party committees and 
governments at various levels should persist in the principle of 
"taking a two-hand approach," all comrades of the party, 
regardless of their jobs, have the duty to assume responsibility 
for building both spiritual and material civilizations. We must 
neither isolate the material civilization from the spiritual 
civilization nor set one against the other. 
  Second, we should profoundly comprehend the exposition that 
"the biggest mistake lies in education" and enhance the concern. 
In 1989, in light of the tendency to neglect ideological and 
political education, Comrade Xiaoping set forth, in a clear-cut 
stand, the exposition that "the biggest mistake in the past 
decade was in education." He said: "Upon sober reflection, we 
assess the mistake in education to be even more serious than 
that of inflation." In 1992, while dwelling on the question of 
how to ensure long-term stability and order of the state, he 
pointed out: "Both persons failed, opposing bourgeois 
liberalization instead of focusing on the economic issue. 
Therefore, they cannot be forgiven." Comrade Xiaoping pointed 
out earnestly: "It cost us a dozen years to achieve today's 
results in building special zones, but it will only take a 
single night to destroy. While easy to destroy, it is difficult 
to build up. Failing to watch out for signs of problems, 
something will go wrong." Obtaining a profound understanding of 
these expositions is of great significance for us in 
strengthening propaganda and ideological work. The current 
overall situation, the economic and political situation, and the 
international environment we now face are favorable to us. 
However, the ideological problems within the party and in 
society are extremely complicated, various kinds of instable 
factors remain, and the task on ideological and political work 
are extremely arduous. In addition, some of our comrades are 
immersed in specific affairs, are not serious about politics, 
and lack a sense of concern. Some comrades remain indifferent 
to negative feelings, are reluctant to criticize erroneous 
speeches, and even chime in with such speeches. If we allow 
these problems to go unchecked, they will certainly lead to the 
spreading of evil trends and erroneous ideas. In particular, if 
we pay no attention to guiding our cadres and the masses through 
education and let various sorts of mistakes, reactionary ideas 
in particular, spread unchecked in the process of building the 
socialist market economic structure, not only will our economic 
construction, reform, and opening up be adversely affected, but 
our morale will also be dampened and our cause, ruined. 
  Third, we should conscientiously implement the measure of 
"being tough with both hands." In the past few years, we 
shouted loudly for building spiritual civilization and 
strengthening ideological and political work whenever there was 
a meeting, but, the results were not good enough. The essential 
reason was the failure in implementation. Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out straightforwardly: It is not that we have failed to 
stress the adherence to four cardinal principles, the 
ideological and political work, the opposition to bourgeois 
liberalization, and the opposition to spiritual pollution, but 
that we have fallen behind in consistency, taking action, and 
even talk about them." He exhorted the whole party that "in 
building spiritual civilization, in improving the party style, 
and in improving the atmosphere of society, we must be resolute 
without any slackness and must begin with specific affairs." 
Comparing our work against this instruction of Comrade 
Xiaoping, we can actually find some problems that cannot be 
neglected. First, we have not been resolute enough. Although 
some measures have been adopted, they are not dynamic enough to 
have formed a prevailing atmosphere. Second, our measures have 
been sometimes resolute but sometimes slack. Some comrades have 
forgotten propaganda and ideological work when the work is 
smooth, and when confronted with problems, they became suddenly 
attentive to propaganda and ideological work. Third, some 
comrades do not have the courage to solve problems beginning 
with the specific incidence of their own localities and units, 
and do not have the courage to talk about and manage the obvious 
problems, and then let these problems go unchecked for fear of 
running risks and giving offense. To actually change this 
situation, party and government leaders at all levels of all 
units as well as all comrades of the party must enhance party 
spirit, adhere to principles, and actually attend to practical 
work with the spirit of being responsible for the interests of 
the party and the people. They should not only map out plans 
and measures for strengthening propaganda and ideological work 
but also do their work in a down-to-earth manner and truly carry 
out what they have written and said in order to truly turn the 
ideological and political work from being merely ideology to 
practical work and yield great results in this regard. 
  2. On the current main tasks of the propaganda and 
ideological work front. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the national propaganda 
and ideological work conference: The propaganda and ideological 
front must firmly grasp the fundamental guide of the theory on 
building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, "arm the 
people with scientific theories, guide the people with accurate 
mass media, portray the people with lofty spirits, and mobilize 
the people with outstanding works." This "fundamental guide and 
the work in four aspects" are to make an overall arrangement and 
work out a good idea for achieving the propaganda and 
ideological work in the course of accelerating the setup of the 
socialist market economic system. The basic propaganda and 
ideological work tasks at present and in the foreseeable future 
as set forth by the region according to this spirit are as 
follows: We should work closely in line with the overall 
situation of reform, development, unity, and stability; arm the 
masses with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; conduct propaganda on the party's basic line, 
principles, and policies among the masses; educate the masses 
with ideas of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; mobilize 
the masses' enthusiasm with the goal of becoming fairly well-off 
and seeking common wealth; seek unity of thinking; have firm 
confidence; unite with the people; mobilize the cadres and 
people of various nationalities; bring their enthusiasm, 
creativeness, and arduous and pioneering spirits into greatest 
play; and create a good social mass media environment and 
provide forceful ideological and political guarantees for 
realizing the region's two current fighting goals. 
  A. We should grasp theoretical study so that the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics will take root 
in the hearts of the people. Arming the cadres and the people 
with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the primary task of the propaganda and 
ideological work front as well as the key to achieving 
propaganda and ideological work. The propaganda and ideological 
work conference set higher, new demands on fulfilling this task. 
We must conscientiously implement this spirit and solidly 
deepen the study of the theory on building a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  The organizational and propaganda departments under the 
party 
committees at various levels should make overall plans, 
including both long-term and short-term arrangements. The main 
contents of the study are to study volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decision" of 
the third plenary session of the 14th party congress. We should 
prominently grasp the study of the leading cadres at or above 
the banner and county level, particularly the key groups. In 
study, the key groups at various levels should combine theories 
with practice, seek unity of thinking, perfect policy decisions, 
sum up experiences, promote the organic combination of the work, 
and strive to deepen their study and better apply what they have 
studied. Through the study of the key groups at various levels, 
we should guide the broad masses of party members, cadres, and 
people to engage in the study. From now on, we should educate 
party members mainly with the theory on building a socialism 
with Chinese characteristics so as to have the broad masses of 
party members and cadres grasp the theoretical essence of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, to answer 
and handle various practical problems, to be able to profoundly 
understand and comprehensively implement the party's basic line 
of "one center and two basic points," to be able to deeply 
understand and grasp the basic viewpoint of developing the 
socialist market economy, to be able to accurately understand 
and handle the relationship between stability and reform and 
development, to be able to accurately understand and constantly 
persist in the basic principle of "taking a two-hand approach 
and ensuring that both hands are tough," and to be able to play 
an exemplary role in persisting in the purpose of serving the 
people wholeheartedly. 
  As far as our Inner Mongolia is concerned, one of the most 
important aspects in studying theory is to persist in using the 
Marxist nationalities concept and nationalities policy to arm 
the broad masses of party members and cadres of various 
nationalities. The party's nationalities theory and 
nationalities policy are a component of the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The broad masses of 
cadres across the region, particularly the party leading cadres, 
should firmly cultivate the Marxist nationalities concept, study 
and grasp our party's basic theory and basic policy on solving 
the nationalities issue, and study and understand the ideology 
and thesis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on nationalities issues and 
work. Through conducting realistic, in-depth, and extensive 
education on nationalities theory and policy, we should strive 
to grasp the basic viewpoint, clarify the rights and wrongs on 
some major issues, and reach a common understanding. 
  At present, we should further unify thinking and enhance 
understanding on the following basic viewpoints: 
  A united multinational country with a long history, China's 
territory has been developed jointly by the people of various 
nationalities and created a brilliant Chinese culture; 
  Over a long period of relocation and fusion, the people of 
various nationalities have formed a Chinese nation whose people 
are closely interrelated and bonded strongly with the sense that 
being a part of the Chinese nation is the spiritual tie linking 
the people of various nationalities together, and the idea that 
"all nationalities are indispensable to one another" as the 
ideological basis for safeguarding national unity and promoting 
common prosperity; 
  All natural resources in the localities are the commonwealth 
of the Chinese nation, and translating the natural resources 
advantages into economic advantages is the common task for all 
nationalities; 
  The essence of the party's policy on nationalities is aimed 
at developing minority areas and realizing common prosperity 
among the people of various nationalities; 
  We should stress essence and not form in observing minority 
areas; 
  We must uphold the "three essential criteria" in assessing 
the work of minority areas; 
  In essence, the issue on the uneven development in various 
localities is an issue of the history of society and economic 
development and is absolutely not an issue of inequality among 
the people of various nationalities; 
  A process is required in narrowing the gap between minority 
areas and developed areas and realizing common prosperity; 
  Promoting great unity among the people of various 
nationalities and maintaining political and social stability in 
minority areas is the overall situation of the party and the 
state and is where the fundamental interests of the people of 
various nationalities lie; 
  An important method used by hostile western forces in 
dissolving socialism is that of using the nationalities issue 
and religious issue to disintegrate China, which not only means 
disaster for the various nationalities in China, but also for 
the whole world; 
  Our struggle against a small number of national splittists 
is 
a conflict between ourselves and the enemy to the people of 
various nationalities, the splittists. 
  With a common understanding, we will be able to build a 
strong line of ideological defense to oppose "westernization," 
and "disintegration," narrow the market for the activities of 
the national splittist force to maximum, eliminate interference, 
realize a long period of order and stability in the border 
areas, safeguard the unification of the motherland, and 
accelerate development in our region and the common progress and 
prosperity among the people of various nationalities. 
  B. We should correctly guide public opinions to serve 
in-depth reform, to accelerate development, and to safeguard 
stability. Grasping correct media guidance is aimed at 
mobilizing the masses of people of various nationalities to 
actively participate in reform and in the modernization drive. 
We should apply all sorts of propaganda and media means, 
implement the party's theories, line, principles, and policies 
of the new period among the masses of people through solid and 
effective work, publicize the situation and tasks to the people, 
clearly explain the new problems and new contradictions emerging 
in the course of reform to the masses, provide a strong 
ideological and political guarantee for accelerating reform and 
opening up, and create a good media environment for developing 
the economy and promoting national unity and social stability. 
  This year is critical to deepening the reform and 
accelerating the development of the region. In deepening the 
reform, we should emphatically make breakthroughs in five 
aspects, that is, to make new breakthroughs in establishing and 
perfecting the socialized comprehensive service system in rural 
and pastoral areas; in transforming the mechanisms of industrial 
and commercial enterprises; in reforming financial and tax 
systems; in reforming pricing and financial systems; and in 
conducting organizational reform, changing government functions, 
and carrying out reforms in subsidiary fields. After making 
breakthroughs in these five aspects, we will be able to create a 
new situation in overall reform. At present, because the people 
have different positions and interests, and use different angles 
to approach issues, various sorts of ideological problems will 
naturally exist. This requires our party committees at all 
levels and our comrades on the propaganda and ideological front 
to strengthen investigation and study, to master in a timely 
manner the changes in the people's ideas and feelings, to do a 
good job in giving ideological persuasion, resolving 
contradictions, and harmonizing public feelings, and to guide, 
in a clear-cut way, the masses to comprehend, support, and 
participate in reform. At present, the most important and 
urgent task is to purposefully do the propaganda and ideological 
work for the difficult and hot issues for the common concern of 
the masses. 
  For instance, the issue on how to approach the gaps between 
the development of the region and advanced localities. Through 
the guidance by mass media, we should make the people definitely 
understand the following facts: At present, the region's 
general situation of economic development is good, and the 
region has made a very great progress if compared with the past. 
There are many-sided reasons for causing the gaps between the 
region and advanced localities, the gaps exist between those who 
have become prosperous first and those who lag behind, and this 
kind of gap will be hard to avoid in a certain period of time. 
In accelerating development, we should stress solid work and 
efficiency rather than blindly competing with one another in a 
race for speed. In accelerating development, we should make 
best possible use of the rich natural resources of the region's 
agriculture and animal husbandry to engage in large-scale 
cropping and breeding in a bid to increase the value in an even 
faster manner. In accelerating development, we must deepen 
reform, overcome the ideas of "waiting, depending on, and asking 
for someone else," and get rid of the defects of "common big 
pots," "iron rice bowl," and "egalitarianism." In accelerating 
the pace of making the region become prosperous, we should 
depend on the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the 
people of all nationalities and should be aware that it is of no 
avail to blame God and men and being negative and pessimistic is 
detrimental to development. The region enjoys exceptional 
advantages and has tremendous potentials in developing the 
economy and thus the bright prospects in invigorating the 
region's economy should be fully understood. After reaching a 
common understanding of these issues, we will be more confident 
and vigorous, create a new spiritual outlook, and obtain an 
ideological foundation and motivation for achieving success in 
our work. 
  For another instance, anticorruption is also a hot issue 
with 
which the masses are concerned. It should be noted that the 
people's dissatisfaction with corrupt phenomena is a 
manifestation of their concern with the party and their hope of 
making the party strong and pure. As the propaganda and mass 
media departments of the party, we should guide the masses to 
have a correct understanding of the opposition to corruption. 
In this regard, we should define the following several basic 
viewpoints: The main trend of our party is good, the 
overwhelming majority of party members and cadres are honest and 
clean in performing official duties and are conscientious in 
serving the people. In opposing corruption, the attitude of the 
CPC Central Committee is resolute and the measures are 
effective, and the regional party committee and most party 
organizations in the region have been brave in tackling and 
dealing with corruption. Corrupt phenomena are serious, and the 
anticorruption campaign is a long-term task, which cannot be 
accomplished in one stroke. We should be ideologically prepared 
to deal blows to corruption firmly and unremittingly and should 
also embrace the sense of urgency. In launching the 
anticorruption campaign, we should stress discipline and the 
legal system and should depend on the masses to build up a 
powerful momentum of mass media instead of launching movements. 
Correctly launching the anticorruption campaign in line with 
the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee will not affect 
economic construction, reform, and opening up, but will provide 
important guarantees for reform and construction. Our party 
will always oppose corruption and will certainly be able to 
achieve results at each stage of anticorruption and gradually 
reduce the phenomenon of corruption to the lowest degree. 
  To accurately grasp the focal points of the orientation for 
mass media it is necessary to grasp various media. Media, such 
as newspapers, publications, and radio and television programs, 
are key means to achieve the propaganda and ideological work. 
Therefore, these news mediums should bring into full play their 
special characteristics and advantages in guiding the mass 
media; persist in the principles of unity, stability, vigor, and 
propaganda by giving positive examples; accurately grasp the 
orientation for propaganda and mass media; positively support 
and develop accurate and healthful mass media; overcome lopsided 
and irresponsible mass media; and resolutely eliminate and end 
harmful mass media. Our mass media must really conform to the 
principles and policies of the party and actually stand for the 
majority of the people's opinions and interests. We must never 
support the mass media that are not suitable to the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's 
basic line and basic policies, and the party's policies toward 
nationalities and religions, and that are not conducive to the 
national unity and the reunification of the motherland. 
  Further strengthening external propaganda is an important 
aspect of accurately grasping the orientation for mass media. 
Success in external propaganda is of great strategic and 
realistic significance in expanding Inner Mongolia's 
international and domestic influence; promoting the economic, 
scientific and technological, and cultural exchange between our 
region and the outside world; and forming a good external 
environment that is conducive to deepening reform, expanding the 
scale of opening up, and accelerating the pace of development. 
We must further strengthen the awareness of external 
propaganda, use the geographic advantages, use various channels 
and forms to disseminate Inner Mongolia, have the outside world 
understand Inner Mongolia more clearly, and have Inner Mongolia 
walk toward the whole country and the whole world with wide 
strides. 
  C. We should well grasp the ideological education and strive 
to advocate a good mental outlook and a good social practice. 
The fundamental purpose of strengthening the ideological 
education is to cultivate new persons with ideals, morality, 
education, and a sense of discipline. At present, we should 
focus our efforts on educating the broad masses of cadres, 
people, and youngsters with the spirit of serving the people 
wholeheartedly as repeatedly advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong; 
the spirit of having ideals, morality, education, and a sense of 
discipline as repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit so as to 
have these spirits become the strong spiritual pillars of the 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the social 
practice in the new age and to further forcefully resist the 
influence of such corrosive ideas as money worship, hedonism, 
and out-and-out egoism. 
  According to the demands of the new situation of setting up 
the socialist market economic system, at present and in the 
foreseeable future, the party committees, the governments, and 
the propaganda and ideological departments should emphatically 
solve the following few problems by conducting the ideological 
education in a clear-cut and vivid manner. First, we should 
educate the people to have firm confidence in socialism, foster 
lofty ideals, and consciously engage themselves in the great 
cause of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Second, we should enhance the cadres and people's confidence in 
deepening reform and accelerating development and guide them to 
be inspired with enthusiasm, work hard, and tide over 
difficulties. Third, we should educate the cadres and the 
people to foster the ideas of ardently loving the motherland and 
showing concern for the collectives and to accurately handle the 
relationship between the interests of the whole and those of the 
part and between the interests of collectives and those of 
individuals. At the time of conducting the ideological 
education, all departments and units should closely proceed from 
their work realities and the broad masses of cadres and people's 
thinking to do their jobs well, solve problems ahead of them, 
stress real efficiency, and avoid practicing formalism. 
  At the same time, we should also conduct education on 
building our country and conducting all undertakings through 
thrift and long years of hard work, and on professional ethics, 
social morality, and basic national and regional conditions. We 
should make the people understand that in such an economically 
underdeveloped area like ours, arduous struggle and building the 
country through hard work should be an important guiding 
ideology during the whole course of economic development and 
that any acts of going in for ostentation and extravagance, 
parading one's wealth, and engaging in extravagance and waste 
are incompatible with the demands of the times and the desire of 
the people. Even when we become rich in the future, we should 
also actively promote the spirit of arduous struggle and 
building the country through hard work. Through extensive and 
in-depth education, we should also promote the progressive, 
sound, and civilized way of living, promote the revolutionary 
spirit of unselfishness and selfless dedication, and enable more 
people, particularly young people, to correctly cultivate the 
concept on value and on the outlook on life, to enhance their 
sense of the legal system, and to consciously observe law and 
discipline, professional ethics, and social morality. It is 
necessary to educate cadres and the masses to recognize the 
basic national and regional conditions, link the work they are 
engaging in with the overall development situation of the 
region, and consciously contribute to accelerating Inner 
Mongolia's reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  To strengthen ideological education of the new period, we 
must pay attention to summing up experience, promoting typical 
examples, and unceasingly enhancing the ideological work of the 
whole society. We should stress the exemplary role, moral 
quality, and strength of educators while conducting education 
and strive to create a social environment and cultural 
atmosphere for enhancing educational results. We should give 
democracy full play; respect, understand, and care for the 
people; adopt the forms and methods that are easily accepted and 
welcomed by the masses, make all activities imbue with 
education, and guide the masses to conduct self education and 
mutual education. In short, we should give full play to the 
positive role of ideological education in correctly guiding the 
people's social value orientation, social morality, and social 
ideology. 
  D. We should attend to literary and artistic creations and 
provide more healthy and rich spiritual products for the people 
of various nationalities. As far as the literary and art front 
is concerned, to implement the guidelines of the national 
propaganda and ideological work conference, it must pay special 
attention to producing outstanding literary and artistic works 
on promoting the main melody and manifesting the regional and 
national characteristics, and at the same time, promote the 
creation of various literary and artistic works to satisfy the 
daily increasing needs of the people of various nationalities. 
  To invigorate literary and artistic creations, we must 
uphold 
the correct orientation of serving the people and socialism and 
implement the principle of letting "a hundred flowers blossom 
and a hundred schools of thought contend." Speaking from the 
angle of leadership, first, leaders should grasp the 
orientation; second, they should formulate good policies; and 
third, they should organize and coordinate the work well and 
create a good environment for invigorating literary and artistic 
creations. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to 
enhance the quality of creations, exert efforts to produce a 
number of outstanding works, such as films, television programs, 
literature books, dramas, music, dance, folk arts, and artistic 
works. Propaganda and cultural departments at all levels should 
produce good literary and art works in an effort to guide 
literary and artistic creations. In publication work, we should 
uphold the orientation, deepen reform, maintain the 
characteristics, and play a greater role in building the two 
civilizations in the whole region. We should support and 
protect the literary and artistic works with quintessence of 
national culture and a fairly high value. 
  We should continue to implement the principle of "achieving 
development on the one hand and eliminating pornography on the 
other" to promote healthy development in Inner Mongolia's 
cultural undertakings. It is hoped that all literary and art 
groups, writers, and artists will fully understand their noble 
mission, live up to the high expectations placed on them, raise 
spirits, go deep into the reality of life, devote themselves to 
work, and create a number of outstanding works that reflect the 
spirit of this era and the local and national characteristics 
and that are artistically appealing. Meanwhile, the efforts of 
various fields should be mustered and effective measures adopted 
to greatly rectify the cultural market so that notable results 
can be achieved in a short time. In developing cultural 
undertakings, we should gear them to the needs of the masses, 
rely on the masses, and mobilize the forces of the entire 
society to make Inner Mongolia's mass cultural activities vivid, 
lively, rich, and colorful. 
  3. On strengthening party leadership over propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  Now that the major principles for the propaganda and 
ideological work have been defined, the key to the next step of 
work is to publicize the guidelines of the party Central 
Committee and the regional party committee at the grass-roots 
levels in a down-to- earth manner. This requires that our party 
committees at all levels further strengthen leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, firmly grasp the initiative in 
doing propaganda and ideological work, and make the work more 
fruitful through practical and effective work. 
  First, we should attach great importance to the party's 
propaganda and ideological work and grasp the initiative in 
leadership work. Propaganda and ideological work has a strong 
political, policy, and ideological nature. While paying close 
attention to and achieving success in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction, party committees at all levels should 
conscientiously strengthen and improve leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work. They should list propaganda 
and ideological work high on their agenda, study it on a regular 
basis, draw up the principles, tasks, and work focuses of the 
propaganda and ideological work for different periods, and 
devote more energy to guiding and helping propaganda departments 
to discuss and address major issues and to raise work levels. 
Major leaders of party committees should concern themselves 
with the propaganda on major issues, and propaganda departments 
should participate in major political and economic activities so 
that propaganda and ideological work will more directly permeate 
the party's central work. When formulating strategic plans for 
economic and social development, party committees and 
governments at all levels should include the development of 
propaganda and cultural work in the general plans. Whether party 
and government leaders attach importance to propaganda and 
ideological work and whether they have the ability to carry out 
propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as important 
criteria to judge whether they are politically strong and have a 
high leadership level. As long as our leaders fully understand 
the important position and role of propaganda and ideological 
work, they will be able to actively carry out ideological and 
political work and fundamentally grasp the initiative in 
propaganda and ideological work. 
  Second, we should change work styles and pay close attention 
to implementation of work. All departments, units, and comrades 
on the propaganda and ideological fronts should vigorously 
conduct investigation and study and seek truth from facts when 
doing specific work. Intensifying investigation and study is 
the basic skill for a success in propaganda and ideological 
work. Comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should 
go down to the grass- roots levels to learn about the actual 
conditions and develop their investigation and study in both 
range and quality. They should establish more ties not only 
with cadres but also with the masses; learn more not only about 
typical experiences but also about the specific conditions in 
large areas; and conduct not only in-depth investigation but 
also in-depth study. 
  On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand 
materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern 
and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological 
work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic 
demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological 
work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and 
ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all 
levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task 
within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the 
fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by 
the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay 
attention to sharing the work with departments of the 
corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels, 
combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well. 
We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda 
worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own 
work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological 
tasks will be well implemented. 
  Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint 
force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving 
the whole society which must be accomplished with the 
coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party 
committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations 
in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and 
neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative 
departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as 
the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's 
federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work. 
All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should 
grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in 
which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all 
sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological 
work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels 
should be good at maintaining coordination with other 
departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and 
seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments 
are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work. 
All localities should actively support propaganda and 
ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in 
line with the actual economic development situation, gradually 
improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a 
good environment for propaganda and ideological work. 
  Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and 
enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural 
undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform 
principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire 
propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform 
propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles 
conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership 
over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to 
the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural 
workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural 
undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize 
the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing 
functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and 
raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further 
reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of 
the party and government in propaganda and cultural units; 
cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually 
establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market 
economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal 
management system and operational mechanism of the entire 
propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from 
cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the 
institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and 
cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and 
regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological 
work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between 
cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external 
cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural 
products enter the international market. To reform propaganda 
and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime 
importance to social efficiency, and under this basic 
precondition, realize an integration of economic and social 
efficiency. 
  On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand 
materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern 
and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological 
work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic 
demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological 
work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and 
ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all 
levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task 
within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the 
fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by 
the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay 
attention to sharing the work with departments of the 
corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels, 
combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well. 
We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda 
worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own 
work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological 
tasks will be well implemented. 
  Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint 
force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving 
the whole society which must be accomplished with the 
coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party 
committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations 
in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and 
neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative 
departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as 
the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's 
federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work. 
All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should 
grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in 
which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all 
sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological 
work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels 
should be good at maintaining coordination with other 
departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and 
seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments 
are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work. 
All localities should actively support propaganda and 
ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in 
line with the actual economic development situation, gradually 
improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a 
good environment for propaganda and ideological work. 
  Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and 
enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural 
undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform 
principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire 
propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform 
propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles 
conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership 
over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to 
the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural 
workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural 
undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize 
the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing 
functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and 
raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further 
reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of 
the party and government in propaganda and cultural units; 
cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually 
establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market 
economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal 
management system and operational mechanism of the entire 
propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from 
cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the 
institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and 
cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and 
regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological 
work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between 
cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external 
cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural 
products enter the international market. To reform propaganda 
and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime 
importance to social efficiency, and under this basic 
precondition, realize an integration of economic and social 
efficiency. 
  In conducting reform in the propaganda and ideological 
work, we should also display the spirit of daring to do and try. 
We should boldly explore things as long as they conform with 
the demand of the party's basic line, with the demand of 
building socialist spiritual civilization, and with the law of 
self development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We 
should also bravely renew these things so that we can find out a 
way of reinforcing the vigor of propaganda and cultural work 
through reform and of promoting the prosperity and development 
of these undertakings. 
  Fifth, we should realistically enhance the construction of 
leading bodies and personnel's contingent among the departments 
in charge of propaganda and ideological work. This represents 
an organizational guarantee for successfully conducting the 
propaganda and ideological work. Leadership of departments in 
charge of propaganda and ideological work and every cadre in 
these departments must act in unison politically with the CPC 
Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee. 
They should strictly enforce the political and working 
disciplines and no one is allowed to go his own way. The 
propaganda and ideological work must be favorable for reform and 
for developing and stabilizing the whole situation. By no means 
should we have the propaganda and ideological work add to 
turbulence. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "To upgrade the 
quality of cadres, we may select so many measures for this 
purpose from various angles. However, what is most important is 
to upgrade the accomplishment in Marxist theories of the broad 
masses of cadres and particularly of leading cadres." Comrades 
engaging in the propaganda and ideological work should even pay 
attention to upgrading their accomplishment in Marxist theories. 
They should fully discern the importance of enhancing the study 
of Marxist theories and of applying Marxist theories to arming 
themselves from the high plane of the historic tasks undertaken 
by propaganda and ideological workers; of the strategy of 
safeguarding the reform, development, and unity; and of 
stabilizing the whole situation. Propaganda departments at all 
levels should formulate or implement the plans for holding 
theoretical training classes to vigorously train in a systematic 
way and in group a large number of comrades who actually and 
practically know well the basic theories of Marxism and 
Leninism. By regarding these comrades as backbone personnel, we 
should have them bring along the theoretical study on propaganda 
and ideological fronts across the region. Efforts should be 
made to maintain the stability in the contingent of propaganda 
cadres and to direct cadres on the propaganda and ideological 
front to foster the spirit of having self-respect, being 
self-possessed, and self-progressed; as well as to enhance their 
sense of glory, mission, and responsibility in engaging in the 
propaganda and ideological work. Party organizations at all 
levels should enhance the ideological education among cadres in 
charge of propaganda work and teach them to be loyal to the 
party's propaganda undertakings, to ardently cherish their 
professional work, to perform their duties thoroughly, and to 
make contributions selflessly. The emphasis of successfully 
building the contingent of personnel is to enhance the work of 
building leading bodies on the propaganda and ideological front. 
Efforts should be made to upgrade the political and 
ideological levels of staffers among the leading bodies and to 
enable the leading bodies at all levels on the propaganda front 
to be the leading core with unified thinking, pure party spirit, 
heightened spirit, unity, and practical work style. In line 
with the personnel affairs criterion of four requirements and 
the demand of having both ability and political integrity, 
propaganda departments at all levels jointly with the 
organizational departments should select a large number of 
comrades who have the theoretical level of Marxism, as well as 
ardently cherish and know well the propaganda and ideological 
work, to enter the leading bodies at all levels on the 
propaganda and ideological front. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should show concern for the comrades 
on the propaganda and ideological front in the fields of 
politics, ideology, work, and livelihood so as to enable them to 
give better play to their talent and to continuously make new 
contributions. 
  The new situation and tasks of establishing the systems of 
socialist market economy and realizing the two periodical 
fighting targets set by the autonomous regional party committee 
have set forth new and higher demands for the propaganda and 
ideological work and also provided broad scope for the work. 
Leading cadres in party organs at all levels and comrades on 
the propaganda and ideological front should bravely assume the 
heavy duty imposed on them by the age, heighten their spirit, 
enhance their confidence, be willing to do work in a 
down-to-earth manner, boldly create something new, and strive to 
create a new situation in the region's propaganda and 
ideological work!

Shanxi Acting Governor Sun Wensheng (1327 2429 4141) before the 
Second Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress on 24 
February: "Seize the Opportunity for Reform, Quicken the Pace of 
Development, and Further Advance the Great Cause of Revitalizing 
Shanxi and Making its People Prosperous"] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies, 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now 
submit 
the report on the work of the government for your examination 
and approval, and also for suggestions and comments from members 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and 
other observers. 
<H5>  I. Remarkable Success Was Achieved in Reform, Opening Up </H5>
and Modernization in 1993 Through Genuine Hard Work and All-Out 
Efforts 
  The year 1993 marked the first year in our all-out efforts 
to 
push the provincial economy to a new height. It is also a year 
worth summing up. Under the correct leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party 
committee, and with strong support and supervision from the 
provincial people's congress and the provincial committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 
provincial people's government adhered to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, upheld the party's basic line, and worked 
closely around the theme of "seizing the opportunity to develop 
ourselves" in mobilizing and organizing the people of the whole 
province to vigorously grasp the three foundations (agricultural 
capital construction, basic industry, and infrastructural 
facilities) and giving prominence to the four key areas (coal 
mining, power generation, road construction, and river 
diversion). We were thus able to quicken the pace of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction, and basically realized 
the objectives and tasks adopted by the First Session of the 
Eighth Provincial People's Congress for 1993. 
  1. The national economy continued its rapid 
development and the three key industrial sectors reported 
all-round growth. Gross national product (GNP) for the 
province was 63.22 billion yuan, 113.9 percent of the planned 
amount, or an increase of 12.2 percent over the previous year 
calculated at comparable prices, with primary, secondary, and 
tertiary industries realizing increases of 10.6 percent, 13.4 
percent, and 10.6 percent respectively. The rural economy 
showed all-round development, with grain output hitting an 
all-time record of 9.902 million tons, 15.4 percent more than in 
the previous year. With the exception of cotton, the output of 
agricultural, forestry, and animal products all registered 
increases. Township enterprises showed rapid growth, with 
business earnings reaching 59.49 billion yuan, 84.4 percent over 
the 1992 figure, and realizing the target set in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. Industrial 
production registered rapid growth in spite of substantial 
market changes and the shortage of funds and transport 
facilities, and steady improvements were made in economic 
results. Industrial enterprises covered by the budgets of local 
governments registered increases of 33.1 percent and 54.7 
percent respectively in business earnings, and profits and taxes 
realized compared with the previous year. Fiscal revenue for 
the whole province was 7.24 billion yuan, 113.3 percent of the 
budgeted amount, or 24.9 percent over the previous year. In 
dealing with the conspicuous contradictions and problems that 
cropped up in the course of rapid economic development, we 
conscientiously implemented the central government's measures on 
strengthening macrocontrol, firmly and resolutely stopping and 
checking illegal fundraising, sorting out unauthorized 
inter-borrowings, and putting an end to the state of confusion 
in the financial market by consolidating the financial order and 
enforcing financial discipline. Through these efforts we were 
able to stop the practice of issuing white slips when purchasing 
farm and sideline products, ensure bank payments, increase 
investment in key projects and enterprises, and bring about a 
healthy development of the national economy. 
  2. Great success was achieved in "construction in 
three areas" and the reserve strength for economic development 
was further enhanced. Investment in fixed assets in the 
localities amounted to 12.5 billion yuan, 115.9 percent of the 
planned target, or an increase of 42.1 percent compared with the 
previous year. In the state sector of the economy, investment 
in fixed assets in agriculture, energy, transportation and 
telecommunications accounted for 59.6 percent. Last fall and 
winter a mammoth campaign was launched to promote "farmland 
water conservancy capital construction, voluntary road repair 
works, and key construction projects." The enthusiasm, drive, 
and awareness shown by the vast numbers of cadres and the masses 
in this campaign were unprecedented. A total of more than 280 
million work-days were put into farmland water conservancy 
capital construction, and 103,000 ditches were built. Work was 
in full swing on five of the six major highways under 
construction, and one had already been opened to traffic. A 
remarkable job was done in the construction of country roads, 
with 12 more townships made accessible by highways, 34 small 
towns made accessible by asphalt roads, and 630 villages made 
accessible by motor vehicles. Key construction projects 
proceeded smoothly. Some 3.62 billion yuan were spent on the 27 
provincial- level key construction projects, eight of which had 
already been completed and put into operation. 
  A total of 220 technical upgrade projects were launched at 
a cost of 2.3 billion yuan. Here, I must point out in 
particular that work on the long-awaited project to bring water 
from the Huanghe River into Shanxi at Wanjiazhai, as well as the 
eastern and western sections of the Tai-Jiu Expressway, had 
already started; construction of the elevated waiting room for 
the Taiyuan Railway Station and the main section of the 
departure hall of the Taiyuan Airport were basically completed; 
the Xiaoliu Railway was open to through traffic; and the number 
of counties and cities served by program-controlled telephone 
exchanges and long- distance digital networks now reached 36. 
In the course of the year, coal production capacity was 
increased by 1.42 million tons; power generating capacity was 
increased by 840,000 kilowatts; and an additional 535 kilometers 
of highways and 58 kilometers of railroads were opened to 
traffic. 
  3. Reform of the economic structure made a great 
stride forward, and new headway was made in opening the province 
to the outside world. The experiment on changing the 
operation mechanism in 100 selected large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises progressed smoothly, and 14 aspects of 
operational autonomy were basically implemented in these 
enterprises. Reforms of the labor and personnel, wage 
distribution, and social security systems were carried out in 
more than 3,000 enterprises, about one-third of all state-owned 
enterprises in Shanxi. Reform of the enterprise property rights 
system made a substantial step forward. The number of 
enterprises adopting the shareholding system increased to 260 
from 64 in 1992. The Xinghuacun Fenyang Wine Limited 
Shareholding Company successfully issued shares and became a 
publicly listed company. Joint-stock cooperative enterprises 
thrived in the whole province. New progress was also achieved 
in reform of the market system, social security system, and 
housing system, and in the establishment of a collectivized 
social service system in the rural areas. Individual and 
private economies and foreign investment all achieved rapid 
growth. In the coal industry, significant progress was achieved 
in rationalizing the management system and rectifying the order 
of production, shipment, and marketing. Further progress was 
made in opening up the province, with 220 contracts worth 1.5 
billion yuan having been won by the four provincial-level 
economic development zones at Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, and 
Fenglingdu. Trade promotion activities and economic and trade 
negotiations held overseas and in other parts of the country all 
yielded good results. The total volume of imports and exports 
for the whole year amounted to $837 million, an increase of 19.4 
percent over the previous year, with exports accounting for $634 
million, an increase of 8.7 percent. During the year, 660 
partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises registered for 
business. Their investment totaled $998 million. Of this, the 
amount of foreign investment agreed was $402 million, and the 
amount actually used was $177 million. Horizontal ties of 
economic and technological cooperation with other provinces, 
cities, and autonomous regions were also further strengthened. 
  4. Scientific and technological education was further 
strengthened, and new progress was made in all social 
undertakings. Thanks to the reform of the system for the 
management of scientific and technological allocations, the 
establishment of a system of responsibility for investment in 
scientific and technological projects and the introduction of a 
risk mechanism, scientific research institutions were 
revitalized. Construction of the 10 intermediate test bases for 
scientific research and development saw smooth progress. A 
total of 65 key scientific and technological projects relating 
to industry and agriculture were completed, 27 of which were 
pacesetters. Marked economic results were achieved in the 
promotion of 25 selected scientific and technological projects, 
92 "Spark Program" projects and 63 "Torch Program" projects. 
The strategy of invigorating the rural economy through the 
integration of agriculture with science and education was 
well-implemented. A total of 250 enterprises moved into the 
Taiyuan and Changzhi High-Tech Industrial Development Zones. 
Annual earnings from technology-related industries and trade 
amounted to 550 million yuan, 100 percent more than in the 
previous year. Education saw new development, with 
vocational-technical education making particularly swift 
progress. In spite of the strained fiscal situation, the amount 
spent on education in the whole province and investment by 
provincial-level departments on capital construction for 
educational purposes still registered increases of 14.7 percent 
and 26.8 percent respectively compared with the previous year. 
Special allocations were made by the provincial government to 
increase length of service allowances for primary and secondary 
school teachers and subsidies for teachers of community-run 
schools, transfer 3,000 outstanding teachers of community-run 
schools to regular government payroll, issue allowance to 
intellectuals with senior professional or technical titles, and 
provide better housing for middle-aged and young teachers of 
some universities and colleges and for primary and secondary 
school teachers in cities and towns. Sports saw further 
progress. Our athletes achieved good results at the Seventh 
National Games. Medical service saw further improvement in both 
urban and rural areas. Progress was also registered in the 
fields of culture and art, the press and publishing, radio, film 
and television, family planning, environmental protection, 
social welfare, nationalities and religious affairs, archives, 
relics, old-age care, and so forth. New achievements were made 
in socialist democracy, the legal system, and the overall 
control of public security. 
  5. People's income rose and their living standards 
continued to improve. The average amount that city dwellers 
used for living expenses was 1,714.9 yuan, 108.5 percent of the 
planned target. This represented an increase of 20.7 percent 
over the 1992 figure, or a real growth of 4.2 percent after 
allowing for price rises. Per-capita net income for peasants 
was 718.3 yuan, 102.6 percent of the planned target, up 14.6 
percent, or a real growth of 4.2 percent after allowing for 
price rises. The market was brisk. The total volume of retail 
sales was 27.47 billion yuan, 100.2 percent of the planned 
target and an increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year. 
In spite of the rising level of consumption and an increase in 
investment avenues, such as shares, bonds, and fund 
subscriptions, the volume of bank savings for both urban and 
rural residents increased by 9.6 billion yuan. Housing 
conditions for urban and rural dwellers improved following the 
completion of 4.83 million square meters of housing units in 
cities and towns and 9.46 million square meters in the rural 
areas. The provincial government took active steps to supply 
drinking water to people and livestock in poverty-stricken areas 
and to improve the education and medical facilities there. In 
the course of the year, more than 260,000 people and 40,000 
large livestock at some 1,300 natural villages in 40 
poverty-stricken counties had had their water supply problem 
solved. Teaching conditions were improved in rural primary 
schools in 16 poverty-stricken counties, and hospitals were 
extended or repaired in 59 townships or small towns. These 
three measures were highly acclaimed by people in 
poverty-stricken areas. 
  Fellow deputies! Our province accumulated much valuable 
experience in pushing forward reform and quickening the pace of 
development in the past year. The following are some of the 
more important points: 
  1. In order to quicken the pace of economic 
development in our province, it is necessary to emancipate the 
mind, seek truth from facts, and proceed from reality in 
everything. If we compare our province with the coastal 
areas, we see that we suffer not only subjective disparities, 
but also objective deficiencies, such as backward infrastructure 
and unfavorable geographical conditions. Last year, our province 
managed to make fairly big strides forward in reform and opening 
up and maintain rapid economic growth in spite of difficulties, 
precisely because we had adhered to the ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. We not only 
formulated the necessary policies and measures for deepening the 
reform and further opening up the province, but proceeded from 
reality in devoting major efforts to improving the 
infrastructure. 
  2. In order to quicken the pace of economic 
development in our province, it is necessary to grasp the 
principal contradiction and the weak links and make timely 
readjustment of the development strategy. The principal 
contradiction in the economic development of our province is 
that our singular pillar industry, production of primary 
products, and irrational industrial structure tend to affect the 
quality of the overall economy and the improvement of 
consolidated economic performance. The acute shortage of water 
resources and poor transport are two major obstacles to our 
economic development. Last year, we made timely readjustment of 
our economic development strategy by putting forward the plan to 
bring about total innovation and comprehensive development of 
production bases for energy and heavy chemical industries. By 
attaching importance to "the three foundations" and "the four 
key areas," we managed to bring about a great advance in the 
readjustment and optimization of the industrial structure. 
Practice proves that this strategy is in keeping with Shanxi's 
reality. 
  3. In order to quicken the pace of economic 
development in our province, it is necessary to rally the people 
and properly guide, protect, and arouse their enthusiasm. 
Accelerating reform and development in order to revitalize 
Shanxi and make its people prosperous is a great, yet arduous, 
historical mission which can only be accomplished through the 
joint efforts of the people of the whole province. Last year, 
we made the call to do genuine hard work and make all-out 
efforts, urging cadres at all levels to speak the truth, do 
solid work, set a good example, and take the lead in working 
hard. The broad masses of the people saw hope and felt 
encouraged. In particular, the spirit of starting an enterprise 
through self-reliance and hard struggle found vivid embodiment 
in the practice of "three constructions." 
  4. In order to quicken the pace of economic 
development in our province, it is necessary to uphold justice, 
enforce law and discipline, and maintain political and social 
stability. Stability is the precondition for development. 
Last year, we firmly implemented the policy of paying equal 
attention to cultural and ideological progress and material 
progress in strengthening socialist culture and ethics and the 
legal system. With profound love for the people of Shanxi, we 
fought all kinds of evils and strengthened the overall control 
of public security. Law-breakers among those in office, such as 
the public security bureau chiefs of Linyi County and Xinzhou 
City, were seriously dealt with in accordance with the law, 
while a number of arch criminals were executed, much to the 
delight of the masses. In the fight against corruption, tough 
and serious action was taken against cadres, some at district 
and departmental levels, who abused power for personal gain and 
committed serious crimes in violation of law and discipline. 
Through these actions, we boosted the morale of the people and 
upheld social justice. 
  Fellow deputies! The past year has been a year of 
remarkable success for reform and development in our province. 
These achievements have not only given us a good starting point 
in the further implementation of the development strategy of 
"overall innovation and comprehensive development," but have 
laid a good foundation for the reform strategy of "overall 
advance with emphasis on key areas." On behalf of the 
provincial people's government, I wish to express my highest 
consideration and heartfelt gratitude to all workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, cadres, commanders and fighters of the People's 
Liberation Army, officers and men of the people's armed police 
and public security police, and people from all walks of life in 
our province, for the positive contributions they made in 
reform, opening up and modernization and for their all- out 
support to the government. 
  While fully affirming the achievements, we must soberly see 
that there are still some shortcomings and deficiencies in the 
work of the government, and that there are still many obvious 
contradictions and difficulties in the road of development. In 
economic life, structural problems have yet to see major 
improvements, and technological and managerial levels are 
backward. A large number of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises have a high equity- debt ratio and heavy inherited 
burdens. They cannot compete in the market, and some are on the 
verge of bankruptcy because they have more liabilities than 
assets. Capital construction is over- extended, with far too 
many projects under construction. Although measures have been 
taken to concentrate resources on key projects, the use of funds 
is still too dispersed. Agriculture has not yet firmly 
established its position as the foundation of the economy. The 
rising cost of grain and cotton production and the widening 
price scissors between industrial and agricultural products have 
affected the enthusiasm of peasants to develop grain and cotton 
production. The fact that a situation of total opening up has 
yet to truly take shape is also restricting our economic and 
social development to some extent. The macroeconomic 
environment is not relaxed enough, and there is a general 
shortage of funds. The general retail price level has gone up 
by 13.1 percent, and the hidden danger of inflation remains 
unabated. Although fiscal revenue has increased by no small 
amount, due to increased expenditure in all areas, more than 
half of the total number of counties in our province have been 
unable to pay wages on time in their implementation of the 
annual budget. In social development, the task of controlling 
population growth remains arduous, environmental pollution is 
becoming an increasing problem in some areas, and factors 
affecting social stability still exist. Meanwhile, the 
ideological level, workstyle, and professionalism of government 
organs and government functionaries at all levels cannot measure 
up to the new standards required for the development of a market 
economy, and problems of bureaucratism, formalism, laxness, 
extravagance, and waste exist to varying degrees in departments 
at all levels. In particular, corruption among a handful of 
government functionaries has aroused the resentment of the 
masses. The above- mentioned contradictions and problems 
deserve our attention. We should and must, by analyzing the 
contradictions, recognizing the gaps and heightening our sense 
of crisis, urgency, and concern, arouse the fighting spirit of 
the people of the whole province, and seize the opportunity to 
push forward our reform and quicken our development. 
<H5>  II. Make Structural Readjustment, Improve Economic </H5>
Performance, and Maintain the Sustained, Healthy, and Rapid 
Development of the National Economy 
  The year 1994 is an important year for maintaining the 
momentum of development and striving to fulfill the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. It is also a crucial year for 
the implementation of the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee" and the relevant measures 
proposed by our province for the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure. The general policy for the work of 
the government this year is as follows: Firmly adhere to 
the guidance provided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, seize the new opportunity for reform and development 
to accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure, establish a new enterprise system, further open up 
the province, quicken the pace of structural readjustment, 
promote technological advances, continue to strengthen the 
agricultural foundation, basic industries and infrastructure, 
and strive to improve overall economic performance, further 
improve people's living standards, and maintain social stability 
in order to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid 
development of the national economy. 
  According to this general policy, the principal targets for 
economic development in the whole province in the year 1994 are: 
GNP is to reach 73 billion yuan, or a 10 percent increase over 
the previous year calculated at comparable prices. Primary 
industry is to grow by 4 percent, secondary industry by 12 
percent, and tertiary industry by 10 percent. Every effort will 
be made to break the 90 percent mark in the new comprehensive 
industrial economic performance index. Local fiscal revenue, 
calculated according to the new system, is to reach 4.76 billion 
yuan, or a 21.9 percent increase calculated on the comparable 
basis. The total volume of foreign trade is to reach $700 
million, up 10.4 percent. The total volume of retail sales is 
to increase by 15 percent to 31.6 billion yuan, with sales of 
consumer goods expected to reach 28 billion yuan. 
  The above targets have been decided upon after careful 
analysis and appraisal of the situation, taking into account 
both the difficulties and problems in our economic life and the 
favorable factors and opportunities before us. They are targets 
based on an understanding of the overall situation and the need 
to maintain an overall balance. The present international and 
domestic situation is very much to our advantage, and the people 
of the whole province are eager to deepen the reform and quicken 
the pace of development. The growing demand for investment in 
the country and the priority given by the state to 
infrastructural facilities and basic industries will give a 
boost to our economic development. The fact that the coal 
management structure has been basically rationalized and coal 
prices have been deregulated is a favorable factor allowing us 
to bring our resource superiority into play. Last year a number 
of capital construction and technical upgrade projects were 
completed and put into production, and these will continue to 
serve their useful purpose this year. Farmland water 
conservancy construction has produced some useful results and 
laid a good foundation for agricultural production. On the 
whole, this year's economic development targets are positive and 
can be achieved through hard work. We should seize the 
opportunity and strive to attain the highest speed of 
development possible. However, we must also properly handle the 
relations between speed and performance, between economic growth 
and qualitative improvement, and between emphasis on key areas 
and overall development. In our opinion, in order to make a 
success of economic work this year, it is important to uphold 
the following three principles: 
  First, it is important to uphold the principle of giving 
priority to economic performance. Optimal performance, fair 
competition, and elimination of the inferior through competition 
are objective requirements for the market economy. In the wake 
of reform of the fiscal and financial systems, enterprises can 
no longer rely on preferential tax concessions, fiscal 
subsidies, and bank loans to pay their workers. If they perform 
poorly and even sustain losses, they will have to declare 
themselves bankrupt. Similarly, if a place is unable to improve 
its economic performance, it will not be able to increase 
revenue and improve the livelihood of its people. Thus, it is 
necessary to attach primary importance to the improvement of 
economic performance in economic work. In future assessment of 
economic development, we should mainly look at performance 
rather than output value. 
  Second, it is important to uphold the principle of putting 
scientific and technological advances above everything else. 
For many years, it had been our customary practice to develop 
the economy by putting up new establishments, launching new 
projects, and engaging in the extensive form of enlarged 
reproduction. As a result of this practice, established 
enterprises had a shortage of funds, while new projects did not 
have enough investment, and neither could perform well. In 
order to change this state of affairs, it is important to tap 
potential, take the road of intensive development, and bring 
economic construction onto the orbit of reliance on scientific 
and technological advances and improvement of the quality of 
laborers. With this in mind, it is necessary to earnestly 
implement the strategy of relying on science and education to 
revitalize Shanxi, promote the close integration of 
"agriculture, science, and education" and of "industry, science, 
and education," pay attention to the vocational training of 
staff and workers and to the cultivation of specialized 
personnel, strengthen scientific research and development, step 
up technical upgrading in existing enterprises, make use of new 
techniques and technologies, develop new products, and promote 
the readjustment of the industrial structure and the improvement 
of the economy as a whole. 
  Third, it is important to uphold the principle of balanced 
and coordinated development. The market economy can effectively 
bring into play the fundamental role of the market in the 
deployment of resources, but it can also be quite blind. In 
particular, in developing the market economy, we are liable to 
overlook agriculture which has low returns, or the development 
of infrastructural facilities, environmental protection, and 
public welfare causes which require huge investment but yield 
slow results. Thus, it is necessary to correctly handle the 
relations between primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, 
correctly handle the relations between immediate and long-term 
interests, do a good job of the overall coordination of economic 
operations, maintain a basic balance of total demand and supply, 
guard against big economic fluctuations, and maintain the 
sustained, healthy, and rapid development of the national 
economy. 
  In adhering to the above principles in our efforts to 
realize 
this year's economic development objectives, it is important to 
strengthen the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
and expand the state sector of the economy. On this basis, 
steps must be taken to quicken the pace of development of the 
collective economy and give positive support to the development 
of individual and private economies. It is important to 
concentrate efforts on grasping the following six tasks: 
  1. Bring about the all-round development of the rural 
economy, taking as our primary objective increases in the supply 
of essential agricultural products and peasants' income. 
Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. It is 
also the sector that can ensure the country's stability. This 
year, the primary task of our rural work is to implement the 
spirit of the Central Committee Conference on Rural Work, 
improve the infrastructure, rely on scientific and technological 
advances to develop township enterprises and strengthen the 
collective economy, and try by all and every means to reap a 
bumper harvest in agriculture and to increase peasants' income. 
  Centering round the task of increasing the supply of 
essential agricultural and sideline products, we should 
energetically grasp grain and cotton production and the 
"shopping basket" project, striving to ensure a stable and high 
yield for principal agricultural products such as grain, cotton, 
and oil- bearing crops, with output targeted at 9.5 million tons 
for grain, 90,000 tons for cotton, and 400,000 tons for 
oil-bearing crops. From the time new grain is ready to go to the 
market, steps must be taken to suitably raise the procurement 
price of grain and the order price for cotton. Positive steps 
must be taken to develop agroindustry and stabilize the price of 
capital goods in the agricultural sector. It is important to 
increase agricultural input and make a success of the 
comprehensive development of agriculture. It is also important 
to continue to mobilize the masses to carry out farmland water 
conservancy capital construction in a big way and improve the 
conditions of agricultural production. Efforts must be made to 
accelerate the development of agricultural mechanization and 
raise the level of agricultural modernization. It is necessary 
to energetically develop forestry and accelerate the development 
of protective forestry belts in the "three northern regions," 
and of afforestation in the Taihang Mountains and on the plains 
in an effort to improve the ecological environment. It is also 
necessary to earnestly put the "Land Management Law" into 
practice, cherish arable land, and pay attention to its 
protection. 
  In order to increase peasants' income and quicken the 
process 
of achieving a moderate level of prosperity in the rural areas, 
we should rely on the development of high-yield, 
high-efficiency, and high-quality agriculture and the 
development of township enterprises. Gearing ourselves to 
market needs, we should concentrate efforts on the readjustment 
and optimization of the rural industrial structure, 
energetically develop economic crops, forestry, orchards, animal 
husbandry, aquatic production, and the processing of farm and 
sideline products that have broad market prospects and promise 
good economic results, and make a success of the development of 
commodity grain and commodity cotton production bases, as well 
as bases for the production and processing of agricultural, 
forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline products. We should 
actively develop economic associations that combine farming, 
breeding and processing, production, supply and marketing, or 
agriculture, industry, and trade, improve collectivized social 
services, and guide and organize peasants to take part in market 
competition and to open up and seize markets. Accelerating the 
development of township enterprises is not only the principal 
way to increase peasants' income and strengthen the rural 
collective economy, but is an important measure for accelerating 
economic development in the whole province. This year, township 
enterprises must devote more attention to economy of scale, 
structural readjustment, upgrading technology, and economic 
performance, ensure a growth rate of over 25 percent, and 
achieve increases in both sales revenue and taxes paid to the 
higher authorities. Every effort must be made to build three 
prefectures and cities with an income of 10 billion yuan, 30 
counties (city districts) with an income of 1 billion yuan, 300 
townships (small towns) with an income of 100 million yuan, and 
1,000 villages with an income of 10 million yuan. It is 
important to build relatively centralized industrial 
subdistricts and speed up the urbanization of rural market 
towns. It is important to continue to implement measures aimed 
at protecting peasants' interests, strictly control centralized 
profit retention to a given percentage, strengthen fiscal 
management in the rural areas, keep accounts open and 
effectively reduce peasants' burdens. 
  It is important to devote major efforts to poverty relief, 
increase input into the work, speed up the construction of 
infrastructural facilities, such as roads, power plants, and 
telecommunications in poverty-stricken mountainous areas, 
continue to tackle problems of drinking water for men and 
livestock, schooling and medical service in these areas, support 
the poor through advances in science, technology, and education, 
and concentrate efforts on making a success of the Luliang 
project, which has been set up as an example for shaking off 
poverty. 
  2. Accelerate industrial development and improve 
economic performance, taking the readjustment of product mix and 
the upgrading of technology in enterprises as points of 
emphasis. With market needs as guidance, we should actively 
support the development of newly emerging industries and 
industries enjoying a strong competitive edge, expand the 
production of fine-processed products and products making use of 
high and new technologies, concentrate efforts on making a 
success of coal-burning power generation, coal-related chemical 
production, the production of special steel products, heavy 
machinery, aluminum and aluminum products, as well as the 
processing of farm and sideline products, and push forward the 
readjustment of the industrial structure. In a situation where 
imbalance between the supply of and demand for coal has been 
ameliorated, it is necessary to practice the system where 
production is determined by transport capacity, strike a balance 
between production and marketing, pay attention to the 
protection of resources, prohibit unauthorized mining and market 
dumping. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on the 
construction of key power plants and accelerate the work of 
supplying electricity to Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, and 
Tianjin in order to turn our province into a commodity 
electricity base. It is necessary to raise funds by every means 
in order to speed up the development of the aluminum industry. 
  We should bring into play the superiority enjoyed by the 
Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in the production of special 
steel products and increase the proportion of high-quality steel 
in its production. Measures must be taken to invigorate the 
machine-building, electronic, and automotive industries. We 
should energetically develop the production of high- grade 
cement, plate glass, special refractory materials, granite, new 
building and interior decoration materials as well as refined 
chemical products, and turn these into new growing areas of our 
economy. We should tap the potential of the military industry, 
and speed up the development of civilian products. Our consumer 
goods industry is a weak link that calls for increased input and 
considerably faster development. To begin with, we should try 
to boost the production of foodstuffs, hides, and ceramics. In 
all trades and industries, it is important to readjust the 
product mix in line with market needs, and increase the 
production of competitive products, brand-name and high-quality 
products, high- and new-technology products, and export products 
for earning foreign exchange. It is also important to actively 
open up markets, strive to boost sales, and raise the selling 
rate of products. 
  The fundamental way to readjust the product mix and improve 
economic performance lies in tapping latent potential, upgrading 
technology and using incremental production elements to bring 
along the readjustment of existing production elements. The 
upgrading of technology in old enterprises must be accorded 
strategic importance and grasped with every effort, and steps 
must be taken to rationally readjust the use of fixed assets and 
increase the intensity of technological upgrading. This year, 
investment in the upgrading of technology has initially been 
fixed at 4 billion yuan, 1.7 billion yuan more than last year, 
and efforts will be made to speed up the upgrading of 42 large 
and medium-sized enterprises. Meanwhile, a number of projects 
involving short construction cycles and small investment but 
that will yield quick results will be launched. These are 
expected to produce results in the same year investment is made. 
It is also necessary to establish and improve research and 
development systems in enterprises, and organize colleges and 
universities, research units and manufacturing enterprises to 
launch various forms of technical cooperation or join hands in 
tackling problems. Effective measures must be taken to 
concentrate resources on making a success of the Taiyuan and 
Changzhi High-Tech Industrial Development Zones. Governments at 
all levels must work on the overall coordination of economic 
operation in accordance with the requirements of the socialist 
market economy. It is important to continue to practice the 
system of responsibility for stopping losses, and reduce losses 
by 15 percent compared with the previous year. It is also 
important to pay attention to the promotion of safety and do a 
good job of safety in production. 
  3. Speed up the development of tertiary industry by 
attaching importance to key areas and relaxing policy 
restrictions. In line with the requirements for the 
development of the market economy, it is necessary to 
concentrate efforts on making improvements in commodity 
circulation, communications and transportation, posts and 
telecommunications, finance and insurance, tourism and the 
service industries, and increase the weighting of tertiary 
industry in GNP on the basis of last year's figure. It is 
necessary to speed up the construction of facilities for 
commodity circulation and improve the commodity circulation 
network with key cities at the lead and medium-sized and small 
cities as the foundation. Further efforts should be made to 
mobilize the masses to render voluntary service in road repairs, 
do a good job of highway construction, and realize the goal of 
making every township accessible by highways, every small town 
accessible by asphalt roads, and every village accessible by 
motor vehicles over the next two years. This year, the capacity 
of local program-controlled telephone switches will be increased 
by 400,000 lines and that of long-distance switches will be 
increased by 50,000 circuits. The number of cities and counties 
with local program-controlled switches will be increased to over 
70, and telecommunications facilities for the province as a 
whole will be further improved. It is important to develop in a 
planned way all kinds of financial institutions, such as 
specialized insurance companies, trust and investment companies, 
securities companies, financing and leasing companies and 
enterprise group finance companies, establish and develop 
foundations, cultivate bonds and securities markets, and broaden 
the channels for investment and financing. It is important to 
energetically develop accounting, auditing, law, and notorial 
offices, as well as information counseling, real estate, 
tourism, culture and recreation, and livelihood services. Also, 
we should fully bring into play and utilize our rich tourist 
resources, improve the infrastructure and increase the number of 
tourist spots in order to attract more Chinese and overseas 
tourists to visit our province. 
  In order to accelerate the development of tertiary industry, 
it is necessary to relax policy restrictions, open the industry 
to all, and uphold the policy of allowing state, collective, and 
private undertakings to grow together. In particular, it is 
necessary to energetically develop the nonstate economic sector 
which includes collective, individual, and foreign economies in 
both urban and rural areas. It is necessary to open the doors, 
dismantle the barriers, and attract unemployed youths in cities 
and surplus labor in the rural areas to set up business in the 
tertiary sector. Self- service organizations run by enterprises 
and establishments must gradually break away from their 
"mothers" and follow the road of independent management by 
assuming responsibility for their own profits and losses, 
gearing themselves to social needs and fighting for their own 
survival. 
  4. Continue to do a good job of key construction 
projects around the "three foundations and four key areas." 
Key construction projects have a vital bearing on the overall 
situation and the reserve strength for economic development in 
our province and must therefore be grasped with unremitting 
efforts year after year. We must uphold the principle of 
working within our capability and to the best of our ability, 
and concentrate our material and financial resources and main 
energy on completing the existing major infrastructure projects. 
This year, key projects in the fields of agriculture, energy, 
water conservancy, transportation, education, and science and 
technology will continue to receive guaranteed investment in 
fixed assets. Arrangements have been made for 20 key projects 
at the provincial level, including the Huanghe River diversion 
at Wanjiazhai and 16 other ongoing projects. The three new 
projects are the library building at Shanxi University, the 
science and technology building at Taiyuan Polytechnic 
University, and the eight-ton truck production line at Shanxi 
Automotive Works. Eight projects, including the updating of the 
Taiyuan Railway Station, are due for completion this year. 
Every effort will be made to start work on the proposed 
Yangcheng No.1 Power Plant, a key project under the strategy of 
attaching equal importance to coal and power export. 
Preparation for the Wangqu Power Plant, intended to supply 
power to Shandong, as well as the power plant intended to supply 
power to Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei will also be stepped up. 
  The shortage of funds is a striking problem in the 
construction of key projects in our province. We must work hard 
not only on raising funds, but also on the use of funds. We 
must do a good job of absorbing funds and resort to all ways and 
means to draw capital from abroad and from other provinces and 
cities. Funds for construction may be raised through the 
auctioning of land-use rights and the property rights of some 
state-owned enterprises and through the issuance of bonds and 
shares. We should practice the system of responsibility for 
project legal persons, strengthen management over construction 
work, ensure the progress and quality of construction, and 
strive for better investment returns. We must continue to check 
up on projects under construction, reduce investment in fixed 
assets, and resolutely halt duplicated projects, projects 
showing poor performance and dim market prospects, and projects 
without the necessary fund injection. 
  5. Vigorously develop science, technology and 
education and ensure their coordinated development alongside 
economic construction. Governments at all levels and all 
enterprises must implement the "Scientific and Technological 
Advancement Law," increase scientific and technological input 
through different channels and, while doing a good job of 
research on the basic theories of applied technologies and 
building up technological strength, concentrate efforts on the 
application, dissemination and popularization of existing 
scientific and technological achievements. In dealing with the 
weak links in the development of industrial and agricultural 
production and the technical problems confronting our key 
industries, we must organize and concentrate resources on 
tackling these key problems. This year, we must complete the 
work of tackling 40 technical problems in agriculture and 30 
technical problems in industry. We must continue to implement 
the "Spark Program," "Torch Program," and programs for the 
dissemination of research results, concentrate efforts on 
grasping the dissemination and application of 37 of these 
research results and promoting their commercialization and use 
in all types of enterprises as quickly as possible, and strive 
to increase the extent to which research results are turned into 
productive forces and to improve economy of scale. We must 
actively readjust the structure of science and technology, 
energetically develop nongovernmental scientific and 
technological enterprises, and gradually form a research, 
development, and dissemination system that has an optimal 
structure and a rational distribution system and works in close 
conjunction with economic development. 
  We must accelerate the development of education by earnestly 
putting into practice the "Outline for Reform and Development of 
Education in China" and the "Law Governing Teachers." We must 
increase input in basic education and concentrate efforts on 
improving primary school education in 38 poverty-stricken 
counties. We must mobilize all forces in society to support 
"Operation Hope" in order to increase student enrollment among 
school-aged students in poverty-stricken areas and speed up the 
enforcement of nine-year compulsory education. With 
vocational-technical education as the point of emphasis in the 
restructuring of education, we must energetically develop all 
kinds of secondary vocational and technical schools and skilled 
workers' schools, and do a good job of running 
vocational-technical schools of high standards in some counties 
and districts. We must actively develop adult education and 
concentrate efforts on providing on-the-job training for workers 
and continue efforts to eliminate illiteracy among young and 
middle- aged people. In tertiary education, it is important to 
stabilize the scale, positively readjust the curriculum setup, 
reform teaching materials and improve the quality of teaching. 
While concentrating efforts on the successful running of Shanxi 
University and Taiyuan Polytechnic University, it is necessary 
to strengthen the establishment of key disciplines, laboratories 
and research institutions in other colleges and universities. 
  It is necessary to further enhance people's awareness of 
the importance of "invigorating Shanxi through the application 
of scientific and technological advances" and foster a fine 
social atmosphere of paying attention to scientific and 
technological education, respecting knowledge, and respecting 
qualified people. More effective measures should be adopted to 
arouse and bring into play the enthusiasm of intellectuals by 
improving their work, study, and living conditions and giving 
handsome rewards to those who have made outstanding 
contributions. We must continue to do a good job of 
intellectual imports, the import of qualified people, and the 
dispatch of personnel to other units, and attract more 
outstanding people to come to work in Shanxi by putting into 
practice the policy of "supporting students studying overseas, 
encouraging them to returning and letting them decide for 
themselves whether to come or go." 
  6. Try by all means to increase people's income, 
strive to improve the quality of life, and actively develop 
various types of social undertakings. Continuously 
improving people's material and cultural life on the basic of 
economic development is the starting point and ultimate goal of 
government work. This year, the per capita living expense 
income of city dwellers is to increase by 15.5 percent to 1,980 
yuan, while peasants' net income is to increase by 11.4 percent 
to 800 yuan. Governments at all levels must attach importance 
to and firmly grasp the task of increasing people's income and 
ensure the successful realization of the targeted increases. At 
present, there is a decline in income among workers in 
enterprises that are performing poorly or have totally or 
partially ceased production, as well as among some retired 
personnel. Due to fiscal problems, government functionaries and 
primary and secondary school teachers in some places did not 
receive their wages on time. Some poverty-stricken areas and 
remote mountainous areas still have problem securing enough food 
and clothing for their people. People who have relations and 
cannot support themselves, families of martyrs and armymen, as 
well as the handicapped, also have a difficult time making ends 
meet. Governments at all levels must take effective measures to 
deal with these problems. In order to correctly handle the 
relations between accumulation and consumption, it is necessary 
to uphold the principle of "first, feed the people and, second, 
build the country" in arranging fiscal expenditure. On no 
account should money for feeding the people be spent on 
construction or on ostentation and extravagance. As in the 
"three constructions," it is necessary to promote in a big way 
the campaign to increase production, practice economy, raise 
revenues and reduce expenditure, and develop a healthy habit of 
thinking it an honor to practice economy and a disgrace to 
waste. In particular, leading cadres at all levels must take 
the lead in practicing frugality, and all government 
functionaries must be the first to bear hardships and the last 
to enjoy comforts, and must wage hard struggle alongside the 
masses. It is necessary to attach importance to stabilizing 
prices and controlling inflation in economic work, establish a 
reserve system for important commodities, improve the system for 
the collection and use of the price regulation fund, strengthen 
market and price management, deal strict blows to fake and 
inferior commodities, fully take into consideration the 
tolerance level of the masses in price readjustment, and keep 
annual retail price rise under 10 percent. 
  Great efforts must be made to resolve practical problems of 
concern to the masses and raise their quality of life. We 
should firmly uphold the policy of prevention first, and make a 
serious effort to grasp the prevention and treatment epidemic 
and vocational diseases, particularly endemic diseases. This 
year, it is important to concentrate efforts on upgrading and 
equipping hospitals in 82 key small towns and townships with a 
population of over 10,000 in 50 poverty-stricken counties to 
facilitate the masses. We must extensively promote mass sports 
activities, improve people's physique, and do a good job of 
running the ninth provincial games. We must show concern and pay 
attention to the work of looking after the aged and develop 
old-age care. We must speed up housing construction, develop 
urban gas supply networks, and improve the water supply 
conditions in both urban and rural areas. This year, efforts 
will be made to tackle the drinking water problem for 900,000 
more people, striving to completely resolve the problem of 
finding drinking water for both men and animals in rural areas 
in the whole province and the water supply problem for people in 
16 poverty-stricken counties. The work of forecasting natural 
disasters must be strengthened and a good job must be done in 
rescue and relief. We must pay greater attention to 
environmental protection and earnestly enforce environmental 
protection laws and regulations, with the focus on the control 
of the three types of industrial wastes, in order to further 
improve the environmental quality of the provincial capital 
Taiyuan and of the whole province. Governments at all levels 
must attach great importance to family planning, further 
strengthen management by objective, strictly enforce birth 
control laws, regulations and policies, effectively strengthen 
propaganda, education and services, put the focus of work on the 
rural areas and the floating population, and resolutely keep the 
natural population growth rate to under 13 per thousand. 
  III. Strive for Overall Advance, Make Breakthroughs 
in Key Areas, Quicken the Pace of Reform for the Establishment 
of the Socialist Market Economic Structure 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
charted the grand blueprint for the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure. Early this year, the 
Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Provincial CPC Committee 
passed the proposals for implementing the "Decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" and made 
overall arrangement for reform and opening up in the last seven 
years of the 20th century. Since this year will be the 
foundation-laying year for the establishment of the new market 
economic structure, and since the scope, intensity and 
difficulty of reform will be significantly increased, we must 
make an all-out effort and concentrate on pushing forward reform 
in the following three areas with a view to making breakthroughs 
in our endeavors. 
  1. Do well in the implementation of measures for major 
macro- control reforms. The series of major measures 
adopted by the state since the beginning of the year for the 
reform of the fiscal, financial, investment, planning, and 
foreign trade management systems are of decisive importance in 
setting the framework of the new structure. Reforms aimed at 
establishing and improving the macrocontrol system are the focal 
points of this year's national reform; they are also an 
important task in our provincial reform. Governments at all 
levels and general economic departments concerned must do a 
serious and meticulous job of all necessary groundwork and 
carefully organize implementation. On the basis of the division 
of provincial and local administrative jurisdiction, the 
existing fiscal system where local governments are allowed to 
retain all the above-quota revenue is to be replaced by a fiscal 
system of revenue sharing between the provincial and local 
governments. It is important to pay close attention to the 
establishment of local taxation systems, form local taxation 
organs, and strictly enforce tax collection and management in 
order to increase fiscal revenue. We should establish a system 
of unified budgeting, make overall arrangements for budgetary 
and nonbudgetary funds, strengthen budgetary constraints, and 
make more efficient use of fiscal revenue. In practicing the 
new fiscal and taxation system, it is necessary to properly 
handle the relations between provincial and local governments 
and between the state and enterprises in order to arouse the 
enthusiasm of all quarters. Reform of the financial, 
investment, planning, and foreign trade management systems must 
be conducted positively and steadily in accordance with the 
steps and procedures prescribed by the state. These reform 
measures introduced this year are rich and specialized in 
content and contain many new concepts and stipulations. For 
this reason, it is necessary to create favorable conditions for 
the smooth implementation of these reform measures by actively 
publicizing the main ideas of these reforms as well as knowledge 
pertaining to these areas and by strengthening cadre training. 
  2. Strive to make marked progress in reform in six key 
areas. The proposals for the implementation of the 
"Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee" in our province made it clear that we must make 
overall plans, strive for overall advance, make breakthroughs in 
key areas, implement the reforms step by step, and quicken the 
pace of reform and opening up in the whole province. This year, 
we must concentrate on six key areas and strive to make 
breakthroughs in reforms in some key links and key areas. 
  (1) We must speed up the establishment of a modern 
enterprise 
system that is suited to the needs of the development of the 
market economy, and concentrate efforts on making a breakthrough 
in the reform of the property rights system. Since large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the pillars of the 
national economy, and reform of these enterprises is the focal 
and difficult point in the reform of the economic structure, it 
is necessary to attach importance to this reform. We must 
continue to put the "Enterprise Law" and "Regulations" into 
practice and make sure that enterprises are given their share of 
responsibility, rights, and interests. Arbitrary appropriations, 
fund-calls and charges must be halted in order to protect the 
legitimate rights and interests of enterprises. It is important 
to further grasp the experimental transformation of operational 
mechanism in 100 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, 
begin the work of reappraising the stocks and assets of 
enterprises and of defining their property rights, take positive 
steps to relieve enterprises of their historical burdens, and 
create favorable conditions for reorganization in line with the 
corporate system. From these 100 pilots, 25 larger enterprises 
which perform well and which possess the necessary conditions 
should be selected and reorganized into corporate bodies in 
accordance with the requirements for the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system. The number of enterprises selected to 
try out the shareholding system should be increased from the 
present 260 to 560. The auctioning of small state-owned 
enterprises and large and medium- sized enterprises should be 
accelerated. State-owned enterprises with heavy losses, more 
liabilities than assets, and no potential for development should 
be resolutely liquidated in accordance with law. It is 
important to effectively strengthen the management of 
state-owned assets, grasp well the experimental points for the 
supervision and management of assets in state-owned enterprises 
in the two cities Datong and Yangquan and in the 
machine-building and electrical appliance industry, explore new 
approaches and accumulate experience. 
  Taiyuan has been chosen by the state as a pilot city for 
bringing about "the optimum structure of capital and the 
invigoration of enterprises." We should seize this opportunity 
to quicken the pace of enterprise reform. All localities should 
proceed from reality and strive to make bigger headway and 
achieve greater success on the basis of reform in small 
state-owned enterprises and urban collective enterprises. 
  (2) Step up the establishment of a unified and open market 
system for orderly competition, and concentrate efforts on 
making a breakthrough in the cultivation of a production factor 
market. We should put an end to the previous practice where 
urban markets were stressed at the expense of rural markets, 
comprehensive markets were stressed at the expense of 
specialized markets and commodity markets were stressed at the 
expense of production factor markets, and strive to broaden the 
market scopes and form links with markets nationwide and in the 
international arena. Efforts should be made to further develop 
financial markets and open all kinds of fundraising channels, 
both direct and indirect. Positive steps must be taken to 
cultivate and develop labor markets and form an employment 
mechanism for the rational flow of manpower, where workers can 
choose their own jobs and enterprises can choose their own 
workers. It is important to step up the development of 
technology markets and strive to complete the establishment of a 
permanent, regular, and high-standard technology market at the 
provincial level in the not too distant future. While putting 
the primary land market under state monopoly, we should 
deregulate and invigorate the secondary land market, guide the 
healthy development of the land market, and use land to bring 
business and generate profits. We should pay close attention to 
the establishment of property rights transaction markets, 
encourage the flow of existing enterprise assets and promote the 
formation of different property rights structures. We should 
also establish specialized wholesale markets in production, 
marketing and distribution centers of staple agricultural 
products, manufactured consumer goods, and capital goods. 
  (3) Step up the establishment of rational labor distribution 
and social security systems, and concentrate efforts on making a 
breakthrough in the reform of the unemployment insurance, 
medical, and housing systems for enterprise employees. Social 
security in urban and rural areas should be resolved in diverse 
and multi- layered ways, with the provincial authorities making 
overall plans for pensions for employees of state-owned 
enterprises and the county authorities making overall plans for 
pensions for employees of urban collective enterprises. We 
should earnestly put into practice the State Council's 
"Regulations Concerning Unemployment Insurance for Employees of 
State-Owned Enterprises" and lose no time working out detailed 
rules for the implementation of these regulations in our 
province. We should make positive efforts to reform the free 
medical system and promote the practice where medical expenses 
are appropriately tied to individuals. At the same time, 
efforts should be made to try out the medical insurance system 
at selected units and gradually establish a medical insurance 
system that links the medical insurance fund for serious illness 
with personal medical accounts. In the reform of the urban 
public housing system, we should put the stress on the sale of 
public housing, promote the provident fund system in an 
all-round way, and quicken the pace of public housing sales. 
  (4) Step up the establishment of a new system for the 
development of commercialized agriculture and the rural market 
economy, and concentrate efforts on making a breakthrough in the 
reform of the land-use system and the development of a 
joint-stock cooperative system. Land-use rights should be 
deregulated. Upon expiry of contracts for the use of farm 
plots, land-use rights should be extended and kept intact for 30 
years without change in ordinary areas and for 50 years in 
poverty-stricken and remote mountainous areas. Rights for the 
use of "four types of barren land" auctioned or contracted out 
to peasants should be kept intact without change for 100 years. 
Land-use rights may be traded, leased, or converted into share 
capital in accordance with law. On the basis of clearly 
defining property rights, we should promote the rural 
joint-stock cooperative system in an all-round way, taking 
counties as units, and strive to achieve marked progress in this 
regard in one-third of our counties. Experimental reforms on 
household registration should be conducted in Shouzhou and some 
small towns, where peasants will be permitted to settle in 
cities to work in factories, do business or join the service 
industry. 
  (5) Accelerate the establishment of a system of science, 
technology, and education which promotes the development of the 
market economy, and concentrate efforts on making a breakthrough 
in the reform of the system of personnel training and 
employment. We should deepen the reform of the scientific and 
technological system in an all-round way around the task of 
invigorating research organs and promoting the flow of skills. 
We should actively support the development of nongovernmental 
scientific and technological enterprises and encourage 
scientific and technological personnel to go and work on 
contracted technological projects in the rural areas. In keeping 
with the need to develop the market economy, it is important to 
actively readjust the structure of education, and concentrate 
efforts on the development of vocational-technical education. 
It is important to give schools the necessary decisionmaking 
powers in running their own affairs and gradually increase the 
percentage of students enrolled through agency and of 
self-funded students in colleges and universities and in 
technical secondary schools. 
  The system of job allocation for graduates of colleges and 
universities should be reformed so as to give both graduates and 
employing units the right to choose. Measures should be taken to 
encourage university graduates and technical secondary school 
leavers to go and work in enterprises, especially township 
enterprises. It is important to reform the systems of personnel 
training, selection, exchange, and employment, remove the 
barriers between ownership systems and between cadres and 
workers, promote the rational flow of qualified personnel, and 
develop a mechanism of incentive and competition for qualified 
personnel. 
  (6) Accelerate the establishment of a new system for foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, open the province wider to the 
outside world, and concentrate efforts on making a breakthrough 
in the use of foreign capital and the import of technology. In 
keeping with the direction of "unified policy, open operation, 
fair competition, responsibility for one's own profits and 
losses, integration of industry and trade, and practice of the 
agency system" efforts should be made to quicken the pace of 
reforming the system of foreign trade and economic cooperation 
and opening to the outside world, seize the favorable 
opportunity, make better use of foreign funds, resources, 
technologies and markets, and develop an export-oriented 
economy. While improving the "hard" environment, it is also 
necessary to attach importance to the improvement of the "soft" 
environment by rationalizing the system by which external 
investors are attracted to do business in the province, provide 
better services by centralizing approval and clearance 
procedures, and truly put into practice the series of 
preferential policies formulated by the state and our province 
to attract foreign investors and investment from Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan compatriots. Taiyuan is the political, 
economic, and cultural center of our province, as well as an 
open city in the Chinese heartland. Efforts should be made to 
improve and strengthen the city's urban construction and 
management and see to it that it is kept clean, tidy, civilized, 
and orderly so as to create a desirable living and investment 
environment. Positive steps should be taken to encourage old 
enterprises to carry out overhauls using foreign capital, and to 
promote the healthy development of the three types of partially 
or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. We should aim at 
establishing over 400 partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises in the province in the year 1994, with total 
investment exceeding $500 million. Better guidance should be 
given to the use of foreign capital in order that more funds 
will go to the basic industries, infrastructure, and key 
projects. We should continue to grasp the construction of 
export commodity bases, readjust the export product mix, improve 
their grade and quality, and actively open up new overseas 
markets in an effort to increase foreign exchange earnings. 
Foreign trade enterprises should be encouraged to make 
themselves more competitive by developing into profit-oriented 
international business groups. Efforts should be made to do a 
good job of foreign economic cooperation and strengthen the 
management of off-shore enterprises. The whole province and all 
trades and professions should make concerted efforts to create a 
stronger and more animated atmosphere of opening up. 
  (3) Actively push forward the reform of administrative 
organs 
to change the function of the government. Reforming the 
administration and changing the function of the government is 
essential to establishing the socialist market economy and 
accelerating economic development. The chief problems in this 
respect are overstaffed departments, lax discipline, and low 
efficiency. We should, in accordance with the principle of 
separating government and enterprise functions and maintaining 
streamlined, unified, and efficient administration, abolish or 
merge some of the specialized economic departments and 
institutions which overlap with or perform similar functions as 
others, reduce the number of nonpermanent organs, strengthen 
departments in charge of macrocontrol and supervision, and 
reinforce the functions of social management departments. 
Matters that fall within the jurisdiction of enterprises should 
be left to enterprises, matters that should be handled by market 
forces should be left to the market, and matters that can be 
handled by market intermediaries should be left to intermediary 
organs. At the same time, it is also important to strengthen 
the functions of the government in macrocontrol, comprehensive 
coordination, and social management. Institutional reform 
should be launched in full this year, and reform of 
provincial-level institutions should be completed in the main 
within the first six months. On this basis, the system of 
public service should be introduced. In the reform of 
institutions, the main difficulty lies in making appropriate job 
arrangements for displaced personnel. In this respect, it is 
important to conduct active and appropriate ideological work and 
broaden the avenues for accommodating the displaced staff. For 
example, some may be transferred to work in grass-roots units, 
or encouraged to go into the service sector, while others may be 
asked to join public institutions or corporations. We should 
see to it that all personnel, be they people who still work in 
the government or those displaced, can play their proper role 
and prove their ability. After the reform, government 
departments at all levels must strengthen their institutional 
restructuring in accordance with their terms of reference. They 
must streamline procedures, improve efficiency, and strive as 
quickly as possible to establish an operating mechanism that 
meets the need to develop the market economy. 
  At the same time, efforts should be made to intensify the 
reform of public institutions in accordance with the principle 
of separating the functions of the government and public 
institutions and the principle of collectivized services. 
Public institutions in the scientific and technological, 
educational, cultural, and public health sectors should, in 
light their own reality, explore their own road of operation 
along enterprise lines, face the market, and offer paid service. 
  Fellow deputies! Only by seizing the opportunity for reform 
can we seize the opportunity for development, and only by 
deepening reform can we accelerate development. People's 
governments at all levels must redouble their efforts in reform, 
carefully organize and coordinate their work, and promptly 
discover and deal with new situations and problems in the course 
of implementation so as to ensure the smooth progress of reform. 
<H5>  IV. Create a Fine Socio-Political Environment for Economic </H5>
Construction, Reform and Opening Up by Insisting on Doing Two 
Types of Work Simultaneously, Attaching Equal Importance to Both 
  Fellow deputies! The present formidable tasks of economic 
construction and reform need the assurance of a stable socio- 
political environment. The Seventh Session of the Sixth 
Provincial CPC Committee pointed out that this year we should go 
all out to grasp the "three major tasks" of reform, development, 
and stability, make new strides forward, show novelty and open 
up new horizons. This places higher demands on the work of the 
government. Firmly adhering to the principle of doing two types 
of work simultaneously and attaching equal importance to both, 
we must further strengthen cultural and ideological work, 
strengthen the establishment of the legal system, and strengthen 
the building of leadership bodies, the rank and file, as well as 
workstyle, in order to create a favorable socio-political 
environment for economic construction, reform, and opening up. 
  1. Effectively strengthen socialist culture and 
ideology, taking as our objective the cultivation of a new 
generation of better-educated, self-disciplined people with new 
ideals and moral integrity. We should, in the development 
of socialist culture and ideology, concentrate our efforts on 
the cultivation of a new generation of people with new ideals 
and moral integrity, who are better educated and have a strong 
sense of discipline, so as to provide a powerful spiritual drive 
and intellectual support to reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. We should organize cadres and the masses at all 
levels to carefully study volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping, and arm them with the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should conduct 
extensive, in-depth, and lively education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism, teach people to cherish their 
motherland, Shanxi, the collective, and their own native 
village, hold high the main theme, and energetically publicize 
heroes and exemplary models who demonstrate the spirit of the 
times on all fronts. We should continue to unfold in depth 
education on public-mindedness and professional ethics, oppose 
money worship, pleasure-seeking, and extreme individualism, and 
cultivate fine customs and habits. Our province has a glorious 
revolutionary tradition. Today, in pushing forward reform, 
speeding up development, and realizing the objective of 
revitalizing Shanxi and bringing prosperity to its people, we 
still need to energetically carry forward the spirit of the 
older generation of revolutionaries and heroes who defied 
difficulties and dared to sacrifice; we still need to 
energetically carry forward the enterprising spirit of new and 
old models in relying on their own efforts and working hard; and 
in particular, we still need to energetically carry forward the 
pioneering spirit of the pacesetters of reform in daring to 
blaze new trails, take risks, and set the pace for others. 
  In strengthening socialist culture and ideology, it is 
important to uphold the principles of serving the people and the 
cause of socialism and letting a hundred flowers bloom and a 
hundred schools of thought contend, and strive to bring further 
prosperity to cultural undertakings. Literature and art, the 
press and publishing, radio, film, and television should all 
strive to create and publish more and better works that reflect 
the spirit of the times, show local characteristics and are 
welcomed by the masses. They should arm people with scientific 
theories, guide people with correct opinions, mode people with 
lofty aspirations, and inspire people with outstanding works. 
It is important to strengthen cultural market market in 
accordance with law and strictly deal with illegal publishing 
activities. Efforts should be made to strengthen the protection 
of cultural relics and build more libraries, cultural palaces, 
museums, science and technology halls, and archives. Mass 
cultural and ideological activities should be given energetic 
support in the urban and rural areas. In the rural areas, we 
should carry out activities to promote material progress and 
cultural and ideological progress extensively and in great depth 
with the aim of achieving a modest level of prosperity. In the 
urban areas, we should carry out "civilized city" and "civilized 
unit" activities in a deepgoing and sustained way, with the 
focus on creating a beautiful environment, establishing a fine 
social order, and providing high-quality service. We should 
mobilize the masses to change their ways and habits by doing 
away with outmoded conventions, bad customs and superstitions, 
and encourage and foster socialist new concepts, moral standards 
and habits. 
  2. Maintain social stability by further 
strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system. 
The fundamental aim in strengthening socialist democratic 
politics is to protect the rights of the broad masses of the 
people as masters of the country. Governments at all levels 
should earnestly put into practice the resolutions and decisions 
passed by the people's congresses and their standing committees, 
take the initiative to make progress reports, consciously accept 
comments and supervision by the people's congresses and their 
standing committees, and accept supervision by the people's 
deputies and by the broad masses. They should strengthen ties 
with the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and 
other democratic parties, giving them support in participating 
in and discussing government and political affairs and 
fulfilling their role in political consultation and democratic 
supervision, in order to give full scope to the patriotic united 
front. They should attach importance to the role of trade 
unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, the 
China Association of Science and technology, the All-China 
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and other mass 
organizations as bridges and channels. They should adopt proper 
procedures for handling affairs in a democratic way, and see to 
it that there is adequate research and consultation before 
policy decisions are made so that the decisionmaking process 
will be more democratic and scientific. Governments at all 
levels should continue to open up channels through which to 
maintain contacts with the masses, paying close attention to the 
letters and visits they receive from the masses and keeping 
themselves informed of the people's criticisms of and demands on 
their work. They should strengthen democracy at the grass-roots 
level, see to it that the congresses of workers and other 
employees, the neighborhood committees and the villager 
committees function well, and encourage democratic participation 
at the grass-roots level. The party's policies on minority 
nationalities and religion should be earnestly put into practice 
in order to strengthen unity among all our nationalities. It is 
also important to strengthen religious affairs management and 
take positive steps to make religion compatible with socialism. 
  Strictly adhering to the spirit of the directive, "carry 
forward the fine traditions of the party controlling the armed 
forces and strengthen the building up of reserve forces for 
national defense," recently issued by Jiang Zemin, chairman of 
the Central Military Commission, in an inscription he wrote for 
the Shanxi Military District, as well as the guiding ideology of 
"subordinating to the overall interests of economic construction 
and meeting the needs of national defense construction," we 
should strengthen the building up of the militia and the 
reserves at the grass-roots level, organize these units to take 
an active part in the maintenance of public order, and launch 
activities of sustaining the armed forces through proceeds from 
physical labor so that they can contribute their share toward 
bringing Shanxi's economy to a new height. It is important to 
stabilize the armed forces departments at the grass-roots level, 
and educate people about the importance of national defense. 
The government should support the Army and give preferential 
treatment to families of armymen and martyrs, and the Army 
should support the government and show its concern for the 
people. The whole society must show concern for defense 
construction, cherish the people's soldiers, and make continuous 
efforts to consolidate the unity between the Army and the 
government and between the Army and the people. 
  We should attach importance to the legal system and 
strengthen the government's work in this respect. In keeping 
with the need to establish a new market economic structure, it 
is important to step up the establishment of local legal 
systems, actively put forward legislation proposals, and 
establish and improve administrative rules and regulations. 
Governments at all levels must learn to use legal means to run 
economic and social affairs, and abide by law in administrative 
matters. They must strictly enforce the "Law of Administrative 
Proceedings" and the "Regulations on Review of Administrative 
Measures," consciously accept supervision by law, by the media 
and by the masses, and resolutely correct violations of law such 
as failure to abide by the law, lax law enforcement, and letting 
law-breakers go free. They should attach great importance to 
and effectively strengthen the building up of the 
law-enforcement departments and raise the quality and 
law-enforcing ability of their personnel. All public servants 
must take the lead to study and understand law and set an 
example in abiding by law and discipline. Further efforts should 
be made to deepen education in the legal system and enhance 
people's awareness of the importance of the legal system and the 
sense of law throughout society. 
  Reform and development cannot take place without social 
stability. Governments at all levels must give priority to the 
maintenance of social stability and take effective steps to 
grasp this task firmly and well. They must strengthen the 
functions of the people's democratic dictatorship. The masses 
now feel very strongly about problems of public security. In 
this connection, it is necessary to deal heavy and quick blows 
at serious criminal offenses against people's lives and property 
and against modernization, and stop the growth in the number of 
criminal offenses. We should persist in combining specific 
struggles with overall control, crackdown with prevention, work 
conducted by specialized organs with work carried out by the 
masses, earnestly put into practice the system of leadership 
responsibility in the overall control of social order, and hand 
down measures for the overall control of social order to 
individual villages, neighborhoods, schools, government organs 
and industrial and mining enterprises. 
  Cases of major importance should be seriously investigated 
and dealt with, and economic offenders should be brought to 
justice in accordance with law. We should purify the social 
atmosphere, take resolute measures to ban social evils, and 
continue to wage struggles against pornography and "the six 
evils." We should correctly handle contradictions among the 
people, do a good job of resolving contradictions and tackling 
problems as soon as they emerged. It is also important to 
strengthen reform through labor and re-education through labor. 
  3. Strengthen the leading organs, ranks, and style of 
work of governments at all levels, encourage a revolutionary 
spirit, and unite in struggle. A leading body that is 
united in struggle, a contingent of cadres who are diligent and 
honest in their work, and a workstyle that is pragmatic yet 
creative are the fundamental guarantees for the victorious 
completion of our tasks of reform and construction. They are 
also the key to the maintenance of social stability and 
political stability. Our government is the government of the 
people. Governments at all levels and their leading cadres must 
put the interests of the people above everything else, work with 
one heart and one mind, fulfill their duties and 
responsibilities, and devote all their energies to the cause of 
reform and development. It is important to effectively 
strengthen the building of a diligent and honest administration, 
continue to wage a deep-going struggle against corruption, 
resolutely correct fraudulent practices among various trades and 
professions, enforce strict discipline, and set strict 
requirements on cadres, seeing to it that they are clean and 
honest, hard-working, and forward- looking. Leading cadres at 
all levels must set a good example in being honest and 
well-disciplined, be the first to act, and work still harder at 
establishing and maintaining a fine image for government 
functionaries. It is important to further strengthen the 
building of a clean government and establish an effective 
restraining mechanism for preventing the abuse of power for 
personal gain as well as fraudulent practices among various 
trades and professions. Law enforcement departments at all 
levels must fulfill their supervisory functions in real earnest 
and seriously investigate and deal with violations of law and 
discipline. Corruption, whether it is a matter of abusing power 
for personal gains, trading power for money, offering and taking 
bribes, or serious dereliction of duty, must be thoroughly 
investigated and punished in accordance with law and discipline 
regardless of who is involved. Provided that we firmly rely on 
the masses, we will be able to triumph over corruption and win 
the support and backing of the people. 
  After the general principles and work tasks have been set, 
the key lies in truly and firmly putting them into practice. 
Leading cadres at all levels must effectively change their 
style of work and make real efforts to grasp implementation. It 
is important to cut down meetings, paper work and administrative 
and protocol functions, spend more time going deep into reality 
to conduct investigation and studies, and strive to take the 
initiative in work by promptly discovering and resolving new 
situations and new problems in reform and development. It is 
important to respect the creative initiative of the masses, and 
pay attention to summing up good typical examples and experience 
in the localities in order to promote work in the whole 
province. Governments at all levels must be concerned about the 
weal and woe of the masses, listen attentively to their views, 
and adopt their suggestions in solving practical problems. They 
should, as General Secretary Jiang Zemin urged, always show 
concern for the masses, rely on the masses and do everything for 
the masses. They should resolutely overcome bureaucratism, 
resolutely oppose formalism which is neither realistic nor 
practical, and develop in the whole province a fine social 
habit, where everyone is honest, down-to-earth, realistic, and 
innovative. It is important to establish and improve systems of 
responsibility for objectives throughout one's tenure and for 
work each year. Starting from this year, the provincial 
government should divide important objectives into smaller 
projects and assign them to the provincial governor, vice 
governor, and department heads. They are to report their work 
at the end of each year, and their performance will be strictly 
appraised. Prefectural, city and county governments must also 
establish responsibility systems. They should ensure the 
victorious completion of all tasks set for this year, with each 
level grasping its work through to the end. 
  Fellow deputies! Our province is run by a good government 
which enjoys the support of the people, who desire progress. 
Now is the golden opportunity to speed up development. We are 
determined, under the correct leadership of the provincial party 
committee and the support and supervision of the provincial 
people's congress, to lead the people of the whole province to 
further emancipate their minds, resolutely carry out reform, 
push forward, and strive for the successful completion of this 
year's tasks with hard work and an enterprising spirit.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The mainland will 
properly handle the boat tragedy that claimed the lives of 24 
Taiwanese tourists and eight mainlanders, said a senior official 
from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS). 
  In a telephone conversation this afternoon with Chiao 
Jen-ho, 
vice-chairman and secretary general of the Taiwan-based Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF), Tang Shubei, vice-president of ARATS, 
said that leaders of the Chinese central government and other 
departments concerned attached serious importance to the 
accident. 
  He said Zhejiang Province had made emergency efforts to 
locate and recover the remains of the dead. The local 
authorities had also given a lot of help to the relatives of the 
victims who went to Zhejiang to settle the matter. 
  The 32 victims died on March 31 when the tourist boat they 
boarded burst into flames on Qiandao Lake in East China's 
Zhejiang Province. 
  Tang said that he understood SEF's expectations. 
  He said that ARATS had done everything it could to keep in 
touch with SEF. 
  He told Chiao that Beijing had dispatched a team of 
specialists to the accident site to conduct an investigation. 
  Tang said that such a tragedy was the last thing the two 
sides want to see, adding that there are more than one million 
Taiwan compatriots visiting the mainland every year. It was a 
rare accident, he said. 
  Chiao conveyed to Tang the concerns and opinions of the 
Taiwan public. Tang said he will forward the information to 
relevant departments.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Visiting Malaysian 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz 
said here Wednesday [6 April] that Malaysia supports Taiwan's 
bid to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). 
  Rifadah, however, said that Malaysia doesn't have a set 
policy on whether Taiwan or Mainland China should join the world 
organization first. Beijing has reiterated that it should be 
admitted into GATT ahead of Taipei. 
  Rifadah's visit here is part of her global efforts to woo 
investments in the Southeast Asian nation. She presided over a 
symposium on Malaysia's investment climate in the morning. 
  She also said that it's "logical" for Taiwan to become a 
founding member of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), a 
regional economic cooperation grouping proposed by Malaysian 
Prime Minister Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamed. 
  She said that to be an EAEC member, a candidate must be 
Asian 
country that is a member of the Asian-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Forum and Taiwan meets all these conditions. 
  In meeting Premier Lien Chan, Rafidah said that she is 
optimistic about the development of cooperative ties between 
Taiwan and Malaysia, 
  Lien in return expressed the hope that more ranking 
Malaysian 
officials would visit Taiwan to enhance mutual understanding and 
exchanges. He also asked Rafidah to forward his invitation for 
Prime Minister Mahathir to visit Taiwan.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Qian Qichen said here today that China would welcome civil 
servants in Hong Kong to continue to serve the public after 1997 
when China restores its sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  Qian, who is also foreign minister, made the remarks when 
meeting with a delegation from the Business and Professionals 
Federation of Hong Kong, headed by its chairman Vincent Lo Hong 
Sui. 
  Qian said that civil servants in Hong Kong do not need to 
worry about their future after 1997. 
  However, senior officials in the future Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region should meet the relevant requirements 
spelled out in the Basic Law, Qian said. Only a few are 
involved in this regard, most civil servants are welcome to 
continue their service, he said. 
  The vice-premier also attributed worries among some Hong 
Kong 
residents about the central government's policies towards Hong 
Kong after 1997 to the lack of knowledge of the Basic Law, in 
which, he said, most policies are clearly stated. 
  Therefore, he agreed with guests' ideas on accelerating the 
pace of spreading the knowledge of the Basic Law and even 
providing more financial support for these efforts.

  [Text] Wuhan, April 7 (XINHUA) -- With the launching of the 
Chang Jiang river development strategy and the Three Gorges 
water conservancy projects, central China's Hubei Province has 
become a new attraction for investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macao. 
  Since the beginning of 1993, a total of 1,882 investors from 
the three regions have registered in the province with total 
funds of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total from the 
three areas to seven billion U.S. dollars, according to the 
provincial industry and ?commerce bureau. 
  The investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao are 
interested 
in industry, construction, commerce, real estate, agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries in the province. 
  Their firms are located in the cities of Wuhan, Yichang, 
Huangshi and Ezhou along the Chang Jiang river, the biggest 
river in China. 
  The number of firms with investment over one million U.S. 
dollars each has reached 9. 
  Preferential policies and regulations have been announced by 
local governments to attract funds from the three regions.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP) -- China said Thursday it 
would send "nobody" to Pyongyang this month for President Kim 
Il-song's birthday party, in a sign of a brewing showdown 
between the communist allies over the Korean nuclear crisis. 
"The Chinese side will send nobody to the DPRK to attend the 
birthday celebrations of President Kim Il-song," said foreign 
ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin, when asked at a weekly press 
briefing whether even a low-level delegation would go. Wu 
insisted Beijing enjoyed "good relations" with Pyongyang, 
despite reports in Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper Thursday 
that North Korea had targetted some surface-to-surface missiles 
on China. 
  The spokesman said Beijing had not sent any senior leaders 
to 
Kim's 81st birthday last year -- however, Beijing's dispatch 
then of only two artistic delegations was widely interpreted as 
a snub to its long-time allies in Pyongyang. China has tried to 
distance itself from Stalinist North Korea in recent years and 
the ongoing crisis over Pyongyang's suspected development of 
nuclear missiles has heightened the tension. While refusing to 
support sanctions against North Korea to force it to open its 
nuclear facilities to international inspection, China -- a UN 
Security Council member -- has not thrown its support fully 
behind Pyongyang while refusing a role as an intermediary in the 
dispute. On Monday, Pyongyang rejected a China-framed appeal 
from the Security Council for it to allow full International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  Wu dismissed suggestions the rejection had humiliated 
Beijing. "We are always of the view that the nuclear inspections 
issue of the DPRK should be settled through dialogue and all 
parties concerned in this issue also expressed their desire to 
continue resolving this issue through dialogue. So there is no 
such thing as losing one's face," he said. 
  The Chinese ministry spokesman meanwhile reiterated 
Beijing's 
support for a negotiated settlement to the dispute, critizing 
the U.S. dispatch this week of Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
"Any action detrimental to the relaxation and stability of the 
situation on the peninsula, be it military exercise or 
deployment of missiles, is something we are not in favour of," 
he said. "Under the current circumstances, all parties 
concerned should in particular refrain from taking actions that 
will exacerbate the conflict," said Wu, urging all sides to show 
"patience."

verbal assault Thursday on its most famous dissident, Wei 
Jingsheng, warning he faced prosecution despite attempts by the 
United States to intervene on his behalf. Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin told a press conference that Wei, detained 
since last Friday, "has broken the law and must be prosecuted." 
  "These people are outsiders and are cut off from the Chinese 
reality," he said of Wei and other pro-democracy agitators. 
  The arrest of Wei was "a small problem that should not be 
exaggerated," Wu said. "There are people in jail anywhere in 
the world. In China, this is so because they have broken the 
law," he said, adding: "There is no universal penal code." 
  Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of 
a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in 
the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign ministry spokesman Wu derided suggestions that the 
government was "persecuting" dissidents. "It is a completely 
groundless accusation," he said. "For China, stability is 
essential for economic development and it is necessary to uphold 
order." 
  The row over Wei and other dissidents comes in the runup to 
the decision by President Bill Clinton, scheduled in June, to 
renew most-favoured-nation status for Chinese goods to the US 
market, a benefit estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars in customs dues.

  [Text] Wu Yi minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, is to head a trade delegation to the United States 
to attend the Eighth Session of the Sino-US Joint Committee on 
Commerce and Trade scheduled for April 13-14. On March 17, 
Beijing Review correspondent interviewed Minister Wu. 
  QUESTION: Minister Wu, you are preparing to lead a large 
trade delegation to the United States. What is the goal of your 
trip? 
  ANSWER: The most important mission of my participation is to 
jointly preside over the Eighth Session of the Sino-US Joint 
Committee on Commerce and Trade to be held on April 13-14 in 
Washington, D.C., with US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown. As 
an annual government-level meeting between trade representatives 
of the two governments, the committee session is the most 
important channel for discussions of bilateral economic and 
trade relations and other related questions. The session will 
be another major event following the Sino-US summit meeting in 
Seattle and the Eighth Session of the Joint Committee on 
Economics presided over jointly by the Chinese minister of 
finance and US finance secretary. 
  During the forthcoming session, the two sides will discuss 
trade and investment policies, and cooperation in various 
industrial sectors, including those related to information, 
energy, transportation, chemical industry and environmental 
cooperation, and legal issues. 
  As part of an effort to promote bilateral trade and US 
investment in China, our delegation will launch trade and 
investment negotiations in Los Angeles and New York on April 11 
and 19 respectively. I hope the negotiations will allow 
American industrialists to gain greater insight into the 
situation in China since the introduction of the reform and 
opening policies, and will provide them with access to China's 
vast potential market. I also hope the meetings will attract 
more American business people to trade with China and invest in 
our country. The purchasing group which will accompany the 
delegation to the United States will make purchases depending on 
advances made during the bilateral business talks. 
  Q: What will be the focus of the purchasing, and what will 
the level of purchases be in terms of funds? 
  A: The purchasing plan includes petroleum exploration and 
production equipment, motor vehicles, various technologies and 
light industrial products. The amount of purchases will depend 
on advances made during the talks. 
  Q: What about Sino-US trade and investment negotiations? 
What items will be included? 
  A: The large-scale negotiations designed to promote 
investment and trade are being held in the United States for the 
first time since China introduced the reform and opening 
policies 15 years ago. They will be sponsored jointly by the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
Graham &amp; James of the United States and the US Asian 
Association. The 200-member Chinese negotiating team will 
include senior officials in charge of investment and trade from 
eight ministries and commissions under the State Council, three 
corporations and 25 provinces and municipalities, as well as 
experts and entrepreneurs. Representatives from the six major 
corporations under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation will also participate in import and export 
negotiations. 
  The chief aim of the delegation's trip is to introduce 
China's reform, opening policies and economic development, in 
order to enhance mutual exchanges and understanding, and to 
develop and expand economic and technological cooperation and 
trade between the two countries. The delegation also intends to 
encourage US business people to invest in China and further 
expand investment and trade cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  About 800 key investment projects will be offered during the 
negotiations, including 60 hydroelectric and thermal power 
stations, 100 highway, railway, airport and wharf construction 
projects, 200 projects involving machine-building and electrical 
equipment, 100 electronics projects, 100 petrochemical projects, 
50 projects related to metallurgy and other industrial raw 
materials, and 30 projects involving agriculture, livestock 
breeding and forestry. 
  Q: How many similar purchasing delegation has China 
organized 
in the past, and how much have they influenced the development 
of Sino- US trade? 
  A: The Chinese government has consistently attached 
importance to the development of Sino-US economic and trade 
relations. Since 1990, China has sent four large purchasing 
delegations to the United States, two for comprehensive 
purchases and two for automobiles and aircraft. All have yielded 
good results. The delegations have purchased products valued at 
over US$3.5 billion, including aircraft, motor vehicles, grain, 
chemical fertilizers, cotton, petroleum, and machinery and 
equipment. The purchases have promoted the expansion of Sino-US 
economic and trade relations. Another purchasing delegation will 
be sent to the United States during the joint committee's 
forthcoming session. The actions indicate that the Chinese 
government attaches great importance to increasing the volume of 
imports from the United States. 
  Q: China experienced deficits in foreign trade last year, 
will substantial increases in imports from the United States 
further expand the deficit, and what influence will they exert 
on China's overall imports and exports? 
  A: Deficits in Sino-US trade are unavoidable. We believe 
that 
a basic balance should be maintained between imports and 
exports. However, instead of reducing imports, we insist on 
attaining the goal by expanding exports. Our goal is to import 
advanced technology and equipment needed for our modernization 
drive and materials which are in short supply domestically. The 
value of imports during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period 
(1991-95) is expected to reach US$400 billion. At present, about 
80 percent of our country's foreign exchange earnings come from 
exports. If the deficit continues to grow due to the sluggish 
increases in exports, our foreign exchange income will 
definitely fall and will in turn adversely affect imports. I 
hope our trade partners will increase their imports of our 
commodities, in order to help maintain the coordinated 
development of bilateral trade. 
  Q: The Chinese economy has developed rapidly and the whole 
world has expressed great concern about the opening of China's 
market. What is the current situation regarding the country's 
market? 
  A: Opening to the outside world was the basic principle 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China in late 1978. In 
recent years, we have further flung wide our market as part of 
our efforts to open our doors wider to the outside world. Since 
1991 alone, we have cut import taxes on 6,537 types of 
commodities and have abolished the import regulation tax. We 
have also abandoned all import substitute lists and will refrain 
from making such lists in the future. We will gradually cut 
licensing controls on 53 kinds of commodities currently subject 
to import licence controls. Furthermore, we will bring the role 
of the market economy into full play as the basis for the 
optimized allocation of resources, strengthen the guidance of 
industrial policies, and gradually reduce administrative 
examination procedures and control. Reform of the management 
mechanisms of state-owned enterprises has expanded their 
management autonomy and has granted them more power in terms of 
imports. Thanks to the series of policies we have adopted to 
open the market further, the country's imports have grown 
steadily over the past three years. In 1991, our import value 
hit US$63.8 billion, up 19.6 percent over 1990. The figure rose 
even further to US$80.6 billion in 1992, up 26.3 percent over 
1991, and to US$103.95 billion in 1993, a rise of 29 percent 
over 1992. Imports for this year will stay at or above last 
year's level, and the total import value over the coming seven 
years is expected to hit US$1,000 billion. The country plans to 
import 210 key technological items valued at US$30 billion 
between 1993 and 2000. Along with the reform of the foreign 
economic and trade system, measures will be taken to further 
open the market and bring it into line with the international 
market. Given the above- mentioned facts and well-based 
predictions, any reasonable person would conclude that China's 
market is indeed open to the world. I believe that the deepening 
of the reform of China's foreign economic and trade system will 
offer even more chances for the entry of foreign commodities 
into the Chinese market. 
  Q: What is the current status of Sino-US economic and trade 
relations? 
  A: As everyone knows, Sino-US trade has expanded rapidly 
since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in 
1979. According to statistics released by China's General 
Customs Administration, bilateral trade jumped from US$2.45 
billion in 1979 to US$27.7 billion last year, a net 12-fold 
increase. During the same period, investments by US businessmen 
increased on an annual basis. At present, the number of 
US-funded projects in China has topped 8,000 with combined 
contracted investments of US$11 billion, ranking first amongst 
all overseas investors. More than 50 of the top 500 US firms 
have established business bases in China. Although some 
problems occurred in Sino-US trade relations last year, 
bilateral trade and US investment in China continues to grow. 
  In my view, a major reason for the rapid development of 
bilateral trade and cooperation rests with the fact that the 
economies of the two countries have a strong nature of mutual 
supplementation. The United States possesses advanced 
technology and funds, while China has vast labor resources and 
potential markets. Each year, Chinese imports from the United 
States include large numbers of aircraft, and vast quantities of 
wheat, chemical fertilizers and other products, as well as 
machinery and electrical equipment, all of which are well 
received by Chinese clients and consumers. Along with the 
constant growth of the Chinese economy, imports from the United 
States have increased annually, with the value reaching US$6.6 
billion, US$8 billion, US$8.9 billion and US$10.7 billion for 
successive years between 1990 and 1993. Although deficits 
occurred in foreign trade last year, our imports of raw 
materials and energy, which faced critical shortages, and 
machinery and telecommunications equipment needed for further 
economic development increased considerably. This once again 
shows that China is a market with tremendous potential and is a 
market open wide to the outside world. 
  I believe that the sustained growth of China's economy and 
the country's grand economic development plan will create even 
more favorable trade and investment opportunities for American 
enterprises. We sincerely hope the US side will take positive 
and practical actions, cast aside man-made obstacles, lift 
controls on technology exports, and quickly resume the US Trade 
Development Agency's (TDA) financial aid for project feasibility 
studies, while at the same time providing US investors with risk 
guarantees from the US Overseas Private Investment Co., and 
reinstating preferential loans from the American Import and 
Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China. Such 
actions will help to further tap the vast potential of China's 
imports from the United States and US investments in China.

That the More the Economy Develops, the More We Should Control 
Population Growth; Li Zemin and Wen Xueyuan Speak; the Zhejiang 
Provincial Government Signs Target Management Responsibility 
Contracts With Cities and Prefectures"] 
  [Text] The provincial task force in charge of population 
and family planning held a provincial meeting on family planning 
work in Hangzhou on 5 March. Zhejiang party committee Secretary 
Li Zemin and Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke on some main issues on 
Zhejiang's family planning work in 1994. Xu Aiguang, provincial 
family planning commission chairman, reported on Zhejiang's 
administration of population and family planning targets in 1993. 
  Liu Xirong, Zhejiang party committee standing committee 
member and vice governor, chaired the meeting. Xu Xingguan and 
other leaders were present. 
  Wan Xueyuan, director of the provincial task force in charge 
of population and family planning and governor, affirmed 
Zhejiang's achievements in family planning work. He said: In 
1993, party committees and governments at various levels have 
continually strengthened leadership over family planning work, 
have strictly enforced the target management responsibility 
system, have persistently provided respective guidance in 
accordance with separate categories, and have resolutely handled 
major issues and arduous problems. Consequently, family 
planning work has been progressing favorably and Zhejiang has 
fulfilled its scheduled population growth plan. However, we 
cannot be optimistic over Zhejiang's population growth and 
family planning. Zhejiang will be under high-birth periods in 
1994 and 1995. High-birth periods for some cities and counties 
in south Zhejiang will continue up to the early 21st century. 
Zhejiang's family planning work has been progressing unevenly. 
While carrying out family planning work under new 
circumstances, Zhejiang has encountered some new conditions and 
problems. He pointed out: Population issues are social and 
economic issues. The faster the market economy develops, the 
more we should strengthen family planning work. We should 
firmly establish an overall view of population: We should 
integrate population issues as well as population and family 
planning work in the overall economic and social development, 
and should strive to coordinate population growth with economic, 
social, resources, and environmental development. At present, 
population problems are still an important constraint 
restricting Zhejiang's economic progress. In the course of 
establishing the market economy, we will still be facing 
population problems, which are major problems to be studied and 
resolved. Party committees and governments at various levels, 
particularly key leaders, should guide all the leading bodies to 
pay close attention to population issues; should coordinate, on 
their own initiative, with relevant departments so as to share 
the tasks according to their different functions in an effort to 
implement state policies on population; should ensure that 
various policies and measures are conducive to family planning 
work; and should comprehensively rectify population problems. 
Zhejiang's specific targets in 1994 are: By the end of 1994, 
Zhejiang's total population should be under 43.8 million; its 
population growth rate should be under 1.492 percent; and its 
population's natural growth rate should be under 0.839 percent. 
According to the requirements for improving counties with high 
birthrates, about six out of Zhejiang's 20 counties with high 
birthrates should get rid of the "high birthrates" term. 
According to the requirements on contraceptive management, 
about a quarter of Zhejiang's counties should implement 
contraceptive management in an all-around manner. According to 
the requirements on qualified villages, 60 percent of Zhejiang's 
administrative villages should be able to fulfill the family 
planning requirements. Consequently, the overall standards of 
Zhejiang's family planning work can be raised. 
  Li Zemin stressed at the meeting: We should establish an 
overall view that economic and social development should be 
coordinated with population growth. To attain a comfortably 
well-off living standard by the end of this century, Zhejiang 
should, first, sustain coordinated progresses in its economy, 
and, second, control its population growth. Zhejiang will still 
fail to attain a comfortably well-off living standard if it 
messes up family planning work leading to an uncontrolled 
population growth even though its economic indicators and 
figures have been raised. When handling related work, we should 
beware of future hardship, per capita share, individual 
responsibility, and the overall situation. He urged: Various 
localities should continually implement the system whereby party 
and government leaders personally handle the tasks and are held 
responsible eventually with each subordinate party committee and 
government held responsible to those at the next superior level. 
Party committees at various levels should annually hold two 
meetings to study family planning work. They should incorporate 
family planning work in the general programs for local economic 
and social development; should make annual arrangements to study 
problematic areas; and should strictly enforce relevant 
discipline and laws governing family planning work. We should 
regard the performance of family planning work as a criterion 
for evaluating cadres' work performance: Promotion will be 
denied to cadres who have not earnestly or effectively handled 
family planning tasks. Party and government leaders should 
study population theory. When handling related work, party 
committees and governments should stress problematic and key 
issues and basic tasks. 
  At the meeting, Governor Wen Xueyuan signed target 
management 
responsibility contracts on population and family planning with 
responsible officials of various city (prefectural) governments 
(administrative offices). 
  Attending the meeting were members of the provincial task 
force in charge of population and family planning and principal 
leaders of cities and prefectures.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Fujian provincial 
authorities have issued a set of provisional regulations to 
tighten the management of investment by overseas companies in 
the form of assets. 
  A leading official of the provincial commodity inspection 
bureau said that the regulations are intended to protect the 
legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and overseas 
investors, and meet the needs of opening Fujian wider to the 
outside world and deepening the reforms. 
  He said that, in accordance with the regulations, his bureau 
and its subsidiaries are in charge of evaluating assets of 
foreign investment, primarily machinery and equipment. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial departments of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, planning, finance, industry and commerce, 
and taxation will assist the provincial commodity inspectors in 
evaluating such assets, he added. 
  In accordance with the regulations, a contract on the 
establishment of an overseas-funded enterprise must contain an 
article stating that imported assets of foreign investment are 
subject to evaluation by the provincial commodity inspection 
bureau and other government departments. 
  The authorities will not approve the establishment of any 
overseas-funded enterprise if its contract does not contain such 
an article, the official said. 
  He explained that in recent years more overseas companies 
have put machinery and equipment as investment in co-production 
projects with Chinese firms. 
  Machinery and equipment currently account for at least 90 
percent of investment by overseas partners in overseas-funded 
companies in Fujian, he said. 
  He criticized some overseas business people for resorting to 
fraud in this regard.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (CNS) -- Governor of Guangdong, 
Mr. Zhu Senlin, speaking at a provincial meeting on the media 
and ideology held here today, said that the export-oriented 
economy had become an important economic pillar in the province 
with one-third of the capital needed for the build-up coming 
from overseas and foreign-funded enterprises registered with the 
province numbering some 40,000 in addition to some 30,000 
enterprises undertaking various kinds of business related to the 
import of material from abroad. 
  Mr. Zhu said that the gross domestic product (GDP) achieved 
by Guangdong between 1991 and 1993 grew at an annual rate of 
over 20 percent on average. It is expected that it can realize 
an eightfold growth in its GDP by 1997 over that in 1980. 
  He pointed out that during the past three years Guangdong 
saw 
an annual increase of close to 100 percent in the introduction 
of foreign capital which was valued at US$2.58 billion in 1991 
and rose to US$9.65 billion last year, an amount making up 26 
percent of the actual use of the total foreign capital in the 
country. The province also saw a rapid rise in foreign trade 
during the last three years with a share of 19 percent of the 
total export nationwide in 1991 climbing to 41 percent last year. 
  Mr. Zhu said that judging from the first few months of this 
year, economic development in Guangdong was quite sound. 
Exports province-wide were valued at US$4.53 billion last 
January and February, 120.7 percent up over the same period last 
year. The actual use of foreign capital was put at US$1.345 
billion or a gain of 57.7 percent while the industrial output 
value, the sales value and financial revenue maintained quite 
big growths.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6, (XINHUA) -- China will take 
tougher action against conduct severely violating the laws and 
regulations on environmental protection and will mete out stern 
punishment to those involved in violations that result in grave 
consequences. 
  This was outlined by senior officials from the National 
People's Congress (NPC) and the State Council here today. 
  Speaking at a conference of the NPC's Environment and 
Resources Protection Committee, NPC Vice-President Wang Bingqian 
said that new pollution sources have joined old ones to compound 
the country's deteriorating environment, due to local 
environment protection violations in the process of launching 
new construction projects. 
  He said rampant poaching, killing, selling and buying of 
endangered and rare animals which are under national protection 
are still going on in some places, adding that small and poorly 
equipped cement plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and 
smelting furnaces, though strictly forbidden by law, have staged 
a comeback in parts of China. 
  Such cases of violating environment protection laws must not 
be ducked but rather be resolutely and promptly dealt with, the 
official noted. 
  Song Jian, state councillor and director of the State 
Council 
Environment Protection Committee, said that China's environment 
protection laws need to be modified to include criminal 
penalties. Violators should be punished as severely as smugglers 
and drug traffickers. He added that detention and sentences 
must be meted out to those who deserve them. 
  According to a summary report delivered to the meeting by 
Xie 
Zhenhua, director of the State Environment Protection Bureau, 
illegal poaching, killing, smuggling, selling and buying of 
protected wild animals have survived repeated government sweeps, 
and hotels and restaurants in some areas are still making a 
fortune out of dishes based on rare animals. 
  The report pointed out that some places have introduced from 
abroad projects that fall short of Chinese environment 
protection requirements, while other places have even imported 
from outside China harmful waste. 
  Xie said that technologically poor equipment and a lack of 
counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for 
severe environmental pollution and ecological disturbance in a 
wide range of areas. 
  He said that one of the major problems most complained of by 
urban residents is the pollution caused by waste water, waste 
gas, rubbish and noise, which, along with the boom in the 
service industry, have emerged as a hard nut to crack. 
  Some localities have eagerly launched high energy-consuming 
and pollution-prone projects at the cost of environment 
deterioration to pursue short-term economic benefits, the 
official said. 
  According to the Chinese official, the air quality in only a 
few of the country's 500 major cities has reached the state-set 
first-grade standard. He said that South China has been plagued 
by the pollution of acid rain, adding that economic losses from 
acid rain can add up to more than 14 billion yuan in Guangdong 
and Sichuan Provinces. 
  Official sources said that relevant departments with the NPC 
and State Council this year will organize ten environment 
inspection teams, which will travel to Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, 
Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces and Inner 
Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions to handle cases 
of environment violations.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Despite the daily 
cutting of Timber, the Daxinganlin forest zone in northern 
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still extending 
owing to the region's continuous efforts in afforestation. 
  A total area of 1.84 million hectares has now been densely 
wooded in this forest zone, so far the biggest afforested area 
in China. 
  The zone, with 80,000 hectares of afforested trees ready for 
felling, has enlarged the primeval forest in the region, which 
has only 200,000 hectares of forest for cutting. 
  With its primeval forest used for felling as early as the 
1850s, it is the biggest timber production center in China. 
  Reforestation was carried out over the past four decades 
while planting trees on wasteland as well as desolated hills and 
mountains. By now 71.5 percent of the zone have been wooded, up 
11.4 percent over the figure of four decades ago. 
  Experts say that the afforestation in the zone has coped 
with 
the felling. 
  The zone, with an annual afforestation area of more than 
67,000 hectares, can provide 240 million high-quality saplings 
every year. The survival rate of the saplings amounts to 90 
percent, an increase of 36 percent over the figure of the 1950s.

<F P=106> [By Shen Sixiang (3088 1835 3276) and Xu Dongyang (1776 2639 </F>
3152): "The Overall Agricultural Development Areas Become Ones 
Where the Peasants' Income Is High"] 
  [Excerpt] Through the development and construction in the 
past five years, the overall agricultural development project 
areas, covering the region's 40 banners and counties, became 
successful examples in modernizing the region's agriculture as 
well as the areas where the peasants' income is high, and this 
is becoming the focus of people's attention. In 1993, the per 
capita income of peasants in the overall agricultural 
development project areas was 840.40 yuan, 62.5 yuan higher than 
the per capita income of the total peasants in the region. The 
total agricultural output value in these areas reached 1.7 
billion yuan, an increase of 63.5 percent over the figure before 
development. The newly added grain production capacity in the 
past five years reached 1 billion kilograms. 
  Since 1989, when the state approved implementing the 
region's 
overall agricultural development projects, the region has 
increased the number of the projects from a large-sized project 
covered in the first-phase development project in the three 
leagues and one city in the eastern part of the region to five 
projects, including the second-phase overall agricultural 
development project, the experimental project for developing 
animal husbandry on the grasslands, the project for transforming 
the saline and barren land in Bayannur League, the project for 
raising cattle with straw in Linxi County, and the base for 
growing export vegetables in Manzhouli. The scale of 
development has been expanded from 12 banners and counties of 
three leagues and a city to 40 banners and counties of eight 
leagues and cities. The amounts of funds for development has 
increased from 110 million yuan annually (excluding the funds 
collected from the masses) to 140 million yuan. A total of 810 
million yuan was invested in the past five years (including the 
funds collected from the masses.) So, this is the largest 
agricultural development project in the region since the 
founding of the PRC. 
  The overall agricultural development project areas have 
become the region's key grain, oil, and sugar production bases. 
In the past five years, 4.05 million mu of low- and 
medium-yield farmland covered in the project areas were 
transformed, more than 1 million mu of uncultivated areas were 
developed for agricultural production, 680,000 mu of land were 
afforested, 580,000 mu of grasslands were improved, and more 
than 600,000 mu of paddy rice growing areas were newly 
developed. The conditions for larger areas of waterlogging and 
alkaline land have comprehensively been developed and improved 
in the manner of linking project measures and agronomic measures 
with biological measures. Intensity and scientific levels were 
noticeably improved. The output of the major farm and sideline 
products, such as grain, oil bearing crops, sugar beets, and 
meat, increased by a big margin. All this plays a gigantic role 
in ensuring the self-sufficiency in grain. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Vincent (name indistinct): "Nightmare on Lake Qiandao"] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- It started off as a spring 
holiday for the 24 visitors from Taiwan, some in Mainland China 
for the first time to catch a glimpse on the land of their 
ancestors. It ended in tragedy in a cramped, lower-deck cabin 
aboard the Hai Rui while the boat crossed Lake Qiandao, or 
Thousand Island Lake. The bodies were found one piled on top of 
another, burned beyond recognition. 
  Seven days later, when by Taiwanese custom the spirits of 
the 
dead return to earth, the victim's relatives were still at the 
scene near the lake, seeking answers to the questions they have 
been asking since arriving in the mainland on Sunday [3 April]. 
  Qiandao Lake is in Mainland China's Zhejiang Province about 
200 kilometers west of Hangzhou and is a popular tourist 
destination. 
  The relatives and representatives of the Taipei Association 
of Travel Agents [TATA] were able to view the boat and the 
charred bodies on Sunday and Monday, before mainland authorities 
roped off the scene, barred reporters from the area, and 
detained the relatives in a hotel. One thing seems certain: 
the deaths of the tourists and eight mainland crew members and 
tour guides could hardly have been accidental. 
  An unnamed Zhejiang official said the boat's gas tank had 
not 
exploded in the fire. Unless those aboard the ship had gathered 
below to escape a rainy day and were struck by a bolt of 
lightning, or all had been asleep at 5:30 p.m. when a freak 
accident occurred, then [word indistinct] and murder seems the 
only explanation. 
  Yao Ta-kuang, a TATA representative at Lake Qiandao on 
Saturday, said that some gold rings, expensive watches, and cash 
were found along with the bodies, some of the relatives insisted 
that the belongings of the victims were notably short of 
possessions the victims had carried with them from Taiwan and 
had on the boat with them. Some of the relatives also claimed 
they found bullet holes in the boat before they were shepherded 
away to the hotel by the mainland authorities. The Hai Rui was 
ferrying the tourists across the lake to their hotel, which they 
had yet to check into. 
  The Zhejiang officials began stonewalling immediately. 
Taiwan officials were not informed of the incident until about 
30 hours after it occurred. When Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation, or SEF, insisted on sending an official to the 
mainland to find out what happened and to see what steps could 
be taken on behalf of the victims' relatives, mainland officials 
turned down the request. The Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait, or ARATS, the mainland agency authorized 
[word indistinct] to handle cross- strait affairs, claimed it 
was "not necessary" for SEF officials to be at the site. "We are 
very concerned about the accident and will provide help to the 
victim's relatives," ARATS Deputy Secretary- General Zhao 
Zhengyu added. 
  Meanwhile, the relatives, who had flown to the mainland with 
the hope of repatriating the remains of their loved ones, were 
also spurned by mainland officials, who had taken it upon 
themselves to perform autopsies on the bodies. No results of 
the autopsies were made available. 
  In addition to not letting the relatives gather evidence at 
the site -- taking photographs, for example -- mainland 
officials also refused to let the relatives take the bodies to 
Hangzhou, a nearby city, either for cremation or to fly the 
bodies back to Taiwan. Zhejiang Lieutenant Governor Liu Xirong 
told the relatives Tuesday that the bodies could not be shipped 
out of the mainland because their decomposition posed a health 
threat, while other local authorities said that allowing the 
corpses to be shipped to Taiwan would severely affect the 
mainland's security. On Thursday, officials informed the 
relatives that the bodies would be incinerated at Tonglu on 
Friday. Tonglu is between Lake Qiandao and Hangzhou. 
  Despite the relatives pleas to the ROC Government for help, 
officials and commentators here could only criticize the 
mainland's handling of the matter. "The denial of the relatives' 
demands is consistent with the Chinese Communists' ignorance of 
human rights," Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong said 
on Tuesday. Kuomintang Cultural Affairs Department Director 
Chien Han-sheng said that the actions taken by mainland 
officials over the past few days have been "muddleheaded and 
careless." 
  SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu, long involved in trying to reach 
agreements with the mainland over several issues, said relations 
between the two sides had definitely been harmed, and at least 
one scholar agreed with him. Chu Hsin-min, a foreign diplomacy 
professor at National Chengchi University, said the incident 
would likely be a "drawback" to Taiwan-mainland relations. 
  On Wednesday, Taiwan legislators vented their ire at the 
Beijing regime. Li Ching-hua, a Kuomintang legislator formerly 
in favor or reunification with the mainland, said the 
cross-strait relationship had entirely failed because of the 
incident, while Chiu Lien-hui, of the opposition Democratic 
Progressive Party, demanded that ROC Premier Lien Chan pronounce 
Mainland China "a tourist area of uncivilized people." 
  Now, a Taiwan boycott of travel to Mainland China seems 
likely, unless Beijing meets a list of demands the ROC 
Transportation and Communications Ministry will present, 
outlining the steps it can take to keep the mainland a favorite 
destination of Taiwan tourists. 
  The boycott will do nothing for the 24 unfortunate tourists 
who spent their final minutes faced with a terror that may 
remain a mystery until cross-strait ties are unfrozen.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said this afternoon that reporters 
acquiring essential information to promote the development of 
economic relations and trade is different from stealing state 
commercial, financial, and economic secrets, and we should not 
confuse the two. 
  A few days ago, Xi Yang, a reporter with Hong Kong's MING 
PAO, was pronounced guilty by China's judicial organ on the 
charge of "stealing state secrets" and will serve a 12-year 
prison sentence. 
  At a regular news briefing held here on Thursday afternoon, 
Wu Jianmin answered Hong Kong reporters' questions on Xi Yang's 
sentence. He said that as China is opening up more deeply to 
the outside world, it is entirely justified for the overseas 
community to acquire more information about us. The Chinese 
side also publishes, in a timely fashion, statistical 
information through various means, such as granting interviews 
to reporters, and makes public all sorts of information related 
to China through other channels, and our purpose is to promote 
the development of economic relations and trade between China 
and the outside world. 
  Wu Jianmin said that every country had its own commercial 
and 
economic secrets. In cases where someone has stolen such 
secrets, he should definitely be punished. 
  Finally, Wu Jianmin said: If necessary, the Foreign Ministry 
Information Department will, as in the past, organize news 
briefings and invite relevant government officials responsible 
for economic affairs to brief overseas reporters on certain 
aspects of economic construction and development they want to 
know about.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] The anti-piracy centre of the International 
Maritime Bureau (IMB) in Kuala Lumpur is about to issue a report 
on six incidents in which vessels were detained or boarded by 
Chinese patrol craft in the South China Sea over the past three 
months. 
  Four of the incidents have been acknowledged by Chinese 
authorities. 
  This represents a "quite significant" increase in piracy 
activity, an IMB official told Eastern Express. 
  China faces growing pressure from the United Nations to 
control piracy by its vessels, which has led to sometimes 
violent incidents from Japan to Indonesia. 
  In response, Beijing has stripped local maritime departments 
of the right to issue identification numbers for boats. 
  On Monday, China's three non-military departments involved 
in 
maritime affairs -- Public Security, Customs and Oceans -- began 
a centralised control of boat numbering, mainland maritime 
sources said. 
  Local bureaus of the departments will have to renumber 
existing fleets according to directions from their head office. 
  "We have taken back this function from the localities," an 
official of the National Bureau of Oceanography (NBO) said in 
Beijing. 
  "They can no longer just issue boat numbers as they please." 
  The inclusion of the Customs and Oceans departments in the 
clampdown appears to reflect a new worry that public security 
vessels are not the only source of official piracy. 
  The North Sea fleet of the NBO, based in Qingdao in Shandong 
province, operates only 12 vessels officially but "many more" 
have been sent to sea by other northern branches sporting 
numbers chosen at random, the official said. 
  This had caused "irregular" behaviour by some of the 
bureau's 
vessels, he said. 
  China's first admission of piracy came from the Ministry of 
Public Security (MPS) three weeks ago. 
  "Some departments not involved in anti-smuggling operations 
were prompted by personal interests to send their own men to 
sea, leading to a number of incidents in which foreigners were 
involved," Li Huan, a deputy director of the Ministry's Frontier 
Guard Bureau, said. 
  Li announced new measures "to counter the chaotic state of 
marine anti-smuggling operations". 
  He said coastguard boats, involved in marine security and 
anti- smuggling operations, would have to follow a nationally 
standardised code system. 
  This was apparently a reference to the system which took 
effect on April 1. 
  Li said MPS personnel would be issued with forgery-proof 
marine- patrol duty passes and would have to wear arm bands for 
identification purposes. 
  "The new and uniform identification system will help prevent 
other boats from going out to sea to hunt for smugglers while 
masquerading as Public Security border units," he said. 
  The forthcoming IMB report will detail four incidents of 
detention by official Chinese vessels in the Hong 
Kong-Luzon-Hainan triangle this year. 
  According to international law, official vessels should not 
halt foreign vessels more than 12 miles, or 19 kilometres from 
their coastline. 
  In one case, confirmed by the Chinese coastguard, the 
Panamanian- registered Alicia Starr was detained more than 475 
kilometres off the Chinese coast at the end of January. 
  China told the IMB the vessel was suspected of cigarette 
smuggling. 
  The bulk carrier Vlaherna evaded an attempted boarding on 
February 16 about 250 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong, 
although the identity of the pursuing boat is not known. 
  Six incidents had been confirmed in the whole South China 
Sea 
in the first three months of the year, compared with 17 for last 
year. 
  However, the IMB expected the number to rise "quite 
significantly" after receiving new information from the Hong 
Kong Marine Department recently. 
  Almost half of the 98 attacks detailed by Hong Kong 
authorities since September 1992 involve official Chinese 
vessels. 
  The Marine Department has been relaying information about 
suspected official piracy incidents to Guangdong authorities 
since last year. 
  However, the territory's shipping community has taken a low 
key approach with Beijing over the issue. 
  "China's problem is in the regions, so there's no point in 
embarrassing the centre," one Hong Kong shipowner said. 
  "We can just point out that all this activity is bringing 
them into disrepute in the international community," he said. 
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, C.C. 
Tung, said the Chinese government was taking the matter more 
seriously following a visit to Beijing by a United Nations 
maritime safety official last month. 
  "They are in no way condoning these activities," he said. 
  The issue was likely to be raised with Chinese officials 
during a meeting of the Asian Shipowners Forum in Beijing next 
month, Tung said. 
  Russian officials protested last June after the vessel 
Kovdor 
was pursued by a Chinese-flagged speed boat 150 kilometres 
southeast of Shanghai. 
  "At a short distance from the Kovdor, the sailors began to 
demonstratively put on the uniform of the Chinese frontier 
guards," the Russian navy press office said. 
  It is understood the safety committee of the UN 
International 
Maritime Organisation will next month consider plans to set up 
its own antipiracy centre.

  [Text] Washington, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
called today for the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde as soon as possible. 
  "A contingent of UN forces should soon be on its way to 
Gorazde," President Bill Clinton's National Security Advisor 
Anthony Lake said in a policy speech at the John Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, Maryland. 
  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the 
presence of UN peacekeepers in the Muslim enclave, under 
increasing Serb attacks in recent days, "could be a basis for 
possible air strikes." 
  Christopher told the Public Broadcasting Service that NATO 
could threaten air strikes if the UN forces, expected to be from 
Ukraine, Britain and France, were attacked. 
  Lake stressed that "neither the president nor any of his 
senior advisers rules out the use of NATO power to help stop 
attacks such as those against Gorazde." 
  "We must make clear to the Serbs and to the Serbs of Bosnia 
that the costs of continued intransigence are high," he added. 
  At the Pentagon, Spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski said the U.S. 
was ready to help transport the Ukrainian soldiers to Gorazde. 
  There were 15 peacekeepers in Gorazde, reports said.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China's northwestern 
Gansu Province has attracted a series of international 
cooperation projects in its efforts to alter adverse natural 
environmental conditions and improve agricultural 
infrastructures. 
  The projects have brought about "remarkable changes" in 
rural 
development in this region, the provincial authorities said. 
  The Guanchuan river valley in Gansu was notorious for its 
arid land, scarce vegetation, suffering from constant soil 
erosion and frequent natural disasters. 
  The World Bank extended a low interest loan of 7 million 
U.S. 
dollars in 1987 to help this place. Now 73 percent less sand 
and soil is deposited into the already silty Huanghe river by 
the Guanchuan river, thanks to the cooperation projects with the 
bank. 
  Forestry and grass cover 42.5 percent of the land in this 
region today, up from 8.5 percent in 1986. And grain production 
is increasing 4.5 million kilograms every year. 
  A local official said, "the rural population in this river 
valley have almost ended poverty." 
  The UN World Food Program provided 61.18 million U.S. 
dollars 
in aid to help construct six large irrigation projects along the 
Huanghe river. The former drought-stricken highland has been 
turned into a grain production base. 
  In 1987, the World Bank also financed what has been called 
China's most difficult and costly water diversion project with a 
loan of 123 million U.S. dollars, relieving the repeated 
interruptions caused by a shortage of funds and complicated 
geological conditions. 
  Italian and Japanese companies are participating in the 
construction. It is expected to be finished this year and to 
irrigate 13,000 hectares of land this winter. 
  To further alleviate the water problem in Gansu, the UN Food 
and Agriculture Organization and the European Community offered 
aid packages of 200,000 U.S. dollars and 3.58 million European 
currency units respectively to set up two hi-tech water-saving 
irrigation experimental zones. 
  Promoting social development has also been an important 
aspect of cooperation with world organizations in Gansu. 
  Medical bodies in the countryside in 15 counties have been 
receiving aid from the UN Population Fund, children's fund and 
some Canadian institutions. Many rural clinics have been set up 
under the aid program. 
  The World Bank loaned Gansu 20 million U.S. dollars to 
improve rural education in some poverty-stricken areas in 1987. 
China's first pilot center aided by foreign funds to wipe out 
rural illiteracy was established in Longxi county recently. The 
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization provided 
25,000 U.S. dollars in aid for the center.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japan-U.S. trade talks 
will remain deadlocked due to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
resignation, TV reports said today. 
  The reports quoted a Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry official as saying that "the development will be 
unclear" despite the fact that talks between Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor are likely to be resumed next week. 
  Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco next 
week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded 
in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese trade 
delegation left here today for Morocco to sign the overall 
agreements of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Gu Yongjiang, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation (MOFTEC), will attend the Marrakech Trade 
Summit scheduled to run from next Tuesday to Friday, when 118 
ministers of countries participating in the Uruguay Round will 
sign the final act embodying the results of the multilateral 
trade negotiations and the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization. 
  Long Yongtu, assistant MOFTEC minister and secretary-general 
of the Chinese delegation to Marrakech, said before his 
departure that the coming summit is a major event in the current 
international trade community. 
  He said that China, although not yet having GATT membership 
restored, participated in the Uruguay Round of negotiations 
since September 1986 and is qualified to sign the package of 
documents concluded by the Uruguay Round of talks. 
  Long said that after the Uruguay Round documents go into 
effect, a new World Trade Organization (WTO) will be 
established, replacing the existing GATT as the leading world 
trade body. 
  Therefore, he said, China insists that its eight-year 
negotiations with GATT members for re-entry into the 
international trade body be concluded before the wto comes into 
being so that the country can be one of its original members. 
  "China's signing of the documents means it has met 
fundamental requirements to become a founding member of the new 
world trade organization," the assistant minister said. 
  He added that China, as a big country and a major world 
trade 
partner, deserves WTO membership. 
  Long said that the Chinese Government will continue to make 
joint efforts with other GATT members for an early restoration 
of China's GATT membership on the principle of balance between 
rights and obligations.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with Harold 
Brown, former U.S. secretary of defense and adviser to the U.S. 
Center for Strategic and International Studies, and his party at 
the Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon. The host and guests 
exchanged views on bilateral relations and on other issues of 
common interest. 
  Liu Huaqing said to Brown: Ten years ago when you were U.S. 
secretary of defense, you made positive contributions to 
developing friendship between the two countries and our two 
armed forces. He noted that Brown's current visit to China will 
be conducive to developing Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Liu Huaqing said: China and the United States have no 
fundamental conflicts of interest. The two armed forces should 
maintain regular contacts. Bilateral contacts, however, are now 
fairly limited owing to reasons on the U.S. side. He noted that 
he welcomed more U.S. friends to visit China to have a look. 
  He said: The 21st century is not far away. China hopes that 
the next century will be one of peace and development. Both 
China and the United State should make common efforts to 
contribute to realizing this goal. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese Armed Forces are responsible 
for defending the national sovereignty and territorial integrity 
and for maintaining national security and stability. He 
stressed that China's military strategy is purely defensive. 
  As for the Korean nuclear issue, Liu Huaqing reiterated that 
China hopes to see a stable Korean peninsula. He said that 
China has consistently stood for the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula and for the settlement of the nuclear issue 
through patient dialogue between all the relevant parties. He 
added that imposing pressure can only make things more 
complicated. 
  Brown expressed the hope that China and the United States 
will continue to improve their relations and strengthen 
bilateral cooperation in regional, international security, and 
other areas. 
  Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army General Staff, met with Brown and his 
party. 
  Brown and the other U.S. guests are visiting China at the 
invitation of the China Center for International Studies.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Ten years of successful 
cooperation between the United Technology Company (UTC) and its 
Chinese partners led the company to decide to expand its 
presence in China by entering into the country's aircraft 
industry. 
  George David, president of UTC, made the statement here on a 
recent visit to sign an agreement with China. According to the 
agreement, UTC will invest another 12 million U.S. dollars in 
the Tianjin Otis Elevator Company -- one of UTC's ten joint 
ventures with China established ten years ago. 
  "The step indicates that UTC is not only satisfied with the 
operation of this joint venture, but also confident in expanding 
its business in China," David said, adding that all ten 
UTC-China joint ventures producing elevators and air 
conditioners are doing very well. 
  Their total sales last year reached 500 million U.S. 
dollars, 
and orders for Tianjin Otis stood at 300 million U.S. dollars in 
volume. 
  "The success of the companies shows that our prospect in 
China is very bright, and we should take root here," he said. 
  Since China will further its development of the 
transportation industry including aircraft manufacturing to 
conform to its rapidly- developing economy, UTC would positively 
take part in China's development in this regard, said the 
president, whose company ranked 16th in 1992. 
  He recalled that the company exported turbines to China in 
1986 and bought components of jet engines from the country. 
  UTC will not only expand its business in this field, but 
also 
hope to set up joint ventures, David said. 
  Commenting on China's investment environment, David, who has 
visited China many times over the last ten years, said that what 
impressed him most is that many Chinese officials, especially 
high- ranking officials, handle affairs in a decisive manner, 
and are very far-sighted. They are able to set foreign 
investors' minds at ease. 
  The president attributed the success of the joint ventures 
between UTC and the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai to the 
support of Li Ruihuan and Zhu Rongji, former mayors of the two 
cities when the companies were established. 
  The improving legal system in China has also made foreign 
investors feel safer, he said, adding that China's reform 
approach this year is designed to make conditions more favorable 
to foreign investors.

  [Text] Moscow, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin named Sergey Mikhailovich Shakhray, minister of 
nationalities and regional policy, as deputy prime minister 
today. 
  Shakhray, 38, who was named deputy minister in charge of 
federal regional issues in 1991, was removed from the post and 
given his present portfolio when Russian cabinet was reshuffled 
in 1994. 
  The Party of Russian Unity and Harmony (PRUH) formed by 
Shakhray participated in Russian parliamentary elections last 
December and found its way to State Duma, the lower house. 
  Observers think that the PRUH faction in Duma, a mild 
democrat group led by Shakhray, played a key role when the State 
Duma passed amnesty in February this year. 
  The presidential press office announced that the 
presidential 
decree also stipulates that the number of deputy prime ministers 
be increased from three, decided in January when the cabinet was 
reshuffled, to six, including one first deputy prime minister. 
  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, the minister of 
economy, has recently been promoted to be deputy prime minister.

  [Text] Moscow, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Federation 
Council today vetoed President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to 
confirm the removal of Procurator-General Alexey Kazannik from 
office for his implementation of the State Duma's February 
amnesty. 
  After a 50-minute debate, the Council (upper house of 
parliament) rejected the president's suggestion by a vote of 61 
to 57, with 4 abstentions. 
  Kazannik, who had been an enthusiastic supporter of Yeltsin, 
was appointed procurator-general soon after the October 1993 
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament. 
  On February 26, the State Duma (lower house of parliament) 
adopted a resolution to grant amnesty to organizers of the 1991 
"August 19 event" and those leaders arrested after the October 
1993 bloodshed. 
  The amnesty question posed a dilemma for Kazannik. According 
to the state constitution, as procurator-general he was 
obligated to carry out the legislature's decision; at the same 
time the president tried to prevent him from doing so. 
  Shortly after the amnesty was implemented, Kazannik tendered 
his resignation to Yeltsin and it was accepted. 
  Yeltsin also asked parliament to approve his suggestion that 
Alexey Ilyushenko, director of the monitoring bureau of the 
presidential office, be named acting procurator-general before 
formal confirmation by parliament. 
  However, the parliament did not want Kazannik to resign, 
while Yeltsin insisted that he go. 
  After the veto, Presidential Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
stressed that the post of procurator-general should not be 
vacant and the existence of two procurators-general would not be 
allowed. 
  Presidential Parliamentary Representative Alexandr Yakovlev 
today said that he expects the upper house to review its veto 
decision. 
  Observers here believe that the ongoing controversy over a 
candidate for the position of procurator-general mirrors the 
complexity of current Russian politics.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
relations between Mongolia and China enjoys a promising 
prospect, said visiting Mongolian Minister of External Relations 
Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA here this afternoon, 
Gombosuren voiced his satisfaction over the talks with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen yesterday and meeting with Premier 
Li Peng this afternoon. 
  He said there would be "two important events" in 
Sino-Mongolian ties this year. One is Chinese Premier Li peng's 
Mongolia visit at the end of this month, and the other the 
upcoming China visit by Chairman Nachagyn Bagabandy of the 
Mongolian State Great Hural. 
  The high-level exchange of visits between the two countries 
would be of major significance in the development of bilateral 
links, he added. 
  Gombosuren noted that the two countries' economic and trade 
relations have been expanding in recent years. Last year 
Mongolia's trade volume with China, in which border trade played 
an important role, accounted for one-fourth of the country's 
total trade volume. 
  He pointed out that there exist great potential and a bright 
future in the cooperation between the two countries in such 
fields as fuel, power and transportation. 
  He stressed that it is the priority of Mongolia's foreign 
policy to develop friendly relations with China and Russia, two 
neighbors of Mongolia. 
  Gombosuren and his party arrived here yesterday. In addition 
to Beijing they are also scheduled to tour Tianjin and Nanjing.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (YONHAP) -- China opposes any 
military exercises or missile deployment in South Korea which 
could be detrimental to the easing of tensions in the region, 
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said Thursday. 
  Responding to reporters' questions about the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and the U.S.-South Korean joint 
military exercise `Team Spirit,' Wu said China opposed any 
military activity that might exacerbate strains on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Wu emphasized that stability and the easing of tensions in 
the region are also in the interests of neighboring countries, 
reiterating China's position that the North Korean nuclear 
problem should be solved through dialogue. 
  Asked whether Beijing would send a delegation to North Korea 
for President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday on April 15, the 
spokesman replied, "China has never sent any delegation to 
Pyongyang in connection with Kim's birthday."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa tendered his resignation today to take the 
responsibility for the stalemate in Diet deliberations on the 
state budget for fiscal 1994, caused by a persisting controversy 
over his dubious financial deals. 
  "I have told the leaders of my coalition government and an 
emergency meeting of the cabinet of my intention to resign," 
Hosokawa told a press conference at his official residence in 
Tokyo. "I have received their approval," he added. 
  Hosokawa said he bears the responsibility for the wranglings 
between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over his 
loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co., which has kept 
the Diet budget business paralysed. 
  The announcement came only days after a media frenzy over 
reports on his joking about stepping down, which he strongly 
denied. 
  Hosokawa had refused the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party's demand to summon his former aide to the Diet over his 
100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from Sagawa, and 
denied he was personally involved in a Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) share purchase, which he said was done by 
his late father-in-law. 
  Earlier, before the news conference, he suddenly summoned 
the 
leaders of the coalition to the premier's official residence and 
formally told them he was quitting. 
  "The reason for my decision to resign is the paralysis in 
the 
Diet," one coalition official quoted Hosokawa as telling his 
colleagues at an emergency cabinet session. 
  He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his 
personal financial management, according to TV reports. But he 
did not specify the issue. 
  Hosokawa, 56, took office last August, ending a 38-year-long 
grip on state power by the Liberal Democratic Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will announce his resignation to the nation at a mid- 
afternoon news conference after convening a final cabinet 
meeting, Masayoshi Takemura, the chief government spokesman said. 
  Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted a leader of his ruling 
coalition as saying that Hosokawa would resign to take 
responsibility for controversy over his personal finances, a 
coalition party leader said [sentence as received]. 
  An extraordinary cabinet meeting is planned to be held at 
0515 GMT, Takemura told reporters. 
  Komeito party chief Yuichi Ichikawa said on television, "the 
prime minister told us he would resign from office." 
  Hosokawa had been under opposition pressure to step down 
over 
a 100 million yen (952,000 U.S. dollars) loan he took in 1982 
from a trucking firm, later to figure in the money-and-mobsters 
scandal which last year toppled the Liberal Democratic Party 
from power. 
  The opposition has staged a month-long boycott of budget 
business in parliament, demanding Hosokawa allow a former aide 
to testify to the assembly on the matter. But Hosokawa refused. 
  Ichikawa said that Hosokawa had tried all he could to clear 
up controversy over the loan issue, but he had just learned of 
unspecified further illegalities over the cash. 
  Hosokawa came to power last August after his eight-party 
coalition defeated the long-ruling LDP in general elections. 
  JIJI news agency reported that Hosokawa expressed his desire 
to resign in a meeting with leaders of his coalition government 
at the prime ministers official residence this afternoon.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China International Trust 
and Investment Corporation (CITIC) yesterday signed an agreement 
with the Bank of Tokyo, enabling it to issue yen-denominated 
commercial paper worth up to 15 billion Japanese yen. 
  Under the accord, the maturities of the short-term funds 
range from two weeks to nine months. The interest rate will be 
fixed at the time of issue and the Bank of Tokyo will act as the 
issuing agent for China in the deal. 
  Hong Yun-cheng, president of CITIC Industrial Bank, said 
that 
this short-term measure may help cut money-raising costs and 
diversify China's access to the world's capital markets. 
  Hiroyuki Nakao, senior managing officer of the Bank of 
Tokyo, 
said: "China's creditability runs high in Japan. Banks and 
other financial institutions are ready to go with the cp 
[commerican papere] program." 
  This is the first time that China has moved to issuing 
commercial paper in an overseas capital market.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- In talks held at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning with Qaddumi, foreign 
minister of the State of Palestine and chairman of the Political 
Department of the PLO, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen reiterated that China hopes that all sides involved will 
continue to adopt a flexible and pragmatic stand in order to 
bring about all- round progress in the Middle East peace process. 
  Qian Qichen said: Disputes among countries can only be 
resolved through peace negotiations. The signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on Autonomy shows that the 
Palestinian issue can finally be resolved through peace 
negotiations. 
  He said: The Middle East issue is a regional conflict which 
has continued since World War II, and the road to peace is still 
long and tortuous. The Hebron massacre in February this year 
has demonstrated even more the urgency of resolving the 
Palestinian issue. 
  Qian Qichen said: China resolutely supports the peace 
process in the Middle East and, as always, supports the just 
cause of the Palestinian people. 
  Qaddumi thoroughly briefed Qian Qichen on the negotiations 
between Palestine and Israel and between other Arab countries 
and Israel and on the situation in the occupied territories. 
  Qaddumi stressed: The safety of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories should be effectively guaranteed in accordance with 
the consistent resolution of the United Nations. The PLO will 
continue to make unremitting efforts for a political solution to 
the Palestinian issue. 
  He said: Israel should withdraw its troops from the occupied 
territories as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the early 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. 
  Qaddumi thanked the Chinese Government and people for their 
consistent support for the just cause of the Palestinian people. 
  After the talks, Qian Qichen and Qaddumi signed a Sino- 
Palestinian agreement on economic and technological cooperation. 
According to this agreement, the Chinese Government will grant 
the State of Palestine a 75 million yuan interest-free loan. 
Since the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement was signed in September 
last year, to support Palestine's reconstruction China has 
provided Palestine with a 30 million yuan interest-free loan, 
built a school for the state free of charge, and presented 410 
tonnes of rice and 240 tonnes of sugar in gratuitous aid. 
  This morning, the two foreign ministers also signed and 
exchanged notes on $500,000 in cash given to Palestine by China 
to support its reconstruction.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--Former student democracy 
leader Wang Dan called on the government later Friday to release 
both Wei and Xu. 
  "I am surprised by these arrests and I call on the 
government 
to release them immediately," he told AFP by telephone. 
  "The situation is much more tense than last year," Wang 
added, although he said he had not been troubled by the police 
recently. Wang was one of the leaders of the student-led 
democracy protests in 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square which 
ended in a bloody military crackdown. 
  Fellow dissident Yang Zhou said the arrest of Xu had roused 
considerable concern in dissident circles. "It is a fresh 
attempt to intimidate those who are fighting for democracy," he 
said by telephone from Shanghai. 
  "It may also be an attempt to stifle any action against the 
authorities during Balladur visit," added Yang, who is the 
founder of the Chinese human rights association.

  [Excerpt] Chinese Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen 
yesterday denied they had played a role in determining the 
outcome of the Xi Yang case. They were quoted by Vincent Lo 
Hong-sui, head of the Business and Professional Federation, as 
saying during meetings in Beijing that, as executive officials, 
they would not interfere with the Judiciary. 
  Mr Zhu, also head of the People's Bank of China, denied 
reports that he had ordered a stiff sentence for Hong Kong 
reporter Xi, who was accused of stealing financial secrets. The 
Politburo Standing Committee did not discuss legal cases, he 
said. 
  The comments came as Beijing rejected calls to release more 
details on the conviction of Xi who was sentenced to 12 years' 
jail. [passage omitted]

That It Is Completely China's Internal Affair"] 
  [Text] Guo Fengmin, the Chinese leader of the Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group [JLG], stressed when talking about MING PAO 
reporter Xi Yang's case, that it was absolutely a matter of 
China's internal affairs because it was handled in accordance 
with the law of China. 
  Last night, Guo Fengmin attended a spring get-together, 
sponsored by the Chinese Enterprises' Association, where 
reporters asked him questions about the Xi Yang case. One 
reporter asked: "Do you think it is appropriate for the Hong 
Kong government to issue a statement on the Xi Yang case?" Guo 
Fengmin answered: "This matter is China's internal affair and 
should be handled in accordance with the law of China." 
  Guo Fengmin added: The State Council Foreign Ministry 
spokesman has made it very clear that the Xi Yang case is a 
matter which has been handled according to the law of China. As 
for the concrete details, he said that, as the leader of the 
JLG, he did not have much understanding of the case. However, 
he stressed that the Xi Yang case did not have any bearing on 
Hong Kong journalists' normal news-gathering activities and, 
because state secrets were involved, such a case, according to 
China's law, could not be tried openly.

  [Text] Zou Jiahua, member of the Political Bureau of the 
CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, 
came to Jilin Province to inspect work from 2 to 6 April. He 
pointed out that in doing economic work currently, we should 
keep the overall interests in view, implement central principles 
and policies in line with specific local conditions, focus on 
ending the deficits and increasing the profits of state-owned 
enterprises to promote their reform and development, further 
consolidate the position of agriculture as the foundation, and 
facilitate coordinated and healthy development in industrial and 
agricultural production. 
  During his inspection tour in Jilin, Comrade Zou Jiahua 
heard 
reports by responsible comrades of Jilin Province and, 
accompanied by He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Gao Yan, provincial governor, went to Changchun, 
Jilin, and Liaoyuan to inspect the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Group 
Company, the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, Liaoyuan Coal 
Mining Administration, and other large- and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises and several enterprises that had 
suspended production totally or partially. He also visited 
peasant households to learn about peasants' lives and their 
preparation for spring farming. 
  After hearing a report by a responsible comrade of the Jilin 
Provincial party committee, Comrade Zou Jiahua said: Jilin 
Province has won good results in economic construction over the 
past few years. It has achieved fairly rapid development in 
reform, opening up, and other undertakings, improved people's 
living standard, and maintained social stability. In improving 
large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 
strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation, in 
particular, it has adopted some realistic and effective measures 
to conduct beneficial explorations and experiments. Its ideas 
and measures for the next step of work are also clear and 
feasible. Making unremitting efforts, it will certainly see the 
result of new achievements. 
  Comrade Zou Jiahua pointed out: At present, we should regard 
state-owned enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises' effort to end deficits and increase 
profits, as an important link of economic work. Governments at 
all levels and pertinent departments should make active efforts 
to provide a good external environment for improving large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, do a good job in 
investigation and study, give different guidance according to 
different conditions, and work out specific methods for every 
enterprise. Enterprises should keep the major target of 
establishing the socialist market economy system in view and 
focus on market demand in doing work. The key to this is to 
make continuous efforts to develop the new products that meet 
market demand, are of high quality, and yield good economic 
returns and to reduce production cost and improve efficiency. 
Enterprises should accelerate their technical transformation, 
which should be carried out in an orderly manner every year. 
When conducting technical transformation, they should aim at 
achieving technological advance and never regard expanding floor 
space and increasing personnel as their purpose of development 
or continue to adopt old technology, old measures, and old 
equipment. To resolve fund shortages, they should not rely 
merely on higher levels. They should raise funds from various 
channels, succeed in tapping their own potential, increase the 
proportion of the funds owned by themselves in the circulating 
funds, and reduce their reliance of banks as much as possible. 
Meanwhile, they should properly address the specific 
difficulties encountered by some enterprise workers in the 
process of deepening reform to safeguard and stabilize the 
overall situation. 
  Zou Jiahua emphasized: Industry and agriculture should be 
developed in a coordinated manner. As the raw material base for 
industry and the market for industrial products, agriculture and 
the rural economy, if falling behind in development, will 
restrict industrial development. In current agricultural 
development, we should first arrange well the development of 
basic farm products, such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
seeds. Meanwhile, we should guide the rural economic work in 
such as way that the rural economy is comprehensively developed 
and peasants' income increased. We should make overall 
arrangements for agriculture, rural economy, and peasants' 
income. When agriculture and rural economy are developed and 
peasants' income is [words indistinct] increased, industrial 
development will be promoted. In agricultural production, we 
should restructure crops, encourage peasants to develop 
livestock breeding, and greatly develop the intensive processing 
industry and the township enterprises that use farm products as 
raw materials while stabilizing the acreage sown to grain, 
stabilizing grain output, and stabilizing [words indistinct]. 
We should regard the increase of productivity and per-unit 
yields as an important link in agricultural development. 
  Zou Jiahua said: China's current economic situation is good. 
The desire of some localities and some comrades for faster 
development is good. However, they should guide work according 
to the law governing economic development. They should proceed 
from the actual conditions in economic work and the national 
capacity and select proper priorities of development to make the 
economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. 
  Zou Jiahua urged: Local economic development should be based 
on specific local conditions. All localities should develop the 
economy that reflects their own advantages and characteristics; 
and they should support their own pillar and backbone 
enterprises. Auto and chemical industries are Jilin's 
advantageous industries, and black earth is its advantageous 
resource. In its endeavor of development and construction, it 
should fully develop these advantages to make them still better. 
  Others accompanying Vice Premier Zou Jiahua during the 
inspection tour were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the 
State Planning Commission; Zhang Kezhi, deputy secretary general 
of the State Council General Office; and Li Zibin, vice minister 
of chemical industry.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Bao: "Local State Licenses To Clean </F>
Up the Drug Trade"] 
  [Text] The government is introducing local authority 
licenses for all pharmaceutical traders from July in a bid to 
crack down on the black market in fake and shoddy drugs. 
  All producers and dealers must apply to their provincial 
health and pharmaceutical administrations for the new licenses 
by the end of the year, according to the Ministry of Public 
Health. 
  Unlicensed traders will be shut-down and punished starting 
from next year. 
  Hospital laboratories will also need licenses under the new 
system, said the ministry's Pharmaceutical Administrative 
Department. 
  The registration scheme aims to upgrade the country's 
pharmaceutical industry and ensure the safety and effectiveness 
of its products. 
  And it will crackdown on the production and sale of 
substandard drugs, the ministry said. 
  All drug producers will have to pass rigorous hygiene 
standards, which cover staff, facilities, raw materials and 
packaging. 
  And their production processes will be fully inspected. 
  Drug businesses which fail to meet the stipulations of the 
State Pharmaceutical Law will be required to come up to standard 
by a set deadline or face being shutdown. 
  Traders which pass the inspection will be given a licence by 
the end of this year. 
  Both the Ministry of Public Health and the State 
Pharmaceutical Administration have stepped up preparations for 
applications and inspections. 
  And improved controls over the medicine industry will help 
China's pharmaceutical sector come up to advanced international 
standards, said Qi Mojia, Director of the State Pharmaceutical 
Administration. 
  More international drug-production standards and techniques 
will be introduced, he said. 
  And regular quality-control inspections will encourage 
medicine makers to improve their manufcturing methods, he said. 
  Quality has improved over the past year, Qi said. 
  And government standards have become more rigorous. 
  The ministry has revised the "national standard for 
medicinal 
product quality" promulgated in 1988, bringing it into line with 
World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. 
  The new standard obliges pharmaceutical producers to improve 
quality control and report any patient side-effects to the local 
health authorities. 
  Over 95 percent of pharmaceutical plants surveyed reached 
State standards last year. 
  Medicine exports came to moe than $1.4 billion last year, an 
increase of 10 percent over 1992. 
  But an illegal medicine market still exists in the country, 
Qi said. 
  Profiteers continue to produce and sell fake and substandard 
medicines.

<F P=106> [Report on interview: "Maintaining the Protracted Nature </F>
and Stability of Policy on Religion -- Person in Charge of the 
Religion Affairs Bureau of the State Council Answers Reporter's 
Questions"; date, place not given] 
  [Text] On 31 January 1994, Premier Li Peng signed State 
Council Decrees Nos. 144 and 145 to promulgate the "Provisions 
for the Management of Foreigners' Religious Activities Inside 
the PRC" (hereinafter referred to as the "Provisions") and the 
"Regulations on the Management of Places for Religious 
Activities" (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations"), 
which were put into force as of the date of promulgation. A 
RENMIN RIBAO reporter interviewed a responsible person of the 
Bureau of Religion Affairs of the State Council on the 
formulation and implementation of these two sets of 
administrative regulations on religious affairs. 
  Question: Why was it necessary to formulate the "Provisions" 
and the "Regulations?" 
  Answer: In order to maintain the protracted nature and 
stability of the policy religion, to institutionalize effective 
policies for handling religious affairs in our country and turn 
them into laws, and to promote the building of socialist 
democracy and the socialist legal system in our country, we need 
to quicken the work of religious legislation. The "Provisions" 
and the "Regulations" are just two sets of laws and regulations 
in the process of religious legislation. The promulgation and 
enforcement of these two sets of regulations is an objective 
need in the course of fully and correctly implementing the 
party's policy for the freedom of religious belief. 
  Question: Would you please discuss in detail the purpose of 
formulating the "Provisions" and the "Regulations"? 
  Answer: First, guaranteeing foreigners' rights and freedom 
of religious belief and normal religious activities inside the 
PRC. The major religions in our country all have historical and 
extensive relations with their co-religionists throughout the 
world. With the continuously in-depth development of reform and 
opening in our country and the increasing expansion of our 
international exchanges, religious circles in our country will 
continue to increase exchanges with their overseas counterparts, 
and a large number of foreigners with various religious beliefs 
will come to China to carry out economic, 
scientific-technological, cultural, educational, public health, 
and sports exchanges and cooperation, or will come to China for 
purposes such as visiting relatives, sightseeing, various types 
of visits, and doing business. Their religious life is their 
private affair. The Chinese Government respects their religious 
beliefs and protects their normal religious activities. This is 
a constant policy that our government has always pursued. The 
"Provisions" reaffirm this policy in the form of a legal 
document, and this fully expresses the clear-cut attitude of our 
government on this issue. Second, guaranteeing friendly 
international religious exchanges, as well as cultural and 
academic exchanges related to religion. This is a component 
part of our friendly exchanges with other peoples, and is 
beneficial to increasing mutual understanding and friendship 
between the peoples of various countries, to reform and opening 
in our country, and to maintaining world peace. The Chinese 
Government always supports such activities. Therefore, it is 
also necessary to protect them in the form of laws and 
regulations. Third, safeguarding the public interests of 
society in our country. China is an independent state with 
sovereign power, and no international exchange can harm our 
country's sovereignty and state security. Religious exchanges 
are no exception. Therefore, when foreigners are involved in 
religious activities inside China, carry out friendly exchanges 
with China's religious circles, and carry out cultural and 
academic exchanges in China, they must abide by China's laws and 
regulations. These three points are the purpose of formulating 
the "Provisions." 
  The first point of the "Regulations" explicitly specifies 
its 
purpose, which is "to protect normal religious activities, 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of religious 
places, and to improve the management of places for religious 
activities." The places for religious activities are places for 
the masses of believers to express their religious feelings and 
carry out collective religious activities; they are also places 
where the religious clergy live and perform their religious 
duties. At the same time, they constitute a type of social 
organization. Where the activities are normal, whether their 
legitimate rights and interests are properly guaranteed, and 
whether their relations with other social quarters are well 
coordinated all will have a major bearing on their own 
conditions, as well as on the public community as a whole. In 
order to fully and correctly implement the policy for freedom of 
religious belief, to protect normal religious activities, to 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the places for 
religious activities, and to improve the management of the 
places for religious activities, it is necessary to formulate 
the "Regulations." 
  Question: After reading the "Provisions," I found that most 
provisions there show full respect for foreigners' religious 
beliefs and protect their normal religious activities. Do you 
need to give any additional explanation? 
  Answer: As you said, Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5; the first 
point of Article 6; and Article 7; all show full respect for the 
rights of foreigners to enjoy freedom of religious belief, and 
protect their normal religious activities. All foreigners 
inside China, no matter whether they have religious beliefs and 
no matter what religious beliefs those are, the Chinese 
Government will show respect for them. The Chinese Government 
and citizens will not interfere in their normal religious 
activities based on their religious belief as long as such 
activities are not related to Chinese citizens. Along with the 
in-depth development of reform and opening up in the future, 
some large-scale international conferences, sports events, and 
cultural or academic exchange activities will be held in China. 
In order to satisfy the needs of the collective religious life 
of foreigners who come to China, the units organizing such 
activities may apply for arranging religious activities for 
non-Chinese citizens in places specified for foreigners' 
religious activities with the approval of the religion affairs 
department of the Chinese Government. All such provisions fully 
show that the Chinese Government respects the freedom of 
religious belief of foreigners in China, protects their right to 
have normal religious life, and also gives expression to China's 
spirit of reform and opening up. 
  Question: What is the spirit of "China's relevant 
regulations" in Article 7 of the "Provisions"? 
  Answer: That is the principle of separating religion from 
education in our country. The selection of students sent to 
foreign countries to receive religious education in order to 
train as clerics is different from the selection of students to 
study in foreign countries in ordinary institutions of higher 
education in our country. The selection of religious students 
is an internal affair of the religious organizations in our 
country, and must follow our country's principle that China's 
"religious bodies and religious affairs are are not subject to 
any foreign domination," as specified by the PRC Constitution. 
According to the relevant regulations of the Chinese 
Government, religious students being sent to study in foreign 
countries should be selected and arranged by the relevant 
national religious bodies in good coordination, and should be 
reported to the government's religion affairs department for 
approval. No foreign religious bodies, international religious 
organizations and organs, or individuals sent by these 
organizations to China can enroll such students on their own 
without the approval of the Chinese authorities. 
  Question: What approach will be taken to the religious 
activities held on the mainland by residents of Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, and Macao? 
  Answer: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao have close and 
extensive religious ties with the mainland, and exchanges in 
this aspect are expanding day after day. The exchange of visits 
for religious purposes also is increasing markedly. Such 
activities should be regularized by law so that they can be 
managed on the basis of the law. Taiwan is China's inalienable 
territory, and the PRC soon will restore the exercise of its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. According to the Basic 
Laws of Hong Kong and Macao, after China restores the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, we will put into 
practice the policy of "one country, two systems." The principle 
for handling religious relations is "non-affiliation, 
non-interference, and mutual respect." "Peaceful reunification 
and one country, two systems" are the guidelines that our 
government uses to handle relations between the two sides of the 
Strait. Religious relations between the mainland and Taiwan also 
will follow the three-point principle. Under the circumstances 
of "one country, two systems," Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao 
compatriots will be different from residents of the mainland, so 
Article 11 of the "Provisions" lays down the principled rule.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- A concerned department 
of the State Council today issued a circular on readjusting the 
plan for launching the first "Fengyun 2" satellite. The text of 
the circular is as follows: 
  China originally planned to use its Long-March 3 carrier 
rocket to launch the first "Fengyun 2" stationary meteorological 
satellite at the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in the near 
future. But, because an accidental event took place in the 
process of testing the satellite in the technical zone, damaging 
the satellite and workshops, the launching plan has been 
readjusted. China will make great efforts to complete the 
follow-up work to ensure the completion of other satellite 
launching plans for this year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Li Wei: "Organ Transplantation Developing in </F>
China"] 
  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Xue Liansheng, 17, who 
suffered from severe hemophilia, received a mother-donated 
spleen transplant three years ago in Wuhan, capital of central 
China's Hubei Province. Now he can walk to school with a cane 
instead of crawling on all-fours. 
  Nearly 20,000 people in China have received various organ 
transplants since the 1970s. To date, 21 different kinds of 
clinical transplants have been performed in China, including 
kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, heart, bone marrow, adrenal 
gland, parathyroid, lung, testicle, pancreas-kidney, hepatic 
cell, spleen cell, brain cell and brain nervous tissue. 
  Shortage of organ donors -- in part because of the grip of 
old ideas -- is restricting the expansion of these operations to 
help yet more people. 
  Kidney transplants have been the most numerous in China's 
clinical organ transplants: more than 10,000 have been done by 
nearly 90 medical institutions so far. 
  By 1993, nearly 800 kidney recipients had survived for five 
years and over 100 recipients survived for ten years. 
  More than 60 liver transplants have been performed in China. 
Eleven heart transplants have been done and two recipients have 
survived for nearly two years. 
  In addition, pork islet grafts were done for eight patients 
who had been suffering from "type one" diabetes for five to 22 
years. 
  Transplants of cranial nerve tissue and brain cells have 
also 
been developed with good results in treating Parkinson's 
disease, dwarfism, chorea and cerebral hypoplasia in recent 
years, said experts. 
  The study of organ transplantation in China began in the 
1970s, about ten years later than abroad. However, all the 
kinds of organ transplants which have been developed elsewhere 
in the world can now also be done in China, said Qiu Fazu, 
honorary president of the Wuhan-located Tongji Medical 
University. He is one of the founders of China's organ 
transplant research. 
  The Institute of Organ Transplantation of Tongji Medical 
University is China's only large-scale comprehensive research 
unit in this field. In addition, there are several dozens of 
medical units in China which have also joined the study and 
clinical practice of organ transplantation. 
  More than 60 researchers work in the three-storey building 
of 
the Tongji Institute. They have developed 13 kinds of organ 
transplantations, including liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, 
islets as well as cell perfusion. 
  Xia Suisheng, 70, who is director of the institute and 
president of the Society of Organ Transplantation of the Chinese 
Medical Association, has performed nearly 1,000 transplant 
operations and saved the lives of a number of people who were 
suffering from serious diseases. 
  According to Professor Qiu Fazu, China has made some 
up-to-international-level achievements in organ transplants in 
recent years. However, it still lags behind advanced countries 
in the transplantation of large organs such as liver and heart, 
said Qiu. 
  One of the main causes lies in a shortage of organ donors 
because of the public rejection of the "brain death" concept, 
Qiu said. In China, it is morally and legally prohibited to 
procure organs from corpses whose heart is still beating. 
  "As a result, the quality of grafts in China is lower than 
that of advanced countries," he said. 
  In addition, medical expenses for an organ transplant in 
China are so high that ordinary people cannot afford it. A 
liver transplant costs more than 100,000 yuan (about 11,500 U.S. 
dollars), and the imported immuno-suppressive drugs are also 
very expensive, said Qiu. 
  It is learned that Chinese scientists have been trying to 
extract immuno-suppressive materials from traditional Chinese 
herbal medicines so as to lower the medical expenses for organ 
transplantation. 
  Medical specialists said they would continue to appeal to 
the 
public to accept the concept that "brain death is the beginning 
of irreversible death" and strive for its legal recognition. 
  "With enough organ donors, more Chinese people suffering 
from 
severe diseases will be saved through organ transplants," said 
Qiu.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zem in today urged Chinese officials at all levels to 
better arm themselves with knowledge of modern science and 
technology. 
  The president's call was contained in the foreword to a 
textbook entitled "ABC of Modern Science and Technology", which 
was published here today. 
  The book, produced by the State Science and Technology 
Commission upon the instruction of President Jiang, is intended 
for government officials at county level and above. 
  Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central 
Committee 
of the Communist Party of China, said in the foreword that the 
period between now and the middle of the next century is vital 
for the prosperity of the Chinese nation. 
  He said that the current world situation characterized by 
peace and stability and the development of new science and 
technology have provided a precious opportunity for China to 
advance its economic development. 
  Jiang called on the whole nation to grasp the historical 
opportunity to keep track of the development of world science 
and technology and strive to transform the traditional 
industries and develop new ones. 
  He said that China must give full scope to science and 
technology in promoting economic growth so as to ensure a 
sustainable, fast and healthy development. 
  He urged officials at all levels to renew their knowledge in 
science and technology and keep abreast with modern development. 
  "Only by unswervingly keeping on learning and continuously 
renewing, can we improve our abilities of making policy 
decisions and the art of leadership," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States have no conflicts of fundamental interests and the 
military contacts between them should be increased, said a 
senior Chinese military leader here today. 
  Yet, owning to reasons on the U.S. side, the present 
contacts 
between the two armed services are quite limited, said Liu 
Huaqing, vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission. 
  "We welcome more U.S. friends to visit our country," he told 
former U.S. Defense Secretary Harold Brown here this afternoon. 
  Brown, who is advisor to the U.S. Centre for Strategic and 
International Studies (CSIS), are [as received] here on a visit 
as guest of the China Center for International Studies. 
  Some decade ago, Liu met with the then U.S. defense 
secretary 
here in Beijing. 
  "You made positive contributions to the friendship between 
the two countries and the two militaries," Liu told Brown, while 
voicing the hope that the current visit be helpful to the 
development of Sino-U.S. ties. 
  There are only a few years left in the running up to the 
21st 
century, which, China hopes, would be one of peace and 
development, Liu said. 
  Both China and the United States should contribute to the 
realization of such a goal, Liu said. 
  Touching on the country's military, Liu noted that the 
Chinese Armed Forces are responsible for the national 
sovereignty, territorial integrity as well as the maintenance of 
national security and stability. Its military strategy is 
purely defensive, he added. 
  On the Korean nuclear issue, Liu reiterated that China hopes 
to see a stable Korean Peninsula. 
  China is in favor of denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula 
and it hopes the nuclear issue be settled through patient 
dialogues between all the relevant parties. Imposing pressure 
can only make things more complicated, he said. 
  During the meeting, Brown expressed the hope that the 
U.S.-China ties be improved and the bilateral cooperation on 
regional, international security and other areas be strengthened. 
  Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the General 
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met with Brown 
and his party.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Respectable 'Beam of Light'-- </F>
Praising PLA Soldier Jin Zhenghong"] 
  [Text] Jin Zhenghong is a volunteer in a People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] company. Unlike heroic soldier Xu 
Honggang who has performed magnificent feats, Jin Zhenghong has 
merely done some ordinary things which many people are able to 
do. However, each of these ordinary things is very touching and 
shines with extraordinary splendor. 
  Jin Zhenghong likened himself to "a beam of sunlight" and 
spared no effort in giving people his light and warmth. It 
shows that he is a man of noble character and with a strong 
sense of social responsibility. Starting with doing his own 
duties properly, he really spared no effort in giving people his 
light and warmth. What is particularly commendable is that 
during his 12 years of active service, he continuously did good 
things. He solved problems for others, mediated in disputes, 
and could still contribute his share magnanimously without any 
hesitation even when he was misunderstood by others, thus 
enabling him to stand up to any test. It is essential to work 
for ethical progress. We must upgrade the construction of 
socialist spiritual civilization to a new level and rely on 
everyone's concern and participation. Jin Zhenghong's good 
deeds only benefited some people but their positive influence is 
immeasurable. As far as the great undertaking of purifying our 
social atmosphere and upgrading our morals is concerned, we 
should lay special stress on the contributions made by this 
ordinary soldier! 
  Society comprises every specific individual. Our party also 
comprises every specific party member. The masses love and 
support the CPC precisely because the CPC's aim is to 
wholeheartedly serve the people and because tens of thousands of 
CPC members are bringing their light and warmth into play. 
Every citizen, and every CPC member, is required to play his 
own part in improving our party style and the general mood of 
society, creating good social ethics and atmosphere. Bits and 
pieces of floating clouds can still be found in a clear and 
boundless sky. Similarly, in our society, which is full of life 
and vitality, there are also a number of unsatisfactory 
phenomena in our party style and the general mood of society. 
It is quite natural that people should have complaints about 
this. Our Party and government attach great importance to this 
problem and are taking vigorous measures to solve it. It is 
necessary to rely on everybody's efforts to check and eradicate 
negative and corrupt phenomena. Leading cadres, and members of 
the CPC in particular, must take the initiative in this respect. 
What Jin Zhenghong has said is quite true: It would be better 
to kindle one's own flame first than to grumble at the poor 
social atmosphere. It would be better to do concrete work than 
to always bear resentment against anyone since the more doers 
there are, the less bystanders we have. Whether he is aware of 
it or not, everything Jin Zhenghong has done has educated and 
influenced people around him, like a "light breeze blowing in 
the night which soothes things silently." In our country, if 
everyone, like Jin Zhenghong, brings his "beam of light" into 
play, the construction of the two civilizations will advance to 
a new stage, new results will be achieved, the world will be 
warmer, and our society will become brighter. In this 
connection, Jin Zhenghong has really set an example of how to 
act as a citizen of the Republic and as a true CPC member. 
  We hope that more and more people in our society will follow 
the example of Jin Zhenghong. We hope that the lofty spirit 
presented by the deeds of Xu Honggang and Jin Zhenghong will be 
carried forward so that the sky of our motherland will be filled 
with warmer sunlight!

<F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>
  [Text] The 10th anniversary of the promulgation of China's 
Patent Law was marked on 1 April. Recently, station reporter 
(Song Jian) interviewed Gao Lulin, director of the State Patent 
Office, in connection with the success China has achieved since 
implementation of the Patent Law nine years ago. Gao Lulin said: 
  [Begin Gao recording] In 1985 when the Patent Law was first 
implemented, the Chinese government accepted approximately 
17,000 patent applications. The number of applications 
increased every year. In 1993, the Chinese government accepted 
over 77,000 patent applications. Some 20 to 25 percent of all 
the 300,000 or so patent applications accepted have been 
exploited; some exploited patents have yielded very good 
economic results. The establishment of the patent (?system) and 
the popularization of the patent [word indistinct] have 
inevitably given rise to certain disputes over patent 
infringement. But China's people's courts and patent offices 
have effectively handled these disputes. According to 
incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, people's courts 
and patent offices had respectively handled 2,000 cases of 
patent disputes. Following the revision of the Patent Law and 
China's access to and coordination with the international patent 
systems, we can say provisions for patent protection as 
prescribed in China's Patent Law have basically met the 
requirements set by the World Organization for the Protection of 
Intellectual Rights as well as by GATT. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Third of seven programs cosponsored by the State Economic </F>
and Trade Commission and the State General Administration of 
Taxation entitled "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' 
Implementation of the New Tax System: On the Question of 
Computing and Deducting Value-Added Tax [VAT]" moderated by 
Jiang Qiangui, director of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission's Enterprise Department -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Video opens with a long shot of three women and 
two men seated behind a long table in a room, then cuts to show 
a medium-range shot of Chen Jie, deputy director of the State 
General Administration of Taxation's Turnover Tax Department,

participants, including Ma Jinyuan, chief accountant of Beijing 
No. 1 Cotton Mill; Liu Jian, deputy director of Beijing Medical 
Radiographic Equipment Plant; and Zheng Guangzhao, chief 
accountant of Beijing Papermaking and Packaging Industrial 
Corporation] [Jiang] Viewers and comrades, we are now 
presenting the third lecture of the "Answers to Questions 
Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System." 
Today, we would like to discuss questions about computing and 
deducting VAT. Deputy Director Chen, could you please first 
tell us something about the computation of VAT, since many 
people are still not very familiar with it? 
  [Chen] This is a very broad topic which is widely discussed 
in the rules and regulations on VAT. Today, I can talk in 
general terms about the principles for computing VAT. The VAT 
regime divides taxpayers into two categories. The Ministry of 
Finance has set a standard for producers as well as wholesale 
and retail traders -- the level for enterprises that produce 
taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over one million, 
while the level for enterprises that are engaged in wholesale or 
retail of taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over 1.8 
million. Those who are above the standard level are ordinary 
taxpayers. Those who are below the standard level and have an 
inadequately developed method of accounting are small taxpayers. 
Enterprises that are below the standard level but have 
adequately developed methods of accounting are deemed ordinary 
taxpayers. Some comrades equate small taxpayers with 
enterprises below the standard level -- this is not a proper 
interpretation. To be more accurate, we should put it this way: 
enterprises and [words indistinct] that fail to reach the 
aforementioned set standard level and have inadequately 
developed methods of accounting are small taxpayers. 
Enterprises that have an adequately developed method of 
accounting are ordinary taxpayers, no matter whether they are 
above the standard level or not. For ordinary taxpayers, the 
principle for calculating payable VAT is equal to their sales 
tax less their procurement tax; while the procurement tax is 
calculated according to their sales income and a tax rate [three 
formula are shown on screen successively: 1) tax to be paid = 
sales tax during the period - procurement tax during the period; 
2) sales volume = tax inclusive sales volume / (1 + tax rate); 
3) sales tax = sales volume x tax rate]. 
  [Jiang and Liu] How should enterprises deduct procurement 
tax in the absence of special VAT invoices when doing business 
with small taxpayers who could not use specialized VAT invoices? 
  [Chen] Enterprises in the aforementioned situation can seek 
help from taxation organs. In other words, sellers can go to 
taxation organs to ask them to issue invoices. The sales price 
shown on an invoice does not include the payable tax; and a six 
percent tax rate should be specified. [two formula are shown on 
screen successively: 1) sales volume = tax inclusive sales 
volume / (1 + tax rate), and 2) tax to be paid = sales volume x 
tax rate] By so doing, we can alleviate this problem. To 
strengthen management over the use of the special invoice, we 
divide taxpayers into two categories. However, we cannot change 
the rules on enterprises that have an inadequately developed 
accounting calculation mechanism -- this is an international 
practice. Although some people do not quite understand this 
issue, in my opinion, this is justifiable to some extent. Small 
enterprises' business operations are negatively impacted because 
they could not use specialized VAT invoices. However, we have 
two concerns: if small enterprises want to enjoy tax deduction 
according to the formula -- sales tax minus the procurement tax, 
they should bear [words distinct] responsibilities. In my 
opinion, rights and responsibilities are a two-way street. If 
you want to enjoy a certain rights, you should bear a certain 
responsibilities. In other words, if you ask others to bear 
responsibilities, you should authorize them some rights. If 
small enterprises do not strengthen their methods of accounting 
[words indistinct] but want to enjoy the same rights as ordinary 
taxpayers, in my opinion, this is unjustifiable. Moreover, to 
pay tax according to law is an obligation stipulated in the 
Constitution. Our demand on small taxpayers in bearing their 
responsibilities is not harsh. We only ask them to strengthen 
their methods of accounting. In strengthening their methods of 
accounting, enterprises, not the state, will be the first to 
benefit. Another concern is that we do not have enough tax 
personnel to administer small taxpayers, including individual 
entities, if we allow them to use such special invoices. It 
will sabotage our system, in which tax is deducted based on 
invoices, if we allow them. 

    [Liu] How should enterprises deduct the procurement tax 
if they purchase goods to be used in production from retail 
shops that could not use special VAT invoices? 
  [Chen] Sometimes, factories and other enterprises need some 
small quantity of goods to be used in production, and they are 
unlikely to buy these goods from other factories but from retail 
shops. If the retail shops are small taxpayers, they could not 
use the special invoice. As a result, buyers cannot get a tax 
dedcution. However, we have a real problem if the retail shops 
are ordinary taxpayers and do not use the special VAT invoices. 
This is somewhat related to the inadequate popularization of 
the tax law. One article stipulated in the law says: such 
special invoices could not be issued if commodities are sold to 
consumers. However, retail shops do not always sell goods to 
consumers only, they also sell goods to enterprises that will 
utilize these goods in production. So do factories. Therefore, 
no matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale or retail 
enterprises, as long as they sell goods to consumers, such 
special invoices should not be issued. In other words, no 
matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale, or retail 
enterprises, as long as they sell goods to enterprises -- 
nonconsumers, including individual entities -- such special 
invoices should be issued. Recently, we have worked out a 
supplementary regulation: if goods are sold to enterprises that 
are ordinary taxpayers, such special invoices can be issued; and 
if buyers are small taxpayers, only general invoices can be 
issued. Therefore, when enterprises buy goods from retail 
units, they need to identify their taxpayer classification. 
Currently, there are some retail units that do not use such 
special invoices. We plan to further address this issue and 
publicize the tax system. In the meantime, we will work out 
some punitive measures to deal with those that do not issue 
invoices on purpose. 
  [Ma] Deputy Director Chen, how should enterprises deduct the 
procurement tax when buying raw and semifinished materials 
through the collection and acceptance method in the absence of 
special VAT invoices? 
  [Chen] There may be two reasons that special VAT invoices 
are not issued after goods are sold: one is that the seller is a 
small taxpayer who does not use such special invoices -- this is 
a situation created by our tax system; the other is that some 
industrial enterprises do not issue such special invoices. As 
far as I know, if two industrial enterprises have price 
disputes, such special invoices may not be issued. The seller 
usually sets conditions for issuing a special VAT invoice to the 
buyer, such as asking the buyer to accept the price set by the 
seller. However, as I said earlier, they should issue the 
special invoice. Not to issue such speical invoices violates 
regulations. We plan to notify taxation organs in various 
localities to pay attention to such situations. We have made 
concrete arragements and plan to conduct an across-the-board 
inspection of the implementation of the new tax system at the 
right time. Additionally, we will overcome some drawbacks in 
regulating the use of the special VAT invoice. Also, with the 
instituting of punishment measures, people who buy goods from 
enterprises in other places without receiving invoices may 
report to the local taxation organ which is obligated to help 
them. In our opinion, if we can institute the system in which 
the tax is deducted based on invoices, this will be beneficial 
to the development of enterpirses. We plan to study ways to 
further alleviate this problem.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
"Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded Financial 
Organizations" promulgated by Beijing in early March will come 
into force on 1 April. Although the document is named 
regulations for management, it is actually a signal of opening 
up wider to the outside world. As a result, the regulations 
have attracted attention in banking circles in Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Europe, and the United States, which are ready to apply 
to open branches in mainland China. 
  More than 10 years ago, foreign-funded financial 
organizations were allowed to set up representative offices or 
branches in the four special economic zones [SEZ] of Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In recent years, foreign-funded 
banks have been allowed to set up offices in Shanghai, 
Guangzhou, and other open cities along the coast. To meet the 
needs of the increasing number of foreign-funded financial 
organizations, the State Council promulgated the "Regulations 
for Management Over Foreign-Funded Banks and Sino-Foreign-Funded 
Banks in the SEZ's" on 2 April 1985, and the People's Bank of 
China promulgated the "Regulations for Management Over 
Foreign-Funded and Sino-Foreign-Funded Financial Organizations 
in Shanghai" on 8 September 1990. However, the two regulations 
were local documents and the provisions were too strict, which 
evoked complaints from many foreign investors. 
  Compared with these two regulations, the unified national 
regulations for foreign-funded financial organizations, which 
will come into force on 1 April, are rather flexible. Figures 
from Hong Kong's financial circles say that the new regulations 
have increased the proportion of fixed assets of foreign-funded 
banks and financial organizations from 25 percent of net capital 
plus reserves to 40 percent. This move encourages 
foreign-funded financial organizations to increase investment 
and buy premises. Although the new regulations do not include 
renminbi businesses in the scope of foreign-funded financial 
organizations, some people say they are allowed to deal with 
"approved businesses in the country's currency and other foreign 
currencies." This shows that there is a possibility of Chinese 
financial authorities lifting restrictions on foreign-funded 
financial organizations dealing with renminbi business in a 
limited way. A financial expert pointed out: The new 
regulations turn convertible currency equivalent to the dollar 
into convertible currency equivalent to the renminbi, which has 
enhanced the status of the renminbi and has also paved the way 
for the renminbi to officially become an internationally 
circulated currency. 
  According to the new regulations, provisions for the 
business 
scope of foreign-funded banks and foreign-funded financial 
organizations, include the following: Foreign exchange savings 
and lending, foreign exchange acceptance, approved foreign 
exchange investment, foreign exchange guarantees, foreign 
exchange transactions, investigations and consultations, and 
approved renminbi businesses and foreign currency trading. 
  As foreign-funded banks have increasingly asked for 
permission to do renminbi business, Zhao Haikuan, director of 
the Finance Research Office of the People's Bank of China, said 
that foreign-funded banks will be allowed to deal with renminbi 
business sooner or later, but the problem is that the conditions 
are not ripe at present. The tax rate of Chinese banks on the 
mainland reaches as high as 55 percent, while that of 
foreign-funded banks is only 15 percent. As there is a wide gap 
between the two, it benefits one side and it would be impossible 
to introduce fair competition. Only when reform of the 
mainland's banking system is completed and commercial banks are 
established, which operate in the ways of a modern banking 
system, will it be possible for foreign-funded banks to deal 
with renminbi business and compete fairly with mainland banks. 
  To date, there are 98 foreign-funded banks with branches or 
offices on the mainland. With the further deepening of China's 
economic structural reform and opening up, an increasing number 
of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations will set up 
branches and representative offices in China. Citicorp recently 
transferred its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai 
and became the first foreign-funded bank to set up a 
headquarters in China. J. P. Morgan, Swiss Bank Corporation, 
and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez of France have gone to 
Shanghai one after another to discuss setting up branches there. 
More than 50 banks from countries and regions including Japan, 
the United States, France, Germany, and Hong Kong have also held 
talks respectively with the People's Bank of China Beijing 
branch on the possibility of establishing a joint bank. Taiwan 
financial consortia which intend to set up branches on the 
mainland include Juntai, Tungtisi, Tungyee, Leeba, and Yuantung. 
With the rapid development of China's economy and the 
implementation of the new regulations, it is estimated that more 
and more foreign-funded financial organizations will set up 
branches or offices on the mainland.

<F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" column: "New Import-Export </F>
Regulations for Foreign-Invested Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC] has recently formulated import-export 
regulations for foreign-invested enterprises. The main contents 
are as follows: 
  --According to the enterprise law regarding Sino-foreign 
joint operations and relevant laws and regulations, 
foreign-invested enterprises can only export the products they 
produce themselves and import such machinery, equipment, raw and 
semifinished materials, spare parts and components as they need 
for their own production purposes. In addition to having 
approval of the relevant quarters in accordance with the 
provisions, they must not purchase or act as agents for the 
products of another enterprise nor must they import commodities 
for sale or exchange on the mainland. 
  --Where products exported by foreign-invested enterprises 
require export licenses, they must be approved by MOFTEC and 
their annual export volume must not exceed the licensed fiscal 
export plan. No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to 
purchase export licenses from a foreign trade company for export 
purposes. If such a deal is discovered, the buyer and the 
seller will be penalized. 
  --Foreign exchange earned by the Chinese side of a 
Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative enterprise should be 
settled and turned over to the higher authorities in strict 
accordance with relevant regulations. It is necessary to 
prevent some foreign-funded enterprises from retaining foreign 
exchange by exporting through the foreign-invested enterprises 
they have set up. 
  --When setting up, examining, and approving the 
establishment 
of foreign-invested enterprises, all localities should continue 
to make it an important point to set up product exporting 
enterprises, encourage and support enterprises to earn more 
foreign exchange by increasing exports, to attain a balance of 
foreign exchange income and expenditure, and to increase 
gradually the numbers of homemade raw and semifinished materials 
and spare parts and components exported.

  [Text] Haikou, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
is to introduce a monopoly system on salt production and 
wholesale distribution. 
  Starting from this year, all salt producers and wholesale 
dealers are required to apply for licences, a State Council 
decision has said. 
  This is aimed at checking shoddy and non-iodised salt on the 
market. 
  An administrative department for the salt industry will be 
set up in the China Council of Light Industry to take charge of 
the work. 
  In recent years, low-quality and non-iodised salt have 
emerged on the market, leading to a rise of Iodine Deficiency 
Diseases (IDD) in some areas of the country. 
  The introduction of the system is expected to help the 
country realize its goal of eliminating IDD nationwide by the 
year 2000. 
  China is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD 
prevalence.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China has stepped up 
oil exploration of in east China as part of its efforts to 
implement the strategy of "stabilizing oil production in the 
east and developing the resources in the west" and maintain the 
current level of the country's oil production. 
  The goal is to find more reserves and maintain oil 
production 
in this part of the country at 124 million tons, according to a 
senior official of the China National Petroleum Corporation 
(CNPC). 
  The eastern region covers the vast area east of the Taihang 
Mountains and the Three Gorges and north of the Chang Jiang 
River. Oil reserves in this area are estimated at 33.5 billion 
tons, 54 percent of China's total onshore oil reserves. It 
produces 90 percent of the country's oil, which is expected to 
reach 140 million tons this year, slightly higher than last. 
  After more than four decades of exploitation and 
development, 
most of the production wells have entered the period of decline. 
The high content of water makes production difficult. The 
amount of reserves verified is less than the amount of oil 
tapped. 
  Oil production in this region is essential to maintain the 
current level of production, as oil exploration and development 
in the western part of the country has just begun and 
transportation problems have hampered development. 
  According to the CNPC official, a plan has been in place to 
increase the recovery rate of the old wells by five percentage 
points by drilling more wells and adopting such technologies as 
water control and tertiary extraction. 
  At the same time, efforts will be made to implement rolling 
exploration and development in and around the old oil fields in 
a bid to find more geological reserves. This will help find 100 
million tons of new geological reserves a year and boost the 
production capacity by two million tons. 
  In addition, the region will accelerate the development of 
low-filtration, thick oil and shallow sea oil fields. 
  China's crude oil consumption increases at an annual rate of 
six million to seven million tons.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sun Shangwu: "Rural Firms Get OK to </F>
Sharehold Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The central government is drafting a law on how 
workers can buy shares in their local enterprises. 
  The employee-share system has already been widely adopted in 
thousands of rural enterprises, but a central law could help 
avoid disorder and chaos, and prevent the whole process from 
being too haphazard process, said the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES). 
  Rural governments used to support collective enteprises by 
raising funds from local people and workers. 
  The new co-operative system allows workers to buy shares in 
their local collectives and get paid according to their work and 
the number of shares they own. 
  The shares will not be sold on the open market, only to 
workers and locals. 
  Agriculture Ministry statistics show more than 2 million, or 
10 percnt, of rural enterprises were turned into co-operatives 
by December. 
  And another 60 million rural firms, mostly in the coastal 
provinces, are in the process of introducing the reform. The 
system has even caught on in the less-developed provinces. 
  Twenty percent of the State firms have adopted it, a SCRES 
official said. 
  He described this new system, which differs from the 
traditional and the standard shareholding systems, as a "new 
type of relations of production." 
  Some economists argue that the new national system should 
bar 
shareholders from withdrawing or transferring their shares when 
they leave the enterprises. 
  And they believe all shareholders should have equal 
decision- 
making power, regardless of how many shares they hold. 
  However, the worker-shareholders should be paid according 
both to their work performance and the numbers of their shares. 
  But the SCRES official admitted that many rural enterprises 
switching to shareholding co-ops did not follow this principle. 
  Most have adapted the system to their local conditions. 
  Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Sichuan have 
produced their own laws guiding the switch to shareholding 
co-ops, he said. 
  And five other provinces and cities are now mapping out 
their 
own rules. 
  The official said that the SCRES is one of several 
ministries 
responsible for drafting this law. 
  The commission this year will investigate these provincial 
laws and listen to the opinions of experts, provincial leaders 
and entrepreneurs.

<F P=106> [By Wang Xiangwei] </F>
  [Text] Hainan province, China's largest special economic 
zone, yesterday unveiled plans to sell off all of its 33 wholly 
and partly state-owned enterprises in an ambitious move to fuel 
economic growth in the region. 
  The massive sale to foreign investors includes an airline, 
two airports, a major power plant and a highway, according to 
Sun Lijun, the provincial deputy secretary-general. 
  The sale would be conducted through public auction and 
individual negotiation, from tomorrow until next Wednesday, in 
Haikou, the capital of the province, Sun said yesterday in Hong 
Kong. 
  Sun said a 27 per cent stake in Hainan Airline would be sold 
to foreign investors. An official of the airline later 
confirmed the deal. 
  He said the airline planned to raise U.S.$27m (about 
HK$210.6m [Hong Kong dollars]) through an international 
placement of 70 million B shares. 
  The move, analysts said, would herald the opening up of 
China's domestic aviation market to foreign investors, and 
foreign carriers in particular. 
  The news followed a weekend announcement by the Civil 
Aviation Administration of China that the country would invite 
foreign airlines to buy into domestic carriers this year. 
  Earlier, the Chinese government said two major Chinese 
carriers, China Southern and China Eastern, would seek primary 
listings on the New York Stock Exchange this year or next. 
  However, both Sun and the Hainan Airline official declined 
to 
say whether foreign airlines were involved in the deal. 
  Established in October 1989 and restructured into a 
joint-stock company in September 1992, Hainan Airline has five 
Boeing passenger planes flying 15 domestic routes. 
  Last June the airline started to trade 96 million legal 
person shares on China's screen-based securities trading system 
STAQ [expansion unknown]. 
  Last year, the airline, with a staff of 450, made 67.06m 
renminbi (about HK$59.55m) in profits. 
  The provincial government would not set limits on how much 
foreign investors could buy for most of the 33 enterprises to be 
sold, Sun said. 
  "In fact, we will encourage them to buy the whole of the 
power plant and the airports we have put up," he said. 
  The sale of the state-owned enterprises highlights the 
unconventional and controversial methods often seen in Hainan. 
  In the late 1980s the province caused a political storm 
after 
it announced that it would lease 30 square kilometres of land to 
the Hong Kong-based construction company, Kumagai Gumi, to 
develop a free port. 
  The controversy centred around the fact that the leases 
resembled those which had been drawn up in the 1890s when China 
was forced to cede territories to foreign colonial powers. 
However, the deal was eventually approved by Beijing in 1992. 
  Sun said the provincial government had already drawn up a 
series of provisional regulations to govern the sell-offs and it 
would set up a permanent trading centre, open to Chinese and 
foreigners, this Friday where enterprises could be bought or 
sold. 
  The centre, like a stock exchange, would operate on a 
membership mechanism in which enterprises that wanted to buy or 
sell would have to do so through members. The centre would have 
21 members, most of them securities and investment companies. 
  Enterprises would be able to sell both state-owned and 
non-state-owned assets, provided they were properly audited. 
  Investors would be able to buy the management rights, 
land-use rights, and intellectual property rights of the 
enterprises. 
  Sales would be finalised through negotiations or public 
auctions at the centre. 
  The Hainan centre will not be the first in China. Shanghai, 
Sichuan and Hunan already have similar centres. 
  But Hainan wants to become the largest and most 
sophisticated 
in China. 
  Ren Junren, the deputy director of the Hainan Securities 
Regulatory Office, said the centre would consider admitting 
foreign securities companies and linking up with other centres 
across the country so enterprises in other provinces could be 
traded. 
  Of the 33 enterprises to be sold, Ren said only a few were 
losing money and some companies had big potential. 
  In addition to the airline, the Hainan Airport Joint Stock 
seemed to be a good buy, he said. The company runs two major 
airports in Hainan. 
  The Sanya Fenghuang International Airport, with an 
investment 
of Renminbi [Rmb] 600m, is due to open on July 1, 1994. 
  The airport, close to summer resort Sanya City, is designed 
to handle 1.5 million passengers a year and accommodate Boeing 
747 passenger planes. 
  Construction of the Haikou Meilan Airport, at a cost of 
Rmb3bn, is due to start later this year and open four years 
later. The new airport would replace the current Haikou airport 
which was converted from a military airstrip.

  [Text] At 1730 on 29 March, a reasonably old medium-sized 
van drove into Zhengzhou University. With bowls and chopsticks 
in their hands, provincial CPC Secretary Li Changchun, and 
Deputy Secretary Song Zhaosu entered the student dining hall to 
have supper with the students. 
  Inside the Zhengzhou University Student Dining Hall, Li 
Changchun, and Song Zhaosu lined up with students to buy rice 
and dishes using coupons they had brought themselves. While 
eating their supper, they made small talk with students from the 
literature, history, and philosophy departments, asking them 
about their monthly board expenses. They also asked them 
whether they were satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by 
the dining hall. A male student eating his supper at the same 
table as Li Changchun said: Our monthly board expenses are 
about 100 yuan and monthly board expenses for female students 
are about 70 yuan. Other students said that they were basically 
satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by the dining hall. 
  After taking their supper, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu 
visited the cooks and management staff of the dining hall, 
asking questions about managing the dining hall and passing on 
the students' opinions and suggestions. Li Changchun said: I 
have learned that students are basically satisfied with the 
quality and price of food supplied by the dining hall. I hope 
that you will continue to make efforts to handle messing 
arrangements for students in an even better way. He encouraged 
the cooks and management staff to do everything possible to 
reduce costs of rice and dishes under the existing conditions to 
ensure a balance between receipts and payments. He stressed 
that surplus was unnecessary and that they must publish their 
accounts regularly. Through their hard work, they would send 
the warmth of the party and government to students. 
  When the students learned that the provincial CPC Committee 
leaders were having supper with them, many crowded round and 
reported of their own accord their study and life style to the 
two leaders, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu, and also about the 
situation in their native places. The two leaders cordially 
encouraged them to study hard and fully improve themselves in 
terms of political thinking and studies, so that they could make 
their due contributions to the modernizations in their native 
places after their graduation. 
  When it was getting dark, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu went 
to the offices of the university leaders to study with them ways 
to further strengthen management and properly handle the messing 
arrangements for students. Li Changchun urged university 
leaders to do this from the high plane of training qualified 
personnel for modernizations to ensure students' vigorous health 
and vim and vigor, so that they can study well. They put 
forward several specific demands. In the end they told the 
university leaders to go to student dining hall very often to 
observe and learn from real life. In doing so, they could have 
heart-to-heart talks with the students, discover the real 
situation, and heed their opinions in handling messing 
arrangements for students in an even better way.

  [Text] The provincial government held a forum yesterday 
afternoon at the headquarters of the Fujian provincial Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference Committee, in which 
non-CPC representatives from all walks of life participated by 
invitation to air their opinions on the government work report. 
  Provincial CPC Secretary and Governor Jia Qinglin and 
leaders 
You Dexin, Wang Jianshuang, Liu Yongye, Zhang Jiakun, and Cao 
Jiufu attended the forum. Also present, were people in charge 
of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the 
China Democratic League, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' 
Democratic Party, the China Democratic National Construction 
Association, the China Zhi Gong Dang, the Taiwan Democratic 
Self-Government League, the China Association for Promoting 
Democracy, the Jiusan Society, the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce, and other public organizations concerned. 
  During the forum, participants fully expressed their 
opinions 
on the various ideas for the development of the province in all 
aspects presented by the government work report. They 
particularly contributed many very valuable opinions and 
suggestions on such issues as lightening the burden on the 
peasants, deepening the rural reform, transforming the 
operational mechanism of state-run enterprises, increasing 
investment in education and in scientific farming projects, 
establishing an effective supervision mechanism, and curbing 
corruption. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary and Governor Jia 
Qinglin 
addressed the forum, after hearing the opinions of non-CPC 
representatives from all walks of life, endorsing the opinions 
and suggestions presented by the forum participants and stating 
that their ideas would serve as a very useful reference for the 
government in policy making. 
  Comrade Jia Qinglin briefed the participants on the economic 
development and progress in reform in the province this year. 
He pointed out that this year will be a crucial one for the 
province in achieving sustained, rapid, and healthy development. 
The province's task this year is to carry on the reform, keep 
up development, and ensure stability, while maintaining a 
balance between these three aspects. 
  Jia Qinglin said: This province has initiated five reforms 
this year, specifically: Reform of the financial and taxation 
systems; the operation to introduce uniform foreign exchange 
rates; reform of the fundraising and financing systems; foreign 
trade reform; and reform of the banking system. As shown by the 
development over the past two months, smooth progress has been 
made in these reforms but more meticulous work must be done in 
the future. 
  Jia hoped that everybody will make concerted efforts and 
that 
all the democratic parties will play an active part in political 
involvement and work together to do a good job in building 
Fujian Province.

  The opening ceremony was presided over by executive Chairman 
Mao Zhiyong who declared the second session open at 0830 this 
morning. 
  Provincial Governor Wu Guanzheng delivered the Jiangxi 
Provincial Government Work Report in which he said: Over the 
past year, Jiangxi has witnessed fast national economic growth; 
carried out in- depth reform and opening up; continually 
improved people's livelihoods; and stepped up socialist 
spiritual civilization and material civilization building. Last 
year, the whole province conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; implemented in an 
in-depth manner the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; further emancipated the minds; sought truth from 
facts; seized each and every excellent opportunity to quicken 
the pace of development; and maintained rapid and vigorous 
national economic growth with the result that the province's 
total GNP exceeded 68 billion yuan, up 15.8 percent on the 
previous year, while the province's total industrial and 
agricultural output value reached 122.1 billion yuan, up by 27.5 
percent, and total financial revenue 6.56 billion yuan, up by 
30.8 percent. Despite serious natural calamities, the province 
still reaped a good agricultural harvest with the total grain 
output reaching 30.34 billion jin. 
  Wu Guanzheng went on: Last year, Jiangxi also successfully 
and comprehensively improved economic efficiency with the result 
that the total amount of profits and taxes realized by budgetary 
industrial enterprises registered a 46 percent increase. The 
province's total social commodity retail volume reached 27.9 
billion yuan, up by 21.2 percent. The subsistence income of the 
province's urban residents rose by 26 percent while the per 
capita net income of the province's peasants went up by 13.3 
percent. In 1993, Jiangxi absorbed a total of $1 billion in 
foreign funds and actually used $343 million of foreign funds. 
Moreover, Jiangxi also successfully kept the natural population 
growth rate within its planned limit. 
  Reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Wu 
Guanzheng maintained: This year, we should try to handle 
relations between reform and development correctly on the one 
hand and stability on the other; seize each and every excellent 
opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push forward 
development, and maintain stability; work in a down-to-earth 
manner; promote industrial development on the basis of 
agricultural development; and lay a solid foundation for 
Jiangxi's future development. This year is a crucial one for 
deepening reform aimed at building a socialist market economic 
structure and an important year for concentrating on building 
basic facilities and pushing the province's economic growth onto 
a new stage at a faster pace. On the premise of improving 
economic efficiency, readjusting economic structure, and 
quickening construction pace, we should strive to keep Jiangxi's 
economic growth rate at a level higher than the country's 
average. We should strive to attain the following national 
economic and social development tasks in 1994: 
  1. Increase the province's GNP by 12 to 14 percent. 
  2. Increase the province's total industrial and 
agricultural output value by 18 percent, of which total 
agricultural output value is to be increased by 5 percent and 
total industrial output value by 23 percent. 
  3. Increase the province's financial revenue by 12 to 14 
percent. 
  4. Increase per capita net income of the province's 
peasants by 100 to 130 yuan. 
  5. Keep the province's natural population growth rate 
within limits set by the state. 
  In order to attain these goals, Wu Guanzheng stated, first 
and foremost, we should conscientiously implement "The CPC 
Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" and waste no time in 
pushing ahead with reform; second, we should strive to improve 
the productive forces layout and concentrate on successfully 
building such basic facilities as electrical energy, 
communications, telecommunications, water conservancy, and so 
on; third, we should strive to quicken both the pace of economic 
exploitation and the pace of inviting foreign funds and 
expanding opening up; fourth, we should strive to develop, more 
successfully and more rapidly, a high-yield, high-efficiency, 
and high-quality agriculture, township and town enterprises, and 
large and medium state-owned enterprises with an eye to bringing 
about rapid and highly efficient industrial growth; sixth, we 
should strive to carry out in-depth circulation system reform, 
open up more markets, invigorate circulation, and build a new 
market circulation system as well as a new market management 
system; seventh, we should strive to actively integrate science 
and technology into the economy and train a strong contingent of 
qualified personnel with a view to infusing the provincial 
economy with new vitality; and eighth, we should try to step up 
building spiritual civilization under the conditions of a 
socialist market economic structure and strive to create a 
favorable environment for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  Wu Guanzheng concluded by stating: The work we are doing at 
the moment is aimed at promoting economic growth, improving 
people's livelihood, and pushing ahead with Jiangxi's 
comprehensive development. We should arm our minds with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; adhere to the party's basic line; unite as one; 
enhance cooperation; focus more on furthering in-depth reform; 
push ahead with economic construction; and make greater 
contributions to Jiangxi's overall development under the 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the core! 
  More than 100 people attended this morning's meeting as 
nonvoting delegates. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jinan, April 7 (XINHUA) -- World Bank officials, on 
a visit to Shandong from April 4-6, said that the bank's 
operations in this east China province had been very successful. 
  Nicholas C. Hope, the new director of the bank's China and 
Mongolia Office, said he was very satisfied that projects 
financed by loans from the bank had been going so well. 
  On his first day in his new post, the director visited the 
expressway connecting Jinan, the provincial capital, and the 
port city of Qingdao, and an irrigation project in Qufu, the 
home of Confucius, both backed by World Bank loans. 
  He was accompanied by Pieter P. Bottelier, the bank's chief 
of mission to China, and officials from the Chinese Ministry of 
Finance. 
  Mr. Hope said he was deeply impressed by the province's 
strict management and efficient organization in project 
operations, and that the province had never delayed repayment of 
loans. 
  From 1982 to the end of last year, the World Bank had 
provided loans worth 824 million U.S. dollars on 26 projects in 
agriculture, traffic, health and education, and 16 of them have 
been completed. 
  Mr. Hope said that Shandong has great development potential 
and provides many profitable investment opportunities. He 
expressed the wish that the bank would continue and expand its 
good cooperative relations with Shandong. 
  At the end of his visit, Mr. Hope received six applications 
from the provincial government for loans for six projects in 
coastal environmental protection, traffic, power supply and 
rural housing development. The proposed loans total 1.6 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  Mr. Hope said he would take the applications to the bank's 
Washington headquarters, and that he would personally actively 
support them.

  [Text] Forty-four students drowned in a recent boat outing 
accident in Zhejiang's Jinyun County. According to a report 
filed by our reporter from Hangzhou, on 5 April the Wuzhen 
Primary School in Jinyun County, Lishui Prefecture, Zhejiang 
Province, organized over 140 fourth and fifth grade students for 
a spring outing. Three fourth grade classes were assembled for 
a boat outing on Yanmenxiang Reservoir, which was about 10 li 
from the town. After arriving at the assembly location around 
1030 [0230 GMT], more than 80 students boarded the boats at 
designated locations. After 10 minutes, the first boat 
capsized, while the second boat also capsized 45 minutes later. 
  According to the local public security department, the two 
boats were made of cement, and it was initially concluded that 
the accident was caused by dangerous overloading. After the 
accident occurred, the teachers who were at the scene and those 
people who rushed to the scene after hearing of the accident 
made serious efforts to rescue the students. The rescue 
operation ended at 0400 [2000 GMT] on 6 April, and it was 
confirmed that 44 students of about 10 years of age drowned, 
while the rest were saved. 
  After the accident occurred, Zhejiang Deputy Provincial 
Governor Xu Zhichun, and other officials of the Lishui 
Prefecture, rushed to the scene to direct the rescue effort and 
to deal with the problems arising from the accident. On the 
same day after the accident occurred, the principal leader of 
the Zhejiang provincial party committee called on the provincial 
education commission to immediately notify all middle and 
primary schools throughout the province of the accident, adding 
that the commission should urge them to draw a lesson from this 
accident, to ensure safety in spring outings for students, and 
to cancel long-distance outings if safety conditions are found 
to be inadequate.

<F P=106> ["Special report": "Boats Capsize in Zhejiang, 44 Primary </F>
School Students Die"] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 6 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- On 5 April, a boat 
capsizing accident occurred in Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, 
where over 80 primary school students on a spring outing fell 
into the water, 44 of whom drowned. 
  It was Qing Ming festival yesterday [5 April]. The primary 
school in Huzhen town, Jinyun County organized over 140 students 
from grade four and five to go on a spring outing. Three 
classes went on a water tour on a reservoir in Yanmen Township, 
five km from the town. Over 80 students came to the assembly 
place. At around 1030, the students embarked at the designated 
place. Ten minutes later the first boat capsized, and, after 
four or five minutes, the second boat also capsized and sank. 
  Teachers on the scene and some other people who rushed to 
the 
scene on hearing the news threw themselves into rescuing the 
students from the water. The large rescue operation ended in 
the early hours of today. It was finally confirmed that 44 
students, all of whom were around age 10, had drowned. 
  Both of the sunken boats were concrete boats [the hulls are 
constructed from concrete formed around a steel frame]. The 
preliminary police investigation suggests that the accident was 
caused by serious overloading. 
  After the accident, Xu Zhichun, the vice governor of 
Zhejiang 
Province, together with persons in charge of the administrative 
office in Lishui Prefecture, rushed to the scene to supervise 
the rescue operation and the handling of the aftermath. The 
provincial government education committee issued a notice to all 
primary and middle schools in the province advising them to draw 
a lesson from this accident and to take substantial measures to 
ensure the safety of spring outings. The cause of the accident 
is under further investigation and the repercussions are being 
dealt with.

  [Text] Yesterday morning [30 March], a ceremony for 
provincial leaders to devote warmth and make donations to the 
masses in Mashan and Yaoshan was held in the former office 
building of the provincial government. Provincial party, 
government, and military leaders attended the ceremony, 
including Liu Fangren, Chen Shineng, Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi, 
Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui, and others. They took lead 
in donating more than 10,000 items of clothing, more than 200 
books, and 1,500 yuan in cash to the masses in Mashan and 
Yaoshan. 
  At the ceremony, provincial party committee Deputy Secretary 
Wang Siqi said: I hope that party and government departments in 
various localities will strengthen organization and leadership, 
and that -- taking these donations as a starting point -- they 
will carry out education throughout the province on struggling 
hard, and practicing thrift, patriotism and collectivism. He 
also pointed out: At present, there are quite a lot of 
impoverished people in our province. Governments in all 
localities must fully realize the difficulties, importance, and 
complexity of work to support the impoverished. We must arouse 
our emotions, take real action, and use our heads to increase 
the weight of the work to support the impoverished. Only thus 
can we change the situation in the impoverished areas. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren and 
Governor 
Chen Shineng were interviewed by reporters. They said: On the 
one hand, the present activities to devote warmth to the masses 
in Mashan and Yaoshan have shown that our province is 
implementing conscientiously the policy of the CPC Central 
Committee. On the other hand, such activities are the common 
desire of the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the 
province. They have strongly promoted the work to support the 
impoverished throughout the province. There are 10 million 
people in our province who need support. In Mashan and Yaoshan, 
there are 300,000 poor people. If the work to support the 
impoverished in these two areas is carried out well, it can play 
the role of grasping the key point to promote the work as a 
whole. I believe that the broad masses of party members and 
cadres will participate actively in such activities to support 
the impoverished and aid households in need. 
  While answering reporters' questions, they stressed: In 
carrying out such activities, we need a good plan. However, 
what is more important is that we need to work in a 
down-to-earth manner. The present donations are only part of 
the project to support the impoverished. We must help them 
develop and improve the quality of production and education, 
with the emphasis on development. It is necessary to solve the 
problem of impoverishment once and for all, and to help these 
impoverished areas develop their self-supporting capabilities 
and to survive. 
  They emphasized: The activities of devoting affection are 
merely a good start in supporting the impoverished. There is 
much work to be done. The provincial party committee and 
government have the confidence and determination to carry out 
well the work to support the impoverished. 
  After the ceremony, provincial party committee Secretary Liu 
Fangren and Governor Chen Shineng talked with responsible 
comrades of the office in charge of the activities, and asked 
them to contact one child in Maoshan and one in Yaoshan who were 
deprived of education, promising to subsidize them.

  [Text] To ensure the correct implementation of the new 
taxation system and the stability of the market, the Guiyang 
City Commodity Price and Tax Bureaus recently formulated the 
regulations to ensure price stability after the taxation system 
reform is introduced. The main contents are as follows: 
  1. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the spirit 
of the 4 February notice by the State Planning Commission and 
the State General Administration of Taxation on maintaining 
price stability after taxation system reform is carried out. 
All [word indistinct] are prohibited from [words indistinct] 
and forcing up commodity prices at will and disrupting the 
market. 
  2. As the economy grows overall, tax burdens in enterprises 
will not be increased. If the tax burdens in enterprises which 
introduced the new taxation system increase, in principle, they 
should not increase prices. Because their tax burdens have 
increased by too wide a margin, enterprises in localities which 
want to increase prices should get the approval of the commodity 
price bureau. 
  3. As the current ex-factory price, wholesale price, and 
retail sales price already contain taxes, all [word indistinct] 
are prohibited from increasing the burdens on consumers by 
applying value-added and other forms of taxes. As far as the 
commodities which are sold at reduced prices are concerned, 
production, allocation, and wholesale departments should 
indicate on the price tags that taxes are not included in the 
reduced prices. 
  4. The different profit rates from marketing wholesale and 
retail sales of consumers capital goods, including agricultural 
capital goods such as chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals, 
should remain unchanged; that is, they should be calculated at 
the present taxable prices. All expenses should be collected 
from the different profit rates. All enterprises and units are 
prohibited from expanding the rates without authorization. 
  5. Commodity price departments in urban districts should 
strengthen supervision and inspection over market prices. Those 
who adjust the prices of commodities whose prices are set by the 
state without the approval of the commodity price bureau, or 
increase their prices because of miscalculations resulting from 
a misunderstanding of the situation, or force up their prices by 
capitalizing on taxation system reform, should be ordered to 
make prompt corrections and, moreover, they should be dealt with 
according to relevant state laws and regulations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Song Xiang (1345 5046)] </F>
  [Text] Chengdu, 28 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This 
reporter learned today from the Sichuan Provincial Commodity 
Price Bureau that in view of the present situation of 
fluctuating prices for grain and edible oils in some localities, 
Sichuan Vice Governor Diao Jinxiang announced, on behalf of the 
provincial government, three measures sternly forbidding various 
localities from raising market prices of grain and edible oils 
without authorization in a bid to curb the re-escalation of 
grain and edible oils prices in various localities. 
  Prices in the grain and edible oil markets in Sichuan during 
the Spring Festival were relatively stable, but immediately 
after the festival, prices rose again. Because the supply of 
grain and edible oil in some localities in the province was not 
timely, lawless merchants took advantage of the situation and 
engaged in hoarding and speculation to drive up prices. A few 
state grain shops also raised prices without authorization. 
This caused excessive rises in grain and edible oil prices and 
at the same time pushed up the entire retail price index. 
Everyone is talking about the matter in various localities. 
  It is learned that the three measures to curb and stabilize 
grain and edible oil prices adopted by Sichuan Province include: 
  --Major measures to curb and stabilize grain and edible oil 
prices put forward by the State Council and the Sichuan 
Provincial Government must be seriously implemented and fixed 
prices must be strictly followed in order to maintain the 
stability of grain and edible oil prices; 
  --In some places where the supply of edible oils is 
excessively short, rationing can be adopted; and 
  --In a few localities where there really is difficulty in 
the supply of edible oils and where a readjustment of prices is 
needed, a report can be submitted to the provincial commodity 
price bureau for approval, but rises cannot exceed 10 percent of 
the price limit.

  [Text] Chongqing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Chongqing, a major 
industrial city in southwest Sichuan Province, has reported 
rapid expansion of its telecommunications network in recent 
years. 
  Officials from the telecommunications authority said the 
city's telephone lines had increased from 20,000 in 1988 to 
200,000 by the end of last year. 
  In 1993 alone, near 40,000 lines were installed at an 
investment of 510 million yuan. The figure equals the total 
number installed in the previous 40 years, according to the 
sources. 
  With the new opening of fiber optic lines to Wuhan and 
Chengdu and a satellite ground station, telecommunications 
between the city and the outside have become much easier, the 
sources said. 
  Nearly 95,000 direct call lines now connect the city with 
over 700 domestic cities and 185 countries across the world. 
  Meanwhile, the city's telecommunications network has become 
more diversified. It now handles more than 6,000 mobile phones 
and some 100,000 wireless pagers. 
  The sources said that, as the telephone network expands, 
applications for household telephones are piling up. 
  The sources disclosed that the city will invest a record one 
billion yuan this year to add another 210,000 lines to its 
telephone network.

  [Text] The Fourth Session of the Yunnan Provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commission opened in Kunming yesterday 
morning. Liu Fuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, attended the session. On behalf of the standing 
committee of the provincial discipline inspection committee, 
Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission, delivered a report to the session. He said: Since 
the third session of the provincial party committee, under the 
leadership of the provincial party committee and government, 
discipline inspection and procuratorial departments throughout 
the province have paid intense attention to the honesty and 
self-discipline in performing duties of cadres at the office 
level and above and investigated and handled major and important 
cases. In the last two years, provincial discipline inspection 
organizations have investigated and handled 5,951 cases of 
discipline violations, punishing 4,982 party members for 
discipline violations, of whom 96 were party-member cadres at 
the county and office levels; provincial administrative 
inspection organizations have placed 967 cases on file for 
investigation and prosecution and meted out disciplinary 
sanctions to 897 persons, of whom 12 were cadres at the county 
and office levels, and they have also specifically handled key 
problems and rectified key departments. The provincial 
authorities have scrapped 2,451 fee-collection items, lightening 
the burden on enterprises and the people by a total of 380 
million yuan a year. Thanks to unremitting efforts, the 
province has achieved some results in anticorruption work; 
outstanding corrupt practices have disappeared to some extent; 
and party-member cadres have received a profound reeducation on 
resisting corruption and degeneration and on honesty in 
government, enhanced their sense of incorruptibility and 
self-discipline, worked out regulations on incorruptibility and 
self-discipline, and formed a restraining mechanism, thus laying 
a foundation for the further improvement of party style and the 
construction of clean government. Overall, the momentum of the 
province's anticorruption struggle is good and it is now 
progressing healthily. This has helped to promote and ensure 
the province's reform and opening up to the outside world, and 
also economic construction, thus laying a good foundation for 
deepening the struggle against corruption. 
  Lang Dazhong said: This year, discipline inspection 
departments should earnestly study and implement Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's important speech and the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission; 
effectively carry out the anticorruption struggle by proceeding 
from the overall situation of reform, development, and 
stability; devote efforts to consolidation, policy 
implementation, and persistence; and deepen the struggle, step 
by step, with the emphasis on practical results. It is still 
necessary to continue to pay close attention to the three tasks. 
Leading cadres should continue to take the lead in honestly 
performing their official duties and exercising self-discipline. 
Cadres at the county and office levels of party and government 
leading organizations, judicial organs, administrative law- 
enforcement departments, and economic management departments 
should have finished conducting inner-party democratic 
activities by the end of May. It is necessary to continue to 
regard the investigation and handling of cases as the focal 
point of the anticorruption struggle, concentrate forces on 
investigating and handling major and important cases, check 
unhealthy practices, and devote efforts toward policy 
implementation. 
  In conclusion, Lang Dazhong said: The key to doing a good 
job of this year's anticorruption work lies in improved 
leadership. Principal leaders of party committees and 
governments at all levels should assume overall responsibility 
for the anticorruption work in the localities and departments 
under their own jurisdiction, so that the work will be 
continuously carried out in depth, level after level down, with 
specific persons taking charge and making fresh contributions to 
promoting the province's economic development, pushing ahead 
with its reform and opening up to the outside world, and 
safeguarding its political stability.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The sky is clearer 
and the air cleaner in Shenyang, this once pollution-ridden 
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, according to the 
city's environmental agency. 
  Shenyang is one of the most important heavy industrial 
centers in China. The city's gross national product grew at an 
average annual rate of 15.6 percent to reach 37.45 billion yuan 
in 1993, an increase of 26 billion yuan over the 1986 figure. 
  The results of monitoring by the environmental agency show 
that annual mean value of the total suspended particles per 
cubic meter of air in 1993 was 0.434 mg, 0.87 mg less than in 
1986, the amount of monthly dust fall per square kilometer in 
the year was 29.81 tons, 11.2 tons less than eight years ago and 
the annual value of the content of sulphur dioxide per standard 
square meter in the air was 0.122 mg, 0.037 mg less than eight 
years ago. 
  The city used more than 10 million tons of coal last year, 
accounting for 70 percent of the total amount of energy consumed. 
  The city has been working hard to eliminate pollution 
sources, especially soot and dust emitted by factories and 
family stoves. Restaurants in urban areas of the city are 
required to use clean fuels. More than 3,000 old-fashioned 
boilers have been replaced by modern central heating facilities. 
  Any enterprise whose discharge of wastes and dust exceeds 
the 
state set standards would be warned or fined. 
  The city authorities have also encouraged a tree planting 
campaign as part of the efforts to improve the environmental 
quality.

  [Excerpts] Addressing a meeting held yesterday [29 March] 
to promote the anticorruption operation for cadres at and above 
the office level from organs directly under the provincial 
authorities, Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, said: Our province must stress 
reform, development, and stability as major matters this year, 
must continue to implement the central authorities' decision on 
the struggle against corruption, and must carry out the 
anticorruption operation in a sustained, deep-going, and more 
effective manner, while preserving the present achievements. 
  The anticorruption promotion meeting was presided over by 
Cai 
Zhulin, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. 
Present were more than 1,000 people, including leading comrades 
Doba, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjue Cenam, Han Yingxuan, 
La Bingli, Bai Ma, Liu Guanghe, Bainma Dandzin, Han Shenggui, 
(Ajia Luosang Tudan), (Ma Jinxiao), and (Hu Decai), as well as 
cadres from organs directly under the provincial authorities. 
  During the meeting, the participants were briefed on the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission and on the important speech by Comrade 
Jiang Zemin on the anticorruption operation. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, 
Tian Chengping delivered a speech to mobilize the participants 
to engage in the operation. He first reviewed the development 
of the anticorruption operation in the province over the 
previous period. He pointed out: The anticorruption operation 
has been progressing in a wholesome manner and has basically met 
the requirements and expectations of the central authorities and 
the provincial party committee. Thanks to the concerted efforts 
by all the people -- from the leadership to the grass-roots 
level -- all the targets have been fulfilled with regard to the 
three major tasks for the current stage, as assigned by the 
central authorities. [passage omitted] 
  Tian Chengping noted: Although some results have been scored 
in the anticorruption operation in our province, what we have 
achieved already still falls short of the actual demand and the 
public's expectations. Therefore, we must view the 
anticorruption struggle from a strategic point of view and treat 
it as a long-term, complicated, and arduous task. [passage 
omitted] 
  Party committees and governments, as well as discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs at all levels, must further 
strengthen leadership over the anticorruption operation. While 
studying and planning their working procedures to deepen the 
reform, carry on economic construction, and safeguard stability, 
they must set requirements on the anticorruption operation, map 
out the plan, and devote great efforts to implementing the plan. 
[passage omitted] 
  To conclude his speech, Tian Chengping stressed that 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs, while focusing 
their attention on specific tasks in the anticorruption 
operation, must more strictly supervise the enforcement of laws, 
with the stress on implementing major policy decisions and 
measures adopted by the state, and thus make sure that 
democratic centralism is implemented properly, political 
discipline is enforced strictly, and government orders are 
carried out smoothly. Whenever problems are discovered, they 
should give timely guidance, thus ensuring that the 
anticorruption operation will be developing in a more 
deep-going, effective, and lasting manner.

  [Text] Xining, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China is to update the 
40-year-old Qinghai-Xinjiang highway this year. 
  Built in 1954, the 2,728-kilometer highway starts from 
Xining 
City, capital of Qinghai Province, and runs to Shache [as 
received] in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The renewal will be jointly undertaken by the departments of 
communication and transportation in Qinghai and Xinjiang. 
  Lu Junhan, a project engineer, said that it would improve 
the 
transportation conditions between Qinghai and Xinjiang and 
contribute to the opening up of the resources of minerals, oil 
and asbestos in the Qaidam Basin. 
  According the plan for the project approved by the Ministry 
of Communications, in the second half of this year, Qinghai will 
first reconstruct the highway from Ulan County to Delingha in 
the Mongolian-Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Haixi. 
  The total investment in this 177 kilometer highway section 
is 
about 150 million yuan and the project is expected to be 
completed in 1997.

  [Text] According to XIAN WANBAO [XIAN EVENING NEWS], since 
the beginning of March, the Xian City Grain Bureau has continued 
to cut prices of standard flour and rapeseed oil and taken two 
measures to stabilize the grain and edible oil market. The 
reduced prices of standard flour and rapeseed oil of state-run 
grain shops are 27.50 yuan per sack and 7.40 yuan per kilogram 
respectively. The city grain bureau has also set up grain 
inspection teams to comprehensively inspect transactions of 
grain and edible oil sold at reduced prices. To stabilize the 
city's grain and edible oil market, two deputy directors of the 
bureau personally led delegations to Shanghai, Hanzhong, and 
other places to coordinate the allocation and transfer of grain 
and edible oil. 
  In April, 750,000 kg of edible oil will be allocated and 
transferred. The Guojiamiu Grain Storehouse and the Wuyi, 
Limin, Renmin, Qunzhong flour mills carried out production in 
full capacity and put 14,000 sacks of standard flour on the 
market everyday. While guaranteeing the supply of standard flour 
and rapeseed oil at reduced prices, all grain and edible oil 
retail shops should [words indistinct]. The city grain bureau 
urged that grain departments at all levels should 
conscientiously abide by supply discipline and definitely not 
sell to big dealers grain and edible oil items to be sold at 
reduced prices or sell them at a profit.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Peng held talks with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in 
the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  Li Peng emphatically pointed out that China has always 
treasured Sino-French relations. Balladur said that his current 
China visit is aimed at promoting the development of 
French-Chinese relations. 
  The talks proceeded in a sincere and friendly [cheng zhi you 
hao 6134 2304 0645 1170] atmosphere. 
  Li Peng warmly welcomed the visit to China by Balladur and 
his party. He said: "China and France reached an understanding 
on the restoration of their traditional friendly cooperation 
through their joint efforts. The governments of the two 
countries issued a joint communique on 12 January, thereby 
enabling Sino-French relations to return to the track of normal 
development." 
  Li Peng pointed out: Both China and France are great 
nations. They are permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
Although tremendous changes have taken place in the 
international situation in recent years, the importance of their 
cooperation has not been reduced but rather has increased. They 
have many points in common in safeguarding world peace and 
promoting economic development. Economically, there is a very 
strong possibility for China and France to complement each 
other, and the potential for development [in this area] is very 
great. He emphatically pointed out: "China is willing to 
develop long-term, stable, and friendly cooperation with France 
according to the principle of seeking common ground while 
reserving differences; of mutual respect, noninterference in 
each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. 
Prime Minister Balladur and the current French Government have 
made positive efforts to restore and improve bilateral 
relations. We would like to express our appreciation for this. 
We should have an eye on the 21st century and treat and handle 
Sino-French relations strategically to make them enjoy further 
healthy development." 
  Touching on bilateral economic relations and trade, Li Peng 
said: There are practical and good prospects for China and 
France to carry out trade and economic cooperation. This is 
because, first, China's economy has entered a track of 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian 
kang di fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455] at 
present. This provides tremendous possibilities for China to 
expand economic relations and trade with every other country of 
the world, including France. Second, transportation, energy, and 
telecommunications and other infrastructural industries are the 
sectors receiving priority for development in China's economy, 
whereas these fields are French enterprises' strong points. 
China welcomes French enterprises to participate in competition 
on an equal basis in China. Third, the Chinese Government 
adopts a positive attitude on developing mutually beneficial 
trade and economic cooperation with France. Quite a number of 
French enterprises have conducted cooperation with China for a 
long time. They remained dedicated to mutually beneficial 
cooperation even when Sino-French relations hit a snag. 
  Li Peng expressed his hope that French enterprises would 
enhance their competitiveness in the Chinese market so as to be 
conducive to further developing and expanding Sino-French trade 
and economic cooperation. 
  Prime Minister Balladur spoke highly of the importance of 
French-Chinese relations. He noted he believed that the 
potential for cooperation between the two countries is very 
great. He said: Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications, 
and Foreign Trade Longuet will soon lead French entrepreneurs in 
visiting China to promote trade and economic cooperation between 
France and China. The French side also welcomes the visit to 
France to be made soon by Minister of Power Industry Shi Dazhen. 
  The two premiers also discussed the possibilities of 
cooperation in important projects and the prospects for the 
grain trade. They agreed that both sides will maintain the 
momentum of mutual visits by high-level officials, strengthen 
political consultations, and confirm the understanding on 
holding regular meetings and consultations between the two 
countries' foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers which 
was reached this January when Vice Premier Qian Qichen made an 
official visit to France. 
  Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into the GATT," 
Balladur said that France supports China in resuming its status 
as a signatory state to the GATT and thus becoming a founding 
member of the World Trade Organization. Li Peng expressed his 
thanks for France's support. 
  Li Peng also briefed his guests on U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher's recent China visit, and he explained China's 
principled stand on the human rights issue. Balladur briefed 
his host on France's stand on the human rights issue, saying 
that France has no intention of interfering in other nations' 
internal affairs and that it is willing to discuss the issue 
with other countries on the basis of equality. 
  At the request of his guests, Li Peng briefed them on 
China's 
independent, peaceful foreign policy and its relations with 
neighboring countries. The two premiers also exchanged in-depth 
views on wide-ranging international and regional issues of 
common concern, and they noted that the stands of both sides 
have a lot in common. Both sides unanimously expressed their 
belief that China and France are influential nations in 
international affairs and that maintaining good relations 
between them accords with their fundamental interests and is 
conducive to world peace and stability. 
  Among those present at the talks were Qian Qichen, State 
Council vice premier and concurrently foreign minister; Shi 
Dazhen, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee 
and minister of power industry; French Foreign Minister Juppe; 
and French Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications, and 
Foreign Trade Longuet. 
  Prior to the talks, Li Peng presided over a welcoming 
ceremony for Balladur. In the evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet 
in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Balladur and their party. 
  This afternoon, Zhou Jue, vice chairman of the National 
People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, held working talks 
with Gilles de Robien and Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, vice presidents 
of the French National Assembly, in the Great Hall of the People. 
  Balladur arrived in Beijing this morning at the invitation 
of 
Li Peng to begin a four-day official visit to China.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur gave assurances Thursday his government would 
not "interfere" in China's internal affairs, including the human 
rights issue, a Chinese official said. "France has no intention 
to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and 
France is willing to discuss the issues with other countries on 
an equal footing," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin 
quoted Balladur as telling Premier Li Peng in a meeting 
Thursday. Wu said the comment came as the two sides discussed 
the issue of human rights, with Li briefing Balladur on U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit. "It is 
obvious that China and France have different views on the human 
rights issue. We also noted that the French side will not 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said Wu. 
  The spokesman said the French leader did not bring up the 
recent arrest of China's leading dissident Wei Jingsheng during 
the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur gave assurances Thursday [7 April] his 
government would not "interfere" in China's internal affairs, 
including the human rights issue, a Chinese official said. 
  "France has no intention to interfere in the internal 
affairs 
of other countries and France is willing to discuss the issues 
with other countries on an equal footing," Chinese foreign 
ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Balladur as telling Premier 
Li Peng Thursday. Wu said the comment came as the two leaders 
discussed the issue of human rights during talks between their 
delegations. 
  "It is obvious that China and France have different views on 
the human rights issue. We also noted that the French side will 
not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said 
Wu. 
  The spokesman said Balladur, on the first official visit 
here 
by a French premier in 16 years, did not bring up the arrest 
last week of China's leading dissident Wei Jingsheng. 
  Balladur spokesman Bernard Brigouleix said later that during 
the meeting the French prime minister had recalled that France 
"has a traditional interest in human rights everywhere in the 
world." 
  Brigouleix also said Li had agreed to Balladur's suggestion 
of a private meeting, together with their foreign ministers, 
after the working-level talks to discuss human rights including 
the issue of Tibet, but gave no details. 
  The two premiers also discussed the development of bilateral 
ties following the January normalisation of relations, which 
turned frosty in 1992 over the previous French administration's 
sale of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to China's rival Taiwan. 
  That contract, worth several billion dollars, resulted in 
the 
closure of the French consulate in the southern city of 
Guangzhou in January 1993 and the exclusion of French companies 
from bidding for lucrative Chinese contracts. The Chinese have 
agreed to reopen the consulate, Brigouleix said, although no 
firm date has yet been set. 
  Wu did not confirm the reopening, but quoted Li as 
expressing 
China's "appreciation" for the "great efforts" of Balladur's 
administration to improve ties. 
  On the economic front, the Chinese premier said French 
companies had "their advantages" in the fields of transport, 
energy and telecommunications, all of which were priority 
development areas. 
  But he added that they must do more if they wish to compete 
in the "fierce" Chinese market. "French enterprises are quite 
competitive in certain areas, but also lack competitiveness in 
comparison with other countries," Wu quoted Li as saying. 
  The spokesman announced that French Minister of Industry, 
External Trade and Telecommunications Gerard Longuet would soon 
lead a business delegation to China. Wu also said Beijing would 
give "positive consideration" to requests from Paris for China 
to buy French wheat. 
  The two premiers also discussed the North Korean nuclear 
crisis, with Balladur calling for China to exert its influence 
over its Stalinist ally to open its nuclear facilities to 
international inspection. 
  Li responded by reiterating Beijing's stand that "China has 
only a limited role to play" and urging a resolution through 
dialogue between the parties directly involved. The foreign 
ministry spokesman described the atmosphere of the talks as 
"very good," saying the two premiers had pledged to keep up the 
momentum of high-level exchanges. 
  However, Wu was unable to announce that Balladur had 
extended 
an invitation to Li for a reciprocal visit -- in a conspicuous 
departure from usual protocol. 
  Balladur, whose four-day visit coincides with the 30th 
anniversary of diplomatic ties between France and China, is 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Longuet. 
  He is to meet Friday with President Jiang Zemin, before 
leaving for Shanghai Saturday.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Fresh Start for Deals With French"] </F>
  [Text] The arrival of French Premier Edouard Balladur will 
push Sino-French business relations into a new era, a senior 
Chinese trade official predicted yesterday. 
  The French premier flies into Beijing for a four-day visit 
today and is the most senior French politician to visit China 
since 1989. 
  "China expects Balladur's visit to help push the development 
of the two nations trade and economic cooperation," said Tong 
Jiemin, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). 
  The Chinese Government always attaches high importance to 
its 
business relations with France, a major economic power with high 
technology, said Tong, who is responsible for European affairs. 
  "We're willing to restore the good economic relations with 
France that we had before 1989 and we hope the economic 
co-operation and trade which has already started between the two 
nations will develop for a long period," he added. 
  Sino-French relations deteriorated in 1992 when the French 
government approved the sale of weapons to Taiwan, one of 
China's provinces. 
  Tong said China welcomes French enterprises to join the 
competition for the lucrative Chinese market with other foreign 
firms. 
  China is expected to import at least $1,000 billion between 
now and the year 2000. 
  And Sino-French economic co-operation has a good foundation, 
especially in energy, transport, telecommunications, chemicals, 
agriculture and raw materials. 
  "We hope France will continue its exploitation of business 
possibilities in these sectors as other developed countries have 
done," said Tong. 
  He promised the Chinese Government will help small and 
medium- sized enterprises in France to cooperate with their 
Chinese counterparts. 
  China has 410,000 small enterprises, many of them operating 
in rural areas, and they have become a major force in the 
economy. 
  Many small Chinese firms are looking for foreign partners to 
start joint ventures to open domestic and foreign markets. 
  Bilateral trade between France and China rose 30 percent to 
nearly $3 billion last year. 
  China's imports of French goods rose 10 percent to $1.64 
billion and its exports rose 60 percent to $1.29 billion. 
  Many French companies have pumped money into co-operative 
projects with Chinese firms as the two nations have begun to 
trade more. 
  By the end of last year, French companies had invested $889 
million in 549 projects in China. Most of the projects are 
located in coastal areas. 
  Guangzhou Peugeot, a joint venture making cars in Guangdong 
Province, is one of the largest foreign-invested enterprises in 
China. It is also the third largest foreign-invested car 
producer in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse this morning. 
The French foreign minister is accompanying Premier Balladur on 
a visit to China. 
  Qian Qichen said the two prime ministers held very good 
talks 
yesterday and had reached an extensive agreement on many issues. 
Juppe said the two prime ministers held very positive and 
constructive talks, adding the French side was satisfied with 
the results. 
  In a friendly atmosphere the two foreign ministers exchanged 
views on bilateral relations and on some international and 
regional issues. 
  Touching on the Cambodian issue, Qian Qichen said that China 
and France have cooperated very well on the question of Cambodia 
and both have made contributions to the settlement of the issue. 
He said: The United Nations' actions were successful in 
Cambodia where a new government has been formed. China has 
consistently supported King Sihanouk as the leader of Cambodia 
and will continue to do so. The Cambodian issue has now been 
settled as an international issue, therefore the domestic issues 
are internal affairs of Cambodia and those issues should be 
settled by the Cambodian people themselves. 
  Juppe indicated he shared Qian's view. He said France and 
China have cooperated very well on the Cambodian issue, 
expressing the hope that such cooperation should continue. 
  Briefing Qian on the latest development in the Bosnia and 
Herzegovina region, Juppe said a new situation has emerged in 
Sarajevo where the residents have begun to live a normal life. 
However, there is still a long way to go before the final 
settlement of the problems, and an overall view is needed by all 
the parties concerned. 
  Qian Qichen said he hoped that the efforts for a settlement 
of the Bosnia and Herzegovina question make new progress through 
negotiations. 
  At the request of the guest, Qian briefed Juppe on China's 
position on the question of Hong Kong.

  [Text] Paris, April 7 (XINHUA) -- France's Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe has emphasized that his visit to China with Prime 
Minister Eduard Balladur is to mainly restore political 
relations which had deteriorated between the two countries. 
  On the eve of Balladur's first official trip to China, and 
in 
an interview published here today by LE LIBERATION, Juppe said 
worsened Sino-French relations caused by France's sale of Mirage 
fighters to Taiwan should be past history. 
  He stressed that France cannot continue discord with China, 
citing economic, political, strategic and population factors, 
and he suggested that there is no great difference between their 
two foreign policies. 
  Replying to criticism that the four day visit will not bring 
a flood of new deals, Juppe said that there is no reason why 
France should not develop relations with a country as big as 
China but explained that, in his view, this was not a commercial 
trip. 
  "It is to restore political relations." he said. "Reentering 
into China's markets requires much work and needs time."

Diepgen here this afternoon. 
  During the meeting Qiao congratulated Berlin and Beijing on 
cementing friendly-city ties. 
  Berlin left him with a deep and beautiful impression, Qiao 
said, when recalling his visit to Berlin in January. 
  Qiao noted that there will be more exchanges and cooperation

  Diepgen said that his current tour in Beijing has improved 
mutual understanding. 
  With the German-Chinese relations going on the right track, 
he said, new developments will be witnessed between Berlin and

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will establish 
more vegetable farms and adopt a series of other measures to 
keep prices of staple foods down, a senior municipal official 
said. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, told deputies attending the 
second session of the 8th Municipal Political Consultative 
Conference here that the municipal government has begun to sell 
grain and cooking oil reserves to its citizens as a way to lower 
prices. 
  The cost of daily necessities has been growing rapidly in 
recent months in the Chinese capital. 
  Last year's retail prices rose by 16.9 percent in the city 
and many members at the conference have shown concern whether 
the city can achieve the target to keep the price rise under 10 
percent this year. This target was announced by China's Premier 
Li Peng in his government work report to the recent National 
People's Congress session. 
  Zhang Liyuan, a professor at Beijing University, proposed at 
the city's on-going session that Beijing should supervise the 
prices of daily necessities item by item. 
  Prices should be checked daily, individually, on such daily 
necessities as grain, cooking oil, meat, vegetables, eggs and 
milk. Citizens should be given price check results regularly, 
according to the professor. 
  The mayor said that Beijing is to increase its investment in 
vegetable farms and adopt a series of other measures to ensure a 
booming market supply and to slow down price growth.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- A "two rims" 
strategy for economic development is paying off for north 
China's Hebei Province, according to Provincial Governor Ye 
Liansong. 
  The two rims -- one around Beijing and Tianjin, north 
China's 
two biggest cities, the other around Bohai Bay, with a coastline 
of more than 400 kilometers -- are the backbone of the 
provincial economy, the governor said. 
  About 32 cities and counties in the province, with a 
population of 18 million, are located in the area of the Bohai 
Bay Ring, including big and medium-sized cities such as 
Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Changzhou and Shijiazhuang. 
  Nearly 300 state-owned enterprises of the province have been 
set up in this area, accounting for 43 percent of its total. 
  This year is vital in putting into practice the program 
drawn 
up last year by the provincial government for further opening up 
and development of the ring area, the official said. 
  In contrast, the governor said that the great influence of 
the booming urban economic development was felt by most of the 
province's counties and towns around the Beijing-Tianjin rim. 
  With the help of the two big cities, rural residents nearby 
are likely to become better off much faster than those in other 
areas, he predicted. 
  He said that the province had 52 villages whose total 
production output of industry and agriculture topped 100 million 
yuan, and the majority of them are situated around the ring. 
  He added that the production growth rate of the areas around 
the two rims is also two to three percentage points higher than 
the province's average. 
  Last year, the provincial gross domestic production value 
was 
increased by 16.5 percent, and that of the economic rims 
accounted for 40 percent of the total. 
  The governor said that 1994 is witnessing a shift to an 
export- oriented economy in the Bohai Bay rim, attracting more 
foreign investment to quicken the pace of development zone 
construction. 
  According to the official, the province has planned to set 
aside tracts of land totalling 20 square kilometers for a new 
development zone for overseas investors. 
  The planned area is rich in natural resources such as 
minerals, and has a favorable climate. 
  Currently, the province has set up more than 1,000 joint 
ventures, over 80 percent of which center around the rim area. 
  Also built in the area were one major farm and sideline 
production center and a key base for aquatic products and sea 
salt, both the biggest of their sort in north China. 
  In addition, the area is strong in development of steel, 
coal, building materials and petrochemical industries, with its 
rich natural resources. So far more than 40 minerals have been 
found in the area. 
  More convenient and efficient traffic and transport networks 
have also helped to boost the economic growth around the two 
rims. Apart from a number of main railways, there are over 
3,000 kilometers of highways and newly-built expressways. 
  Around Bohai Bay lie north China's three big ports: Tianjin, 
Dalian (in Liaoning Province) and Qinhuangdao (in Hebei 
Province). The annual cargo throughput of Qinhuangdao Port is 
close to 100 million tons, next in volume to Shanghai Port. 
  According to the governor, this year will witness a rapid 
expansion of the effects of the Bohai economic rim to a wider 
area of over 39,000 square kilometers. 
  He concluded that the provincial government has decided to 
build more joint ventures in this area. Local enterprises with 
educated workforce and good economic returns will be chosen to 
team up with foreign counterparts.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The trade volume 
of the rural and urban trade centers in north China's Hebei 
Province topped 32.1 billion yuan in 1993 with a hefty 52.1 
percent rise from the year before, equaling 54 percent of its 
total retail sale, according to a top official. 
  Developed from roadside markets and village fairs as early 
as 
the 1980s, the official said, the rural and urban farm products 
markets have played a vital part in promoting commodity trading 
across the province and the country over the past few years. 
  He attributed 1993's surge in trade fairs and farm-products 
markets to an increasing investment in market building by the 
local government. 
  He said that the investment in market construction in 1992 
jumped to over one billion yuan, more than double that of a 
four-year period from 1988 to 1991. And at least 130 million 
yuan was added in 1993 to the previous year's total. 
  Over the past two years, nearly 800 such new trade centers 
and markets have been built or rebuilt in the province, ranging 
from open markets to modern high-rise business centers to 
multi-function luxury hotels. 
  A medicine trade center, called oriental, covering an area 
of 
12 hectares with an investment of 140 million yuan, is expected 
to go into operation soon. Within the center, about 500 
business buildings and a luxury hotel funded by a Hong Kong 
investor have been built. 
  By the end of 1993, the number of various kinds of special 
markets reached 641, with a trade volume totalling 17.95 billion 
yuan, accounting for 57.7 percent of the amount for all trade 
centers. 
  In Yongnian County, one vegetable trading center is able to 
handle 500 million kilograms of vegetables yearly, which are 
sold to more than 50 cities in 19 provinces and regions 
throughout the country, and partly to Japan and other Southeast 
Asian countries. 
  The Lixian County Fur Center has a daily trading capacity of 
200,000 fur pelts worth nearly 10 million yuan. 
  In mid-March, a three-day national stock products trading 
fair was held in Lixian County, with a transaction volume of 
1.08 billion yuan. 
  More than 4,000 businessmen around the country and over 60 
overseas tradesmen from eight countries and regions throughout 
the world, including the United States, Japan and Hong Kong, 
attended the fair.

  [Text] Taipei, April 8 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou Thursday [7 April] criticized a U.S. State Department 
report on Taiwan's alleged role in international drug smuggling 
and said the Justice Ministry will ask the State Department to 
clarify the allegations. 
  Ma said conclusions about Taiwan found in the summary of the 
1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ran counter 
to details in the report's appendices. 
  The summary depicted Taiwan as a market and transshipment 
point for Southeast Asian heroin and a safe haven for drug 
fugitives. Taiwan was also said to be producing illicit 
amphetamines and increasingly playing a role in money laundering. 
  In the appendices, however, Taiwan is not listed as a major 
drug producing, manufacturing trafficking or money laundering 
nation, contrary to some foreign wire reports, he said. 
  Ma criticized the report's conclusion that Taiwan is a safe 
haven for drug fugitives. He blamed this misunderstanding on 
the lack of an extradition agreement between the U.S. and 
Taiwan. The problem can be easily resolved by signing an 
extradition treaty, he said. 
  Ma added that the Justice Ministry will see to it that a law 
to prevent money laundering is enacted as soon as possible to 
put an end to the crime in Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau Director 
Wu Tung-ming denied reports that Taiwan is a major drug 
producing and trafficking country. 
  Wu explained that Taiwan is actively cracking down on 
illicit 
drug trade and abuse, has implemented laws and regulations to 
control drug-related crime, and is stepping up international 
drug smuggling information exchanges.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan on 
Thursday [7 April] harshly denounced the Beijing regime for its 
handling of the incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed 
on board a cruise boat in the central China province of Zhejiang 
last Thursday. 
  "We felt shock upon learning the news (about the incident) 
on 
April 2," Lien said. "Since then, we've asked relevant 
government agencies, through the Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF), to get help from the Mainland authorities." 
  All efforts by Taiwan to get information concerning the 
incident have been met with no response by Beijing, and every 
reasonable demand has been categorically rejected, Lien said 
after hearing a report by Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the 
Mainland Affairs Council. 
  "The treatment of the incident by the Chinese communists," 
Lien stressed, "is an indication of the Beijing regime's nature 
-- its ignorance of basic human rights and its acting with utter 
disregard for human life." 
  Lien's condemnation was the harshest ever by a ranking 
government official on the mysterious deaths. The 24 Taiwan 
travelers, along with six Mainland crew members and two guides, 
were burned to death inside the lower cabin of the cruise ship 
that was ferrying them across Qiandao lake last Thursday. Many 
commentators here suspect the victims were set afire by robbers 
who first pillaged the boat. 
  As of now, little has been revealed about the incident due 
to 
Beijing's censorship. Relatives of the victims, as well as 
reporters, were denied access to the boat and the bodies, and 
the relatives were forced to accept Beijing demand that all the 
bodies be cremated in Mainland China. 
  "We can hardly imagine how a government could handle such a 
big incident in such a dumb way," Lien said. "Should the issue 
not be fairly and reasonably handled and the truth not unfold, 
it would definitely have a severe impact on private exchanges 
across the Taiwan Strait." 
  Lien also ordered the formation of a special task force to 
investigate the incident, to be led by Vice Premier Hsu Li-the. 
  Pressure also continued to mount at the Legislative Yuan, 
with legislators demanding that the government halt the 
scheduled fifth round of talks between the SEF and the 
Mainland's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait 
until Beijing opens up about the case. 
  Meanwhile, relatives of the 24 victims plan to hold a press 
conference upon their arrival at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport on 
Saturday. 
  The relatives, who departed for the Mainland last Sunday, 
were detained at a hotel by security officials following the 
breakdown of negotiations between the relatives and Mainland 
officials over how the victims' bodies would be handled.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- The disaster in which 24 
Taiwan tourists were killed last Thursday [7 April] on Lake 
Qiandao (Thousand Island Lake) in Mainland China's Zhejiang 
Province is only the tip of the iceberg as far as travel 
problems in Mainland China go, according to the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs. 
  In a report released Wednesday, the ministry said overseas 
tourists registered more complaints about travel in Mainland 
China than about travel in any other place except Southeast Asia 
as a whole. Taiwan tourists, it said, made more complaints 
about mainland travel than tourists from any other country. 
  Although the tourism industry in Mainland China experienced 
a 
sharp decline in the wake of the Tiananman Square massacre in 
1989, the number of foreign visitors and revenue from tourism in 
Mainland China began to rise again in 1990, the report indicates. 
  In 1992, as many as 37 million foreign tourists visited 
Mainland China -- an 11 percent increase in visits by foreign 
travelers over 1991 -- and tourist industry revenue jumped by an 
astounding 265 percent to US$3.6 billion. The number of visits 
made by Taiwan tourists in 1992 also increased by 251 percent to 
1.5 million, and further increased to 1.97 million last year, 
the ministry said. 
  However, tourist disputes with foreign visitors also 
increased during the same period because of the backward 
conditions on the mainland. 
  If such problems as poor social order, and insufficient 
transportation infrastructure, extra charges and price hikes 
heaped on tourists, and shoddy service from ill-mannered 
personnel cannot be rectified, the report said, Mainland China 
will undoubtedly fall short of its expectation to clear US$10 
billion in tourism revenue by 2000. 
  The Qiandao Lake disaster and several traffic accidents 
involving Taiwan tourists on the mainland in the first four 
months of the year point to the grave risk foreigners face in 
traveling in Mainland China, the report said. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications, 
the Tourism Bureau, and the Taipei Association on of Travel 
Agents all issued strongly-worded statements asking mainland 
authorities to take concrete measures to guarantee the life and 
security of Taiwan travelers there, and called on local visitors 
to suspend travel to the mainland until mainland authorities 
respond to the request.

  [Text] Taipei, April 8 (CNA) -- The National Press Council 
of the Republic of China [ROC] Friday [8 April] pleaded for 
world attention to Mainland China's callous handling of a recent 
travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. 
  The council also asked two major world press organizations 
-- 
the International Press Institute and the Freedom Forum -- to 
join Taiwan in condemning Beijing's human rights violations. 
  The council said in its letters to the two organizations 
that 
Chinese communist authorities have continued to withhold 
information on the cause of the disaster and refused to give 
Taiwan reporters access to the incident site. 
  The 24 Taiwan tourists, along with six mainland crew members 
and two guides, were burned to death inside the lower cabin of a 
cruise ship that was ferrying them across Qiandao (Thousand 
Island) Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31. 
  "While the victims' relatives are depressed and anxious to 
know the truth about the disaster, mainland authorities have 
blacked out news coverage of the accident," the council said. 
  It added that mainland authorities have even performed 
autopsies on the bodies without consulting relatives of the 
victims, and restricted the movement of the grieving relatives 
who rushed to the mainland after the disaster. 
  Moreover, mainland officials have barred the relatives from 
taking photographs of the victims' bodies as well as barred 
Taiwan reporters from visiting the shed where the boat is being 
kept. 
  A TV reporter from Taiwan was even temporarily detained and 
other TV reporters have reportedly been harassed over their news 
coverage. 
  "The rights of free access to news and the public's right to 
know have been disregarded by mainland authorities," the council 
said. "Mainland officials' inhumanity in handling the disaster 
and flagrant violation of press freedom should be condemned by 
the international community," it added. 
  In its letters, the council also condemned Beijing for 
sentencing Xi Yang, a Chinese reporter for the Hong Kong 
newspaper MING PAO, to 12 years in jail on charges of stealing 
state financial secrets. 
  The council said Xi's conviction cannot be deemed a judicial 
judgment since Beijing authorities have so far not given 
evidence to prove Xi had been doing anything apart from normal 
news gathering. Xi was detained on Sept. 27, 1993 and formally 
arrested 10 days later. He faced a secret trial and has been 
denied contact with his family and friends since his detention. 
  "The conviction is a flagrant violation of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which Mainland China has signed," 
the council noted.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, will leave Saturday 
[9 April] for a ministerial-level meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled to open in 
Marrakech, Morocco April 15. 
  As a GATT observer, Taiwan has been invited to attend the 
meeting, during which the 118 contracting parties will sign the 
agreement reached during the Uruguay Round talks in 
mid-December, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said. 
  The GATT meeting will also make a final decision on the 
exact 
time for the establishment of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), they pointed out. 
  Under the Uruguay Round accord, all GATT signatories are set 
to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher 
enforcement powers to supersede GATT. 
  During the GATT meeting, the officials noted, Chiang will 
hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from New Zealand, 
Canada, Australia, and the United States on problems involving 
Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade regulating 
body. 
  Taiwan, accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes 
to become a full member by the end of this year. 
  Meanwhile, the 17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Forum ministers will hold an informal session during their stay 
in Morocco, the officials noted. 
  APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Mainland China, Hong 
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, 
Thailand, and the United States. 
  Chiang will proceed to Egypt for a three-day visit after the 
GATT meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui said 
Thursday [7 April] he is optimistic about the economic prospects 
of Southeast Asia and Taiwan's role within the region. 
  "Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing areas and is 
attracting ever-increasing attention from other parts of the 
world," Li said while meeting with a group of foreign bank 
executives here to attend the 29th Conference of Governors of 
Southeast Asian Central Banks (SEACEN). 
  Li said Southeast Asian countries have become less reliant 
on 
markets outside the region while intraregional trade and 
investment has risen steadily since 1990. "I believe this trend 
will continue in the years ahead," he noted. 
  In line with the trend, Li said, Taiwan has adjusted its 
overseas investment strategy and has encouraged entrepreneurs to 
increase investment in Southeast Asian nations. 
  Li said he exchanged views on promoting bilateral economic 
cooperation and regional economic development with leaders from 
the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand during his February trip 
to those countries. "We'll continue to strive for closer 
economic ties with countries in the region," Li added. 
  Those present at the meeting included Lord Kingsdown, former 
governor of the Bank of England, Dr. J.E. Esmael, executive 
director of the International Monetary Fund, and central bank 
governors from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the 
Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar 
[Burma], Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the host Republic of China 
[ROC]. 
  The SEACEN meeting opened Wednesday and will close Friday. A 
joint statement will be issued at the end of the meeting 
reaffirming member states' commitment to gradually liberalizing 
their financial markets and promoting regional economic and 
financial cooperation.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Nigeria signed 
an agreement on promotion and protection of investments Thursday 
[7 April], Taiwan's first such accord with an African nation. 
  The two countries also signed an agreement on cooperation in 
export processing zone development. 
  The two agreements were signed here by P.K. Chiang and 
Nigerian Trade and Commerce Minister Melford Okilo on behalf of 
their respective governments. 
  Okilo, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a trade promotion 
tour, said Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in Nigeria. 
  "Nigeria spans a large area and has a huge population and 
rich natural resources," Okilo said. "We welcome foreign 
investment to help boost our economic development." 
  Chiang said Nigeria is an important country in West Africa. 
"It is also a promising market worthy of exploration by our 
businessmen," he noted. 
  Chiang said Taiwan will help the oil-rich African country 
develop an export processing zone (EPZ) in Calabar, a port city 
in southeastern Nigeria. 
  Nigeria has sent personnel to Taiwan to study EPZ 
administration and other related expertise during the past two 
years. 
  Chiang said Taiwan will use its international economic 
cooperation development fund to offer practical training for 
more Nigerian administrators and professionals following the 
signing of the EPZ cooperative agreement. 
  Taiwan does not maintain an embassy in Nigeria, but has a 
representative office in Nigeria's largest city of Lagos and a 
consulate-general in Calabar. 
  Taiwan exported U.S.$140 million worth of goods to Nigeria 
in 
1993, but no official records of imports from that country was 
available. 
  In addition to Nigeria, Taiwan has signed similar investment 
protection agreements with 11 other countries -- Argentina, 
Indonesia, Latvia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, the 
Philippines, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Jeffrey Ku, chairman of 
the Taipei-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank, was granted an 
audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito Wednesday [6 April]. 
  "I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his 
Tokyo palace," Ku said Thursday upon his return from a five-day 
visit to Japan. 
  Ku, also an unpaid advisor to Taiwan's Executive Yuan, 
stressed that his visit to Japan was private. 
  Ku said Emperor Akihito expressed his goodwill and regard 
for 
Taiwan. "Akihito was interested in Taiwan's current 
developments," he noted. 
  Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on Taiwan's economic 
strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development. 
  "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on Asia of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the prospects for 
the formation of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus and the 
Asian Free Trade Agreement," Ku said. 
  Ku was the first Taiwan businessman granted a formal 
audience 
with Akihito since the emperor took the throne in October 1989. 
Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct]. 
  Political observers said Jeffrey Ku's meeting with Akihito 
would boost the development of substantive ties between Taiwan 
and Japan, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual 
leader and wields no political power. 
  Japan recognizes Beijing and has been reluctant to develop 
any official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending communist 
Chinese leaders. 
  Many countries, including the United States, France and 
Germany, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan, 
but Japan has not followed suit.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 7 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan Salt 
Works has entered into a joint venture with an Indonesian 
company to produce refined salt, Taisalt Vice President Wang 
Chih-han said here Thursday [7 April]. 
  Wang, currently in Indonesia as part of a state enterprises 
delegation, signed a memorandum of understanding for the venture 
with his Indonesian counterpart Muchji Rusnosuprapto at the 
Grand Hyatt Jakarta Thursday. 
  On hand to witness the signing ceremony were Taiwan 
delegation leader Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and 
Vice Chairman Yeh Man-sheng of the Economics Ministry's 
Commission of National Corporations. 
  The plan calls for construction of seven refined salt 
plants. 
The first such plant will cost around US$15.15 million with 
Taiwan's technology investment not exceeding US$7.2 million. 
  Estimated annual production of the first salt plant will be 
60,000 metric tons, Wang said. He added that six more plants 
will be needed to meet Indonesia's annual salt demand of 
500,000-600,000 metric tons. 
  Refined salt, which costs less in Taiwan but is cheaper to 
produce in Indonesia, is in great demand in the Southeast Asian 
country. 
  Some 30 million Indonesians suffer from thyroid diseases due 
to a lack of refined salt, Yeh said. Increased foreign capital 
and technical assistance is needed to boost salt production 
here, he added. 
  The Taiwan delegation arrived in Jakarta April 1 and will 
return to Taipei April 9.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhu Yucheng Stresses That No Department or </F>
Individual Is Allowed to Interfere in China's Judicial 
Independence"] 
  [Text] Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch emphasized yesterday that "Xi Yang's violation of 
the law is a personal act and is unrelated to normal news 
coverage by Hong Kong reporters on the mainland or to freedom of 
the press at all." 
  Zhu Yucheng said: "I mentioned three points to the gentlemen 
from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong 
yesterday: First, Xi Yang stole state secrets and violated 
China's state security laws. It is completely within the scope 
of China's sovereignty that judicial authorities try him in 
accordance with laws of criminal procedure. Second, the Xi Yang 
case involves state secrets, so no public trial was conducted in 
accordance with laws of criminal procedure. This is a 
characteristic not only of China's law, but also of the laws of 
various countries around the world. Therefore, it was legal to 
conduct a trial in camera. Third, Xi Yang's violation of laws 
was a personal act. The fact that he stole state secrets is 
incompatible with his status as a reporter. This is unrelated 
to freedom of the press or to normal news coverage by Hong Kong 
reporters on the mainland at all." 
  Zhu Yucheng also said that no unit or individual or 
government department is allowed to interfere in China's 
judicial independence. 
  Zhu Yucheng made the above remarks when attending the 1994 
Spring soiree held by the Association of Hong Kong Chinese 
Entrepreneurs at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center 
in Wanchai last night.

<F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>
  [Text] The China-backed TA KUNG PAO, usually known for its 
strict adherence to Beijing's official line, has shown a rare 
streak of independence in its coverage of the sentencing of the 
Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang on spying charges. Observers say TA 
KUNG PAO has provided more balanced coverage of Xi's case than 
Hong Kong's three other pro-Beijing dailies--WEN WEI PO, the NEW 
EVENING NEWS and HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY. 
  While Hong Kong media began carrying unconfirmed reports of 
Xi's sentence last Saturday, none of the pro-Beijing papers 
covered the case until after the Beijing People's Intermediate 
Court confirmed Xi's 12-year prison sentence on Monday. 
  TA KUNG PAO's prominently placed coverage on Tuesday 
included 
responses from Lu Ping, the director of China's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, moderate local political organisations and 
even the Hong Kong government. WEN WEI PO, considered to be 
more hardline than Hong Kong's other pro-Beijing dailies, 
carried just a brief 100-word report quoting Lu Ping downplaying 
the case's impact on the local press. 
  The discrepancy between the two papers' presentation of the 
case became more pronounced after more than 100 Hong Kong 
journalists petitioned the New China News Agency (XINHUA) to 
demonstrate their strong objection to Beijing's closed-door 
trial of Xi. TA KUNG PAO's lead story on Wednesday reported 
that pro-Beijing Hong Kong figures had expressed concern about 
the handling of Xi's case, as well as news about the petition 
presented by local journalists. Furthermore, the paper ran a 
rare editorial speaking up for the press. The editorial, 
entitled "It's Essential for the Public to See Justice", urged 
China to disclose information to show the public the verdict was 
judicially correct. "China has reiterated that Xi Yang's case 
has nothing to do with normal journalistic activities and will 
not affect the Hong Kong media in general," the editorial said. 
"The local press, however, still shows grave anxiety and 
speculation about the case because of the unclear situation." 
  The editorial, which appeared to break ranks with the rest 
of 
the Beijing-controlled press, is believed to have been written 
by Tsang Tak-shing who has served as chief editor of TA KUNG PAO 
since 1986. Tsang, who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the 
National People's Congress, told EASTERN EXPRESS he would demand 
disclosure of details of the case, saying that "justice should 
be seen to be done". But he was quick to add that he would 
accept it if Beijing could not disclose those details owing to 
considerations of legal procedure. 
  Analysts noted that Tsang's elder brother, Tsang Yok-shing, 
was among the six Hong Kong affairs advisers who paid a formal 
visit to XINHUA's Hong Kong office proposing that Beijing 
release details of Xi's verdict. Tsang Yok-shing is also 
chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong 
Kong, a pro-Beijing political body. 
  WEN WEI PO on Wednesday did not carry any reports on the 
case, publishing just two commentaries, under pseudonyms, 
criticising leaders of the United Democrats, Martin Lee and 
Szeto Wah, of using Xi's case to mislead the public. 
  Luo Fu, former editor of the NEW EVENING POST, said that 
despite the apparent differences in covering Xi's case, none of 
the pro- Beijing newspapers would dare to openly question 
Beijing's ruling. "There will not and could not be any basic 
difference among Beijing- backed newspapers, though their news 
coverage may appear to vary on the surface," said Luo. He has 
served a 10-year prison sentence in China after being found 
guilty of spying offences allegedly committed in a closed trial.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] Top executives of the Ming Pao newspaper will 
tonight begin a 72-hour hunger strike outside Xinhua's offices 
as part of last-ditch efforts to persuade Beijing to free their 
jailed reporter Xi Yang. 
  Exasperated by the harsh 12-year sentence handed to Xi on 
charges of "spying and stealing state secrets", the newspaper 
was considering seeking the Hong Kong Government's assistance in 
pressuring Chinese authorities. 
  Separately, local politicians and Beijing's key advisers in 
Hong Kong have stepped up their pleas for leniency towards Xi, 
38, as well as pressing for a detailed account of the verdict in 
his case. 
  The Legislative Council [Legco] will hold an emergency 
meeting tomorrow afternoon to gauge the impact of the case on 
the territory, particularly the press. 
  Representatives of five major newspapers and journalists' 
bodies will take part. 
  Yesterday morning, top editorial executives of Ming Pao led 
about 50 staff in a march on the Xinhua (New China News Agency) 
office protesting against Xi's sentence. 
  Three senior executives -- C.C. Tung, chief editor, Cheung 
Kin- bor, executive chief editor, and Simon Fung Shing-cheung, 
deputy executive chief editor -- will kick off the 72-hour 
hunger strike tonight. 
  Staff members will stage a sit-in every Saturday for the 
next 
two months. 
  Five Hong Kong members of the New York-based Chinese 
Liberal- 
Democratic Party have already started a 48-hour hunger strike in 
support of Xi. 
  Mr Cheung, who led the Ming Pao rally, refused to admit the 
newspaper had adopted the wrong approach in the past. 
  "In the past, we thought it was only a matter between Ming 
Pao employers and the Chinese Government. 
  "We didn't want to see the issue being politicised in the 
tense atmosphere of the Sino-British row," said Mr Cheung. 
  "But now the 12-year sentence has told us the method we 
tried 
in the past was useless." 
  Speaking at the Legco policy panel meeting, chairman and 
former journalist Emily Lau Wai-hing expressed concern over the 
possible dangers of reporting in China. 
  "We would like to know how the journalists have been 
affected 
and how the media employers are going to protect their 
reporters," she said. 
  "The incident has already alarmed the whole industry, 
society 
and even Hong Kong people to a very large extent," Daisy Li 
Yuet-wah, the chairman of Hong Kong Journalists' Association 
(HKJA), said at the Legco meeting. 
  The HKJA has asked for a meeting with Xinhua director Zhou 
Nan to convey the journalists' concern about Xi's fate. 
  It has also written a letter to all local deputies of the 
National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference to call for their help in pressing for a 
fuller account of Xi's case from Beijing. 
  But a vice-director of Xinhua, Zhu Yucheng, rejected 
suggestions made by a group of six Hong Kong Affairs Advisers 
that Xi might have violated China's law by mistake. 
  Xi should have known beforehand that he had infringed the 
Chinese law of "stealing state secrets", Mr Zhu was quoted by 
Tsang Yok-sing as saying. 
  The Xinhua official however, admitted that he had little 
knowledge of the case. 
  Mr Zhu insisted that Xi's case was an individual one which 
should not be related to normal news-gathering in China, and 
would thus not affect Hong Kong reporters working there. 
  Another Hong Kong Affairs Adviser, Ng Hongmun, said he had 
started drafting a letter to the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
to get hold of the facts of Xi's case. 
  "I will also ask the procuratorate to supervise the court 
proceedings of Xi's appeal because they have this right under 
the law," said Mr Ng, also a local NPC delegate. 
  Another Adviser, Mr Vincent Lo Hong-sui, who led a 
delegation 
of the Business and Professional Federation to visit Beijing 
yesterday, said he would try to find out more on Xi's conviction 
when meeting officials there. 
  He told reporters at Kai Tak the sentence handed down on Xi 
"looked very severe". 
  The United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) said they would ask 
all legislators to jointly sign a letter to ask the Chinese 
Government to immediately release Xi. 
  The party would also hold an eight-hour sit-in outside 
Xinhua 
headquarters on Saturday. 
  Party chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming said they had been 
advised 
earlier by Ming Pao to adopt a low profile. 
  "Unfortunately, this results in a 12-year imprisonment," he 
said. 
  He said the UDHK would make a strong protest to the Chinese 
Government as the trial posed a threat to Hong Kong press 
freedom. 
  "The law is vague and the offence is never made known. 
  "We don't even know when exactly the trial took place," he 
said Mr Lee added that the material released by Xi was not 
considered to be a sensitive state secret. 
  "Anyone in a similar position would have done the same 
thing," he said. 
  "And any publisher would have taken that as a scoop and 
would 
have been very happy to publish it." 
  In a letter to Chinese Minister of Justice, Xiao Yang, the 
Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists strongly 
protested against Xi's sentence and demanded it be reviewed.

<F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday appeared to back away from its 
insistence that all Hong Kong civil servants indicate whether 
they will stay or leave the service after 1997. 
  A top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, 
yesterday said that only those civil servants who were unwilling 
to serve beyond the changeover should inform the future 
government. 
  However, Mr Lu did not say how or when such a declaration 
must be made. 
  Mainland co-convenor of the political sub-group of the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), Professor Xiao Weiyun, had 
said that all civil servants should make a statement before 1997 
declaring whether they wanted to continue in the SAR [Special 
Administrative Region] government. 
  The statement attracted immediate criticism in that it 
amounted to a form of political vetting. 
  But Mr Lu told a delegation of teachers in Beijing that 
there 
was a "misunderstanding" over the PWC statement. 
  Mr Lu indicated that the idea stemmed from a recent survey 
that traced the brain-drain in the civil service, according to 
Yeung Yiu- chung, president of the federation of education 
workers, after their meeting with Mr Lu. 
  A City Polytechnic survey conducted between March and 
November last year found that 35 percent of civil servants were 
considering resigning because of the change of sovereignty, 
while 37 percent were pessimistic about their careers. 
  It also disclosed that up to 77 percent were holders of a 
foreign passport -- a condition that would render them 
ineligible for top positions in the 19,000-strong team after 
1997. 
  Mr Yeung quoted Mr Lu as saying that if the survey results 
were to happen, the loss would damage the efficiency of the SAR 
government. 
  The director said that informing a future boss of one's 
departure was normal practice. Mr Lu said he hoped that only a 
few civil servants would be leaving in the years to come. 
  During the meeting, Mr Lu also touched on whether the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office would continue after the handover. 
  He said he believed liaison between the mainland's 
provincial 
and district-level authorities and Hong Kong should be 
strengthened after 1997. 
  But its political department might be dissolved or merged 
with other departments, since its main concern -- new airport 
affairs -- would be a matter for the SAR government.

  [Text] A long-time friend of outspoken United Democrat 
legislator Lau Chin-shek was attacked and beaten on his way to 
Mr Lau's Wong Tai Sin office yesterday. 
  Tse Kwong-wang, 45, suffered head and eye injuries after he 
was punched by two men, both in their mid-20s, on a footbridge 
in Fung Tak Estate at about 1.45 pm. 
  Mr Tse said he did not know the attackers and had no idea 
why 
he was beaten. Robbery appears not to have been the motive 
because the men made no effort to take anything from him. 
  Police could not say whether the attack was politically 
motivated, but it was the second incident over the past two 
months involving Mr Lau. Two months ago ink was thrown over the 
door of the office. 
  Mr Tse, who is the United Democrats' Kowloon Central Branch 
head, mainly serves the Hunghom area, but has been helping Mr 
Lau in the afternoons for the past three months. 
  Mr Tse and Mr Lau, both labour activists at the Christian 
Industrial Committee, have known each other for 20 years. 
  Mr Tse was recommended by Mr Lau to join the United 
Democrats 
several years ago and has recently taken part in protests 
against increases in rates and bus fares. 
  "I am really puzzled. I do not think it is related to my 
community work," said Mr Tse, a part-time taxi driver. 
  "I keep quite a low profile and concentrate on improving 
people's livelihoods. I cannot think of any recent disputes at 
all. 
  "The men did not say a word. They suddenly approached me and 
punched me. Then they went away, without saying anything." 
  He said he would not be frightened off and would continue 
working for Mr Lau and the party. 
  Mr Lau last night said he was sorry bout the attack. 
  "I hope it is not something to do with his political 
background. People should voice their views peacefully," he said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Yu Cheng (6735 2052) ] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 29 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At its 
regular meeting to discuss interest rates last week, the Hong 
Kong Association of Banks suddenly raised the rate of interest 
on Hong Kong dollar deposits by a big margin. This clearly 
reduced the difference between interest rates on loans and 
deposits. It can thus be seen that public opinion is effective 
in supervising any commercial organization. The purpose of the 
major banks in their willingness to readjust greatly divergent 
interest rates is evidently to defend the interest rate 
agreement, which is to their advantage. 
  The United States has tightened short-term money supply on 
two occasions since the beginning of February, causing 
preferential interest rates for commercial banks to rise by 0.25 
percent. This has made it possible for Hong Kong to make 
corresponding readjustments. However, various categories of 
interest rates in Hong Kong have been slightly higher than those 
in the United States for a long period, and the new interest 
rates in the United states are still lower than in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, Hong Kong can either increase its interest rate by 
0.25 percent or maintain the existing interest rate structure. 
The move by the Hong Kong Association of Banks to suddenly 
raise the interest rate for Hong Kong dollar deposits by 0.5 to 
0.75 percent, while the major banks have raised their 
preferential rates by only 0.25 percent, is greatly different 
from the practice of many years. Evidently, this is a result of 
pressure from public opinion. 
  In the past few months, the debate in society on abolishing 
the interest rate agreement has become heated again, and demands 
for abolition have become stronger and stronger. Therefore, the 
banks have to be at combat readiness. This is because the 
existing interest rate agreement is the only thing that attracts 
the attention of the society. Once the monetary policy function 
of the agreement has faded away or been abolished, the image of 
the association in society would be even less noticeable and 
would attract less attention. On the other hand, since the 
major banks have a certain influence on the association and the 
interest rate agreement, they are less willing to have the 
agreement abolished. 
  Since public opinion says the banking sector takes advantage 
of the interest rate agreement to make considerable gains from 
the difference between interest rates on loans and deposits, and 
the recent increase in interest rates on deposits decided by the 
association was far greater than the movement in preferential 
interest rate for the commercial banks, people cannot but 
associate this move with the idea that the banking sector has 
made a concession to public opinion in society. 
  In recent years, the banking sector has made extraordinary 
gains during a period of low interest rates. The low cost of 
capital has set off the impact of an evident slow down in 
capital growth and has given support to the achievements of the 
banking sector. Therefore, the banking sector strongly wishes 
to defend the interest rate agreement. Before the readjustment 
of interest rates, the interest rate agreement of the Hong Kong 
Association of Banks fixed the interest rate for Hong Kong 
dollar deposits at 1.5 percent, but the best lending rate at the 
major banks was 6.5 percent. The difference between interest 
rates for loans and deposits was 5 percent. This meant the 
banks gained more than three and a half times the cost of 
capital. 
  As far as the present situation is concerned, although the 
Monetary Authority has new accounting arrangements and a 
regulatory mechanism for capital raising, and can effectively 
and appropriately operate at any time in the open market in the 
banking sector, the interest rate agreement has existed in Hong 
Kong for many years after all, and the major banks have insisted 
on maintaining the agreement and have made quite a big 
concession to public opinion; therefore, we can consider 
maintaining the agreement temporarily. However, society must 
carry out supervision so that the banks cannot take advantage of 
the agreement to reap staggering profits and that the legitimate 
rights and interests of consumers can be protected. 
  In addition to reaping staggering profits by taking 
advantage 
of the interest rate agreement and the great difference between 
interest rates on loans and deposits, some banking groups have 
frequently increased charges in recent years and have even asked 
for additional interest on loans under the pretext of so-called 
rising costs or as compensation for loan risks. All this is 
unfair to consumers. Banks are undoubtedly commercial 
organizations, but they undertake great responsibilities in 
society. Therefore, they should not collect charges at will and 
society should exercise close supervision over them.

  [Text] Kiev, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Sino-Ukrainian trade 
relations were boosted today when government delegations from 
the two countries met and signed two documents of cooperation 
here. 
  They involved regulations set up by the Sino-Ukrainian Joint 
Government Committee on Trade Cooperation and a summary of that 
committee's first meeting. They were signed by the two chairmen 
He Guangyuan, minister for China's machine-building industry, 
and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov. 
  The two sides exchanged views on the prospects of enlarging 
trade and technical cooperation between them and agreed that it 
is mutually complementary on an economic basis. 
  They also suggested that the trade, at present mostly on a 
barter basis, should take on a new format which involves a 
combination of barter, cash transactions and a means of settling 
accounts in a third country. 
  The two chairmen stressed that the joint committee has 
become 
a bridge for developing cooperation and decided that its second 
meeting will be held in Beijing next year. 
  The Chinese delegation, which arrived in Kiev Sunday [3 
April], will leave here for home Thursday.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China has readjusted 
the plan of launching its first "Fengyun 2" stationary 
meteorological satellite due to an accidental event. 
  The event took place while the satellite was tested in the 
technical zone, which damaged the satellite and the workshops on 
the testing site. 
  The satellite was originally planned to be launched by the 
"Long- March 3" carrier rocket in the Xichang Satellite 
Launching Center recently. 
  China is making great efforts to complete the follow-up work 
and ensure the full implementation of this year's launching plan.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- In view of the 
increasingly rampant crime of forging, reselling, and stealing 
invoices in certain localities; and the serious problem of 
certain lawless elements using counterfeited special invoices 
for value-added taxes [VAT] to evade taxes and swindle the 
government out of tax refunds, the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, Supreme People's Court, Ministry of Public 
Security, and State Administration of Taxation recently decided 
to launch a collective, nationwide campaign from April to June 
to crack down on crime. 
  Leading members of these four departments -- the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate, Supreme People's Court, Ministry of 
Public Security, and State Administration of Taxation -- 
gathered at a teleconference today to plan the crackdown. Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji attended the conference and gave important 
instructions. Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general 
of the State Council, addressed the meeting. 
  Luo Gan said: China's reform for building a socialist market 
economic system has now entered a critical period for pushing 
the entire project forward and achieving breakthroughs in key 
areas. The core of tax reform, which is one of the several major 
reform projects to be carried out this year, is to establish a 
system of indirect taxes based primarily on value-added taxes. 
Under this system, tax deductions are assessed according to the 
amounts of money noted in invoices. This is an internationally 
accepted norm. Working like a "chain," a special invoice for 
value-added tax connects all business processes -- from 
production to distribution, and from wholesale to retail. If 
problems occur in any one of the "chain's" links, it will break 
and cause tax losses. 
  Luo Gan pointed out: Recently, a trend has appeared in 
certain areas, namely: Certain lawless elements, who are 
blinded by greed, have forged invoices by illicit means, and 
made use of these invoices for criminal purposes, such as 
evading taxes, swindling tax refunds, smuggling goods, and 
selling smuggled goods. The crime of forging, reselling, and 
stealing special invoices for value-added taxes, in particular, 
will jeopardize the implementation of the new tax system as a 
whole. Thus, we must come down hard on all lawless conduct of 
forging invoices, especially forging, reselling, and stealing 
special invoices for value-added taxes. 
  Luo Gan said: All regions and departments must have a 
consensus of views, be more aware of the problem, provide 
stronger leadership over the crackdown, and work in close 
coordination with each other. This problem must be dealt with 
comprehensively and regularly. Governments at all levels must 
place the project high on their agendas. Each region and 
department must assign a leading cadre to take special charge of 
organizing and coordinating the crackdown. Principal leaders of 
public security, procuratorial, judicial, and taxation 
departments themselves must get involve in the crackdown, which 
must be meticulously organized and tightly supervised. Capable 
persons of public security, procuratorial, judicial, and 
taxation departments must be immediately assembled to play their 
part in a coordinated manner according to the collective plan. 
Firm actions must be taken to stop the criminal trend of 
forging, reselling, and stealing invoices. We must make sure 
anticipated results are achieved so that a good environment 
favorable for implementing the new tax system and for achieving 
a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development 
can be created. 
  The meeting today also urged all people's courts and 
procuratorial, public security, and taxation organs to do away 
with interference from local protectionism, from departments 
trying to protect their own interests, and from irregular 
practices in certain trades and professions; give priority to 
cracking down in key areas and major cases; and carry out all 
assignments impartially and promptly. It said: While cracking 
down on special cases, efforts should also be made to publicize 
the cases so that the people will become educated. Collective 
and major crackdown actions should be reported through 
television and radio stations, newspapers, and journals. 
  Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court; 
Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator general of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate; Mu Xinsheng, vice minister of public security; 
and Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Administration of 
Taxation, also spoke at the teleconference. Liu Zhongli, 
minister of finance and concurrently director of the State 
Administration of Taxation; and He Chunlin, deputy secretary 
general of the State Council; and persons in charge of relevant 
departments attended the teleconference. 
  It has been learned that the crackdown conducted by the four 
departments will be carried out in large and medium cities and 
regions where forgery, resales, and theft of invoices have been 
quite serious; and the crackdown will also be carried out in 
other areas along with routine operations. Priority will be 
given to cracking down on those who forge invoices en masse in 
underground printing shops, as well as on lawless elements 
engaged in forging and reselling invoices as a lucrative 
profession; and on elements who forge invoices to evade taxes, 
obtain tax deductibles, and swindle tax refunds. Special 
efforts will be made to crack down on organized crimes of 
forging, reselling, and stealing invoices.

  [Text] In a major fund-raising move, Hainan Island is to 
set up a property rights centre to help channel foreign and 
domestic funds into cash-strapped enterprises. 
  When it opens its doors tomorrow, the centre will allow 
foreign investors to invest in a long list of state collective 
and shareholding industrial, commercial and infrastructure 
enterprises. 
  "The idea of the centre is to provide yet another route for 
Chinese enterprises to reform their operations and management," 
said Sun Lijun, the provincial government's vice-secretary. 
  It is the first of its kind set up by a special economic 
zone, although major cities such as Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin and Chengdu have had similar operations. 
  Incorporated as a limited company, the centre has 21 
members, 
which may act as broking agents for domestic enterprises seeking 
foreign funds. 
  Mr Sun said foreign investors could either take an equity 
stake, buy the land use, management or intellectual property 
rights, or invest in the fixed assets of these corporations. 
Investment in the listed shares of companies, however, is 
forbidden. 
  He said rules setting out the scope, investment forms and 
the 
type of property rights which could be transferred were 
contained in a regulation recently approved by the provincial 
government. 
  "The rules are an important step towards the setting up of a 
modern enterprise system in Hainan," said Mr Sun. 
  This fund-raising method for Chinese enterprises was seen as 
more cost-effective than just sending a delegation overseas with 
a long list of projects. 
  "Besides, the centre will be able to provide a more detailed 
background of the Chinese corporations, making it easier for 
foreign investors to make up their minds on what to invest in," 
said Mr Sun. 
  Although the exchange will mainly serve the corporations in 
Hainan, it will also be open to enterprises from other regions 
keen to tap foreign capital. 
  The Hainan Securities Committee Office's deputy director, 
Ren 
Junyun, said plans were afoot to link the exchange with the 
other centres to provide a more comprehensive and efficient 
service to its members. 
  To mark the centre's opening, a six-day property rights fair 
will begin tomorrow in Haikou, the provincial capital. 
  So far, 33 corporations have applied to the centre to find 
potential investors from China or abroad, 19 of which are 
shareholding companies. 
  Among the major enterprises seeking funds are Hainan Airport 
Shareholding Co, Hainan Airlines, Hainan Expressway 
Shareholding, and Hainan Handicrafts Import and Export Corp. 
  Hainan Airport hopes to raise capital through the sale of 
300 
million legal-person shares for projects related to two 
airports, Sanya Fenhuang and Haikou Meilan, it is building. 
Sanya is scheduled to open in July and Haikou Meilan in 1996. 
  In addition, Hainan Airport is also involved in property, 
financial and industrial trading activities. 
  Hainan Airlines was set up in 1989 to operate an air cargo 
business. With a fleet of four 737 Boeing planes, it was 
restructured in 1992 into a shareholding company. 
  Hainan Expressway, set up last year to operate expressways 
in 
the province, has expanded into property and tourism. 
  To fund its expansion, it is prepared to sell 250 million 
shares to investors.

  [Text] The ninth plenum of the Liaoning Provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commission concluded in Shenyang on 7 
April. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered a speech at the plenum, in which he stressed: The 
more deepening of reform and the more development of the 
economy, the more we should resolutely oppose corruption. Gu 
Jinchi said: Party members and cadres at all levels, 
particularly leading cadres, should appraise the anticorruption 
work done in the former period by seeking truth from facts and 
upgrade their understanding on the importance and emergency of 
successfully conducting anticorruption work. They should also 
firmly foster the thinking of unremittingly and frequently 
grasping the work and carry forward the struggle against 
corruption deeply, protractedly, and effectively. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should correctly 
understand and successfully deal with the relationship among 
reform, development, stability, and anticorruption by proceeding 
from the whole situation. They should unswervingly implement 
the principle of taking two-handed approach and being tough with 
both hands. While successfully grasping the central work of 
economic construction, it is imperative to do a good job in 
grasping the anticorruption work. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: A good job should be done this year 
in realistically implementing various tasks for the 
anticorruption work. Efforts should be made to concentrate on 
dealing with the deep-rooted problems so as to strive to score 
greater results in the work. It is necessary to seize the 
emphasis of having leading cadres perform their official duties 
honestly and be self-disciplined, to reinforce the dynamics in 
investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, and to 
continuously correct the malpractice. Efforts should be made to 
further perfect the supervisory mechanism and to take radical 
and stopgap measures concurrently. 
  In his speech Gu Jinchi urged party committees and 
governments at all levels to realistically enhance their 
leadership over the anticorruption work. The principal leading 
comrades of party and government organs should take personal 
charge of the work. Efforts should be made to establish or 
improve the responsibility system enforced for the 
anticorruption work, to enhance the supervisory and inspection 
work, to further strengthen leadership over the work undertaken 
by the discipline inspection commission so as to bring its 
functional role into full play. 
  Attending the plenum were provincial leading personnel, 
including Wang Huaiyuan, Shang Wen, Chen Suzhi, Xu Wencai, Wen 
Shizhen, and Zhang Lingyun; as well as veteran leaders from the 
provincial level organs, including Ge Xifan and Lin Sheng. 
  During the plenum, the participating members approved the 
resolution on the work report given by the Liaoning Provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commission at the plenum.

  [Text] Yinchuan, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's fast economic 
growth has resulted in the widespread development of the coal 
industry in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China. 
  Ningxia, with estimated verifiable coal deposits of more 
than 
31.5 billion tons, is one of China's coal-producing bases 
together with the autonomous regions and provinces of Xinjiang, 
Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Shaanxi. 
  In 1993, the region turned out more than 13.5 million tons 
of 
coal and earned some 30 million U.S. dollars by exporting 
588,000 tons. 
  According to a regional government plan, its coal production 
will reach 20 million tons a year by the end of 1995, and 
production will double the present figure by 2000. 
  Experts say the booming of the coal industry in the region 
stems from the state's policy of transferring energy and 
energy-consuming industries to the northwestern part of the 
country. 
  At present, a 2.4-million-kw thermal power plant is being 
built in the region, and another 10-million-kw thermal power 
base is included under the government plan.

  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- "China always attaches 
great importance to its relations with France," Chinese Premier 
Li Peng said in talks with his visiting French counterpart 
Edouard Balladur here this afternoon. 
  Balladur said his current China visit is aimed at improving 
French-Chinese relations. 
  According to a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, 
the 
talks between the Chinese and French prime ministers proceeded 
in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. 
  During the talks Chinese Premier Li said: "Through joint 
efforts, China and France reached understanding in resuming 
traditional friendly relations of cooperation in January this 
year. With the publication of the joint communique between the 
two governments, Sino-French relations returned to the normal 
track." 
  Li pointed out that although the world has seen tremendous 
changes in recent years, the importance of the Sino-French 
cooperation has not been reduced, but increased. 
  The two countries, he continued, have many points in common 
in safeguarding world peace and promoting economic development. 
  Economically, Li said, the two countries are mutually 
complementary, and the potential for the development of economic 
cooperation is great. 
  He stressed that China would pursue long-term, stable and 
friendly ties of cooperation with France according to the 
principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, 
mutual respect, mutual non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs and equality and mutual benefit. 
  Li appreciated the positive efforts Prime Minister Balladur 
and the French Government had made to restore and improve the 
bilateral ties. 
  "We should have an eye on the 21st century, and handle the 
bilateral ties strategically to make the Sino-French relations 
enjoy healthy development," Li said. 
  The premier said that China and France have bright prospects 
in developing their economic and trade cooperation since the 
economy of China has entered a sustained, rapid and healthy 
development track, thus making it possible for China to expand 
its economic and trade cooperation with every countries in the 
world including France. 
  Secondly, he said, France has advantages in the fields of 
transportation, energy and telecommunications and these sectors 
are just China's priority for development. China welcomes more 
French enterprises to participate in competition in China on the 
basis of equality. 
  Thirdly, Li said, China always take a positive attitude 
towards the development of its trade and economic cooperation 
with France. 
  He hoped that French enterprises would strengthen their 
competitiveness in the Chinese market so as to expand 
Sino-French trade and economic cooperation. 
  Balladur also believed there are great potentials for 
France- 
China cooperation. 
  He said the future visits of Chinese and French ministers 
will promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  Li and Balladur also discussed the possibilities of 
cooperation on important projects. They agreed that the two 
sides, keeping the momentum of high-level contacts, will 
strengthen political consultations and confirm the memorandum of 
consultations between foreign ministers and deputy foreign 
ministers, which was reached this January when Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited France. 
  Touching on issues of China's re-entry in GATT, Balladur 
said 
that France supports China to resume its founding party position 
in GATT, and thus become a founding nation in the world trade 
organization. 
  Li expressed his thanks for this. 
  The Chinese premier briefed Balladur on U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher's China visit, and explained China's 
principled stand on human rights issues. 
  Balladur briefed Li on France's views over the rights issue, 
saying that France, having no intention to interfere in other 
nation's internal affairs, is willing to discuss the issue with 
other countries on an equal footing. 
  Premier Li, at the guests' request, also briefed them on 
China's independent policy of foreign affairs and its relations 
with its neighbors. 
  The prime ministers exchanged views on international and 
regional issues of common concern. They noted that they share 
views on many issues. The two sides agreed that both China and 
France are influential nations in international affairs, and 
that the maintenance of good relations between them accords with 
the fundamental interests of the two sides and the world peace 
and stability as well. 
  Among those present at the talks were Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Chairman of the Chinese 
Government Reception Committee and Minister of Power Industry 
Shi Dazhen, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and Minister of 
Industry, Posts, Telecommunications and Foreign Trade Gerard 
Longuet. 
  Prior to the talks, Premier Li presided over a welcoming 
ceremony for Prime Minister Balladur. 
  In the evening, Li hosted a banquet in honor of Balladur and 
his party. 
  This afternoon, Zhou Jue, vice-chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China,

Pierre-Andre Wiltzer of the National Assembly of France.

Bureau on 26 March 1994] 
  [Text] In 1993, people across the municipality 
conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply 
implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the

structure, implemented all measures of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council on strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and achieved positive 
results under the leadership of the municipal party committee 
and the municipal government. The national economy of the 
municipality was developed in a sustained, rapid, and sound 
manner, and the level of fulfillment of various targets was 
better than that of the previous year. Based on initial 
statistics and calculated in terms of comparable prices, the 
gross domestic products during the year were valued at 85.2 
billion yuan, up 12 percent, marking a year with the highest 
growth rate in the last five years. The financial revenue of 
the year totalled 8.41 billion yuan, up 4.8 percent over the 
previous year. The comprehensive economic strength continued to 
improve. 
<H5>  1. The Primary Industry </H5>
  Primary industry developed steadily. The value added by the 
primary industry during the year totalled 5.3 billion yuan, up 3 
percent over the previous year, if calculated in terms of 
comparable prices, accounting for 6.2 percent of the gross 
domestic product. 
  New progress was made in rural reform. In 1993, rural people 
in the outskirts of Beijing emancipated the mind, sought 
development with strenuous efforts, persisted in the basic 
status of agriculture in the national economy in the course of 
changing its track to that of a market economy, served the 
market, invigorated the operational mechanism, readjusted the 
product variety structure, gradually promoted large-scale and 
market-oriented agricultural production and diversified 
operation, and made a big stride in agricultural modernization. 
  Bumper harvest was reaped in grain production. Agricultural 
production continued to develop towards high yield, high 
efficiency, and fine quality farming and a bumper harvest was 
achieved in grain production despite a year of great disasters. 
The grain output during the year totalled 2.84 million tonnes, 
up 0.7 percent over the previous year; the per-mu yield of sown 
areas reached 415.7 kg, an increase of 21.9 kg, or 5.6 percent, 
over the previous year. 
  The production of farm and sideline products was stable. The 
production of major farm and sideline products was guided by the 
market, the farming structure was readjusted and optimized, all 
farm and sideline products generally increased in output on the 
basis of enhancing quality, and the vegetable baskets of the 
residents in the capital were enriched daily. 
  Output of major farm and sideline products was as follows:

in operation reached 46,000 and showed a 58.6 percent increase 
over 1992. The volume of passengers transported by cabs reached 
490 million persons and showed a 260 percent increase over 1992. 
  The undertakings of culture, journalism, and publication 
scored new achievements. In 1993 the number of literary and art 
troupes across the municipality reached 43; that of cultural 
museums, 22; and that of libraries, 23. The municipal radio and 
television broadcasting stations continued to open new columns. 
The per week broadcasting hours of the Beijing television

and the daily broadcasting hours of the Beijing people's 
broadcasting station were increased to 96. The municipality 
published 43.839 million volumes of magazines or periodicals and 
840 million copies of newspapers in the year. 
  Educational undertakings achieved steady development. In 
1993 the municipality had 66 higher educational institutions 
that accommodated 159,000 students, showing a 13.5 percent 
increase over 1992. It had 118 secondary specialized schools 
that accommodated 62,000 students, showing a 9.5 percent 
increase over 1992. It had 178 vocational schools that 
accommodated 56,000 students, showing a 9.3 percent increase 
over 1992. It had 280 general senior middle schools that 
accommodated 718,000 students, showing a 5.6 percent decrease 
over 1992. The rate of student enrollment between general 
senior middle schools and secondary specialized, technical, 
vocational schools was 2.28:1. The municipality turned out 
109,000 graduates from various schools at or above the secondary 
school level, which showed a 6.8 percent decrease over 1992. 
The enrollment rate of school-age children in the year reached 
99.88 percent and showed a 0.23 percentage points increase over 
1992. The rate of junior middle school graduates who entered 
higher schools in the year reached 88.4 percent and showed a 
10.9 percentage points increase over 1992. 
  By the end of 1993, Beijing had 1,367 adult educational 
schools run by the social sectors and trained 639,000 students, 
an increase of 14.3 percent and 44.6 percent respectively. 
After the State Educational Commission's examination and 
acceptance test, Beijing Municipality became the first city in 
China which met the standard of "basically conducting nine-year 
compulsory education and basically wiping out illiteracy among 
young people and those in the prime of life." 
  New progress was made in public health undertakings. Medical 
and health conditions for the urban and rural people continued 
to improve. By the end of 1993, Beijing had 4,962 medical and 
health- care clinics, 548 of which were hospitals in the urban 
and rural areas, an increase of 13 clinics over the previous 
years. There were 116,200 health workers, an increase of 400 
workers over the previous year. The whole municipality had 
65,600 hospital beds, an increase of 2,400 beds over the 
previous year. For every 1,000 persons in the municipality, 
there was an average of 5.13 doctors of Chinese and western 
medicines, an increase of 0.03 persons over the previous year; 
and 5.9 hospital beds, an increase of 0.2 beds. A number of 
medical organs of various descriptions were built, rebuilt, and 
expanded during the year. 
  Noticeable results were made in sports undertakings. In 
1993, athletes of Beijing Municipality won 99.5 medals at major 
competitions in China, 30 of which were gold medals and 37.5 
were silver medals. At major international competitions, 
Beijing athletes won 18 medals, 11 of which were gold medals 
and four were silver medals. Two persons broke one world record 
on one occasion, four persons broke five Asian records on eight 
occasions, and two persons broke three national records on three 
occasions. Mass sports undertakings were developed in the 
course of popularization, and 1.2 million people participated in 
sports training during the year. 
<H5>  4. Investment in Fixed Assets and Urban Construction </H5>
  Emphasis was given to investment in fixed assets and the 
structure became fairly rational. In 1993, the municipality's 
investment in fixed assets reached 41.05 billion yuan, up 54.3 
percent over the previous year. Of this, local investments 
totalled 27.58 billion yuan, up 50.1 percent. Of the whole 
municipality's total investment in fixed assets, 18.6 billion 
yuan were invested in capital construction, up 57 percent over 
the previous year; 13.26 billion yuan were in equipment 
replacement and technical transformation, up 60.8 percent over 
the previous year; and 5.81 billion were in building commodity 
houses, up 72.4 percent. The municipality's investments in 
fixed assets were mainly used in building urban infrastructure 
facilities, renovating dangerous houses, developing basic 
industry, and building farmland and water conservancy projects. 
The investment in urban infrastructure facilities during the 
year totalled 10.36 billion yuan, up 76.2 percent, accounting 
for 32.5 percent of the total investments, up 3.2 percentage 
point over the previous year; investment in renovating dangerous 
houses totalled 1.51 billion yuan, up 110 percent over the 
previous year; investment in basic industrial projects totalled 
8.86 billion yuan, up 66.1 percent; and investment in farmland 
and water conservancy projects totalled 580 million yuan, up 66 
percent. 
  Noticeable achievements were made in urban construction. In 
1993, Beijing Municipality built a great number of water, 
electricity, gas, heating, road, and telecommunications key 
projects, and witnessed gratifying achievements in changing the 
outlook of the urban and rural areas. The Beijing postal hub 
project was completed. The Shoudu Airport expressway with a 
total length of 79.2 km, the renovation of the east third ring 
road, the Guangning Road, the Beijing section of the 
Beijing-Shijiazhuang expressway, and Migu Highway were completed 
and opened to traffic. Fifteen overpasses and 13 crossing 
facilities for pedestrians were built, thus effectively 
improving the capital's traffic conditions. At present, Beijing 
Municipality is a city with the greatest number of overpasses in 
China. All key construction projects were being smoothly 
carried out. The Construction of western passenger station 
entered the stage of doing the most difficult part, the 
underground construction structure of the main station was 
basically completed, the roof construction of the subway station 
to be built was completed, and construction of five out of the 
eight exceptionally big railway bridges began. Construction of 
key projects, such as the no.8 double-track subway line, the 
second phase of the no.9 water plant, and the pumped-storage 
hydroelectric station in the Ming Tombs were making headway. 
During the year, a new power supply capacity of 239,000 
kilowatts was added; the completed second natural gas pipeline 
running from Huabei oil field to Beijing added a daily gas 
supply capacity of 150,000 cubic meters; 2.624 million square 
meters of central heating areas were built; and a daily trash 
handling capacity of 1,500 tonnes was added. 
<H5>  5. Setup of Various Categories of Markets </H5>
  Along with the gradual setup of the socialist market 
economic 
system, the municipality made bigger strides in building the 
markets for various production factors. The data compiled from 
the survey on various categories of markets showed that a market 
system preliminarily took shape in the municipality. 
  The municipality made a breakthrough in setting up the 
markets for means of production. Sixty-five general markets for 
means of production were set up with an annual transaction 
volume of 5.86 billion yuan, an increase of 25.8 percent. More 
than 90 percent of means of production were distributed. The 
setup of the petroleum exchange centers and the commodity 
exchange centers, that are operated according to the 
international practice, indicated the municipality entered a new 
stage of setting up the markets for means of production. 
Simultaneously, the municipality also entered the stages of 
building or planning to build large-sized markets for means of 
production, such as coal, building materials, metals, and 
vehicles. 
  The municipality began to build monetary markets. 
Forty-eight financial organs across the municipality got 
involved in market activities. The negotiable securities trade 
volume reached 15.17 billion yuan, an increase of 61.2 percent 
over 1992. Of this, the stock trade volume reached 6.42 billion 
yuan, an increase of 1550 percent. The state treasury trade 
volume reached 8.01 billion yuan, an increase of 20.3 percent; 
and the monetary bond and enterprise bond trade volume increased 
by 69 percent over the previous year. 
  The skilled person service markets developed rapidly. There 
were 74 skilled person service markets and 386,000 registered 
laborers. Some 116,000 skilled persons or 30 percent were 
transferred successfully. 
  The real estate markets and the technology markets 
preliminarily took shape. The municipality had 20 real estate 
exchange organs. Some 53,000 real estate transactions were 
concluded during the year, involving 3.56 billion yuan and 
showing an increase of 13.8 percent. Some 4.183 million square 
meters of areas were involved in the transactions. There were 
55 technology trading organizations and the technology 
transaction volume reached 3.56 billion yuan, an increase of 
13.8 percent. 
  The country fair trade markets developed rapidly. In 1993, 
87 country fair trade markets were newly build. Thus, the 
municipality had 960 markets of this kind. The total 
construction areas reached 1.383 million square meters. There 
were 185,000 business stands with an annual transaction volume 
of 8.37 billion yuan, an increase of 71.5 percent over the 
previous year. There were 15 large-sized country fair trade 
markets each with a transaction volume of 100 million yuan or 
more. 
<H5>  6. The Opening of the Municipality to the Outside World as </H5>
Well as the Setup of Development Zones, Small Industrial Zones, 
and Science and Technology Park Zones 
  The year 1993 was a year when the municipality made a 
breakthrough in using foreign capital. A total of 3,752 
foreign-funded enterprises of three types were newly approved 
during the year, an increase of 70 percent over the previous 
year and equal to the total figure in the previous 14 years. 
The foreign capital introduced according to agreements totaled 
$6.23 million, an increase of 430 percent and much higher than 
the accumulated figure in the previous 14 years, totaling $3.96 
million. Some 7,500 foreign-funded enterprises of three types 
were approved and more than $10 billion were brought in. In 
1993, $2.85 billion foreign capital were really used, accounting 
for 31 percent of the total planned figure. 
  Of the "three-typed" projects approved in 1993, the number 
of 
large-sized projects each involving moreo than $10 million 
doubled or redoubled and reached 200. Due to the stimulus by 
large projects, the scale of these projects averaged at 
$2,770,000 and each project used $167.4 million foreign capital 
on average, respectively increasing by 120 percent and 150 
percent over the previous year. More than 20 trans-national 
companies made investment and ran plants in Beijing, and there 
were more than 60 international famous companies in Beijing. 
  Development zones and small industrial zones developed 
healthily and became new economic growth points. As of the end 
of 1993, the municipality had 33 development zones, small 
industrial zones, and science and technology park zones of 
various categories which were established with the approvals of 
the State Council and the municipal government. Some 277.35 
square kilometers of land were covered in the plan for 
clarifying the categories of land which should be used to build 
the zones of these three types. So far, 26 development zones 
and small industrial zones have entered the stages of building 
infrastructural facilities. A total of 1,374 projects entered 
these zones (excluding the new-tech industrial development 
experimental zone). Investment in these projects totaled 18.15 
billion yuan; registered capital totaled 9.94 billion yuan, of 
which 5.43 billion yuan was invested by the foreign side; and 
contracted amount of foreign funds was $1.25 billion, of which 
40 percent, or $500 million, was brought in. Some enterprises 
and products of the zones entered the world market and played a 
fairly good exemplary and leading role. Enterprises completed 
and commissioned in the development zone and small industrial 
zones created 950 million yuan in output value in 1993, created 
1.52 billion yuan in sales income, earned a profit of 80 million 
yuan, and paid 50 million yuan of taxes. 
  The three development zones subordinate to the 
municipality--the Beijing Economic and Technological Development 
Zone, the Beijing Xisanqi New Building Material Industrial 
Development Zone, and the Wangfujing Commercial Zone--provided 
projects for investment. These projects brought in 10.2 billion 
yuan of investment, their registered capital totaled 4.85 
billion yuan, and the contracted amount of foreign capital was 
$670 million. Development in bringing in foreign investment 
remained vigorous. 
  The Beijing Municipal New-Tech Industrial Development 
Experimental Zone continued the high-speed development. By the 
end of 1993, 3,768 technological enterprises had registered with 
the zone, of which 700 were foreign-funded enterprises of the 
three types. These enterprises employed 75,000 people, of whom 
more than two-thirds had a college education level or higher. 
They developed over 4,500 new technology and new products in 
the year, and over 1,600 of them were put into mass production. 
A number of high- and new-tech achievements leading in the 
world were directly transformed into productive forces to 
produce good social and economic benefits. In 1993, the 
experimental zone's income from technological and industrial 
production and foreign trade exceeded 10 billion yuan, and its 
profit totaled 800 million yuan, both ranking first in China's 
new-tech industrial experimental zones. 
<H5>  7. Living Standard, Prices </H5>
  Living standard was further improved. The annual total wage 
of incumbent staff members and workers was 20.25 billion yuan, 
up 27.8 percent from the preceding year. Workers' average wage 
increased by 28.3 percent over the preceding year, or 7.8 
percent when allowing for price rises. Peasants' per capita net 
income showed an increase of 18.2 percent over the preceding 
year, or 5.1 percent when allowing for price rises. Urban and 
rural people's large durable consumer goods continued to 
increase. Every 100 urban families had 107.2 color television 
sets, 45.6 video recorders, and 82.4 cameras, up 5.7, 9.4, and 
6.7 percent, respectively, from the preceding year; and every 
100 rural families had 56 color television sets, 47 
refrigerators, and 76 washing machines, up 21.7, 17.5, and 4.1 
percent, respectively. 
  Price reform was accelerated. To meet the needs in 
developing the socialist market economy, Beijing further 
accelerated the price reform in 1993. It lifted the price 
control on grain, edible oil, and their products in the year and 
basically decontrolled the prices of all major consumer goods, 
except for fuels, thus playing a positive role in balancing the 
price relations and enlivening commodity distribution. Thanks 
to larger demands and increased production cost, workers's cost 
of living price index rose by 19 percent in the year, and the 
retail price index rose by 16.9 percent. The price index 
registered an increase of 20.7, 9.2, and 16.6 percent, 
respectively, in food, clothes, and articles for daily use; a 
decline of 0.3 percent in cultural and recreational commodities; 
and an increase of 15.1, 10.7, and 57.3 percent, respectively, 
in medicine and medical goods, building materials, and fuels. 
The price index of services rose by 33.8 percent. 
  Savings deposits of urban and rural residents continued to 
increase substantially. By the end of 1993, saving deposits of 
urban and rural residents amounted to 56.07 billion yuan, an 
increase of 44.2 percent over the figure at the beginning of 
that year. Of this figure, savings deposits of urban residents 
amounted to 48.25 billion yuan, up 46.6 percent, and those of 
peasants amounted to 7.82 billion yuan, up by 31.2 percent. 
  New headway was made in residential construction. In 1993, 
construction of 18.083 million square meters of residences were 
started or restored, an increase of 4.9 percent over the 
previous year, and construction of 61.41 million square meters 
were completed. In 1993, 135 small residential districts were 
under construction in the municipality, with the areas whose 
construction was started or restored reaching 12.634 million 
square meters. Of them, 10 small residential districts newly 
started construction in 1993, with a total floor space of 
994,000 square meters. In 1993, construction of three small 
residential districts was completed, with a total construction 
area of 500,000 square meters. By the end of 1993, 15 small 
dangerous residential districts were under rebuilding, with a 
total construction area of 3.555 million square meters, of 
which, 790,000 square meters were completed, newly settling 
9,500 households, and resettling 3,600 households. In line with 
the "Beijing programs for well-off-type residences projects," 
the municipality built 100,000 square meters of well-off-type 
residences, 8,000 square meters were made available, enabling 
some specially difficult households to moved to new residences. 
The people's housing conditions improved further. The per 
capita share of housing acreage of urban residents was 12.5 
square meters, and that of peasants was 23.7 square meters. 
<H5>  8. Population </H5>
  Population growth continued to be put under control. 
According to the statistics by the household registration 
departments, by the end of 1993, the municipality's population 
with household registration came to 10.512 million, 63,000 more 
than the figure at the beginning of 1993. Of them, 
non-agricultural population numbered 6.687 million, 124,000 more 
than the figure at the beginning of 1993. According to the 
sample survey of the changes in population, the birth rate of 
permanent population was 9.35 per thousand, up by 0.13 
permillage points over the previous year, and the death rate was 
6.16 per thousand, 0.05 permillage points higher than the 
previous year, resulting in a natural population growth rate of 
3.19 per thousand, 0.08 permillage points higher than the 
previous year. 
  Along with the all-around development of the work, the 
municipality also met some difficulties and problems in 1993. 
Relatively conspicuous ones included: Construction funds 
remained insufficient, construction of basic facilities still 
lagged behind the demand of accelerating the development of the 
capital, economic efficiency of some state-owned enterprises 
declined, increase margin of commodity prices was on the high 
side, and some low-income households still had difficulties with 
daily life.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Must Let the Public See the Justice of the </F>
Judicial Proceedings"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang was found guilty of 
"stealing and prying into secret information of the state" in 
the first trial of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of 
political rights for two years. Since mainland China expanded 
opening and allowed reporters outside the mainland to cover news 
on the mainland, Xi Yang is the first to be sentenced to a stern 
prison term for offending criminal law. Although he is not a 
permanent resident of Hong Kong, because he was working with a 
mass media institution in Hong Kong when he violated the law, 
his case attracted close attention among journalistic circles 
and the public of Hong Kong. 
  On 27 September, China's official news media dispatched a 
report saying that Xi Yang was suspected of being involved in 
the illegal activities of stealing and prying into state 
monetary secrets in violation of the "PRC State Security Law," 
and was detained by the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau 
for investigation that day. On 7 October, another report said 
that the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate approved the 
arrest of Xi Yang, and before that, Tian Ye, another accused 
person in the same case and a cadre of the State Administration 
of Exchange Control, had also been arrested according to law. 
The report said: "The monetary secrets stolen by Xi and Tian 
included the secret plan of the People's Bank of China for 
adjusting interest rates of deposits and loans, the secret 
decision of the same bank on participating in international gold 
trading, and other major monetary secrets. This caused serious 
consequences." The same report also quoted a responsible 
official of the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau as 
saying that "the behavior of Xi and Tian violated PRC criminal 
law and was not relevant to a reporter's normal news coverage." 
  After investigation, the procuratorate filed an indictment 
against Xi Yang on 14 December, and the case was handled by the 
Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court. Because the case 
was related to state secrets, according to the relevant 
provisions of criminal law procedure, it was decided that the 
trial would not be an open one. The court completed the first 
trial and passed sentence in late March. Xi Yang refused to 
accept the sentence and lodged an appeal to the higher level 
court. So far, the court verdict has not been officially made 
public. Because the process of the trial was not open, people 
on the outside knew very little about the case. Upon finding 
out that Xi Yang was sentenced to 12 years in prison several 
days ago, many people were shocked. Although the Chinese 
authorities repeatedly stated that Xi Yang's case had no 
relation to reporters' normal news coverage activities and 
repeatedly stressed that the Chinese Government would guarantee 
the rights of reporters from outside the mainland to engage in 
activities related to their trade, journalists in Hong Kong 
still expressed strong misgivings. There were various 
conjectures as people were unaware of the facts. Members of the 
"Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic 
Movement in China," who are always trying to stir up trouble, 
took advantage of this event to instigate unrest among the 
people. In fact, they tried to seek a pretext to undermine the 
confidence of Hong Kong people in the policy of "one country, 
two systems." 
  From the very beginning, Xi Yang's case attracted extensive 
and close attention, and Chinese judicial authorities also 
obviously attached great importance to the handling of this case 
and did not treat it recklessly. A responsible person of 
China's Supreme People's Court answered the relevant inquiries 
of the Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress 
[NPC], and Chinese government officials also answered relevant 
questions raised by overseas Chinese and foreign visitors. 
However, the court had to independently conducted the trial 
without being influenced by administrative organs and external 
forces. In his work report to the NPC session last month, Ren 
Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, stressed that 
"people's courts at all levels must consistently base their 
trials and sentences on facts and strictly take law as the 
yardstick; and they must strictly follow specific and procedural 
laws when handling cases, and properly handle every case in the 
spirit of being highly responsible to the people's interests and 
state laws." They "must persistently exercise the right of 
independent trial and judgment according to law." He also said: 
"Maintain the system of open trials, and put the activities of 
trial and judgment under supervision of the people through open 
investigations, open debates, and open announcement of sentences 
and court judgments." Although Xi Yang's case could not be 
dealt with in an open hearing because of its special conditions, 
it is still necessary to let the public see the correctness of 
the judicial decision. In the details of Xi Yang's case, the 
most noticeable point for journalistic circles in Hong Kong was 
whether the major secrets were all used for news reporting. 
Some Hong Kong NPC deputies, some Hong Kong affairs advisers, 
and some political organizations have urged the Beijing 
authorities to appropriately make public the details of the case 
as long as this does not affect the fairness of the judicial 
proceedings in order to remove people's misgivings. 
  In order to safeguard state interests, China enacted the 
State Security Law and the Law on Protecting State Secrets. 
Public security and procuratorial authorities are on the alert 
against the sabotage and secret-stealing activities of internal 
and external hostile forces. On the other hand, the mainland of 
China needs to introduce modernization, reform, and opening to 
Hong Kong and overseas areas, and Hong Kong also needs to learn 
more about the real situation on the mainland. Journalists in 
Hong Kong are thus performing important duties of covering and 
reporting news. The Chinese Government has also indicated many 
times that it attaches great importance to the positive role of 
the mass media in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Communique on Inner Mongolia's 1993 economic and social </F>
development statistics released by the Inner Mongolia Regional 
Statistical Bureau on 24 February] 
  [Text] In 1993, guided by the regional party committee and 
the regional government, people of various nationalities across 
the region deeply implemented the guidelines of Comrade 
Xiaoping's important speech delivered during his tour to south 
China and of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee, regarded economic construction as the central task, 
conscientiously implemented a series of important policy 
decisions and plans of the central authorities on strengthening 
and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, seized the 
opportunity, deepened reform, accelerated development, and 
achieved major progress in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. The national economy increased steadily, the 
people's living continued to improve, and social undertakings 
were further developed. Based on initial statistics, the gross 
domestic product during the year was valued at 45.52 billion 
yuan, up 10.6 percent over the previous year, of which, the 
added value of primary industry reached 14.77 billion yuan, up 5 
percent; that of the secondary industry, 18.8 billion yuan, up 
16.4 percent; and that of tertiary industry, 11.95 billion yuan, 
up 9.7 percent. However, some prominent issues still existed in 
the economic life, namely, the shortage of funds, the shortage 
of means of transportation, the low economic efficiency, the 
irrational structure, and the high rise in market commodity 
prices. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, the rural and pastoral areas witnessed a vigorous 
economic development thanks to the efforts of all localities to 
conscientiously implement a series of policy measures of the 
central authorities and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 
supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production and 
safeguarding the interests of peasants and herdsmen. The annual 
added value of agriculture reached 14.77 billion yuan, up 5 
percent over the previous year. 
  Crop cultivation continued to develop. Under the situation 
in which some localities were hit by serious spring and summer 
drought and rarely seen floods and waterlogging in early autumn, 
we reaped a bumper harvest of grain. The grain output totaled 
11.083 million tonnes, an increase of 5.9 percent over the 
bumper harvest in 1992, an all-time record in the region. The 
output of oil-bearing crops declined by 10.8 percent from the 
previous year owing to a decline in the farming areas. The 
output of beet increased 7.1 percent over the previous year. 
  The output of major farm products was as follows:

  New progress was made in forestry. The afforested areas 
during the year reached 390,000 hectare, up 5.2 percent over the 
previous year. The quality of afforestation was enhanced, the 
building of protection forests was further strengthened, forest 
fire prevention work yielded effective results, the forest 
coverage rate continued to rise, and the natural environment 
further improved. 
  Under the situation in which many localities suffered 
serious 
disasters of snowfall and drought, we still reaped a bumper 
harvest in animal husbandry. The number of livestock during 
the animal husbandry fiscal year totalled 55.777 million, an 
all-time record. The number of livestock at the end of the year 
reached 42.47 million, up 1.9 percent over the previous year. 
The number of livestock slaughtered during the year totaled 
18.372 million, which was basically the same as the previous 
year. Of this figure, the number of large animals, sheep, and 
hogs slaughtered respectively reached 1.403 million, 11.715 
million, and 5.254 million, or 20.3 percent, 41 percent, and 
84.5 percent. New progress was made in improving the livestock 
breed, and the proportion of large animals, sheep, and hogs of 
fine breed or improved breed respectively reached 25.2 percent, 
61.3 percent, and 42.7 percent, showing an increase of 2.1 
percentage point and 2.3 percentage point, and a decline of 0.3 
percentage point respectively. The output of major animal 
by-products comprehensively increased. 
  The output of major animal by-products and the number of 
livestock were as follows:

  Production of fisheries registered another best record. The 
annual output of aquatic products was 38,000 tonnes, up 6.8 
percent from the preceding year. 
  Conditions for animal husbandry production improved 
continuously. By the end of 1993, the power of Inner Mongolia's 
farm and animal husbandry machines reached 8.33 billion 
kilowatts, up 3.5 percent from the preceding year; large and 
medium-sized tractors numbered 38,000, down 5.4 percent; small 
tractors numbered 288,000, up 7.7 percent; trucks for farm use 
totaled 12,000, up 0.3 percent; farmland irrigation machines 
1.45 billion kilowatts, up 2.1 percent; areas farmed by machines 
3.106 million hectares, up 5.5 percent, and they accounted for 
60.3 percent of the total farmland, up 3.3 percentage points; 
effective irrigated areas totaled 1.767 million hectares, up 4.2 
percent; the annual amount of chemical fertilizer applied (100 
percent effective content equivalent) 450,000 tonnes, up 10.0 
percent; and rural electricity consumption 1.35 billion kilowatt 
hours [kwh], up 10.7 percent. Farmland water conservancy 
construction was further intensified to substantially improve 
the comprehensive production capacity of agriculture and animal 
husbandry. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, Shandong's industrial production registered 
sustained and stable growth despite fund shortages, the 
restrictions imposed by the bottleneck of transportation, and 
the greater difficulties of enterprises. The annual added value 
of industry totaled 14.32 billion yuan, up 11.5 percent from the 
preceding year. Of the total, the added value of heavy industry 
was 9.88 billion yuan, up 16.2 percent; and that of light 
industry 4.44 billion yuan, up 2.5 percent. Among all the 
industrial enterprises, state-owned enterprises registered a 
4.8-percent increase, of which large and medium-sized 
enterprises a 14.1-percent increase; and the enterprises other 
than state-owned ones registered a 26.6-percent increase, 21.8 
percentage points higher than the growth of state-owned 
enterprises. The proportion of the output value of the 
industrial enterprises not owned by the state to the total 
industrial output value rose from 18.5 percent in the preceding 
year to 21.5 percent. Among the enterprises not owned by the 
state, collective enterprises registered a 24.4-percent 
increase. Of them, industrial enterprises run by townships 
registered an increase of 58.2 percent, and enterprises of other 
sectors, including the "three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises," an increase of 56.1 percent. 
  Affected by the changes in market demand and by the 
operation of enterprises, output of major industrial products 
showed an increase or a decline. 
  The output of major industrial products was as follows:

  The economic efficiency of industry improved. In 1993, the 
general index of economic efficiency of industrial enterprises 
at or above the township level that exercised independent 
accounting, rose from 66.8 to 75.3. Of this, the marketing rate 
of industrial products rose from 95.4 percent to 95.8 percent, 
the profit- and tax-yielding rate of the capital rose from 5.8 
percent to 6.8 percent, the profit-yielding rate of the cost 
dropped from 1.7 percent to 1.6 percent, and the per capita 
labor productivity of industrial enterprises, calculated in 
terms of added value, reached 9474 yuan/person. However, the 
general level of the region's industrial economic efficiency 
remained low, the general index of the annual industrial 
economic efficiency was 21.2 percentage points lower than the 
average national level, and economic efficiency needed to be 
increased further. 
  Construction production developed rapidly. In 1993, 
construction trade fulfilled 4.48 billion yuan in added value, 
up by 35.5 percent over the 1992. The state-owned construction 
and engineering enterprises completed construction on 5.212 
million square meters, up by 9.9 percent. Along with the rapid 
development of the production and management of construction 
trade, economic efficiency of construction enterprises improved 
remarkably, and the per capita labor productivity reached 28,100 
yuan/person, up by 59.6 percent over 1992. 
<H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  The investment in fixed assets continued to increase 
significantly. The annual social investment in fixed assets 
totalled 21.06 billion yuan, up 41.1 percent (13.8 percent in 
real terms after being adjusted for price increases) over the 
previous year. Of this, the investment in state-owned units 
reached 18.65 billion yuan, an increase of 50.9 percent; 
collective units, 530 million yuan, a decline of 18.9 percent; 
urban and rural individual units, 1.88 billion yuan, a decline 
of 1.7 percent. Of the investment in state-owned units, 
investment in capital construction reached 13.14 billion yuan, 
up 43.8 percent; equipment replacement and technical upgrading, 
4.11 billion yuan, up 58.3 percent; construction of commodity 
houses, 1.11 billion yuan, up 164.1 percent; and other items, 
290 million yuan, up 38 percent. Investment in local projects 
reached 10.24 billion yuan, an increase of 67.1 percent, which 
was noticeably quicker than the investment increase of 34.8 
percent in central projects. Investment throughout the year 
were mainly used to unceasingly expand the scope of projects 
under construction. The overall investment scale for social 
projects under construction reached 70 billion yuan, an increase 
of over 10 billion yuan from the previous year. Along with the 
implementation of the central and regional marcoeconomic 
regulation and control measures, the construction of new 
projects was brought under control. During the year, 
state-owned units initiated 2,217 capital construction projects 
and projects on equipment replacement and technical upgrading 
each with an investment of more than 50,000 yuan, a decline of 
419 projects from the previous year. 
  The investment structure was adjusted. Of the total 
investment by state-owned units, the investment in tertiary 
industry was 5.87 billion yuan, up 51.1 percent over the 
previous year, with the investment proportion increasing from 
32.5 percent in the previous year to 33.5 percent. Of this, the 
investment in transport, post, and telecommunications business 
reached 2.62 billion yuan, up 32.4 percent, with the investment 
proportion declining from 16.6 percent in the previous year to 
14.9 percent; commercial, catering, supply and marketing, and 
warehouse business, 1.14 billion yuan, up 90.8 percent, with the 
investment proportion rising from 5 percent in the previous year 
to 6.5 percent. Investment in the secondary industry totalled 
11.36 billion yuan, up 45.7 percent, with the investment 
proportion declining from 65.3 percent to 64.8 percent. Of 
this, the amount in energy industry totalled 6.4 billion yuan, 
up 31.2 percent, with the investment proportion declining from 
40.9 percent to 36.5 percent; investment in raw materials 
industry reached 3.18 billion yuan, up 69.1 percent, with the 
investment proportion rising from 15.7 percent to 18.1 percent. 
The investment in primary industry totalled 300 million yuan, 
up 18.3 percent, and the investment proportion declined from 2,2 
percent to 1.7 percent. 
  New progress was made in construction of key projects. There 
were 45 large and medium-sized capital construction projects 
under construction in 1993, an increase of one project over the 
previous year. Of these projects, five had been completed and 
commissioned, and five projects which had be completed and 
commissioned were single-item projects. There were 30 
above-quota equipment replacement and transformation projects, 
an increase of 10 projects over the previous year, of which, 3 
were commissioned and completed. The major projects that were 
completely or partially put into operation mainly included the 
coal dressing plant of Haibowan Coal Mining Administration with 
a capacity of 12 million tonnes; Fengzhen Power Plant, Jungar 
coal mine pit-head power station, and Huiliuhe power station 
with an added power generating capacity of 400,000 kw, 100,000 
kw, and 5,000 kw; Tongshun aluminum plant with an electrolytic 
aluminum capacity of 5,000 tonnes; Baotou city post and 
telecommunications bureau with an added program-contolled urban 
telephone switchboards of 21,000 channels; Baotou city cheese 
plant; the transformation of the float glass energy-saving 
production line of Tognliao Glass Plant; Baotou Heating Supply 
Company's central heating project in Kun District; and the water 
conservancy hub project in Kailutai river outlet. 
  The comprehensive production capacity increased. During the 
year, 1,893 capital construction projects and equipment 
replacement and technical updating projects were completed and 
commissioned. These projects mainly added the production 
capacity of 5.74 million kw of electricity, 107,000 cubic meters 
of timber, 1.2 million tonnes of coal, 34,000 tonnes of cement, 
810,000 weight cases of plate glass, 4,800 woolen textile 
spindles, 1,500 tonnes of dried cheese, automatic urban 
telephone switchboards with 67,000 channels, and road 
reconstruction projects totalling 129 kilometers. 
<H5>  4. Transport, Post, and Telecommunications </H5>
  Communications and transportation further developed. The 
added value of the communications and transportation trades was 
3.12 billion yuan, an increase of 7.1 percent over the previous 
year. However, the strains on transport which restricted the 
development of the economy were still prominent. In particular, 
railway transportation was prominently under capacity. 
  Figures for transportation services were as follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Postal and telecommunications trades developed at a faster 
speed. The added value of the postal and telecommunications 
trades was 420 million yuan, an increase of 40.2 percent. 
Business transactions totaled 470 million yuan (calculated in 
terms of 1990's constant prices), an increase of 45.4 percent 
over the previous year. Of this, 95.386 million letters of 
various categories from all parts of the country, foreign 
countries, Hong Kong, and Macao were handled; and there were 
48.906 million long-distance calls, registering increases of 
19.2 percent and 85.6 percent over the previous year. Paging 
system subscribers numbered in the 25,000's at the end of the 
year and mobile phone subscribers numbered 2,000, respectively 
increasing 210 percent and 260 percent over the previous year. 
A total of 5,110 automatic long-distance telephone switchboards 
and 3,402 long-distance telephone circuits were newly added 
during the year, respectively increasing 95.7 percent and 106.6 
percent. Urban telephone switchboards came to 370,00, an 
increase of 28.3 percent. About 64.5 percent were 
program-controlled telephones. There were 250,000 urban 
telephone subscribers, an increase of 33.7 percent. The cities 
at or above the county level across the region were installed 
with automatic urban telephone switchboards. 
<H5>  5. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  The domestic markets for consumer goods tended to be steady 
and prosperous. The total volume of retail sales of commodities 
during the year reached 21.97 billion yuan, an increase of 17.5 
percent over the previous year (if factors for price hikes were 
deducted, the real increase was 4.9 percent.) Of this, the 
volume of retail sales of consumer goods reached 20.17 billion 
yuan, an increase of 19.6 percent; and that of agricultural 
capital goods was 1.8 billion yuan, a drop of 1.5 percent. Of 
the volume of retail sales of consumer goods, that of urban 
areas reached 16.91 billion yuan, an increase of 20.8 percent; 
and that of rural and pastoral areas reached 3.26 billion yuan, 
an increase of 13.4 percent. 
  The volume of retail sales of commodities produced by 
various 
sectors of the economy comprehensively increased. The volume of 
retail sales of commodities of state-owned units increased by 
12.1 percent, that of collective units increased by 9.4 percent, 
that of jointly managed units increased by 170 percent, that of 
individuals increased by 34.2 percent, and the volume of retail 
sales of commodities sold by peasants and herdsmen to 
non-agricultural dwellers increased by 48.6 percent. Viewing 
from the sales volume of various consumer goods, the sales 
volume of grain was reduced by 25.3 percent, that of edible 
vegetable oil increased by 20.5 percent, that of pork increased 
by 25.5 percent, that of eggs increased by 2.3 percent, that of 
cotton cloths was reduced by 34 percent, that of clothes 
increased by 2.2 percent, that of woolen goods increased by 4.6 
percent, that of refrigerators increased by 48.8 percent, that 
of washing machines increased by 12.8 percent, that of bicycles 
increased by 0.2 percent, that of color television sets was 
basically the same as last year, and that of electric fans was 
reduced by 19.1 percent. 
  Markets for capital goods further developed and were brisk. 
Supply and marketing enterprises purchased 5.15 billion yuan of 
capital goods, an increase of 8.7 percent over the previous year 
and their sales volume totaled 5.45 billion yuan, an increase of 
3.8 percent. 
  The strength of conducting reform in commodity prices was 
reinforced further. In 1993, the state and autonomous region 
accelerated price reform and continued to relax restrictions on 
the purchase and sale prices of grains and on the producer 
prices of majority steel products and of partial coal under 
unified distribution. They also upgraded the prices of railway 
transport and electric power, readjusted the commodity prices of 
many categories and charge standards, and brought about changes 
in the prices of basic commodities and to the long-standing low 
standard of charges for infrastructures. All of this has played 
an important role in promoting the formation of the market 
mechanism. However, the region's increased scale of commodity 
prices in markets this year was low due to comprehensive 
influences, such as the structural readjustment of prices, the 
high increase of investments, the repeatedly large-amounts of 
currency issued, the impetus caused by cost, and the price level 
of imported foreign goods. 
  The percentage increase of prices in various fields in 1993 
are as follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<H5>  6. Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The total volume of imports and exports topped the previous 
peak again and reached $1.2 billion, showing a 28.5 percent 
increase over 1992. Of this volume, that of exports reached 
$650 million and showed a 10.2 percent increase over 1992; and 
that of imports reached $550 million and showed a 60.1 percent 
increase over 1992. 
  The utilization of foreign capital was accelerated. The 
region newly signed contracts on 413 projects of utilizing 
foreign capital, which showed a 137-project increase over 1992. 
The volume of funds involved in the contracts reached $360 
million and showed a 120 percent increase over 1992. By the end 
of 1993, the number of "three types of foreign-funded" 
enterprises approved by the region reached 734, showing a 
408-enterprise increase over 1992's figure. As of now, 31 
foreign countries have invested their money in opening 
enterprises in the region. Their investments have been made in 
15 industries and trades, including light industry, chemical 
industry, engineering industry, electronic industry, building 
materials industry, communications, energy resources, 
agriculture, and animal husbandry. 
  International economic and technical cooperation developed 
steadily. In the year, Inner Mongolia signed 143 contracts 
worth $122.81 million for construction projects and labor 
service cooperation abroad, an increase of 49.0 percent over the 
preceding year; and total completed transactions amounted to 
$67.546 million, an increase of 48.9 percent. By the end of 
1993, we had invested $18.964 million to establish 83 
enterprises outside the border; and sent 8,829 people abroad for 
labor service, an increase of 2,543 persons. 
  Tourism witnessed another boom. Throughout the year, we 
received 106,000 tourists from abroad, up 2.2 percent from the 
preceding year; and earned $2.379 million from this, up 49.1 
percent. 
<H5>  7. Finance, Banking, and Insurance </H5>
  Notable results were achieved in increasing revenues and 
reducing expenditures. According to initial statistics, annual 
local revenues totaled 5.61 billion yuan (excluding the special 
revenues from power construction funds and social insurance 
funds), showing an increase of 43.5 percent. Of the total, 
industrial and commercial taxes stood at 5.11 billion yuan, an 
increase of 52.3 percent. Local expenditures totaled 8.76 
billion yuan (excluding the special expenses on power 
construction funds and social insurance funds), up 21.6 from the 
preceding year. Of the total, expenditure on capital 
construction came to 600 million yuan, down 6.3 percent; that on 
enterprises' endeavors to tap potential and conduct technical 
transformation was 1.28 billion yuan, up 1.7 times; that on 
supporting agricultural production and on the operation of 
agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and weather 
departments totaled 490 million, up 11.9 percent; that on the 
operations of science and technology, culture and education, and 
public health departments was 2.69 billion yuan, up 57.8 
percent; and that used as price subsidies totaled 680 million, 
down 29.5 percent. 
  Financial orders improved notably. In 1993, monetary 
departments conscientiously implemented the measures of the 
central and regional authorities for strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control, corrected banking problems 
in a timely manner, made great efforts to organize savings, and 
increased credit in a timely manner, thus effectively supporting 
the national economy. By the end of 1993, savings deposits of 
banks totaled 30.89 billion yuan, an increase of 4.61 billion 
yuan over the figure registered at the beginning of the year and 
an increase of 17.5 percent over the year- end figure of 1992. 
Of the total, 7.45 billion yuan were savings of enterprises, 
down 380 million yuan from the figure registered at the 
beginning of the year and down 4.8 percent from the year-end 
figure of 1992. The year-end amount of bank loans totaled 49.20 
billion yuan, up 9.68 billion yuan from the amount registered at 
the beginning of the year and up 24.5 percent from the 1992 
year-end figure. Of the total, 35.50 billion yuan were loans 
for industrial circulating funds, an increase of 5.74 billion 
yuan over the figure registered at the beginning of the year and 
an increase of 19.3 percent over the 1992 year-end figure. The 
annual cash income of banks was 68.03 billion yuan, up 48.9 
percent from the preceding year; and their cash expenditure 
76.42 billion yuan, up 48.4 percent. This put the net amount of 
currency in circulation at 8.39 billion yuan, up 44.5 percent. 
  The insurance business developed rapidly. Annual income in 
the insurance business totaled 810 million yuan, up 32.3 percent 
from the preceding year, and the year's premium for domestic 
insurance totaled 96 billion yuan, up 6.7 percent. Throughout 
the year, over 150,000 enterprises, 171,000 motor-driven cars, 
1.152 million households, and 4.8 million persons participated 
in various insurance programs. The premium for various property 
insurance totaled 70.8 billion yuan in the year, up 22.5 percent 
from the preceding year; and that for various personal insurance 
24.7 billion yuan, down 23.3 percent. Insurance companies took 
132,000 claims for losses and paid 170 million yuan for property 
losses and 30 million yuan for life insurance. 
<H5>  8. Science and Technology, Education, Culture, Public </H5>
Health, and Sports 
  New headway was made in science and technology. Along with 
the increasingly closer connections between science and 
technology and economic construction, science and technology 
plays an increasingly more important role in the region's 
economic construction. In 1993, 445 scientific and 
technological findings were registered with the region, an 
increase of 55 percent over the previous year. Of this, 147 
were key scientific and technological findings, an increase of 
42. Seven key scientific and technological findings won 
state-level awards. They included "the research on overall 
utilization of the licorice root," "select breeding of 
two-humped [Bactrian] camels," and "the serialized development 
of techniques for mass production of table chickens." One 
hundred and forty key scientific and technological findings won 
the regional-level awards. Applications for 601 patent rights 
were made, and 438 patent rights were approved, respectively 
increasing 91 and 196 over the previous year. Markets for 
science and technology were brisk. A total of 1,815 
technological contracts were signed during the year with a 
transaction of 210 million yuan, respectively increasing 20.9 
percent and 45.8 percent. As of the end of 1993, there were 525 
technology and trade organizations engaged in the development of 
technologies, the transfer of technologies, technological 
consultation, and technological services; and these 
organizations had 16,000 employees, respectively increasing 7.6 
percent and 97.6 percent. The science professionals and 
technicians contingents were further expanded. As of the end of 
1993, state-owned units across the region had 455,000 
specialized technicians of various categories, an increase of 
19,000 persons over the previous year. Of this, 96,000 persons 
were specialized technicians of minority nationalities, an 
increase of 5,000 persons; and 218,000 persons were from the 
natural science profession and technicians, an increase of 9,000 
persons. 
  On the basis of attaching importance to quality, educational 
undertakings of various categories continued to be consolidated 
and developed. The education for minority nationalities was 
further strengthened. A total of 177 postgraduates were 
recruited during the year, an increase of 95 persons over the 
previous year. The year-end number of postgraduates was 373, an 
increase of 113 persons over the previous year. The ordinary 
institutions of higher learning recruited 13,807 students 
engaged in the study of regular and special courses, an increase 
of 3,795 students over the previous year. The year-end number 
of undergraduates reached 15,395, including 3,147 minority 
nationality students, respectively decreasing 7,191 persons and 
1,119 persons from the previous year. The secondary specialized 
schools recruited 20,139 students, an increase of 2,006 students 
over the previous year. The enrollment in these schools reached 
55,905 students, including 14,260 minority nationality students, 
respectively increasing 3,113 students and 655 students. The 
enrollment in secondary vocational schools totaled 140,657 
students, a decrease of 4,451 students. Of this, the enrollment 
in vocational senior high schools was 60,689 students, a drop of 
6,859 students. The enrollment in ordinary senior high schools 
was 171,838 students, including 41,829 minority nationality 
students, respectively decreasing 21,097 students and 2,532 
students. The program of compulsory education continued to be 
popularized. The enrollment in ordinary middle schools was 
820,000 students, including 170,000 minority nationality 
students. The enrollment in primary schools was 236,000 pupils, 
including 520,000 minority nationality pupils. The conditions 
in which primary and middle schools are run continued to 
improve. About 98 percent of school-age children entered 
schools. Appropriate achievements were made in adult education 
for the illiterate. 
  Cultural undertakings made steady headway. By the end of 
1993, Inner Mongolia had 102 film institutions staffed with 
2,074 personnel; and it produced five feature films and dubbed 
30 films in Mongolian. By the end of the year, it had 1,354 
film presenting units; 154 art institutions with 6,748 
personnel; 120 art performing groups, of which 64 were Inner 
Mongolia revolutionary cultural troupes mounted on horseback; 
103 cultural halls; 16 museums; and 137 large archives. It had 
41 radio stations, an increase of three over the preceding year; 
and 52 radio transmitting and relaying stations, increasing by 
5; and the radio coverage was 75 percent. It had 25 television 
stations; 938 television transmitting and relaying stations, an 
increase of 65 over the preceding year; and the television 
coverage was 76 percent, an increase of 2 percentage points. In 
the year, 182.86 million copies of regional, league, and city 
newspapers were published, up 1.2 percent from the preceding 
year, of which 10.34 million copies were in minority nationality 
languages, up 2.0 percent; 13.874 million copies of magazines 
were published, of which 1.479 million copies were in Mongolian, 
down 8.4 and 17.8 percent, respectively; and 67.814 million 
copies of pictures and books were published, down 13.5 percent, 
of which 8.562 million copies were in minority nationality 
languages, up 10.0 percent. 
  Public health further developed. By the end of the year, 
Inner Mongolia had 4,932 health institutions, of which 1,987 
were hospitals, up 3.1 percent from the preceding year. 
Hospitals distributed in rural and pastoral areas totaled 
1,615, up 8.8 percent. The year-end number of sick beds in the 
medical units across the region was 65,000, of which 33,000 were 
in rural and pastoral areas, an increase of 4,000 over the 
preceding year. Medical personnel totaled 100,000 by the end of 
the year, of whom 87,000 were high- and medium-level medical 
personnel. Among the high- and medium-level medical personnel, 
47,000 were doctors, of whom 3,000 were doctors of Mongolian 
medicine. 
  Sports made new headway. At important international and 
domestic contests in 1993, 38 of our athletes broke regional 
records on 91 occasions. At the seventh national games, our 
athletes won 34 medals, of which 10 were gold, and their team 
score was 316.5 points, ranking 15th in the country. At 
Beijing's international marathon, our athlete Hu Gangjun won the 
championships, the first won by China's athlete at this 
important event. By the end of the year, 18.64 million persons 
met the "national standards for physical exercises," an increase 
of 524,000 over the preceding year; and athletes up to the 
established standards totaled 826, an increase of 110, of whom 
102 were of minority nationalities, an increase of 24. 
<H5>  9. Population and Living Standard </H5>
  Family planning yielded fairly good results, and population 
growth was brought under control. Calculated based on the 1993 
regionwide survey on changes of population, Inner Mongolia's 
birth rate was 18.48 per thousand, the mortality rate 6.83 per 
thousand, natural population growth 11.65 per thousand, and 
year-end number of population 22.324 million, an increase of 
259,000, or 1.2 percent, over the 1992 year-end number. 
  The income of both urban and rural residents continued to 
increase and the living standard was further upgraded. The 
region's per capita living income of urban areas reached 1,712 
yuan and showed a 27.3 percent increase over 1992 and an 11 
percent increase excluding the factor of price hikes. The per 
peasant and herdsman net income reached 829 yuan and showed a 
15.3 percent increase over 1992 and a 3.6 percent increase 
excluding the factor of price hikes. Of this net income, that 
of peasants reached 778 yuan and showed a 15.7 percent increase 
over 1992 and a 3.8 percent increase excluding the factor of 
price hikes; as well as that of herdsmen reached 1,164 yuan and 
showed a 13.9 percent increase over 1992 and a 3 percent 
increase excluding the factor of price hikes. 
  The number of durable consumer goods for every hundred urban 
and rural households is as follows:

  Urban employment achieved development in multiple fields, at 
multiple levels, and in multiple economic styles. The 
contingent of staff members and workers was somewhat broadened. 
In 1993 the region made job arrangements for 108,000 jobless 
people. By the end of 1993, the total number of staff members 
and workers reached 3.929 million and showed a 0.4 percent 
increase over 1992. Of this number, that of state units' staff 
members and workers reached 3.042 million and showed a 1.3 
percent increase over 1992; and that of collectively-owned 
units' staff members and workers reached 871,000 and showed a 
3.5 decrease over 1992. 
  The wage level of staff members and workers was further 
upgraded. The bill for annual wages of staff members and workers 
reached 10.87 billion yuan and showed a 21.3 percent increase 
over 1992. Of this wages bill, that of the state units' staff 
members and workers reached 9.03 billion yuan and showed a 22.8 
percent increase over 1992; and that of collectively-owned 
units' staff members and workers reached 1.8 billion yuan and 
showed a 13.4 percent increase over 1992. The region's per 
capita wages of staff members and workers reached 2,772 yuan and 
showed a 19.6 percent increase over 1992. Of these per capita 
wages, that of the state units' staff members and workers 
reached 2,987 yuan and showed a 20.1 percent increase over 1992; 
and that of collectively-owned units' staff members and workers 
reached 2,027 yuan and showed a 15.2 percent increase over 1992. 
  The saving deposits of both urban and rural residents 
increased on a large scale. By the end of 1993, the volume of 
saving deposits made by both urban and rural residents reached 
23.21 billion yuan and showed a 5.31 billion yuan and 29.6 
percent increase over 1992. Residents' awareness of finance and 
investment became strong and the number of shares, bonds, and 
securities purchased by them obviously increased. 
  The housing conditions of both urban and rural residents and 
the water, heating, and gas supply facilities as well as of 
living recreation and social welfare were improved in varying 
degrees.

<F P=106> [Statistical communique on Liaoning Province 1993 national </F>
economic and social development issued by the Liaoning 
Provincial Statistical Bureau] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government, the whole 
province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th 
party congress, extensively carried out all tasks on the "second 
pioneering work," and succeeded in effecting a sustained and 
rapid growth in the national economy. Based on initial 
statistics, the gross national product [GNP] of the year 
totalled 180.45 billion yuan, showing an increase of 13.9 
percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of 
comparable prices. Of this, the GNP of the primary industry 
reached 22.3 billion yuan, up 9.1 percent; the secondary 
industry, 109.22 billion yuan, up 16.5 percent; and the tertiary 
industry, 18.93 billion yuan, up 11.7 percent. The momentum for 
economic development was strengthened, new changes took place in 
the economic pattern, the people's living continued to improved, 
and gratifying results were made in all undertakings. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture and Rural Economy </H5>
  All localities across the province conscientiously 
implemented the party's various economic policies in the rural 
areas, unceasingly deepened rural reform, further readjusted the 
rural industrial structure, accelerated the development of the 
"high- yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming" and 
township enterprises, and achieved breakthrough progress in 
agriculture and the rural economy. The total product of the 
rural society amounted to 182.95 billion yuan during the year, 
up 55.6 percent over the previous year, and its proportion in 
the whole province's total product of society rose from 36.6 
percent to 39.2 percent. 
  Agriculture continued to comprehensively develop. The annual 
agricultural output value totalled 39 billion yuan, up 9.4 
percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of 
comparable prices. Of this, the output value of crop cultivation 
totalled 20.81 billion yuan, up 15.1 percent. 
  Grain production continued to set an all-time record on the 
basis of reaping bumper harvests three years in a row. The 
annual grain output totalled 16.96 million tonnes, an increase 
of 1.276 million tonnes; and the output of major economic crops, 
such as oil-bearing crops, beets, and vegetables, except cotton 
which suffered a decline in production, all increased by varying 
degrees. A bumper fruit harvest was reaped. Of this, the 
output of apples broke the record of 1 million tonnes for the 
first time and reached 1.196 million tonnes. 
  The output of major farm products was as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  New progress was made in forestry and afforestation. The 
annual forestry output value reached 870 million yuan, up 10 
percent over the previous year; the new afforested areas reached 
162,000 hectare (2.43 million mu), up 8 percent; the average 
tree survival rate was 84.4 percent; and 160 million trees were 
planted and 12,000 hectare (177,000 mu) of saplings were 
cultivated on a voluntary basis. New progress was made in the 
five major protection forest systems and the four major 
afforestation projects, and the management of forestry resources 
was further strengthened. 
  Animal husbandry production grew steadily. The annual 
animal husbandry output value totaled 11.16 billion yuan, up 11 
percent from the preceding year. Meat output totaled 1.404 
million tonnes, up 19.1 percent; of which pork output was 1.022 
million tonnes, up 11.8 percent, and beef and mutton output was 
132,000 tonnes, up 59 percent. An increase was registered in 
all the year- end number of pigs, cattle, and goats and sheep in 
stock, which stood at 12.283 million, 1.92 million, and 2.644 
million heads, respectively. 
  Fishery continued to development. The annual output of 
aquatic products totaled 1.517 million tonnes, up 14.7 percent 
from the preceding year. Of the total, seawater products came 
to 1.397 million tonnes, up 13.9 percent; and freshwater 
products 120,000 tonnes, up 25 percent. 
  Investment in agriculture increased and conditions for 
production improved continuously. The annual local financial 
allocation for the expenses on agricultural production totaled 
1.34 billion yuan, up 25.3 percent from the preceding year; and 
the year-end remaining sum of the agricultural loans of 
agricultural banks and credit cooperatives was 10.08 billion 
yuan, up 9.8 percent from the year- end sum of the preceding 
year. Technology on scientific farming was disseminated 
continuously. More than 95 percent of Liaoning's total 
cultivated land was sown to fine-strain crops; standardized 
cultivation of corn and rice was applied to 1.225 million 
hectares (18.37 million mu) of farmland, an increase of 158,000 
hectares (2.37 million mu) over the preceding year; and rational 
application of fertilizer, plastic sheet mulching, interplanting 
of mixed crops, and other applicable technology were applied. 
Water conservation construction was intensified, and farm 
mechanization was upgraded continuously. In the whole year, 410 
million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, 
2,100 km of river dikes were improved, water and soil 
conservation areas increased by 177,000 hectares (2.65 million 
mu), and effective irrigated land increased by 52,000 hectares 
(780,000 mu). The year-end power of farm machines totaled 9.946 
million kw; acreage farmed by machines 2.567 million hectares 
(38.498 million mu), up 49.2 percent; amount of chemical 
fertilizer applied (100 percent effective content equivalent) 
951,000 tonnes, up 5.1 percent; and rural consumption of 
electricity 7.37 billion kw hours [kwh], up 12 percent. 
  Township enterprises, as new growing points of the economy, 
achieved a new leap and simultaneous increase in growth rate and 
economic efficiency. According to the statistics of pertinent 
departments, township enterprises' annual output value totaled 
146.4 billion yuan, up 67.6 percent from the preceding year in 
terms of comparable prices; their profits 10.62 billion yuan, up 
47.3 percent; and the sales taxes and income taxes they should 
pay 5.06 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. By the end of the year, 
the towns and townships whose output value exceeded 100 million 
yuan had increased from 236 in the preceding year to 360, those 
whose output value exceeded 1 billion yuan from 7 to 10, and 
those whose output value exceeded 10 million yuan from 1,065 to 
1,700. Major problems in agriculture and rural economy were the 
rapid growth in the prices of the means of agricultural 
production and the rather low profits from farm products. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In industry, guided by the market, enterprises deepened 
their 
reform, accelerated the transformation of the operating 
mechanism and structural adjustment, and notably accelerated 
their production rate thanks to the growth in investment and 
consumption. The total industrial output value of the 
enterprises at and above the township level came to 267.6 
billion yuan, up 14.8 percent from the preceding year in terms 
of comparable prices; and that of all the enterprises, including 
those at and below the village level, was 349.98 billion yuan, 
up 25.9 percent, the largest annual growth rate since reform and 
opening up started. 
  Industrial enterprises of different ownerships 
comprehensively increased in number, particularly the nonstate 
industrial enterprises. The annual output value of the nonstate 
industrial sector amounted to 166.08 billion yuan, up 50.6 
percent over the previous year, and its proportion in the 
province's total industrial output value rose from 43.2 percent 
to 47.5 percent. Of this, the output value of collective 
industry in the urban and rural areas topped 100 billion yuan 
for the first time and reached 111.23 billion yuan, up 68.4 
percent; that of industrial enterprises of other ownerships with 
Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and 
exclusively foreign-funded enterprises as the mainstay totalled 
19.06 billion yuan, up 43 percent; and that of private 
industrial enterprises in the urban and rural areas totalled 
35.79 billion yuan, up 70.7 percent. The output value of state- 
owned industrial enterprises during the year totalled 183.9 
billion yuan, up 5.3 percent over the previous year. A great 
number of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
entered the market to seek survival and development in the 
course of changing the operational mechanism, and their vitality 
was strengthened. The output value of large- and medium-sized 
industrial enterprises during the year totalled 184.49 billion 
yuan, up 6.5 percent over the previous year. 
  Motivated by investment demands, the heavy industrial sector 
maintained a rapid growth in production. The annual industrial 
output value totalled 277.17 billion yuan, up 28.1 percent over 
the previous year; the production of light industry began to 
pick up steadily, and the annual light industrial output value 
totalled 72.81 billion yuan, up 20 percent. 
  The product mix was further readjusted and the product 
quality improved. Industrial enterprises organized production 
in line with market demands, increased the output of products 
that can find a ready market, and strengthened the development 
of new products. During the year, 5,733 varieties of new 
products were developed, of which, 4,211 varieties were put into 
production; the output value rate of new products rose from 8.2 
percent from the previous year to 8.5 percent; and the product 
quality steadily improved. A sample survey and examination of 
553 batches of industrial products during the year showed that 
384 batches of products were up to standard. The rate of 
up-to-standard products was 73.8 percent, up 4 percent over the 
previous year. 
  The output of major industrial products was as follows:

  Economic results were further increased in enterprises. The 
profits and taxes of the independent accounting industrial 
enterprises reached 26.35 billion yuan, an increase of 59.5 
percent. Of this, profits accounted for 10.37 billion yuan, an 
increase of 1.8 times. The index of the overall economic 
results of the industrial enterprises was 95.6 percent. Of 
this, the industrial product sales rate was 95.6 percent, the 
capital profit and tax rate was 10.1 percent, the added value 
rate of industries was 30.7 percent, the per capita labor 
productivity (calculated in terms of added value) was 13,708 
yuan, all showing increases in varying degrees. Due to the big 
increases in the prices of such intermediate products as raw 
materials and energy resources, the blocked sales of some 
products, and the poor management of some enterprises, the 
number of money-losing enterprises and the amounts of deficits 
still remained high. A total of 4,399 or 19.6 percent of 
industrial enterprises suffered losses and the deficits reached 
5.33 billion yuan. 
  State enterprises made new headway in reform. At the end of 
last year, 553 state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises 
carried out the method for management of five kinds of assets, 
47 large- and medium-sized enterprises organized shareholding 
corporations, the small state-owned enterprises made new strides 
for reforming the property right, 121 enterprises carried out 
the shareholding system, 2,323 town enterprises carried out the 
shareholding cooperative system, 72 enterprises carried out the 
leasing system, 241 enterprises carried out the system of state 
ownership and civilian management, 14 enterprises were auctioned 
off, and six enterprises were closed down and declared 
bankruptcy. Enterprises promoted the change of the managerial 
mechanism through reform and accelerated the pace of sending 
enterprises to markets. 
  The production of the construction trade was noticeably 
accelerated. The total output value of the construction trade 
reached 39.09 billion yuan, an increase of 45.8 percent. Of 
this, the output value of the state-owned construction 
enterprises reached 16.93 billion yuan, an increase of 36.9 
percent; and that of construction enterprises -- other than 
those state-owned -- reached 22.16 billion yuan, an increase of 
53.5 percent. The construction areas of the state-owned 
construction enterprises reached 23.463 million square meters, 
an increase of 18.4 percent. The per capita labor productivity 
(calculated in terms of the total output value) was 31,046 yuan, 
an increase of 33.7 percent. The quality of construction 
projects was improved. 
<H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  The speed of investment in construction items was 
accelerated. The investment in fixed assets was 68.14 billion 
yuan, an increase of 56 percent over the previous year. Of 
this, the investment in local projects reached 49.08 billion 
yuan, an increase of 60.1 percent. Of the investment in fixed 
assets, the investment of state-owned units reached 58.03 
billion yuan, an increase of 59.9 percent; and that of the urban

percent; and that of the urban and rural individuals reached 
3.44 billion yuan, an increase of 11.8 percent. 
  The investment in capital construction increased by a big 
margin. The investment structure was further readjusted. The 
construction of key projects continued to be strengthened. The 
state-owned units invested 26.88 billion yuan in capital 
construction, an increase of 57.3 percent. The investment was 
focused on basic industries, communications and transportation 
industries, urban public service facilities, reconstruction of 
urban districts, infrastructural facilities, and tertiary 
industry. Of the investment made during the year, 13.25 billion 
yuan was used by energy resources and raw materials industries, 
an increase of 77 percent over the previous year; 650 million 
yuan was used by agriculture, an increase of 36 percent; 1.87 
million yuan was used by transportation and communications and 
postal and telecommunications industries, an increase of 60.3

Among the 68 large- and medium- sized capital construction 
projects under construction, nine were completed and 
commissioned, and three single-item projects were commissioned. 
Investment in key construction projects totaled 12.4 billion 
yuan, equivalent to 98.8 percent of the annual plan, and its 
proportion to the investment in capital construction grew from 
43.3 percent to 46.1 percent. However, shortages of 
construction funds and the low rate of the funds in place 
remained conspicuous. 
  Technical transformation of enterprises was accelerated. The 
annual investment of state-owned units in replacement of 
equipment and technical transformation totaled 17.63 billion 
yuan, up 52.9 percent from the preceding year. The investment 
was made mainly in industry, transportation, and post and 
telecommunication. Of the total, 1.66 billion yuan was invested 
in electronic industry, up 6.9 times from the preceding year; 
1.91 billion yuan in energy industry, up 1.4 times; 2.27 billion 
yuan in machinery industry, up 1.1 times; and 2.77 billion yuan 
in transportation, post, and telecommunication, up 82.5 percent. 
Judging from the structure of the investment, investment in 
purchases of equipment and installation projects totaled 9.29 
billion yuan, accounting for 52.7 percent of the investment in 
replacement of equipment and technical transformation; that in 
productive projects totaled 14.05 billion yuan, accounting for 
79.7 percent, of which 2.94 billion yuan was invested in energy 
conservation, increase of variety and patterns, improvement of 
product quality, and treatment of "three wastes," up 10.8 
percent; and that in reconstruction projects totaled 7.58 
billion yuan, up 25.3 percent. Among the 78 key equipment 
replacement and technical transformation projects whose 
investment was above the stipulated norms, which were built in 
the year, 11 were completed and commissioned. The Dalian Hualu 
Electronic Industrial Company and the China Hualu Electronic 
Limited Company established the annual production capacity of 
150,000 video recorders and 1.5 million video recorder fuses, 
becoming China's largest production base for video recorders and 
major components. 
  Investment in construction of commercial houses increased 
substantially. The annual investment totaled 11.17 billion 
yuan, up 1.5 times from the preceding year; and 9.179 million 
square meters were completed in the year, up 45.6 percent. Of 
the total investment, that in residential houses came to 8.69 
billion yuan, up 1.1 times; and 8.08 million square meters were 
completed, up 37.2 percent. 
  In the whole year, 4,019 projects of state-owned units built 
with fixed asset investment were completed and commissioned, of 
which 1,516 were capital construction projects, and 2,503 were 
technical transformation projects. These state-owned units 
built 21.767 million square meters of houses of various types, 
up 23.2 percent from the preceding year; and increased their

<H5>  4. Transportation, Post, and Telecommunication </H5>
  The increase trend continued in transportation. The annual 
volume of cargo transportation by various means totaled 830 
million tonnes, up 2.5 percent from the preceding year. Of the 
total, cargo transported by railways within the boundary was 147 
million tonnes, down 1 percent; that transported by highways 620 
million tonnes, up 3.9 percent; that transported by waterways 
18.82 million tonnes, down 0.6 percent; and cargo and mail

those transported by civil airways within the boundary 1.111 
million, up 14.3 percent. Passengers handled by ports totaled 
4.57 million, up 4.4 percent from the preceding year. 
Contradictions due to the strain on transportation, particularly 
railway transportation, were still prominent. The construction 
of highway networks and ports was further strengthened. A total 
of 2,375 km of roads in counties and townships were paved with 
asphalt, 928 bridges totaling 27,000 meters in length were 
built, and 2,228 km of roadbeds were rebuilt. There were 15,600 
km of high-grade and second high-grade roads at the end of last 
year, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total roads. Five 
berths were newly built (expanded) and 5.7 million tons of 
loading and unloading capacity were newly added.

telephone subscribers, respectively ranking the province sixth 
and fourth in the whole country. The Liaoning section of the 
Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin optical fiber cable project, named as 
"information expressway," is 1,890 km long and has been 
completed. 
<H5>  5. Domestic Market and Goods Prices </H5>
  Consumer goods were in ample supply and the markets for 
consumer goods were brisk. The total volume of retail sales of 
commodities reached 72.08 billion yuan, an increase of 22.3 
percent over the previous year. Of this, the volume of retail 
sales of consumer goods reached 67.23 billion yuan, an increase 
of 24.3 percent; and that of agricultural capital goods reached 
4.85 billion yuan, basically equal to the figure of the previous 
year. Of the volume of retail sales of consumer goods, that in 
cities reached 53.09 billion yuan, an increase of 23.8 percent; 
and that in the areas at or below the county level reached 14.14 
billion yuan, an increase of 26.4 percent. 
  The volume of retail sales of the circulation enterprises of 
various kinds comprehensively increased. Great changes took 
place in the structure of the mainstay of market management. 
Nonpublic sectors of the economy noticeably enhanced their 
roles in the circulation sphere. The volume of retail sales of 
state-owned enterprises increased by 10.4 percent over the 
previous year, that of collective enterprises increased by 15.1 
percent, that of individual and private enterprises increased by 
43.1 percent, that of jointly operated enterprises increased by 
70.4 percent, and the volume of retail sales of products 
directly sold to urbanites by peasants increased by 42.2 
percent. The proportion of the retail sales volume of nonpublic 
sectors of the economy in the volume of retail sales of 
commodities rose from 56 percent to 60.3 percent. The dwellers' 
consumption standing and consumption quality were noticeably 
improved. Foodstuffs of small-sized packs, quick-frozen 
foodstuffs, and gifts continued to be readily marketable. The 
sales volume of expensive woolen cloths, woolen sweaters, 
fashionable dresses, and various kinds of childrens' wear 
increased by a big margin. The sales of color televisions, 
video recorders, video game machines, gold and silver ornaments, 
health care goods, and cosmetics increased in varying degrees. 
  The purchase and marketing on the markets of means of 
production were brisk. The total purchase and marketing volume 
of the means of production of the material supply and marketing 
enterprises during the year reached 98.76 billion yuan, an 
increase of 25.7 percent. Of this, the purchase volume of the 
means of production was 48.38 million yuan, up 28.5 percent; and 
the marketing volume reached 50.38 million yuan, up 23.1 
percent. Of the sales volume of various kinds of means of 
production, the sales of ferrous metals increased 35.8 percent 
over the previous year, machinery and electric equipment, 35 
percent, building materials, 20.4 percent, and nonferrous metals 
17.7 percent. 
  Commodity distribution enterprises continued to deepen 
reform, and the "decontrol of operation, prices, employment, and 
distribution" was universally popularized. Market construction 
was further accelerated. The annual investment in building all 
sorts of markets totalled 1.43 billion yuan, up 49 percent over 
the previous year. By the end of the year, there were 2,807 
consumer goods markets in the urban and rural areas across the 
province, 2,012 of which were comprehensive country fairs, and 
795 special markets; the transactions at the urban and rural 
country fairs totalled 31.33 billion yuan, up 52.2 percent over 
the previous year, which was equivalent to 43.5 percent of 
Liaoning's social commodity retail sales volume. There were 
152 markets of the means of production, an increase of 47 
percent over the previous year. The annual transaction volume 
of the markets of means of production reached 34.82 billion 
yuan, up 79.9 percent. A group of large country fairs with good 
business environment, strong radiation power, and prominent 
features of specialization emerged in all localities across the 
province; and the number of large key markets each with a 
transaction volume exceeding 100 million yuan rose from 28 in 
the previous year to 61. 
  New progress was made in building markets of the essential 
production factors. After consolidation, the money market 
continued to develop, and stock markets with a fair standard 
began to take an initial shape. Fairly rapid progress was seen 
in the development of the personnel and labor markets. At the 
end of the year, 123 personnel exchange organs were set up in 
the province, and 222,000 personnel of various sorts 
participated in the exchange; 1,052 labor markets were 
established, 1.65 million personnel of various descriptions were 
registered, and 1.17 million job-seekers were exchanged or 
arranged at these markets. The technology markets were brisk, 
and the annual transaction volume totalled 2.04 billion, up 54.7 
percent over the previous year. 
  Continued efforts were made to deepen price reform, and the 
proportion of market regulation was further expanded. Of the 
total retail sales volume of social commodities during the year, 
96.6 percent was under market regulation; of the total sales 
volume of the means of production, 87.4 percent was under market 
regulation; and of the total purchasing volume of farm products, 
90.4 percent was under market regulation. Thanks to the 
decontrol of prices of most commodities, the mechanism of 
regulation and control remained relatively stagnant, and the 
rise of market commodity prices was fairly big. The general 
level of retail commodity prices during the year rose 13.5 
percent over the previous year, of which, the retail commodity 
prices rose 14.4 percent in the urban areas and 10.5 percent in 
the rural areas; the prices of consumer goods, agricultural 
means of production, and service items all rose by varying

price of industrial products and the purchasing prices of raw 
materials during the year rose 38.4 percent and 49.9 percent 
respectively over the previous year. 
<H5>  1. Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and Tourism </H5>
  Opening up was further expanded and import and export trade

the proportion of finished industrial products was enhanced. 
The annual export of finished industrial products was $3.24 
billion, up 7.9 percent over the previous year, and its 
proportion in the total exports rose from 48.5 percent in the 
previous year to 52.1 percent, of which the exports of machinery 
and electric products reached $960 million, up 12 percent. 
  The volume of investments made by foreign businessmen and 
firms in the province showed a large-scale increase. The 
province signed the contracts with 4,147 projects of utilizing 
foreign funds in the year, which showed an 83.2 percent increase 
over 1992. The volume of foreign funds involved in the

of enterprises opened by the province in outside places reached 
67 and the total investment involved in these enterprises 
reached $40.99 million. 
  The international tourist business was continuously brisk. 
The province received 219,000 tourists of foreign countries, 
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan in the year, which showed a 17 
percent increase over 1992. The foreign exchange incomes earned 
from the tourist business showed a 14.7 percent increase over 
1992. 
  The speed of building various development zones was 
accelerated and the investment environment was further improved. 
The province possessed 12 national level development zones and 
nine provincial level ones. The acreage designed for various 
development zones in the province is 407 square km. Of this 
acreage, 97 square km of land were used for development. The 
investment made in building infrastructures in the zones reached 
17 billion yuan. The number of foreign-funded enterprises that 
already entered the zones reached 1,486 and the foreign capital 
involved in the contracts of these enterprises reached $5.27 
billion. 
<H5>  7. Finance, Banking, and Insurance Business </H5>
  The province brought about a change to the deficit situation 
prevailing in local finance over the past seven years and 
realized a balance between revenue and spending budgets in the 
year. The annual local financial revenues reached 21.04 billion 
yuan and the province fulfilled the annual budget by 127.8 
percent that showed a 28.7 percent increase over 1992 excluding 
the comparable factors. Of these financial revenues, 20.57 
billion yuan were of the revenues of industrial and commercial 
taxes. The annual local financial spending reached 17.94 
billion yuan and showed a 16 percent increase over 1992. The 
difficult situation prevailing in the county-level finance was 
somewhat improved. The financial revenues scored by 45 counties 
(county-level cities) in the year reached 2.89 billion yuan and 
showed a 41.7 percent increase over 1992. The number of 
counties (county-level cities) whose financial revenues were 
over 100 million yuan increased from two in 1992 to nine in 1993 
and that of those whose financial revenues were over 50 million 
yuan increased from 15 in 1992 to 24 in 1993. Two counties 
(county-level cities) removed their "label" of accepting 
financial subsidies. 
  The financial departments at all levels brought about a 
trend 
of stable financial situation by earnestly implementing the 
central authorities' measures with regard to enhancing and 
improving the macroeconomic readjustment and control. The 
inter-bank lending violating the regulation were cleared up and 
corrected. The various styles of raising funds arbitrarily were 
basically brought under control. The province scored initial 
results in consolidating the financial institutions without 
banking permit. The deposits of various styles showed a stable 
increase. By the end of 1993, the volume of various deposits 
received by the financial institutions across the province 
showed a 26.05 billion yuan increase over that scored at the 
beginning of the year. Of these deposits, those saved by both 
urban and rural people showed a 17.96 billion yuan increase over 
the volume scored at the beginning of the year. The volume of 
various loans showed a 34.7 billion yuan increase over that 
scored at the beginning of the year. The newly-increased loans 
were chiefly used for supporting the large and medium-sized 
enterprises to reorganize their production and to conduct 
technical renovations as well as for supporting agriculture, 
township enterprises, and tertiary industrial enterprises to 
develop their new economic growing points. 
  The insurance service continued to develop. The annual 
volume of premium for domestic insurance totaled 441.68 billion 
yuan, up 7.2 percent from the preceding year. By the end of the 
year, 34,000 enterprises and 607,000 households in Liaoning had

income from personal insurance business 2.32 billion yuan, up 34 
percent; and income from the insurance business involving 
foreigners 280 million yuan, up 26 percent. In the whole year, 
2.32 billion yuan was paid out for domestic and foreign claims 
for losses. 
<H5>  8. Science and Technology, Education, Culture, Public </H5>
Health, and Sports 
  Science and technology made steady headway in the process of 
reform. Liaoning's year-end number of independent scientific 
research institutes of various types was 364; and full-time 
technical personnel of enterprises and institutions numbered 
1.75 million. New achievements were won in scientific research 
and technological development. In the year, 4,282 scientific 
and technological achievements in natural sciences were scored, 
of 1,698 were major ones. Twenty-four achievements won 
state-level awards, of which 16 won state scientific and 
technological progress award and eight state invention award. 
Combination of science and technology with production made new 
headway. A total of 3,051 achievements, or 71.3 percent of the 
total, were directly disseminated and applied. The activities to 
develop agriculture and enterprises through application of 
science and technology were widely extended and yielded fairly 
good results. Development of high and new technology, high- and 
new-tech industries, and development zones was further 
expedited. In the year, 470 projects involving high and new 
technology were arranged, which produced 3.3 billion yuan in 
output value and 690 million yuan in profits and taxes. Reform 
of the scientific and technological system was deepened 
continuously, and a number of scientific research institutes 
engaged in developmental projects pursued development in line 
with market demands, thus increasing their vigor and impetus. 
Nongovernmental scientific research institutes expanded 
rapidly, thus initially changing the unitary scientific research 
system. By the end of the year, nongovernmental scientific 
research institutes in the province had increased to 5,180, and 
their personnel to 72,300; they had finished 4,757 scientific 
research projects, of which 75 were listed as state-level; and 
they had produced 630 million yuan in output value and 170 
million yuan in profits and taxes. Patent work was further 
strengthened. Patent applications totaled 4,793 in the year, up 
2 percent from the preceding year; and 4,302 were approved, up 
85.7 percent. 
  New progress was made in education. Higher educational 
schools and secondary vocational and technical schools 
restructured their curricula and disciplines oriented to the 
market, explored the ways of social support to education, and 
achieved new progress. Ordinary higher educational schools 
enrolled 55,000 students for regular and special courses in the 
year, of whom 23,000 were self-funded students and students 
whose training was entrusted by organizations, up 87 percent 
from the preceding year, and the total number of the students of 
these schools was 156,000. Students of secondary vocational and 
technical schools totaled 235,000. Elementary education was 
intensified continuously, with the students of ordinary middle 
schools totaling 1.912 million and those of primary schools 
3.687 million. Middle school compulsory education was 
implemented in 73.8 percent of the total middle schools of the 
province; and special education and preschool education were 
strengthened continuously. Students attending adult schools of 
various types totaled 606,000. Liaoning's "hope project" 
yielded notable results. More than 10 million yuan was donated 
to the "hope project" in the year to build 40 schools and help 
25,000 school-age children to attend schools, thus initially 
solving the problem that children of poverty-stricken areas were 
unable to go to schools. Arrears of wages to 70,000 teachers in 
37 counties (cities) of the province had been by and large 
resolved by the end of the year. 
  New achievements were won in culture, press, publication, 
and 
radio and television broadcasting. Art performing groups staged 
11,000 performances in the year for an audience of 10.52 
million, and 32 plays or operas won awards at or above the 
provincial level; and film projecting units presented 671,000 
movie shows for an audience of 170 million. Cultural service 
organizations and facilities were improved. The year-end number 
of mass art halls and cultural halls was 132, that of public 
libraries 124, and that of museums 26. Radio and television 
programs were rich and colorful, and more people listened to and 
watched the programs. In the year, 210 million copies of books 
and pictures, 160 million copies of magazines, and 870 million 
copies of newspapers were published, and photo and audio and 
video tape markets were increasingly thriving. 
  Public health developed steadily, and medical conditions and 
services were upgraded. By the end of the year, Liaoning had 
7,132 public health institutes, of which 2,039 were hospitals; 
203,000 sick beds, of which 182,000 were in hospitals; and 
233,000 full-time medical personnel, of whom 93,000 were 
doctors. Capacity for preventing and treating endemic and 
occupational diseases was further improved; food hygiene, 
medicine supervision, and planned inoculation for children were 
strengthened; and urban sanitation took on a new look. Rural 
health care networks were improved continuously. By the end of 
the year, Liaoning had 819 town and township health centers, 97 
percent of its villages had established medical stations, and 
medical equipment level had been raised. 
  Bumper harvests were won in competitive sports. Liaoning's 
athletes won 155 gold medals at important contests at home and 
abroad. Fourteen athletes broke 20 world records on 30 
occasions, and 18 won world championships on 24 occasions; 18 
broke 25 Asian records on 50 occasions, and 35 won 37 Asian 
championships; and 30 broke 32 national records on 75 occasions, 
and 94 won national championships. At the seven national games, 
Liaoning's athletes worked hard and ranked first in the total 
number of medals, the total number of gold medals, and the team 
score. Five of our athletes with the family name of Ma, who 
shocked the world sports circles, broke three world records on 
13 occasions; our men's soccer team won the tenth championships 
in a row; our women's volleyball team won the gold medal at the 
national games for the first time; and our women's swimming team 
won the first place in women's group event for the first time. 
Mass sports activities continued to develop vigorously, and 
people's physical quality improved. 
  Population and People's Lives 
  The ample survey on the changes in the province's population 
showed that the population birth rate was 12.43 per thousand, 
the mortality rate was 6.11 per thousand, and the population 
natural growth rate was 6.32 per thousand. If calculated in 
this way, the province's population was 40.415 million at the 
end of the year, an increase of 255,000 people over the previous 
year. 
  The income of urban and rural people continued to increase. 
A sample survey showed that the urbanites' per capita spendable 
income came to 2,065 yuan, an increase of 18.8 percent over the 
previous year (if factors for price hikes were deducted, the 
real increase was 1.8 percent.) The proportion of the urban 
households with more than 3,000 yuan of spendable income for 
daily lives rose from 7.2 percent in 1992 to 12.3 percent and 
that with less than 1,000 yuan of spendable income for daily 
lives was reduced from 5.8 percent to 3.3 percent. The 
urbanites' per capita expenses in daily lives was 1,977 yuan, an 
increase of 20.6 percent. It was the first time that the per 
capita net income of the peasants surpassed 1,000 yuan in 1993 
and reached 1,161 yuan, an increase of 16.7 percent (if factors 
for price hikes were deducted, the real increase was 4.1 
percent.) The proportion of the peasant households whose per 
capita net income was more than 1,500 yuan rose from 15.6 
percent in the previous year to 23.8 percent. The proportion of 
the peasants households whose per capita net income was less 
than 500 yuan was reduced from 12.4 percent to 8.6 percent. The 
peasants' per capita expenses in daily lives was 940 yuan, an 
increase of 17.6 percent. 
  Reform in the labor sphere was steadily carried out. As of 
the end of 1993, 1,723 enterprises reformed their labor 
personnel affairs, wage, and distribution systems and some 
necessary systems. Some 1.463 million staff members and workers 
were involved in this reform. The social security system with 
retirement, employment, and medical guarantees constituting the 
mainstay was smoothly carried out. At the end of the year, 97 
percent of the state-owned enterprises and 85 percent of the 
collective enterprises carried out the staff and worker 
retirement system involving 6.347 million staff members and 
workers, an increase of 21.4 percent over the previous year. At 
the end of last year, there were 10.45 million staff members and 
workers; and there were 719,000 urban individual workers, an 
increase of 155,000 persons over the corresponding period of 
last year. 
  The urbanites continued to improve their living standard. 
The per capita living area of urbanites rose from 6.8 square 
meters in 1992 to 7.1 square meters at the end of 1993. Most of 
the urban households with special living difficulties, whose per 
capita living area were less than 2 square meters, improved 
their living conditions. The per capita living area of rural 
people rose from 17.5 square meters to 18.5 square meters. The 
number of expensive durable consumer goods possessed by the 
urban and rural households noticeably increased. Social welfare 
undertakings were further developed. At the end of the year, 
social welfare units across the province had 44,000 beds and 
took in 34,000 people. The social welfare enterprises steadily 
increased their production and economic results. Environmental 
protection, environmental sanitation, and garden greenery work 
were further strengthened. The people's environment was further 
improved.

<F P=106> ["Statistical Communique on Shanghai's Economic and Social </F>
Development in 1993, by the Shanghai Municipal Statistical 
Bureau (9 February 1994)"] 
  [Text] In 1993, all people in Shanghai Municipality 
implemented the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress 
in an all-round manner; conscientiously carried out various 
measures adopted by the central authorities on strengthening and 
improving macroeconomic regulation and control; emancipated 
their minds; sought truth from facts; and seized the opportunity 
to do their work in a down-to-earth manner and to forge ahead 
under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and 
Municipal People's Government and under the guidance of the 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Reform of the economic system deepened day by day over the past 
year. Meanwhile, Shanghai quickly opened its doors wider to 
other localities at home and to the outside world; achieved 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [guo min jing 
ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; accelerated Pudong's 
development; sped up the construction of infrastructure projects 
in urban areas; continued to develop science, education, 
culture, public health, and various other social undertakings; 
and kept improving the living standards of the people in both 
urban and rural areas. According to a preliminary estimate, the 
municipality produced 150,993 million yuan's worth of gross 
national product [GNP] in 1993. Calculated in terms of 
comparable prices, the figure posted a growth rate of 14.9 
percent over 1992. 
  The main problems existing in social and economic 
development 
were as follows: some enterprises' economic returns dropped due 
to various cost-push factors; commodity prices increased by a 
comparatively large margin; a number of households with low 
income found it difficult to make ends meet; and transportation 
remained a conspicuous problem for urban residents. 
<H5>  1. The Primary Industry </H5>
  In 1993, the municipality's primary industry increased its 
output value by 3.5 billion yuan, down 3 percent from 1992. The 
percentage it captured of the GNP declined from 3.1 percent in 
1992 to 2.3 percent. 
  Also in 1993, Shanghai continued to readjust the internal 
structure of its agricultural sector and develop agriculture in 
the suburban areas of large cities. The added value of the 
agricultural sector for the entire year stood at 9,487 million 
yuan, down 4 percent from 1992. Among them, crop farming 
industry churned out a total output value of 4,016 million yuan, 
down 6.5 percent; the animal husbandry posted a total output 
value of 4,341 million yuan, a figure basically at the same 
level of 1992's; and the fishery industry posted a total output 
value of 1,079 million yuan, down 6.7 percent from that of 1992. 
Shanghai maintained a relatively high level of production and 
supply of major agricultural and sideline products. However, 
due to a decrease in sown areas and other reasons, the output of 
some farm and sideline products was lower to a various extent 
than 1992. 
  The output of major agricultural and sideline products is 
listed as follows:

  As of the end of 1993, counties in suburban areas owned farm 
machinery with a total motor power of 1.703 million kilowatts 
and 10,400 large and medium-sized tractors. In 1993, a total 
quantity of 195,000 tonnes (converted quantity actually used) of 
chemical fertilizers were used; the figure showed an increase of 
14 percent from 1992. Rural areas consumed 5 billion kwh's 
electricity in 1993, up 17.4 percent from 1992. 
  2. The Secondary Industry 
  In 1993, the city's secondary industry increased its output 
value to 90,286 million yuan, up 16,7 percent over the previous 
year; the industrial sector to 85,401 million yuan, up 16.8 
percent; the construction sector to 4,885 million yuan, up 14.3 
percent; and the proportion of secondary industry's output value 
dropped to 59.8 percent from 60.8 percent of the GNP in the 
preceding year. 
  Industry: The city's industrial sector seized the good 
opportunity of economic development to accelerate transformation 
of enterprises' operating mechanisms. They firmly set their 
eyes on the marketplace, took demand as the guide, linked up 
manufacturing with marketing, and experienced sustained and fast 
growth. Industrial output for the whole year was 327,214 million 
yuan, up 18.3 percent over the previous year. The sales volume 
for the whole year was 323,744 million, up 20.1 percent. Of the 
total industrial sales volume, that of state-owned enterprises 
was 173,389 million yuan, up 2.3 percent over the previous year, 
and of collectively- owned industry 60,711 million yuan, up 31.6 
percent. The industrial sales volume of other types of 
industrial establishments was 89,644 million yuan, up 51.9 
percent; of which, the industrial sales volume of 
foreign-invested enterprises accounted for 54,356 million yuan, 
up 65.4 percent. The sale rate of industrial products for the 
whole year was 98.9 percent, up 0.8 percentage point over the 
previous year; of which, the rate for heavy industry was 98.9 
percent and of light industry 99 percent. The value of export 
goods delivered during the year was 38,848 million yuan, up 27.4 
percent over the previous year. 
  Industrial restructuring picked up pace. Spurred by demand, 
heavy industry displayed a momentum of accelerated development. 
Heavy industry and the chemical industry became more pronounced 
in Shanghai. The sales volume of light industrial goods for the 
whole year was 136,953 million yuan, up 16.2 percent over the 
previous year. The sales volume of heavy industry was 186,791 
million yuan, up 23.6 percent. Pillar industries such as 
automobiles, communications, power equipment, computers, and 
home appliances grew quickly. The sales volume of automobiles 
for the whole year was 31.1 billion yuan, up 41.8 percent over 
the previous year. In communications, a new structure was 
dominated by products in five categories -- program-controlled 
telephone exchanges, fiber-optic communications, mobile 
communications, faxes, and satellite communications. The sales 
volume of the communications sector for the whole year was 6,814 
million yuan, doubling that of 1992. The output of digital 
program-controlled telephone exchanges, large- scale integrated 
circuits, air conditioners, and VCRs rose sharply.

  Industrial economic efficiency was steadily upgraded. In 
1993, the profit rate of the municipality's industrial sectors 
was 15.26 percent, up 1.42 percent over that of the previous 
year; and the overall labor force productivity was 25,400 yuan 
per person, up 58.2 percent over the previous year. The total 
profit of the municipality's industrial enterprises with 
independent accounting was 38.296 billion yuan. 
  Enterprise reform continued extensively. State-owned 
industrial enterprises comprehensively promoted various reform 
experiments, with the majority implementing labor, personnel, 
and distribution systems reform. About one-third of state-owned 
enterprises reached their initial goals of changing operating 
mechanisms. At the end of the year, the municipality had 56 
shareholding industrial enterprises. In various localities, 
1,118 state-owned industrial enterprises, or 82.9 percent of the 
total number, implemented the overall labor contract system or 
job contract system; and the number of workers involved was 
1,492,200, or 97.5 percent of the total number. In 1993, 
bankruptcy tests were carried out for enterprises; over 100 with 
poor economic efficiency or which were incapable of competing in 
the market were annexed. The change in enterprise operating 
mechanisms quickened the pace of gearing enterprises toward the 
market. 
  Construction industry: In 1993, following the promotion of 
Shanghai's large-scale urban construction and Pudong's 
development, the scale of investment was further enlarged. 
Shanghai's construction enterprises seized the excellent 
development opportunity, further deepened their internal 
restructuring, and quickened the speed of construction projects, 
resulting in a comprehensive growth of various major production 
indices. In the municipality, the total output value of the 
construction industry was 17.879 billion yuan, up 51.9 percent 
over the previous year. Of these, state-owned enterprises' 
output value was 12.322 billion yuan, up 50.6 percent; and that 
of collective-owned enterprises was 555.7 million yuan, up 54.7 
million yuan. The total construction area of the municipality's 
building enterprises was 27.3644 million sq m, up 6.5283 million 
sq m; and the construction area completed was 10.8911 million sq 
m, up 2.2862 million sq m. 
  The construction industry took measures to deepen reform and 
raise efficiency. The municipality's building enterprises had 
14,000 construction projects, and various kinds of contract 
responsibility systems were applied for 10,300 of them, or 73.5 
percent of the total number of construction projects. Of the 
contract responsibility systems, the bidding system was used for 
4,935 projects, or 35.2 percent of the total. Economic 
efficiency further improved. Overall labor productivity, 
calculated on the basis of total output value, was 41,500 yuan 
per person, an increase of 52.1 percent over the previous year. 
  3. The Tertiary Industry 
  Shanghai's tertiary industry entered a new round of 
accelerated development in 1993. Its output value for the whole 
year was 57,207 million yuan, or 13.2 percent over the previous 
year, which accounted for 37.9 percent of Shanghai's gross 
production, up 1.8 percent over the preceding year. Within the 
tertiary industry, the output value of transport, post and 
telecommunications was 12,657 million yuan, an increase of 9.4 
percent; the output value of commerce, catering services, and 
materials supply and marketing was 14,963 million yuan, an 
increase 15.4 percent; and the output value of banking and 
insurance business was 14,061 million yuan, an increase of 16.8 
percent. 
  Transport, post and telecommunications: As the economy grew, 
passenger and freight shipments of Shanghai's railway, waterway, 
airway, and other means of transportation, as well as post and 
telecommunications all reported an increase in their business 
volume. 
  The volume of transportation by various means was as 
follows:

  Post and telecommunications businesses developed at an 
accelerated pace. Post and telecommunications business volume 
for the whole year of 1993 reached 2.86 billion yuan, an 
increase of 54.4 percent over the previous year. A total of 391 
million pieces of mail were delivered, an increase of 23.3 
percent. Of the total, 886,000 were domestic express delivery, 
up 77.9 percent, and 397,000 were international express 
delivery, up 39.3 percent. Newspapers and periodicals totaling 
1.09 billion copies were distributed, an increase of 2.2 percent 
over the preceding year. Long distance telephone calls totaling 
226 million were made, up 73.5 percent. Of the total, 
international long distance calls, and calls from and to Hong 
Kong and Macao reached 17.47 million, an increase of 67.3 
percent. During the year, all telephone systems in the Shanghai 
area achieved automation. The number of urban telephone 
subscribers increased by 271,300, while the number of rural 
subscribers increased by 43,200. As of the end of 1993, the 
municipality has a total of 1,500,000 telephone lines and 
1,082,000 telephone subscribers, of which 935,000 were urban 
subscribers and 147,000 were rural subscribers. At the same 
time, mobile telephone service continued to expand. As of the 
end of 1993, cellular phone subscribers reached 43,000, an 
increase of 31,600 as compared with that as of the end of 1992. 
Telephone pager subscribers totaled 322,000, an increase of 
166,000. 
  Domestic trade: Shanghai stepped up cultivation and 
construction of large modern markets and deepened the reform of 
enterprises in the circulation area in 1993. It initiated 
"six-decisionmaking" reform in the municipality's 700 large and 
medium-sized commercial enterprises and set up three 
multi-purpose corporations, 28 group companies, and 19 
stockholding companies. Having established a metal exchange, a 
coal exchange, and other capital goods exchange markets, the 
municipality successively established a number of other capital 
and consumer goods exchange markets, including a petroleum 
exchange, grain and edible oil exchange, agricultural capital 
goods exchange, meat commodity wholesale market, chemical 
commodity exchange, vehicle exchange, and building materials 
exchange. Business was brisk in these large markets, with the 
metal exchange reporting a transaction volume totaling 388.9 
billion yuan for the year. These markets were not only capable 
of handling large transactions but also became more standardized 
in their operations. As a result, they were able to play a 
better resources distribution role in the development of the 
socialist market economy. Some of them even began to serve as a 
"barometer" of the economy and a "monitor" of commodity prices. 
  The supply of consumer goods was ample, and the market also 
brisk. The total value of retail sales of commodities for the 
whole year reached 65.351 billion yuan, an increase of 33.5 
percent over the previous year. The real increase was 14.4 
percent if price increases are deducted. Of the total retail 
sales of commodities, the retail sales of agricultural means of 
production totaled 2.92 billion yuan, an increase of 19 percent 
over the previous year, and the retail sales of consumer goods 
reached 62.431 billion yuan, up 34.3 percent. Of the total 
retail sales of consumer goods, the sales in urban areas totaled 
48.772 billion yuan, an increase of 35.9 percent over the 
previous year, and in rural areas reached 13.659 billion yuan, 
up 28.9 percent. 
  Overall increases were registered in the retail sales of 
commodities by state-owned, collective, and individual 
commercial units. Sales by state-owned retail units reached 
34.547 billion yuan, an increase of 35.5 percent over the 
previous year; sales by collective units reached 22.73 billion 
yuan, an increase of 30.1 percent; and sales by individual units 
reached 13.659 billion yuan, an increase of 28.9 percent. 
  The rate of increase of institutional consumption was lower 
than that of residents. The proportion of consumption for 
clothing and other consumer goods increased in 1993. Of the 
total amount of retail sales of consumer goods in 1993, the 
amount of institutional consumption was 11.845 billion yuan, an 
increase of 18.8 percent over the previous year; and the amount 
of residents' consumption was 50.586 billion yuan, an increase 
of 38.6 percent over. The proportion of residents' consumption 
rose from 78.5 percent in 1992 to 81 percent last year. The 
total amount of food products consumed in 1993 was 24.513

was 6.1 percent if price increases are deducted. The total 
value of sales of clothing items was 9.39 billion yuan, 
increasing by 40.1 percent, with the real increase being 17.5

was 28.042 billion yuan, an increase of 38.3 percent, with the 
real increase being 24.8 percent if price increases are

goods other than food products accounted for 60 percent of the 
total amount of sales of all consumer goods, increasing by 
nearly 2 percent as compared with the previous year. 
  The sales of major and high grade durable consumer goods 
rose 
by a great extent. The sales of color TV sets increased by 34.2 
percent as compared with the previous year, the sales of 
refrigerators increased by 16.8 percent, of washing machines by 
24.6 percent, of bicycles by 31.7 percent, of gold ornaments by 
71.2 percent, and of air conditioners by 5.9 percent. 
  Finance and Insurance: The banking and insurance business 
developed rapidly to cope with the needs of economic 
development. At the end of 1993, the total amount of savings 
deposits increased by 35.669 billion yuan as compared with that 
at the beginning of 1993. The total balance of bank loans at 
the end of 1993 was 29.483 billion yuan more than at the

expand. According to customs statistics, a total of $30.93 
billion in import and export commodities went through Shanghai's 
ports in 1993, an increase of 23 percent over the preceding

165 countries and regions visited Shanghai, roughly the same as 
in the previous year. Of the total, 852,900 were foreigners, up 
9.2 percent, while 378,900 were Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
compatriots, a drop of 14.8 percent. Foreign exchange earnings 
from tourism totaled 4,541 million yuan (in Renminbi foreign 
exchange certificates), an increase of 43.7 percent. 
  Science and technology, education, and culture: New progress 
was made in science and technology. According to initial 
estimates, Shanghai's 1993 research and development expenditures 
accounted for 1.36 percent or so of its gross production. As of 
the end of 1993, Shanghai's state-owned enterprises and 
institutions had 888,800 technological personnel in different 
categories. The municipality scored 1,995 major scientific and 
technological achievements in 1993, of which five were first in

technology exchange was set up during the year. Some 25,500 
technology contracts worth 2,032 million yuan were signed; the 
amount represented an increase of 33.3 percent over the 
preceding year. The municipality also accelerated the pace of 
reforming Shanghai's science and technology management 
structure, and adopted better policies and measures to 
industrialize its scientific and technological achievements. 
  Shanghai achieved new developments in educational 
undertakings. To meet the needs of various personnel due to 
socialist market economic development, institutes of higher 
learning and middle-level special schools continued to quicken 
the readjustment of their operations and courses. Various types 
of on- the-job training at various levels and further education 
developed well; educational management system reform continued 
to be deepened; new progress was made in student enrollment and 
graduate employment system reform; and various kinds of school 
operational systems were further improved. In the whole year, 
Shanghai recruited 4,282 graduate students, up 16.7 percent over 
that of the previous year; and its general institutes of higher 
learning recruited 43,600 students for regular and professional 
courses, up 16.5 percent. Of these, institutes of higher

  Cultural, press, publishing, broadcasting, and television 
sectors prospered and enriched the people's spiritual and

socialist spiritual civilization. As of the end of the year, 
Shanghai had 462 movie screening units, including 242 theaters

Shanghai's athletes worked hard to win glory for the country, 
with eight athletes breaking eight world records. At the 
Seventh National Games, Shanghai's athletes won 29 gold, 22 
silver, and 16 bronze medals, placing them third overall in the 
number of gold medals won and total group points. 
  4. The Development of Pudong 
  In 1993, the construction of infrastructure facilities and 
development of functional facilities were stepped up in the 
Pudong New District. Various economic indexes rose rapidly, 
with the extent of increase significantly higher than the 
average of the whole municipality. The gross national product 
in the district reached 16.4 billion yuan during 1993, an 
increase of 30.2 percent based on comparable prices. Of which, 
the value of tertiary industry was 4.743 billion yuan, an 
increase of 46.6 percent. The gross sales value of industrial 
output during 1993 was 57.78 billion yuan [as published], an 
increase of 28.7 percent over the previous year, and the total 
value of sales of industrial products reached 57.207 billion 
yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent. The total amount of retail 
sales of commodities in society was 4.192 billion yuan, an 
increase of 40.1 percent. The total amount of fixed assets 
investment was 16.5 billion yuan, increasing by 120 percent. 
With the exception of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, the 10 major 
infrastructure construction projects of the first phase were all 
completed two years ahead of schedule. The goal of developing 
selected key areas was also overfulfilled. The area of "seven 
through and one flat" ["qi tong yi ping 0003 6639 0001 1627"] 
was expanded to 11.8 square kilometers. The first phase 
2-square kilometer development project at the Waigaoqiao free 
tax zone has been completed for operation. The construction of 
50 buildings at the Lujiazui financial and trade district was 
started. The number of foreign and domestic investment projects 
in the Jinqiao export processing zone has exceeded 200. The 
functions of the export- oriented economy can now be seen in the 
Pudong New District where special stress is laid on the 
development of finance and trade, and processing of items for 
export. The number of direct investment projects by foreign 
businessmen reached 924 in 1993, an increase of 73 percent over 
the previous year. The total amount of foreign capital absorbed 
in the district reached $1.729 billion, an increase of 34 
percent. The total amount of foreign trade export reached $1.02 
billion, an increase of 13.2 percent. 
  The vigorous functional development and further improvement 
of the investment environment in the Pudong New District have 
also promoted the development of enterprises with lateral ties 
at home. In 1993, 1,727 projects which have links with other 
enterprises at home were approved with a total investment of 
13.59 billion yuan. Of which 12.93 billion yuan was invested by 
enterprises in other localities, accounting for 95.6 percent of 
total investment. 
<H5>  5. Fixed Assets Investment </H5>
  In 1993, stress was laid on adjusting the structure in the 
municipality and great efforts were made to improve the 
investment structure. The total amount of investment in 1993 
reached 62.495 billion yuan, an increase of 74.9 percent over 
the previous year. Of which, state owned enterprises invested 
50.639 billion yuan, an increase of 92.6 percent over that of 
1992; collective enterprises invested 7.713 billion yuan, an 
increase of 20.2 percent over 1992; and private investment 
totaled 1.913 billion yuan, an increase of 9 percent. The 
amount of investment for commercialized houses was 1.23 billion 
yuan, an increase of 75.5 percent. Of the fixed assets 
investment in the municipality, 12.417 billion yuan was invested 
for central level projects, an increase of 77.2 percent over the 
previous year and 41.769 billion yuan was invested for local 
projects, an increase of 94.9 percent over the previous year. 
  In restructuring the investment pattern, preferential 
treatment was given to: 1) Tertiary industries: In 1993, 
29.608 billion yuan, or an increase of 110 percent over the year 
before, was invested in tertiary industries; 2) the New Pudong 
District: During 1993, 16.5 billion yuan, or an increase of 120 
percent over the year before, was investment in the New Pudong 
District; and 3) major construction projects: 14.222 billion 
yuan, or 26.2 percent of the city's total investment, was 
invested in 46 ongoing major construction projects, which 
accounted for 0.8 percent of the total number of construction 
projects in the city in 1993. 
  Better results were achieved from investment restructuring. 
In 1993, state units completed 2,385 projects of fixed assets 
and 47.1 of them were commissioned into operation; the floor 
space of assorted buildings completed reached 11.246 million 
square meters, and 29.2 percent of buildings were completed. Of 
the newly completed fixed assets, which worth 31.476 billion 
yuan, 58.1 percent of them were commissioned to use. 
<H5>  6. Municipal Construction </H5>
  The building of the municipal infrastructure for improving 
municipal communications proceeded in a big way in 1993. A 
total of 16.419 billion yuan, or an increase of 94.7 percent 
over that of the preceding year, was spent on building the 
municipal infrastructure, such as roads, power and gas supply 
systems, sewage treatment system, and postal and 
telecommunications systems. Major municipal construction 
projects completed one after another were the Yangpu Bridge, 
main structures of 13 stations of the route one subway, Luoshan 
Road overpass, Longyang Road overpass, Wusong Bridge, expansion 
of the Jiangsu Road, second-stage reconstruction of the traffic 
system along the bund, Pudong section of the inner ring, 
first-stage construction of the Puxi overpass of the inner ring, 
extension of the eastern section of the Shanghai-Jiaxing 
Expressway, first-stage construction of the main sewage 
treatment project, Waigaoqiao port project, Lengqiao waterworks, 
and Rihui Port reclamation and pipeline installation projects. 
  The reconstruction of the old district was expedited in 1993 
owing to the funds raised through various channels. Unsafe 
buildings and shelters with a total floor space of 1.36 million 
square meters were pulled down and removed. 
  The development of public municipal services made new 
headway. By the end of the year the city had 450 public 
transportation routes, or 14 more than those at the end of 1992; 
7,037 vehicles, or 200 more than those at the end of 1992, for 
public transportation; and 31,000 rental cars, or 13,000 more 
than those at the end of 1992. However, because road 
construction lagged behind the needs of social and economic 
development for a long time, as well as the increase of vehicles 
and sizable road construction projects in downtown areas, 
traffic congestion remained an outstanding problem in urban 
areas. In 1993, public means of transportation transported a 
total of 5.6 billion passengers, or 15.34 million passengers 
daily on the average; 1.351 billion tonnes of running water -- 
including 714 million tonnes of running water for household use 
-- were provided, or an increase of 4.7 percent over that of the 
preceding year; and coal gas and liquified natural gas were 
delivered to an additional 237,710 households through pipelines, 
setting a new record of annual increase. In 1993, a total of 
15.7 billion cubic meters of coal gas, or 6.9 percent more than 
that of the preceding year, was supplied. 
  More wooded areas were developed in urban areas. By the end 
of 1993, urban areas had 927.81 hectares of public parks as 
result of the development of 157.54 hectares of wooded areas of 
all types. 
<H5>  7. Commodity Prices </H5>
  To keep pace with the development of the socialist market 
economy, new headway was made in reforming the pricing and price 
management structures in 1993. More authority of price 
management was released, the scope of state-set prices became 
even smaller, and the market played a bigger role in regulating 
prices. In 1993, the purchasing and selling prices of grain and 
cooking oil were decontrolled, the use of coupons for purchasing 
grain and cooking oil was eliminated, and prices of coal gas, 
electricity, and waters and public transportation facilities as 
well as certain services were readjusted. 
  In 1993, the price index of consumer goods in Shanghai was 
117.5 -- 121.1 for food, 119.2 for clothing, 108.5 for goods of 
daily use, 99.2 for educational and recreational goods, 105.5 
for books and magazines, 107.6 for pharmaceuticals and medical 
goods; 159.7 for building and decorating materials; and 157.3 
for fuels. 
  The index of people's living cost in 1993 was 120.2, and the 
index of service charges was 138.3. 
  8. Population and the People's Livelihood 
  Preliminary statistics show that, by the end of 1993, 12.94 
million people had had their domiciles registered in Shanghai 
(but according to samplings conducted among permanent residents, 
the number of population by the end of 1993 should be 13.49 
million), the birthrate was 6.5 per thousand, the mortality rate 
was 7.3 per thousand, and the natural growth rate was minus 0.8 
per thousand. 
  By the end of 1993, Shanghai had 4,902,400 workers and staff 
members, a decrease of 209,600; collectively-owned units had 
910,700 workers and staff members, a decrease of 68,100; units 
of other forms of ownership had 235,500 workers and staff 
members, an increase of 68,500; and the number of independent 
workers in cities and towns had reached 62,700, an increase of 
2,800. In 1993, 170,900 people were given jobs in Shanghai or 
nearby towns. 
  The total payroll of Shanghai's workers and staff members in 
1993 was 27.716 billion yuan, an increase of 27.6 percent over 
that a year ago, and workers' average per capita income was 
5,600 yuan, an increase of 31.2 percent. After allowing for the 
rise of living cost, the actual increase was 9.1 percent. The 
net per capita annual income of peasants in the outskirts was 
2,650 yuan, or 19 percent higher than a year before. After 
allowing for commodity price rises, the actual increase was 4 
percent. The amount of money saved by urban and rural residents 
continued to grow. Their saving at the end of 1993 reached 
57.793 billion yuan. 
  People's living conditions continued to improve. In 1993, 
housing projects involving a total investment of 7.599 billion 
yuan was completed. That was an increase of 70 percent over a 
year ago. The completion of living quarters with a total floor 
space of 6.165 million square meters -- a record high in 
Shanghai -- exceeded the set target of six million cubic meters.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Shanxi Provincial Statistics Bureau on </F>
1 March 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by Shanxi Provincial 
Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development 
Statistics in 1993"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was the first in which Shanxi 
Province pushed forward with all-out effort to implement the 
strategy for its economy to enter a new stage. In the past 
year, under the correct leadership of the CPC provincial 
committee and the provincial government, people across the whole 
province made serious efforts, and with increasing the strength 
of reform and opening-up and the speeding up of economic 
construction as the predominate style, achieved remarkable 
successes in reform and opening up. The national economy grew 
in a sustained, healthy, and rapid manner, and new progress was 
made in various economic projects and social undertakings. 
Measures for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control 
resulted in gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment 
of the whole province, and the magnificent cause of building the 
system of a socialist market economy made an encouraging step 
forward. According to preliminary statistics, gross domestic 
product (GDP) of the whole province hit the target of 63.22 
billion yuan, an increase of 12.2 percent over the previous 
year. However, in the course of rapid economic development and 
transformation from the old to the new system, there were 
nevertheless some contradictions and problems in economic life, 
and the task of intensifying reform and strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control remained extremely arduous. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and 
fishery 
in the province continued to grow, and the situation of 
agricultural production was gratifying. Agricultural added 
value for the whole year amounted to 9.5 billion yuan, an 
increase of 10.6 percent over that of the previous year, 
accounting for 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). 
Total agricultural output value reached 14.5 billion yuan 
(calculated by 1990 constant price), up by 9.6 percent. 
  The production of grain hit an all-time high. In 1993, 
various localities in the province seriously implemented various 
policies of the central authorities for strengthening 
agriculture and rural work, took a number of effective measures 
for strengthening agriculture, continued to take preferential 
measures for agriculture in capital input, reduced the burdens 
of peasants, enacted price ceilings, limited the prices of grain 
and major varieties of the means of production for agricultural 
use, increased the scientific and technological content of grain 
production in many aspects, and brought about a bumper harvest 
in grain production. According to substantial data from a 
sample survey, total grain output from the whole province in 
1993 was 9.902 billion kg, an increase of 15.4 percent over the 
previous year, and an increase of 2.2 percent over the output of 
9.69 billion kg in 1990, the previous high. In grain output, 
the total output of summer grain crops amounted to 3.364 billion 
kg, an increase of 18.2 percent over the previous year, and an 
increase of 2.3 percent over the output in 1990, the previous 
high. The total output of autumn grain crops amounted to 6.538 
billion kg, an increase of 13.9 percent over the previous year, 
and an increase of 2.1 percent over 1990, the previous high. 
There was also a varying degree of production of oil-bearing 
crops, beets, and other cash crops. Areas sown to cotton were 
reduced, and total output dropped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Afforestation work continued to strengthen. Afforestation 
areas across the whole province in 1993 (calculated at an 85 
percent survival rate) reached 3.665 million mu, an increase of 
210,000 mu over the previous year, up by 5.8 percent. New 
seedling areas amounted to 161,000 mu, an increase of 21,000 mu, 
up by 15 percent. A total of 207.271 million trees were planted 
by houses, villages, roadsides, and bodies of water. 
  There was an overall growth of production in animal 
husbandry. In 1993, various localities in the province 
vigorously developed animal husbandry and looked upon it as 
important method for increasing peasants' income and speeding up 
the process of leading a comfortable life. They increased the 
strength of developing animal husbandry by science and 
technology and intensifying reform of the management structure 
of animal husbandry with the state, the collectives, and 
individuals going ahead in concerted effort, which led to 
further raising the level of specialized husbandry, and the 
constant expansion of production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fresh water breeding continued to develop. In 1993 the 
output of aquatic products in the whole province reached 14,000 
tons, an increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year. 
  The mechanization and electrification level of agricultural 
production continued to rise. At the end of 1993, the whole 
province possessed 12.118 million kwh of total power for 
agricultural machinery, an increase of 5.1 percent over the 
previous year. It possessed 28,000 large and medium-sized 
tractors, down by 7.1 percent; 213,000 small tractors, up by 3 
percent; 47,000 trucks for agricultural use, up by 3.9 percent; 
1.421 million kwh of irrigation and drainage power machinery, up 
by 0.9 percent. The amount of chemical fertilizer applied for 
agricultural use in the whole year (conversion net) was 674,000 
tons, an increase of 5.2 percent over the previous year; the 
amount of electricity used in rural areas was 3.75 billion kwh, 
up by 10.6 percent; newly increased effective acreage under 
irrigation amounted to 206,000 mu. 
  Township and town enterprises developed rapidly. According 
to statistics of the Shanxi Province General Corporation of 
Township and Town Enterprises, business income of township and 
town enterprises in 1993 reached 59.49 billion yuan, an increase 
of 84.4 percent over the previous year. 
  However, there were also some problems that merited our 
attention. The agricultural basis was quite weak, the price 
scissors between industrial and agricultural products further 
widened, the development of agricultural production could hardly 
meet the growth of the rural market, and it was extremely 
arduous to achieve the strategic task for the peasants to lead a 
comfortable life. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Building Industry </H5>
  In 1993, industry and building industry maintained rapid 
growth, and 36.3 billion yuan of added value were fulfilled in 
the whole year, an increase of 13.4 percent over the previous 
year. They occupied 57.4 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP), and continued to take a leading position in three major 
industries. 
  Industrial production maintained rapid growth. With the 
transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms as the 
emphasis, a number of enterprise reforms were enacted in 1993, 
which pushed enterprises to move further toward the market. In 
the past year, 100 large and medium-sized enterprises 
experimented on mechanism transformation, and 1,663 small and 
medium-sized enterprises experimented with operational methods, 
such as "state-ownership run by the people" and "private 
operation of public ownership," and there were already 12 large 
enterprise groups in the whole province. Shareholding 
enterprises grew from 64 of the previous year to 260. 
Xinghuachun Fen Liquor Distillery, the province's first 
enterprise to have its stocks listed, achieved success. 
Industrial added value of the whole province for the whole year 
amounted to 32.31 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4 percent over 
the previous year, accounting for 51.1 percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP). Total industrial output (calculated at 1990 
constant prices, the same below), village level and below 
included, fulfilled 99.68 billion yuan, an increase of 29.2 
percent over the previous year; village level and below not 
included fulfilled 62.9 billion yuan, an increase of 11.7 
percent over the previous year. In total industrial output, the 
state-owned economy reached 42.43 billion yuan, an increase of 
5.7 percent over that of the previous year. Non-state-owned 
economy reached 20.47 billion yuan, up 28.7 percent. 
Non-state-owned economy became an important force that promoted 
rapid industrial growth in the whole province. In industrial 
output, heavy industrial output fulfilled 49.54 billion yuan, an 
increase of 13.9 percent over that of the previous year, and 
light industrial output fulfilled 13.36 billion yuan, up by 4 
percent. The growth of heavy industry was faster than that of 
light industry by 9.9 percentage points.

  Overall industrial economic performance was markedly 
improved. In 1993, overall industrial economic performance 
indexes for the whole province were 89.2 percent, a growth of 
10.7 percent over the previous year. Industrial sales output 
reached 71.03 billion yuan (current prices), and the production 
and marketing rate was 95.7 percent, in which the production and 
marketing rate of large and medium-sized enterprises reached 
98.6 percent. The profit and tax rate of industrial funds for 
the whole year was 8.8 percent, the cost and profit rate was 6.1 
percent, labor productivity was 9,958 yuan per person, floating 
funds turnover were 1.5 times, and the industrial added value 
rate 35.5 percent. 1,451 independent accounting industrial 
enterprises at the township level and above in the whole 
province were money-losing, with a loss of 1.25 billion yuan. 
  However, in industrial economic development, there were also 
problems with major fluctuations in production and prominent 
structural contradictions. Major fluctuations in industrial 
production were mainly expressed in drastic slides in the 
industrial growth rate in the course of strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control. Prominent structural 
contradictions were expressed in the fact that the heavy-duty 
industrial structure of Shanxi Province built up under the 
traditional system was weak in competitive power under the 
present circumstances of market economy and that the inferiority 
of its low market adaptability became increasingly evident. 
Moreover, tension in enterprise funds, difficulty in funds 
circulation, and lack of transport capacity were also 
constraining the steady industrial development of the whole 
province. 
  In 1993, state-owned building enterprises in the province 
fulfilled a total of 11.361 million square meters of area under 
construction, an increase of 43.4 percent over that of the 
previous year. Total output fulfilled 7.73 billion yuan, up 
32.1 percent. All-member labor productivity was 24,295 yuan per 
person, up by 22.2 percent. Per capita profits and tax created 
amounted to 1,020 yuan, up 22.2 percent. But 21.5 percent of 
state-owned building enterprises were still money-losing. 
  In 1993, geological and mining departments and affiliated 
organizations drilled a total of 56,899 meters, and discovered 
nine new mineral deposits. The reserves of three of these 
places reached those of large and medium-sized mines. Among the 
newly discovered reserves were 94.17 million tons of bauxite, 
and 160,000 tons of copper. 
<H5>  III. Fixed Asset Investments </H5>
  In 1993, construction began on a number of key projects for 
the economy of Shanxi Province to enter a new stage, and 
progress was smooth. Construction had already begun on the 
Wanjiazhai project that channels the Yellow River into Shanxi 
Province, the Taiyuan-Jiuguan Expressway, and Yangquan No. 2 
power plant. Progress was smooth in the early stages of 
operation of the Yangcheng No. 1 power plant that transmits 
power to Jiangsu Province; the Taiyuan Airport project was 
basically completed; capital construction of the Taiyuan Railway 
Station elevated waiting room was basically completed, and a 
part of it was made available for use. The whole line of the 
Xiaoyi-Liulin railway was open to traffic; a Hong Kong-Taiyuan 
scheduled flight was initiated; and the digital microwave trunk 
line project was completed. 
  The scale of fixed assets investments expanded rapidly. In 
1993, the total amount of fixed assets investment for the whole 
province reached 23.24 billion yuan, an increase of 34.5 percent 
over the previous year. The total amount of fixed asset 
investment by state-owned units reached 19.54 billion yuan, up 
38 percent; total investments by collective ownership units 
reached 1.8 billion yuan, up 13.9 percent; and total investments 
by individuals in towns and townships amounted to 1.9 billion 
yuan, up 23.4 percent. Investments by the central authorities 
fulfilled 10.74 billion yuan, up 26.1 percent, and investments 
by local authorities fulfilled 12.5 billion yuan, up 42.1 
percent. Projects of capital construction and renovation and 
transformation by state-owned units in the whole province 
totalled 3,438, a reduction of 264 projects compared with the 
previous year. Projects which were completed and made available 
to users in the whole year totalled 1,362, and the rate of 
completion and operation was 40 percent. Newly increased fixed 
assets amounted to 8.6 billion yuan, and the rate of 
availability for the users was 49 percent. 
  The investment structure tended to be rational. In 1993, 
with "energy up to scale, communications up to level, and 
telecommunications up to grade" as the objective, the structure 
of investments in the whole province tended to be rational, 
especially after strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Those that should be cut down were cut down, and those 
that should be strengthened were strengthened, thus further 
stressing key projects. In fixed asset investment by state-owned 
units, primary industry reached 650 million yuan, accounting for 
3.3 percent of investments; secondary industry invested 12.27 
billion yuan, occupying 62.8 percent; tertiary industry 
fulfilled 6.62 billion yuan, making up 33.9 percent. Energy 
industry fulfilled 7.1 billion yuan of investments, occupying 36 
percent; transportation, and post and telecommunications reached 
3.9 billion yuan, accounting for 20 percent; and raw and 
processed materials fulfilled 3.6 billion yuan, achieving 18 
percent. Thirty-five key construction projects in the whole 
province fulfilled 7.2 billion yuan of investments, 101.4 
percent of the annual plan. State key projects fulfilled 3.58 
billion yuan of investments, 101.4 percent of the annual plan; 
and local key projects fulfilled 3.62 billion yuan, 101.4 
percent of the annual plan. Among local key projects, ten 
projects which the province decided must be guaranteed after 
macroeconomic regulation and control absorbed 1.76 billion yuan 
of investments, 101.3 percent of the annual plan, and eight 
projects which the province decided they should make every 
effort to ensure fulfilled 1.28 billion yuan, 130.1 percent of 
the annual plan. 
  In 1993, a total investment of 5.12 billion yuan for 
renovation and transformation was fulfilled in the whole 
province, an increase of 37.7 percent over the previous year. 
Projects under construction for the whole year totalled 1,624, 
of which 765 were completely put into operation and made 
available to users, with 3.2 billion yuan of newly increased 
fixed assets. 
<H5>  IV. Energy </H5>
  New breakthroughs were made in the construction, production, 
and transformation of the energy industry. In 1993, investments 
by state-owned units in the energy industry reached 7.1 billion 
yuan, an increase of 12.2 percent over the previous year. 
Investments in coal industry amounted to 4.34 billion yuan, up 
8 percent; investments in power industry totalled 2.63 billion 
yuan, an increase of 31.5 percent over 1992. Newly increased 
coal mining capacity resulted from capital construction in the 
whole year amounted to 1.42 million tons, and power equipment 
installed capacity totalled 840,000 kwh. In the past year, 
Taiyuan No. 2 power plant, Xiaoyi-Liulin railway, and other 
major projects were completed and put into operation one after 
another. In 1993, the energy industry of Shanxi Province 
started carrying out the strategic change from coal 
transportation to simultaneous development of coal 
transportation and power transmission, the transformation and 
deep-processing of raw coal were obviously strengthened, and the 
growth rate of secondary energy supply quickened. In 1993 
primary energy production (converted into standard coal) in the 
whole province amounted to 264 million tons, an increase of 5.18 
percent over that of the previous year. Secondary energy 
production was 67 million tons, an increase of 31.37 percent 
over that of the previous year. 
  In the past year, Shanxi Province supplied to 26 provinces, 
municipalities, autonomous regions, and 12 cities whose plans 
were separately listed, and exported in foreign trade a total of 
224 million tons of coal, an increase of 2 percent over that of 
the previous year, occupying 72.43 percent of the coal 
production. It transmitted 10.785 billion kwh of power to 
places outside Shanxi Province, an increase of 10.33 percent 
over the previous year, accounting for 26.46 percent of electric 
energy production. 
<H5>  V. The Communications and Transportation, and Post and </H5>
Telecommunications Industries 
  The situation of communications and transportation was 
greatly improved. In 1993 the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee 
and Shanxi provincial government listed efforts on highway 
construction as one of the "three items of construction," and 
set off a new upsurge of highway construction by all people on a 
voluntary basis. Among the six major highways set for 
construction within the year, the Taiyuan-Yuci super top-grade 
highway was completed and opened to traffic, and construction of 
the other five highways started in full-scale. Various 
localities, cities, and counties had their own projects. 2.9 
billion yuan of added value was realized by the industry of 
communications and transportation in the whole province, an 
increase of 6.1 percent over the previous year. Newly increased 
highway mileage totalled 535 kilometers. Up till the end of 
1993, the whole province had 2,540.7 km of railway in operation, 
and 32,210 km of highway, of which 2,847 km were grade-two 
highway. The volume of cargo transport fulfilled by various 
means of transportation in the whole province totalled 594.02 
million tons, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year, 
in which the volume of railway cargo transport totalled 256.134 
million tons, up 2.9 percent; and the volume of highway cargo 
transport totalled 337.155 million tons, up 8.5 percent. There 
were also major developments in the industry of air 
transportation. Taiyuan had 41 air links with places outside 
the province, and could directly link with 30 cities in China. 
However, insufficient transport capacity remained one of the 
major factors constraining social and economic development, and 
industrial production in particular, of Shanxi Province. 
  Volume of Passenger and Cargo Turnover Fulfilled by 
Various Means of Transportation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Operational efficiency was improved. In 1993, the average 
daily load of freight cars of the Taiyuan, Datong, and Linfen 
Railway Sub- bureaus was 2.4 percent, 4.7 percent, and 0.3 
percent respectively over 1992, and income from railway 
transportation was 13 percent, 61.6 percent, and 6.9 percent 
respectively over 1992. The rural communications situation was 
further improved. By the end of the year, 99.5 percent of 
townships and towns in the province were linked by highways, 
48.7 of which were linked by asphalt roads. 98.7 percent of 
administrative villages could be reached by motor vehicles, of 
which 55.9 percent were linked by roads. 
  Post and telecommunications undertakings were further 
developed. In 1993, the business of post and telecommunications 
in the province fulfilled an added value of 560 million yuan, an 
increase of 33.4 percent over the previous year. The province's 
total business volume fulfilled 610 million yuan, an increase of 
44.4 percent over the previous year. In 1993, the telephone 
numbers of the city of Taiyuan rose to seven digits, and 
telephone capacity was greatly strengthened. A 
program-controlled telephone system was realized in all 11 
prefectures and cities by the end of the year. 404,000 
program-controlled exchange lines were newly installed and 
extended. The number of telephone users in cities amounted to 
257,000 families, up by 42.6 percent. But a lack of 
telecommunications capacity remained an outstanding problem. 
<H5>  VI. Domestic Markets and Market Prices </H5>
  The market system was fostered and developed. In 1993 the 
whole province continued in-depth reform in the circulation 
sphere. The experiences of "counters and groups work on a 
contract basis, and remuneration calculated by joint sales" of 
the Taiyuan May First Department Store was fully popularized in 
state-owned business enterprises, and the experiences of supply 
and marketing cooperatives reform in Zhongyang, Wenshui, and 
Fanzhi Counties were popularized among supply and marketing 
cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations; 
diversified forms of operation, such as "contract-based, 
leasing, annexation, and auction" and state ownership run by the 
people were carried out in state-owned business retail sales 
enterprises and small business shops. Moreover, the whole 
province quickened the building of various kinds of markets, 
factors markets in particular, and built up 100 large trade fair 
markets and 90 markets of the means of production. The markets 
of funds, labor, information, and real estate were growing. 
  Commodity sales were brisk, there was an ample supply of 
commodities in the whole province, and the residents' 
consumption was stable, presenting a prosperous situation. The 
province realized a total 27.47 billion yuan of social commodity 
retail sales, an increase of 14.2 percent over 1992. The amount 
of consumer goods retail sales was 24.35 billion yuan, up by 
14.6 percent; and the retail sales of agricultural means of 
production amounted to 3.12 billion yuan, up by 11.4 percent. 
The market for consumer goods and the market for the means of 
production in the whole province maintained sustained and steady 
growth, and commodity supply and demand were basically balanced, 
or supply greater than demand already occupied a considerable 
proportion. 
  There was co-prosperity in urban and rural markets. In 1993 
urban and rural markets in the province were brisk, and the 
quality of consumption was raised to some extent. The retail 
sales of consumer goods in cities amounted to 14.3 billion yuan, 
an increase of 14.9 percent over 1992; the retail sales in 
counties amounted to 5.52 billion yuan, up by 13.9 percent; and 
the retail sales of county level and below amounted to 4.52 
billion yuan, up by 14.1 percent. In commodity retail sales, 
the retail sales of individual economy amounted to 6.72 billion 
yuan, an increase of 45.4 percent over the previous year, much 
faster than the 3.5 percent growth rate of state-owned economy 
and the 7.8 percent growth rate of economy of collective 
ownership. The proportion it occupied in the total amount of 
social commodity retail sales rose from 19 percent of the 
previous year to 24 percent. 
  The business of material goods supply and marketing carried 
out the operational strategy of "big market, big circulation," 
the scale of market circulation was expanded, and purchase and 
sales were brisk. Total value of both purchase and sales of 
material goods in the province exceeded the 10-billion-yuan 
mark, 12.87 billion yuan purchase, 13.69 billion yuan sales, an 
increase of 20.5 percent and 12.7 percent respectively over that 
of the previous year. The total value of purchase and sales by 
material goods departments and affiliated organizations in the 
province reached 11.79 billion yuan and 12.18 billion yuan 
respectively, an increase of 50.6 percent and 43.3 percent 
respectively over that of the previous year. 
  Overall, market inflation was high. In 1993 the state 
further increased the strength of price reform, released the 
prices of grain, iron and steel products, and some kinds of coal 
under unified distribution, readjusted and increased the prices 
of log and cement under unified distribution, and carried out 
the policy of "changing from the average to a negotiated price" 
for some kinds of heavy oil. The situation in which "prices were 
decided and regulated by market" was gradually taking shape, and 
prices of the great majority of commodities were regulated by 
market. The overall retail sales price level in the whole 
province increased by 13.1 percent over that of 1992, and was 
the third year since 1978 in which the increase exceeded 10 
percent. In that increase, cities and towns rose by 13.7 
percent, and rural areas by 11.7 percent. Judged by categories, 
prices of food and kind rose by 14.9 percent; grain rose by 28.8 
percent; meat, poultry, and eggs rose by 13.3 percent; 
vegetables rose by 12.7 percent; clothing and kind rose by 9.8 
percent; daily necessities and kind rose by 7.1 percent; 
medicines and kind rose by 14.6 percent; and agricultural means 
of production rose by 12.9 percent. The overall cost of living 
for staff and workers in cities and towns in the province rose 
by 16.1 percent, in which prices of service items in cities and 
towns rose by 32.8 percent. In the course of increasing the 
strength of price reform, behavior such as indiscriminate price 
increase, price increases in disguised form, and competing for 
price increases still existed to a varying degree. Big margin 
of prices increase became a sensitive factor that affected the 
economy and the life of the residents. 
<H5>  VII. Foreign Economic Relations and Trade </H5>
  The pace of opening to the outside world quickened, and new 
progress was made in foreign economic relations and trade. In 
1993 total import and export volume amounted to 837 million 
dollars, an increase of 19.4 percent over 1992. Export volume 
totalled 634 million dollars, up by 8.7 percent, and import 
volume totalled 203 million dollars, up by 72.7 percent. Shanxi 
Province exported its products to 91 countries and regions, and 
business development activities were carried out in Germany, 
economic cooperation discussions were held in the Republic of 
Korea, investment trade talks were held in Xiamen, the Wang's 
patriarchal relatives held business talks and friendly contacts 
in Taiyuan, and the fourth session of the "Two Fairs and One 
Festival" all yielded good results. At the "Two Fairs and One 
Festival" 59 contracts for projects to introduce foreign 
investments were signed and 148 million dollars of foreign 
investments were utilized, which was an all-time high for trade 
talks in the province. At the end of 1993, the province already 
had 1,104 foreign-funded enterprises, of which 660 were newly 
approved in 1993, with a total investment amount of 998 million 
dollars, in which the amount of foreign investments agreed upon 
totalled 402 million dollars, exceeding the sum total over the 
years in the past. 
  Tourist business made major progress. Foreign visitors, 
overseas Chinese, and our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao 
coming to Shanxi for tours totalled 66,500 people, an increase 
of 38.1 percent over the previous year. Foreign exchange income 
from travel business totalled 37.64 million yuan, up 21.7 
percent. 
<H5>  VIII. Finance and Banking </H5>
  Revenue and expenditure were basically balanced. In 1993 
various measures were introduced to strive to reverse the 
situation of financial difficulties, and especially after the 
central authorities put forward measures for strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the whole province 
seriously rectified the order of fiscal levies, made great 
efforts to increase income and cut expenses, strengthened 
taxation and management of tax collection, and achieved positive 
results. The whole province fulfilled 7.24 billion yuan of 
revenue for the whole year, an increase of 14.44 billion yuan 
over 1992, up 24.91 percent; expenditure accounted for 7.57 
billion yuan, an increase of 1.142 billion yuan over the 
previous year, up by 17.77 percent. 
  Banking order evidently changed for the better. In 1993, the 
whole province conscientiously implemented the spirit of 
Document No. 6 issued by the CPC Central Committee, and with 
clearing up borrowing against regulations as a breakthrough, 
rectified the banking order in a down-to-earth manner, achieved 
initial success, and vigorously promoted and ensured the healthy 
development of the national economy. At the end of the year, 
the balance of various bank deposits in the whole province 
totalled 57.02 billion yuan, an increase of 10.05 billion yuan 
over the previous year, up by 21.4 percent; the balance of bank 
loans totalled 63.81 billion yuan, an increase of 11.64 billion 
yuan over the beginning of the year; up by 22.3 percent. The 
net input of money into the market for the whole year totalled 
11.35 billion yuan, an increase of 2.01 billion yuan, up by 21.5 
percent. Various kinds of illegal fundraising activities in the 
province were completely stopped, and illegal credit business 
activities by mortgage firms were banned. 
<H5>  IX. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and </H5>
Physical Culture 
  Geared to economic construction, science and technology 
continued to yield important results. In 1993 reform was 
carried out throughout the province in the management methods of 
some of the appropriations for science and technology, the 
science and technology investment responsibility system was set 
up, the contract-based system was carried out in all 
provincial-level scientific and technological undertakings, and 
the vitality of scientific research organizations was 
strengthened to some extent. A total of 65 projects for tackling 
key industrial and agricultural problems was fulfilled, of which 
27 projects yielded results that took a leading position in 
China, and some reached the world's advanced level. Twenty-five 
scientific and technological results which were emphatically 
popularized in the whole province, 92 "Spark Plan" projects, and 
63 "Torch Plan" projects achieved remarkable economic 
performance. 
  Modelled cultivation, in which an improved variety and 
refined method complement each other, was popularized 
extensively in grain production, and the "Majestic Style Plan"
