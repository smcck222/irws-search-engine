  [Text] Moscow, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The Russian State Duma 
(lower house of parliament) today condemned NATO's unilateral 
use of force against Bosnian Serbs. 
  The State Duma in a statement called for an immediate 
meeting 
of the UN Security Council to discuss NATO's military 
involvement in the Bosnian war. 
  The statement also suggested that measures be taken to 
prevent the escalation of the Bosnian conflict. 
  The UN peacekeeping force should not be used by any bloc to 
carry out military actions, the statement stressed, adding that 
Russia was worried by the fact that NATO continued its policy of 
using force as the means to solve the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also described 
as "unreasonable" NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions around the embattled Gorazde, saying they could only 
result in the worsening of the situation there.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia and Serb leaders in former Yugoslavia today 
strongly denounced the U.N.-authorized NATO air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions, saying the world body had been directly 
involved in the civil war. 
  In an emergency government meeting called to discuss the 
latest developments in Bosnia, Yugoslav leaders said the United 
Nations, instead of disarming the Muslim forces in Gorazde, 
tolerated the two-week spring offensive against Serb-held 
positions launched by the Muslims in a systematic way. 
  When the Muslims were defeated in their spring offensive, 
the 
U.N. gave the go-ahead to launch air strikes on Serb positions 
under the pretext of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde being one of 
the U.N.- designated "safe areas," they said. 
  By authorizing NATO to launch air raids against Bosnian 
Serbs, the U.N. has been directly involved in the Bosnian war, 
the Yugoslav leader said, urging the world body to immediately 
renounce its "dangerous" policy of siding with the Muslims in 
the conflict. 
  NATO jets today launched a second air strike on Serb 
positions around Gorazde in less than 24 hours. According to 
U.N. military sources, Serb artillery, tank and machine gun fire 
into Gorazde town abated soon after NATO warplanes destroyed at 
least one Serb tank. 
  On Sunday [10 April], NATO war planes dropped three bombs on 
a Bosnian Serb command post controlling artillery attacks on 
Gorazde. The raid was the first time NATO has used air power on 
Serb forces attacking a U.N. "safe area" in Bosnia. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said that by giving the 
go- ahead to NATO air strikes, the reputation of the world body 
as a mediator in the Bosnian peace process had been seriously 
impaired. 
  The NATO air raids also drew an angry response from Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic called off a meeting 
planned for today with U.S. peace envoy Charles Redman, and one 
of his senior adviser threatened to take actions against U.N. 
peacekeeping troops and put the Serbs at war with the U.N. if 
NATO continued to launch air raids. 
  Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' parliament, 
said the air strikes showed that neither the U.S. nor the U.N. 
wanted peace in Bosnia. 
  The threat of air strikes forced the Serbs to withdraw their 
heavy artillery from besieged Sarajevo by February 20. Eight 
days later, NATO jets shot down four Serb war planes violating 
the U.N. declared no-fly zone over Bosnia.

  [Text] Istanbul, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Bosnia has warned that 
the unresolved conflicts in the country are threats to global 
peace. 
  The Bosnian ambassador to Washington, Necip Sacirbey, 
appealed Friday [8 April] at the four-day international 
conference on the Balkans to "the world not to tolerate what was 
happening in Bosnia." 
  The conference, which organized by the Solidarity Foundation 
of Turkey, is being held here from April 7 to 10, with 
participants from representatives from Austria, the United 
States, Britain, South Africa, Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and 
Malaysia. 
  "In the war in Bosnia," Sacirbey stated, "there are victims, 
aggressors, and observers. All of us are observers." 
  He asked that the observers not be passive, but to be just, 
and he appealed to them to remember Sarajevo, the capital city 
of Bosnia. 
  "Sarajevo is symbolic of the suffering of each group of 
people in today's world. When we are fighting for Sarajevo, we 
are fighting for a better tomorrow. Please help us," Sacirbey 
said. 
  Meanwhile, turkey Friday renewed a call to the Serbs to join 
the Bosnian-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying 
"Ankara is ready to do what it can." 
  Turkey, which shares cultural and religious ties with the 
Bosnian Moslems, has launched a series of diplomatic initiatives 
on use of force to stop the fighting in Bosnia. 
  Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in late February of 
1992 when 4.3 million population in the former Yugoslav republic 
voted for independence from Belgrade.

  [Text] Bonn, April 11 (XINHUA) -- NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner today said the western alliance will do its best 
to avoid involvement in a bigger conflict with the Bosnian Serbs. 
  In an interview with the No. 2 German television station 
ZDF, 
Woerner said that NATO does not intend to send ground troops to 
the region. 
  The NATO chief said the western alliance favors negotiations 
backed with "limited military actions" in hopes of giving a push 
to the negotiating process. 
  His statement came after NATO launched its second air raid 
earlier in the day on Serb positions around the U.N.-designated 
safe area of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  NATO bombed on Sunday and Monday Serb positions around the 
Muslim enclave in order to halt the Serb advance and protect 
U.N. personnel there from the Serb attackers. 
  U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, who 
authorized the two air strikes in less than 24 hours, warned 
Serbs of more air raids if they continue attacking Gorazde. 
  Woerner hoped the air strikes would produce "expected 
results" as was the case in Sarajevo, 
  Earlier this year, NATO succeeded in making Serbs withdraw 
their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of 
the Bosnian capital by threatening air strikes against Serbs.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The Federal Yugoslav 
government today decided, for the first time, to restrict the 
movements of the UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia 
as of April 20. 
  The government said the peacekeeping forces must get visas 
before entering and staying in the Federal Yugoslavia and their 
vehicles must get approval before driving into the republic. 
  The Yugoslav government, which met today to discuss the 
question of cooperation with the UN peacekeeping forces, 
denounced them for calling in NATO war planes to launch air 
strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. 
  The government said that the UN peacekeeping forces ignored 
the Muslim forces' attempt to make use of the UN-designated 
"safe area" of Gorazde to attack the Serb positions. 
  It accused the UN peacekeeping forces of siding with the 
Muslims and being completely involved in the Bosnia civil war. 
  The government stressed that the UN and NATO actions will 
directly threaten the Bosnian peace process and could lead to 
escalation of the war.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (XINHUA) -- International 
mediators David Owen and Thorvals Stoltenberg visited Sarajevo 
on Wednesday [13 April] in a bid to resume the Bosnian peace 
process and break the deadlock between Bosnian Serbs and the UN 
peacekeeping forces since the NATO air strikes, political 
commentators said. 
  After a meeting with EU mediator Owen and his UN Counterpart 
Stoltenberg, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters 
that Serbs would continue to participate in the peace process 
but refuse to accept those who ordered air strikes against Serb 
positions as international mediators. 
  Karadzic said that it is time for the EU to return to help 
solve the Bosnia conflict because the United States has sided 
with the Muslims and is directly involved in the Bosnia civil 
war. 
  The United States has become a major mediator in the Bosnian 
peace process since early last month when an agreement in 
principle was reached on the U.S.-proposed Muslim-Croatia 
Federation. The EU- proposed peace plan for Bosnia and 
international mediators Owen and Stoltenberg have been desolated 
since. 
  However, after the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions near the Muslim enclave of Gorazde on April 10 and 11, 
Serbs announced that they were suspending all contact with UN 
peacekeeping forces, especially the commander of the 
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia Michael Rose, who ordered the air 
strikes. 
  As the peace process was stalled, Owen and Stoltenberg came 
to Sarajevo. Observers say their visit will show the Bosnian 
peace process cannot proceed without the EU.

  [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today issued a statement condemning a new attack in 
Hadera, Israel. 
  A bus in Hadera was bombed earlier today with six Israelis 
killed and 28 wounded, including 18 Israeli soldiers. 
  "This action, like those before it, is a further attempt by 
extremists to derail the peace process," Clinton said, adding 
that "they must not be allowed to succeed." 
  "We believe the best response to the enemies of peace is to 
demonstrate that negotiations can change realities on the ground 
and give hope to Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful 
future," Clinton said. 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Clinton 
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express 
condolences over today's bus explosion. 
  Clinton stressed the urgency of bringing an end to the 
on-going talks on implementing the PLO-Israeli peace accord 
signed in Washington on September 13 1993. 
  During the telephone talk, Rabin agreed with Clinton on the 
need to reach prompt agreement on the implementation, Myers said.

  [Text] Moscow, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov said today that Russia would adopt "a 
flexible stand" in the effort to solve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  He suggested that the nuclear issue be resolved through 
bilateral negotiations or within the framework of the UN 
Security Council. 
  If both failed to work, then the possibility of an 
international conference should be explored, he said. 
  He added that China, Japan and South Korea did not oppose 
Russia's proposal for holding an international conference to 
guarantee the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at present 
favors holding talks with the United States to find a solution 
to the nuclear issue. 
  Panov said that the DPRK nuclear issue should not be 
considered as only a bilateral question as it affects the 
international community, especially the neighboring nations of 
the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Yong (1776 0516) and KEJI RIBAO </F>
(SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY DAILY) reporter Wei Hongkai (7614 3163 0418)] 
  [Text] Washington, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 11 April, The 
Chinese Government science and technology delegation headed by 
Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, began its busy schedule with 
a view to promoting exchanges and cooperation in the field of 
science and technology between China and the United States. The 
Chinese delegation visited U.S. Government research institutes, 
met with U.S. Government senior officials, and made contacts 
with people of U.S. high-tech enterprises. 
  The nine-member delegation headed by Song Jian arrived in 
Washington on the evening of 10 April to attend the sixth 
meeting of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation 
Joint Committee at the invitation of John Gibbons, U.S. 
presidential science and technology advisor and head of the 
Science and Technology Policy Office of the White House. The 
principal members of the Chinese delegation include Liu Jiang, 
minister of Agriculture; Yan Hongmo, director of the State 
Maritime Bureau; Hu Qiheng, vice president of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences; Ba Denian [1572 1795 1628], president of 
the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; and Ye Ruqiu, deputy 
director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. This 
morning, the Chinese delegation visited the U.S. National 
Standardization Technology Research Institute. Delegation 
members heard an introduction on the institute's "advanced 
technology plan" and "manufacturing and promoting cooperation 
partners project" and also visited two institute laboratories. 
  This afternoon, Song Jian had a meeting with U.S. Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and exchanged opinions with him on 
cooperation in protecting wild animals. According to a Chinese 
delegation member who took part in the meeting, Babbitt pointed 
out that he was "deeply impressed" with China's protection of 
giant pandas and other rare wild animals and China's enforcement 
of laws against the trade of animals that are in imminent 
danger. Song Jian proposed that the two sides strengthen 
unified management on the issue of exhibition of giant pandas 
abroad. He said that, in addition, the two countries could 
cooperate to improve the technology of multiplying giant pandas. 
  In a meeting with Neil Lane, chairman of the U.S. National 
Science Foundation, Song Jian expressed the hope of expanding 
cooperation in the field of "major sciences [da ke xue 1129 4430 
1331]." Neil Lane was interested in China's desire to expand 
cooperation and invited China to take part in the plant genetic 
map project that is being undertaken in the United States. 
  Later, Song Jian met with U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary 
and the two sides discussed prospects of cooperation in the 
utilization of conventional and new energy sources and nuclear 
energy. 
  This afternoon, Song Jian also met with U.S. Deputy Defense 
Secretary Frank Wisner and discussed with him cooperation in 
utilizing military technologies by civilian sectors. The U.S. 
deputy defense secretary held that China started the work of 
having military technologies serve the civilian sectors 
relatively early and gained some experiences that the U.S. could 
borrow. 
  This evening, the U.S.-China Trade Committee and several 
U.S. 
high-tech companies, mainly aerospace and aeronautics 
enterprises, gave a dinner party in honor of Song Jian and 
delegation members. More than 70 people attended the party. 
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu and several 
U.S. congressmen and former congressmen attended the party. 
Robert Rowe, former chairman of the U.S. House Science 
Committee, spoke at the dinner. He pointed out: Both China and 
the United States are big countries. The two should join 
efforts, cooperate with each other, and should not be entangled 
in issues like the most favored nation treatment. 
  Starting tomorrow morning, the science and technology 
delegation and the U.S. side will take part in the biannual 
Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee 
meeting. The Chinese delegation will end its activities in the 
United States on 13 April. 
  On the eve of his departure for the United States, Song Jian 
was interviewed jointly by XINHUA and KEJI RIBAO reporters. 
Song Jian pointed out: Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and 
technology has great potential and broad prospects because the 
cooperation can play a role in leading and promoting the 
constant development of the economy and trade of the two 
countries. He emphatically pointed out: Strengthening 
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in science 
and technology is not only in accord with the basic interests of 
the two countries but also beneficial to the progress and 
development of all of mankind.

  [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry said here today he expected Serbs and 
Muslims in Bosnia to return to the negotiating table. 
  "That is our objective, that's the U.N. objective to see 
that 
cessation negotiated," Perry told ABC's program "Good Morning 
America." 
  U.S. F-16 fighter planes carried out air strikes against 
Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde on 
Sunday [10 April] and Monday. 
  "We have to wait for a day or two to see what the Serbs' 
next 
action is," he noted, "if they start the shelling again, it is 
very likely that the United Nations will call for more air 
strikes and NATO will deliver those air strikes." 
  The United Nations has proclaimed that Gorazde is a safe 
haven and has put U.N. forces in there. 
  If the Serbs begin shelling at Gorazde again, Perry 
stressed, 
"the U.N. can invoke close air support to protect the U.N. 
forces." 
  Russia has denounced NATO air attacks against Bosnian Serbs 
and threatened to delay joining the NATO's partnership for peace. 
  Perry said that "I think the timing of their joining is not 
so important as the fact of joining." 
  He also said it is not necessary to consult with Russia on 
whether the U.N. should call for this strike because Russia 
agreed the U.N. resolution which allowed for the U.N. to call 
the strikes. 
  "So the United Nations' responsibility at that point was 
simply to invoke the action when it happened," he said, "you 
cannot have consultation in the middle of a close air support 
operation." 
  Asked what is the biggest national security problem for the 
United States, Perry said that "over the long term, the greatest 
problem, potential problem, is with Russia." 
  "If the reform movement should fail in Russia," the 
secretary 
claimed, "this would be a great catastrophe not only for Russia 
but for the whole world and for the United States security."

  [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today told U.S. newspaper editors that he is doing his 
best in handling the Whitewater affair. 
  Speaking today at the American Society of Newspaper Editors 
who compared his explanations of the Whitewater affair to a girl 
making excuses for skipping her homework, Clinton said that he 
is doing his best to answer questions about the Whitewater 
affair but he could not have perfect recall of events which 
happened 15 years ago. 
  "I have done my best to answer the questions asked of me... 
I'll continue to do that," Clinton said, heatedly defending his 
handling of the Whitewater affair. 
  But he said he could not stay on top of the daily Whitewater 
revelations in the media without letting the presidency suffer. 
  "Maybe you think I should have shut the whole federal 
government down and done nothing but study these things for the 
last two months," the U.S. president said. 
  "I have done everything I know to do but, can I answer every 
question that anybody might ask me about something that happened 
10, 15, 17 years ago on the spur of the moment and have total 
recall of all of that while trying to be president? No sir, I 
cannot," he stressed. 
  Clinton said he had agreed to the appointment of a special 
prosecutor in the Whitewater case precisely to put the search 
for information in capable hands and allow himself to focus on 
the business of the presidency. 
  Special prosecutor Robert Fiske is investigating whether 
money from a failed Arkansas savings and loan association was 
funnelled to the Whitewater Development Co. in which the 
Clintons had invested back in the late 1970s. 
  Reports said today that records released by the Clintons' 
Whitewater business partner, James McDougall, showed Mrs. 
Clinton had taken a more active role in the Whitewater company 
than White House officials had acknowledged. 
  The records reportedly showed that her law firm in Little 
Rock, Arkansas, was given as Whitewater's address on tax returns 
and that some monthly payments from Whitewater lot buyers were 
mailed to her there. 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said today that 
"we 
stand by our description of her (Mrs. Clinton's) role." White 
House officials have long described the Clintons as passive 
investors in the Whitewater Development Company that was largely 
run by the McDougalls.

  [By reporter Zhang Jiaxiang (1728 0502 4382)] 
  [Text] Hanoi, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, Vietnam's 
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh met here with a 
delegation of China's National People's Congress [NPC] Financial 
and Economic Committee headed by its vice chairman, Zeng 
Xianlin, at the Government Guest House. Both sides held talks 
in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. 
  Nong Duc Manh said that Vietnam and China are joined by 
mountains and rivers and that the two peoples enjoy a 
long-established traditional friendly relationship. The two 
countries have sent many delegations to visit each other since 
the normalization of relations between the two parties and two 
countries. This helped promote the bilateral relationship and 
heralded a new stage in bilateral relations. 
  Nong Duc Manh said: "My recent goodwill visit to China at 
the head of a Vietnam National Assembly delegation was a 
success. We saw with our own eyes the Chinese people's great 
achievements that were brought by adherence to the policy of 
reform and opening up under the CPC's leadership. A rosy 
picture of development prospects is now spread before the 
Vietnamese and Chinese peoples." 
  PRC Ambassador to Vietnam Zhang Qing was present at the 
meeting. 
  China's NPC Financial and Economic Committee delegation 
arrived in Hanoi on 9 April. The delegation held talks with 
Vietnam's National Assembly Economic and Financial Budget 
Committee delegation and visited the Vietnamese Finance 
Ministry, Trade Ministry, and State Cooperation and Investment 
Committee. 
  The Chinese delegation will also visit Ha Bac, Quang 
Tri-Hue, 
Quang Nam-Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City. The delegation will 
conclude its Vietnam visit on 20 April and depart for home from 
Ho Chi Minh City.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong 
Yiren said here today that with joint efforts, the renewed 
Sino-Lesotho ties will be further consolidated and developed. 
  Extending a warm welcome to M.J. Qhobela, visiting foreign 
minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Rong described the visit as 
the first major contact between the two countries after they 
renewed diplomatic relations early this year. 
  The visit shows that the Lesotho Government pays attention 
to 
its relations with China, Rong said, adding he believes the 
visit will help enhance mutual understanding between the two 
peoples and the friendly cooperation between the two countries. 
  Rong appreciated the "one China" stance of the new Lesotho 
Government and its efforts to normalize bilateral relations. He 
thanked Qhobela for his contribution to the restoration of Sino- 
Lesotho ties. 
  China and Lesotho are both developing countries, Rong said. 
China holds that all countries, small or big, poor or rich, weak 
or strong, should live in equality and develop ties with one 
another on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence. 
  Briefing Qhobela on China's domestic situation, Rong said 
that in the past decade and more, China has been pursuing a 
policy centered on economic construction, and its economic 
growth has been rapid. 
  Qhobela said the renewal of diplomatic ties between Lesotho 
and China is a historic event. Despite the long geographic 
distance, the two countries are linked together by common 
interests and the Lesotho-China ties have bright prospects, he 
said. 
  Qhobela told Rong that this was his 4th trip to China and 
that he and his party had witnessed great changes here. Lesotho 
will benefit from China's experience over the past decade, he 
said. 
  Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as guests of 
Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Chen Hegao: "International Mediation </F>
Impact on S. Africa's Election"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The international 
mediation between the African National Congress (ANC) and the 
Inkatha Freedom Party over constitutional difference, which is 
due to start tomorrow, will have a great impact on South 
Africa's first non-racial election slated for April 26-28. 
  The ANC accepted Inkatha's proposal for international 
mediation on March 3 in an attempt to break the deadlock over 
Inkatha's participation in the election process. However, 
Inkatha insisted later that the election be postponed if the 
mediation starts. Because of Inkatha's precondition the 
mediation has delayed. 
  At the four-way summit among President F.W. de Klerk, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini last Friday [8 April], the 
mediation issue was raised again. Though the problem of the 
terms of reference for the mediation was not resolved, the 
leaders decided to go ahead with the process. 
  The government has been lukewarm about the international 
mediation, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled 
constitutional issues. But at the summit it agreed to become a 
party to the mediations process. 
  The constitutional differences between the ANC and Inkatha 
focused on the autonomy power of regions after the election. 
Inkatha favors virtual regional autonomy, while the ANC only 
agrees to extension of regional powers. 
  The differences made Inkatha more determined than ever to 
boycott the election process. Inkatha's anti-election campaign 
has prompted the political fighting between supporters of the 
two organizations. Last month, 552 people died of political 
violence in South Africa, of them 310 in Natal-kwaZulu, the 
stronghold of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  The failure of last Friday's summit marked the end of the 
road in a long line of efforts to woo Buthelezi into the 
transitional process and made the prospect for the successful 
conduct of the poll more gloomy. 
  In such a situation, the beginning of the mediation seems 
more crucial for breaking the deadlock before the election in 
two weeks' time. 
  ANC President Mandela said today that he is confident the 
international mediation can resolve the deadlock over Inkatha's 
participation in the election process. 
  There are indications here that if the mediation makes 
progress in settling part of the constitutional difference, 
Inkatha might contest the regional election. 
  As Inkatha failed to confirm its participation in the 
election and submit its candidates before the deadline set by 
the independent electoral commission, it has lost the chance to 
contest the national election. 
  But analysts said that Inkatha's participation in provincial 
election could help check the wave of political violence and 
create conditions favorable to the election. 
  In an interview with XINHUA yesterday, ANC spokesman Carl 
Niehaus said that the ANC welcomes Inkatha's participation in 
the election process because it could help stabilize the 
political situation before and after the election. 
  The ANC spokesman said that Friday's follow-up summit among 
the four leaders is "really a last attempt" to resolve the Natal 
crisis and remove obstacles to the election, but a positive 
outcome is unlikely. 
  Upon his arrival here today, former British Foreign 
Secretary 
Lord Carrington, one of the seven foreign mediators, declined to 
make comment on prospects of the mediation. 
  He said he and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger 
felt honored to have been invited to mediate. 
  It is reported that the terms of the reference for the 
mediation will be determined once the seven mediators arrive. 
  But ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa today warned 
against Inkatha's expectations that the election might be 
delayed once the mediation starts. 
  It is still unknown if Inkatha will stick to its demand for 
the postponement of election as a precondition for the 
mediation. If so, the mediation could fail to achieve its 
objective.

  [Text] Geneva, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Most Eastern European 
nations are still in recession with little hope of a major 
recovery this year, a UN report issued today said. 
  The report from the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) 
said the drop in production slowed down in most Eastern European 
nations and signs of recovery appeared even in a few countries 
of the region last year. 
  But considering the gravity of the recession, certain 
countries need a few more years to restore production to the 
pre-1989 level, the report added. 
  Production in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth 
of 
Independent States dropped by 13 percent in 1993 compared with 
20 percent in 1992, according to the report. 
  The ECE predicted that there is a very slim possibility of 
an 
end to the economic sliding in these countries this year. 
  The report also said the sharp rise of unemployment in 
Eastern European nations since 1991 has brought about serious 
social and economic problems in these countries. About 7.6 
million people had become jobless by the end of 1993, it added. 
  The commission stressed that the international aid to these 
countries at present cannot help solve the difficulties facing 
them. Eastern Europeans have become ever more disappointed over 
the huge gap between what has been promised and what has 
actually been given, it added.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. F-18 warplane 
accidentally dropped a 227-kilogram bomb upon downtown Gorazde 
densely populated by Muslims Monday [11 April] while 
implementing NATO's second air raid against Bosnian Serb 
positions southwest of the Muslim enclave. 
  According to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, the heavy 
bomb caused serious material losses and high casualties and, as 
a result, many horrified residents fled to mountains around the 
town. 
  But the agency did not give the exact number of casualties. 
  Two U.S. bombers destroyed two Serb military ambulances and 
killed two medical workers Monday afternoon when bombing the 
Serb positions two kilometers away from downtown Gorazde. 
  It was reported that both NATO and the Pentagon are 
dissatisfied with the two air raids against the Serb positions. 
  In the first air strike Sunday, two U.S. F-16 planes could 
not find the targets in time as they lost contact with the land 
control system. They hastened to drop bombs when fuel was 
running out before they could return to their base. 
  In Monday's operation, the bad weather over Gorazde and the 
complex terrain might be reasons for the accident. 
  Inspecting Serb positions around Gorazde, Bosnian Serb 
leader 
Rodovan Karadzic said that the United Nations, when authorizing 
NATO to launch air strikes against Serb positions, has committed 
a gross mistake that could lead to "disastrous consequences." 
  He also accused Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, 
commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia who called 
in the NATO warplanes to bomb Serb positions, of siding with one 
warring party, referring to the Muslims. 
  Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb Army who was 
accompanying Karadzic during the inspection, said he and 
Karadzic had ordered Serb soldiers to shoot down any NATO 
warplanes that will stage air raids against Serb positions again.

  [Text] Jinan, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The first Sino-British 
adult education seminar was held yesterday in Jinan, capital of 
east China's Shandong Province. 
  The seminar was co-sponsored by the Jinan-based Shandong 
Teacher's University (STU) and Nottingham College of Great 
Britain. 
  More than 80 educators from Britain, the United States, 
Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea and China attended the 
seminar and presented some 60 papers, covering the management of 
adult education, relations between adult education and economic 
development, modes of adult education, education for rural 
population, lifetime education and experience in adult education. 
  The seminar will last for five days. 
  STU started an adult education program in 1956 and has 
trained about 20,000 adult students over the past 38 years. It 
has set up a college for adult education, which has an 
enrollment of more than 7,000 students. 
  In 1987 the university signed a cooperation agreement with 
Nottingham College in Sino-British adult education. 
  It is a cooperative and friendly conference, said Professor 
J. E. Thomas, vice-president of Nottingham College. He 
expressed the hope that every grown-up in the world will have 
the chance and freedom to read.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive 
vice president of the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait [ARATS], met with Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping], 
deputy secretary general of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] 
based in Taiwan, on the afternoon of 12 April. They discussed 
and reached three points of common understanding on the 
pleasure-boat fire incident in the Qiandao Hu. They are: 
First, at present, it is necessary to make all efforts to speed 
up the investigation of the Qiandao Hu incident and to publish 
the cause as soon as possible; second, the two organizations 
agree in principle that they exchange opinions on incidents 
involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots of the 
two sides; and third, both organizations should do all they can 
within their respective authority to clear up the negative 
effects of the incident. 
  According to a briefing, Tang Shubei told Shi Qiping: While 
contacts and exchanges between compatriots of the two sides are 
growing daily, we are profoundly saddened by the Qiandao Hu 
incident, which, to our great sorrow, resulted in the deaths of 
24 Taiwan compatriots, who had come to the mainland for 
sightseeing, and eight mainland compatriots. On behalf of the 
ARATS, he grieved for the victims and asked Mr. Shi to once 
again convey deep condolences to their families after he went 
back to Taibei [Taipei]. 
  Tang Shubei said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council have paid close attention to the incident. 
They promptly instructed the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee 
and the provincial people's government to rush to rescue 
victims, to properly deal with the aftermath, and to step up 
efforts to investigate the cause of the incident. The State 
Council Taiwan Affairs Office, the Public Security and 
Communications Ministries, the National Tourism Administration, 
the Zhejiang provincial and Hangzhou city governments, and other 
relevant departments went into action immediately. Recently, 
leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council again 
ordered the Zhejiang CPC Committee and the government to make 
all efforts to speed up the investigation of the cause while 
earnestly dealing with the incident's aftermath. Should the 
involvement of external forces be discovered and verified, it is 
imperative to harshly punish them regardless of who was 
involved. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council also 
instructed the perimeter provinces and cities to actively 
cooperate with the work conducted in Zhejiang. Tang Shubei 
said: In the course of handling the incident, the Zhejiang 
departments concerned did all they could to respect the wishes 
of the bereaved families and to provide them with all kinds of 
help; and explained to them why some things could not be done 
because of the limitation of local conditions. We should say 
that the mainland has paid close attention to promptly dealing 
with the aftermath. 
  Tang Shubei said: In the process of handling the incident, 
ARATS, in the spirit of assisting relevant departments to deal 
with problems arising from exchanges between compatriots of the 
two sides and of safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of 
compatriots of the two sides, has actively cooperated with and 
assisted the competent authorities to promptly deal with the 
incident. It also dispatched its deputy secretary general, Liu 
Gangqi, to visit the incident site to help deal with relevant 
matters. ARATS immediately contacted the SEF to inform it of 
its handling of the incident, and did so in the capacity of a 
nongovernment organization. 
  Tang Shubei emphatically said: Taiwan compatriots' lives, 
property, and security are safeguarded on the mainland. State 
law protects Taiwan compatriots the same way as mainlanders, and 
there is definitely no such problem as discrimination. The 
unfortunate mishap [shi gu 0057 2399] on Qiandao Hu was an 
unexpected incident in the contacts and exchanges between 
compatriots of the two sides of the strait, and it cannot 
possibly, and should not, influence the development of relations 
between the two sides; still less should it be turned into an 
incident of a "political nature." We hope that Taiwan 
compatriots and concerned departments in Taiwan will look at the 
mishap objectively and calmly. As soon as the truth of the case 
is found, ARATS will inform the SEF as quickly as possible in an 
appropriate way. 
  Tang Shubei said: Incidents that harm the normal rights and 
interests of compatriots of the two sides of the Strait, 
including incidents that cause serious threat to lives and 
property of compatriots of the two sides, have happened in the 
past. ARATS always holds that those incidents should be solved 
promptly through negotiations between the ARATS and SEF. 
Concerning the SEF proposal on "discussing matters on 
safeguarding people's lives, property, and security," Tang 
Shubei said that, through preparations, the two organizations 
could and should exchange opinions on the issue of harm to 
lives, property, and security of compatriots of the two sides of 
the Strait. 
  Tang Shubei also said: The economic and trade exchanges and 
contacts between people of the two sides are good things that 
are beneficial to the development of relations between the two 
sides, because compatriots on both sides will benefit through 
those exchanges and contacts. We do not want the development of 
relations between the two sides to be obstructed by the Qiandao 
Hu mishap, still less let one side use this unexpected incident 
to limit and stop contacts between the two sides and put 
pressure on the other side. ARATS noticed that in the course of 
handling this unexpected incident, some of the views in Taiwan 
tended to go to extremes and we are understandable in regard to 
this matter. However, it should be pointed out that a very 
small number of people attacked and even slandered the mainland 
in an unbridled way. This will only increase distrust between 
compatriots of the two sides and deteriorate the hard-earned 
relations between the two sides of the strait. Regarding this 
point, it is hoped that the SEF will ask concerned departments 
in Taiwan to pay attention to the matter. 
  Tang Shubei also pointed out: Prior to clearly finding out 
and announcing the truth of the mishap, using guesswork to 
spread rumors that the mainland is hiding the truth is totally 
groundless. As to dependents of Taiwan compatriots who were 
killed in the mishap and concerned departments in Taiwan holding 
different views regarding the handling of the mishap by the 
concerned local departments, a responsible person of the State 
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office said in his talk on 9 April that 
it is believed that the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots will 
understand the measures taken and efforts made by concerned 
departments on the mainland in handling the mishap. Meanwhile, 
we are also willing to hear positive suggestions and opinions 
from all sides, including those from Taiwan compatriots. 
  In yesterday's meeting, Mr. Shi Qiping also expressed the 
SEF's opinions to Tang Shubei.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] today wrote a letter 
to Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] on the Qiandao Hu 
tour boat incident. 
  The letter says: Your foundation's 7 April letter "regarding 
holding consultations to handle the Qiandao Hu boat disaster" 
has been received. Regarding the issue raised in the letter, 
replies have been made in the 9 April statement of a responsible 
person of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office as well as 
in our association's 4 April letter and 6 April telephone 
conversations. 
  The letter points out: The personal and property safety of 
the vast number of Taiwan compatriots are protected by the law 
when they visit their relatives, travel, invest, and participate 
in various exchange activities on the Mainland. Relevant 
authorities are putting in great efforts to find out the cause 
for the unfortunate incident of the "Hairui" tour boat accident. 
Your foundation and our association should consider the overall 
task of making joint efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights 
and interests of compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait as well as developing cross-strait relations. The two 
sides should rationally and calmly handle the relevant issue and 
not allow ARATS-SEF cooperation and the development of 
cross-strait relations to be affected. 
  The letter says: In cross-strait exchanges, many incidents 
involving the loss of lives and property of Mainland and Taiwan 
compatriots have occurred. Our association has always paid 
close attention to this sort of issue. We suggest that ARATS 
and SEF hold talks after making necessary preparations. As for 
dealing with the aftermath of the "Hairui" tour boat accident, 
our association is willing to listen to your foundation's 
opinions, and convey them to relevant departments.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The personal safety 
and property of Taiwanese tourists on the Mainland are protected 
by law, said the Mainland-based Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) here today. 
  In response to an April 7 letter from the Taiwan-based 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ARATS said that Taiwan 
Affairs Office of China's State Council had already made clear 
its stand on the matter and on the handling of the boat fire 
tragedy. 
  The boat disaster claimed 32 lives, including 24 Taiwanese 
tourists, on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31. 
  ARATS said in its letter of reply that Taiwan compatriots 
coming to the Mainland to visit relatives, travel, for 
investment or other activities, have their personal safety and 
property protected by the law. 
  The Mainland departments concerned are doing all they can to 
find out the cause of the incident, according to the letter. 
  It urged SEF to handle the matter in a rational and 
cool-minded manner, so as to avoid a setback in relations 
between the two associations and the two sides of the straits. 
  It said that there had been several incidents involving the 
loss of lives and property of Mainland compatriots and Taiwan 
compatriots contemporaneous with past contacts between Taiwan 
and the Mainland. ARATS has been following the matter closely 
and is prepared for talks on the matter after necessary 
preparations. 
  ARATS said it was willing to listen to the opinions of SEF 
and will forward them to the Mainland departments concerned.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP) -- China is making every 
effort to uncover the true causes of a blaze aboard a pleasure 
boat last month that left 32 dead, including 24 Taiwan tourists, 
the foreign ministry said Thursday. 
  In the first official government reaction to the March 31 
disaster that caused an outcry in Taiwan amid accusations of 
foul play, the foreign ministry pledged that the findings of the 
investigation would be made public as soon as possible. 
  Chinese media reports have so far insisted that the boat 
fire 
on Qiandao Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang was 
accidental, despite charges from relatives of the Taiwan victims 
that arson and robbery were the motive. 
  "The departments concerned are combining their efforts to 
deal with the aftermath of the incident, making further 
investigations into its cause and trying to find out the truth 
and make it public as soon as possible," a foreign ministry 
spokesman said. "We do not wish to see a repetition of this 
tragedy." 
  Taiwan has strongly criticised China's handling of the 
incident, especially the decision to cremate the bodies before 
they could be returned to Taiwan and their refusal to let 
relatives near the boat. 
  The Taiwan cabinet on Wednesday suspended sightseeing tours 
to China effective May 1, following on an earlier decision to 
suspend all cultural and educational exchanges and threats of 
sweeping economic reprisals. 
  The government in Taipei, driven off the mainland after 
losing a civil war to the Chinese communists in 1949, has banned 
direct, political contacts with China, but permitted private, 
non-political and indirect exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. 
  Tang Shubei, vice president of the China's semi-official 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) 
warned Taiwan on Wednesday against using the boat disaster as an 
excuse to impede exchanges between the mainland and the 
Nationalist island. 
  The foreign ministry also sought to reassure foreign 
tourists 
who might be wary of travelling in China in the wake of the 
incident. 
  "All tourist departments are carrying out overall safety 
checks and putting into practise all kinds of measures to ensure 
the safety of tourists," the spokesman said. "We believe that 
foreign tourists travelling in China should not and will not be 
affected by individual incidents."

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- The United 
States will likely downgrade Taiwan from its "priority watch 
list" to ordinary "watch list," reducing the threat of trade 
sanctions against Taiwan for failing to eliminate commercial 
piracy, US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said here 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Kantor made the statement while meeting with Taiwan's 
Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang to discuss bilateral 
trade issues. The two are here to attend a ministerial meeting 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Kantor told Chiang he is fully aware of Taiwan's efforts to 
improve intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. "I 
understand Taiwan has made progress in IPR protection," he added. 
  "We also know Taiwan manufacturers are organizing an IPR 
foundation to fight against domestic and foreign infringements 
of their copyrights, trademarks or patents," Kantor said. 
  "So we are considering placing Taiwan on the less serious 
`watch list' instead of the `priority watch list,'" Kantor noted. 
  The US trade representative placed Taiwan on the "priority 
watch list" last April for possible trade sanctions under its 
"super 301" provision. It will decide whether to remove Taiwan 
from the list late this month. 
  Chiang told Kantor that Taiwan is determined to wipe out 
commercial piracy and has taken measures to improve IPR 
protection during the past year, including revising laws to 
increase penalties for offenders and launching massive 
crackdowns on IPR violations. 
  "We hope America can take note of our efforts and remove 
Taiwan from its super 301 watch list," Chiang added. 
  Chiang and Kantor also exchanged views on tariff reductions, 
market opening and wildlife conservation issues during their 
40-minute talk. 
  Kantor reaffirmed US support for Taiwan's early entry to 
GATT, but asked Taiwan to accelerate trade liberalization and 
lower tariff rates in accordance with GATT regulations.

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan is 
determined to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) to play a 
positive and constructive role in the new world trade order, 
Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said here Tuesday [12 
April]. 
  Chiang told participants at a ministerial meeting of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that "the Customs 
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" will do its part 
to help boost the healthy development of a multilateral trade 
system. 
  Taiwan, which applied to join GATT as a separate customs 
territory in January 1990 and was accepted as an observer in 
September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this 
year. 
  All GATT signatories are set to become members of the WTO, 
which will be given tougher enforcement powers to supersede GATT 
and will start operations between January and July next year. 
  About 1,000 delegates from some 150 countries are attending 
the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which is set to endorse 
the agreement reached during Uruguay Round talks in mid-December. 
  Chiang stressed that as the world's 14th largest trading 
nation, Taiwan is ready to devote itself to worldwide economic 
liberalization and market-oriented trading reforms. 
  Chiang's seven-minute speech won resounding applause from 
the 
other GATT delegates. 
  The speech also marked the first time that a ranking Taiwan 
official has spoken at a gathering of international 
organizations since Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in 
1971. 
  The GATT meeting will continue through Friday before making 
a 
"Marrakech Declaration" and establishing a WTO preparatory 
committee.

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- Economics 
ministers of the Republic of China [ROC] and Australia Tuesday 
[12 April] agreed to strengthen bilateral trade ties during 
informal tariff reduction talks here. 
  ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang urged Australia to 
support Taiwan in its bid to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as trade, investment and tourism 
relations between Taiwan and Australia have been growing rapidly. 
  Some 4.8 million Taiwan tourists have visited Australia, 
spending more than than US$8 billion while there, Chiang said. 
  In addition, Taiwan-Australia trade has been growing at a 
rapid rate, Chiang said. 
  Chiang's Australian counterpart, Bob McMullan, agreed that 
Taiwan is one of Australia's most important trading partners in 
the Asia-Pacific and he believes that Taiwan should be a member 
of the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT 
before the end of this year. 
  McMullan added that he hopes Taiwan will gradually reduce 
import tariffs -- especially those on fruit, automobiles, and 
beef -- to meet the regulations set out in the GATT Uruguay 
Round accord. 
  McMullan and Chiang are in Morocco for a GATT ministers 
meeting which opened Tuesday.

  [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- The 13th Economic Session 
of the Sino-Saudi Arabia Permanent Joint Committee on Economic 
and Technical Cooperation closed Wednesday [13 April], with the 
two sides pledging to step up bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation. 
  The two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on 
transportation, shipping, agricultural, power, and 
telecommunications projects. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and Ibrahim 
Bin-Salamah, a deputy minister and vice chairman of the Saudi 
Arabia Basic Industry Cooperation, inked the accord. 
  This was the first vice ministerial-level conference in 
Taipei since the two countries severed diplomatic relations in 
July 1990. 
  During two days of discussions, the two countries 
tentatively 
agreed to sign an investment guarantee pact and an agreement 
eliminating double taxation. 
  They also agreed to reduce tariffs, increase private 
exchanges, and clamp down on pirated computer software. 
  The committee will hold its next annual meeting in Riyadh, 
but the time has not yet been fixed.

  [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Responding to the 
"southern strategy" launched by the government last August to 
cool the Mainland investment fever among local business people, 
271 local companies have shown a willingness to invest in 
Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs reported Wednesday [13 April]. 
  According to a survey made public by the ministry, 132 of 
the 
companies said they have plans to invest in Vietnam, 83 want to 
go into the Philippines, and 56 are aiming for Indonesian 
expansion. 
  The Industrial Development Bureau said those businesses 
interested in investing in the three countries are largely from 
the electronics, machinery, yacht-building, plastics, and 
foodstuffs industries. And aiming to further promote trade and 
economic ties with those countries, the bureau said it has set 
up several ad-hoc groups to provide the latest trade information 
on the countries to local businesses. 
  Additionally, the industrial development and investment 
center under the Economics Ministry will hold intensive 
week-long seminars for local investors, starting April 20, 
focusing on the investment climates in the three countries, 
along with information regarding government incentives on offer 
from those countries and relevant regulations. 
  Opinions and suggestions aired by local businessmen at the 
seminars will be collected and compiled by the government as a 
guide to future policy-making, the bureau added.

  [Text] Testifying before the Legislative Yuan yesterday, 
National Defense Minister Sun Chen said that the nation's armed 
forces have completed the drafting of a manpower plan for the 
next 10 years which will be implemented beginning next July. 
According to the plan, seven army brigadier command 
headquarters and 17 battalions will be dismantled within a year. 
In addition, the army's ordnance and transport schools will be 
merged into the logistics school. Troop strength will be 
reduced by more than 20,000 via the streamlining. 
  Sun Chen said: If our internal and external environments 
continue to develop in the right direction, we may also consider 
accelerating the implementation of the plan or reducing our 
total manpower. He pointed: Internal environments refer to the 
improvement of our fighting capability following the replacement 
of our weapons with newer ones, which will reduce the 
requirements for manpower. Objective environments refer to 
relations across the strait and the international situation, 
both may affect the implementation of the manpower plan. 
  In response to questions by legislators on the emphasis 
placed on strengthening the defense posture in the national 
defense white paper, Vice Minister Ku Cong-lien made a special 
point to explain that the change of the national defense 
strategy from offensive to defensive does not mean a change from 
active defense to passive; rather, it is an active strategy 
adopted to coordinate with the country's economic and foreign 
policies. He said that some people are worried about gaps in 
the national armed forces' fighting capability, but the Ministry 
of Defense actually has long had a plan to prevent the 
development of such a situation; there will never be the 
so-called "gaps" in defense preparations.

<F P=106> [By David Healy in London and our Political Desk] </F>
  [Text] An all-party committee of British MPs comes out 
strongly today in support of Governor Chris Patten's democratic 
package for Hong Kong. 
  The influential Foreign Affairs Select Committee of British 
legislators rejects the evidence they heard from critics of Mr 
Patten's stand -- including that from former adviser to Lady 
Thatcher, Sir Percy Cradock -- and stand squarely behind more 
democracy in the territory. 
  The future of Hong Kong takes up the biggest section of the 
110-page report from the all-party, Tory-dominated committee 
headed by former Conservative Cabinet Minister David Howell. 
  In all, the committee list 14 conclusions and 
recommendations 
that the British Government should pursue in its policy towards 
China in relation to Hong Kong. Mr Patten described the report 
as "a very useful document" and said it "gives solid and 
complete support" for Britain's approach in the territory's 
political development. 
  Speaking after touring Sha Tin yesterday, he said he was 
confident that the legislators would bear this support in mind 
as they consider the last part of the more controversial 
electoral legislation in the coming weeks. 
  Tam Yiu-chung, a pro-China legislator, said the committee's 
firm support for Mr Patten's electoral proposal was expected, 
but it would fuel the already tense Sino-British relationship. 
  Independent legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai said she was 
disappointed at the committee's retraction from its 1989 
position that full democracy be introduced before 1997. 
  The report is deeply pessimistic about the future of 
relations between Britain and China on Hong Kong. It says that 
relations between the two have broken down and are unlikely to 
be repaired. In a long section on the issue it says the 
situation has to be set against the background of the Tiananmen 
Square massacre, the appointment of a "high profile political 
governor" and the recent deterioration in relations between 
Beijing and London. 
  The report says these developments "have been followed by a 
breakdown in negotiations and the probable end of the process 
envisaged in 1984 of a through train to 1997 and beyond". 
  "As a consequence the Hong Kong and British governments are 
confronted with a choice they sought for a decade to avoid: to 
choose between meeting the legitimate aspirations of the people 
of Hong Kong for a distinctive democratic government and an 
agreement with the Chinese. "The British Government had hoped 
that these two aspirations would not have been incompatible. 
They now appear to be so. The holy grail seems out of reach." 
  Had it not been for Tiananmen Square, the committee report 
says, a deal over Hong Kong might have been achieved. "But the 
mutual distrust of the two sides as a result of the Tiananmen 
Square events have given China an opportunity to exploit the 
gaps in the joint declaration and the Basic Law and to seek to 
block the development of democracy in Hong Kong. 
  "We have been convinced by the arguments put to us both by 
the Foreign Secretary and the Governor that a democratically 
defensible set of arrangements for Legco must be put in place," 
the committee says. It says, however, the Chinese have now 
adopted what is in effect a veto on democratic developments in 
Hong Kong, and the Chinese threat to demolish any structures put 
in place will undermine the authority of democratic advances in 
the territory. "The British Government is powerless to prevent 
this happening." 
  The MPs say in their report that the probability of the 
Chinese dismantling any democracy in 1997 forced them to 
consider the alternative, pro-Chinese approach put forward in 
evidence to them by Sir Percy, the former British ambassador to 
Beijing who, in evidence to the committee, criticised Mr Patten. 
  The report says unequivocally: "We have concluded that this 
would not be a tenable position, and that it would not be an 
honorable one either. 
  "It would represent a failure to discharge Britain's 
commitments to advancing democracy in Hong Kong and it would fly 
in the face of the Hong Kong people's aspirations for more 
democracy." 
  The MPs say that the Tiananmen Square events have changed 
the 
desire for democracy in Hong Kong into "an urgent necessity". 
In addition the appointment of the "high profile" Mr Patten as 
governor has added to the desire for change to democracy and the 
committee strongly backs him. "While we have received a number 
of criticisms of the tactics and the handling of the issues 
since the appointment of the new governor we have firmly 
concluded that the Governor has rightly chosen the course of 
seeking to satisfy the demands of the people of Hong Kong." 
  The MPs also say it would be "curious, to say the least", if 
international public opinion continues to press for more human 
rights in China but fails to back the same in Hong Kong, and 
they call for the British Government to continue to seek 
international support for its stand on the territory.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Has the British Parliament's Report </F>
Proved?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of 
the British Parliament published a report on Sino-British 
relations. The report is a self-confession of how the British 
side ruined Sino-British cooperation. It is also excellent 
teaching material for Hong Kong compatriots to know the nature 
of British colonialists. 
  The report affirms and supports Chris Patten's 
confrontational policy and provocative methods of pursuing 
political reform in Hong Kong and states that the British side 
will act unilaterally in the remaining years of the transition 
period. This clearly announces that in the next three years, 
Britain will not converge with the Basic Law or devote itself to 
a smooth transition, but will continue to proceed on the path of 
the "three violations," set up illegitimate organizations (such 
as a human rights commission) and various other obstacles to the 
composition of the special administrative region and the smooth 
implementation of the Basic Law, impose on the special 
administrative region groups of people chosen by Britain and new 
laws and a new political system unilaterally formulated, and 
challenge China in the resumption of the exercise of 
sovereignty. Reinforcing this line of confronting China to the 
end is now intended to win support from parliament. It is also 
intended to reduce domestic pressure on the Major 
administration, whose performance has been unceasingly 
criticized and which is heading toward a dead end, and shift the 
attention of the British people. The British administration 
thinks that by holding a confrontational attitude and adopting a 
stance of protecting British interests, it will immediately show 
an image of "being able to accomplish something" and will arouse 
the nationalist feelings of the British people. 
  On the contrary, this only has exposed its weaknesses. 
First, this has exposed the fact that the British 
administration does not have powers of political analysis and 
will only continue to forfeit Britain's long-term interests in 
the Far East and forfeit the opportunity to develop Sino-British 
cooperation and develop British economic and trade interests. 
  Second, it has exposed the administration's empty show of 
strength. The less strength it has, the more it wants to take 
risks. The outcome will be that its strength and timing will be 
at a disadvantage in the competition and it will surely fail. 
The report encourages unilaterally setting up the three-tier 
councils and pursuing Patten's proposals, while admitting that 
the British can do nothing to prevent China overturning his 
proposals and reorganizing the three-tier councils in accordance 
with the Basic Law. 
  Third, it has exposed the fact that Britain's international 
card has failed everywhere and can no longer create the 
scenario. Britain is attempting to organize "allied forces" and 
launch a crusade on the Hong Kong issue. It has proposed that 
the European Union formulate a common policy to deal with China; 
used "human rights" and "democracy" as weapons in relation to 
loans, aid, and trade agreements with China; issued threats; and 
supported its stand on Hong Kong. But the international 
situation is that, on the question of joining the EU, Britain 
has been isolated from the European continent. At first, it 
appeared tough on relations with other European countries. 
Later, when none of its allies conformed, it drifted to their 
side like a deflated balloon. Its allies do not care about its 
complaints, and it simply does not have much influence in the 
EU. The fact that Britain played the "international card" in 
Europe by asking its allies to follow its policies toward China 
and Hong Kong is just ridiculous now that it has not correctly 
assessed its own strength and does not know its limitations at 
all. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, 
and Luxembourg are all busy developing relations with China, 
doing a lot of business, and seizing markets. Moreover, 
Portugal, taking a different path from Britain, is successfully 
implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and 
negotiating cooperation. Now, Britain is asking for help from 
its allies, but who is going to listen? 
  The British perhaps still cherish hopes about the 
"international card," so the report on Sino-British relations 
once again put forward plans and proposals in hope of success. 
This is a signal and Hong Kong people had better heighten their 
vigilance on the British Hong Kong authorities' 
internationalization scheme. 
  The report does not take the facts into account when it 
links 
Sino-British relations, which are now at a low ebb, with "human 
rights obstacles." Of the Western countries, Britain was the 
first to recognize China, but did it ever consider "human rights 
obstacles then?" Why were there no "human rights obstacles" in 
the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, when Britain maintained 
good relations with China? It was not until Patten began to 
pursue a confrontational line when he arrived in Hong Kong that 
Sino-British relations worsened. The report, however, did not 
mention these facts but shirked responsibility, so how can it 
serve its purpose? 
  The fact that the report attacks Article 18 and Article 158 
of the Basic Law precisely shows that the current low ebb of 
Sino-British relations is caused by Britain's incorrect policy 
on Hong Kong. Britain signed the Joint Declaration and promised 
that Hong Kong would be returned to China and that China would 
resume exercising sovereignty in 1997. But it is unwilling to 
do so and is using tricky plans to prevent China from exercising 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. Everyone on the street knows that 
Britain is opposed to and is preventing China from stationing 
troops in Hong Kong after 1997. Now, it is attacking China for 
having the right to proclaim a state of war preparedness in Hong 
Kong if it is invaded by a foreign enemy and if national unity 
is endangered and has attacked China's NPC Standing Committee 
for having the right to interpret the Basic Law. This has fully 
exposed Britain's ambition of opposing China's possession of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong in ways conducive to the extension of 
its concession-style rule. This "country within a country" only 
appeared in the former Shanghai concessions where the central 
government could not station troops, could not interpret or use 
Chinese laws, and did not have the right to defend its territory 
and deal with riots, and such rights are possessed by all 
countries. Only those in Britain who wish to throw Hong Kong 
into confusion and who shield troublemakers would put forward 
such absurd demands. 
  The report is very frank about telling us the intentions 
which Britain has never told before. Now, Hong Kong people who 
love the country and who love Hong Kong can see more clearly and 
know more clearly what dangerous factors have to be removed in 
order to guarantee a smooth transition and guarantee Hong Kong's 
long-term prosperity and stability.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Another Challenge -- Commenting on Report by </F>
British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of 
the British Parliament published a report to express its opinion 
on current British-Chinese relations and the Hong Kong issue, 
and to express full support for the "constitutional reform" 
being carried out in Hong Kong by the British Government and 
Chris Patten. 
  The document was not so much a report as a letter of 
challenge. 
  It advocated the British side's "independent action" in the 
"pre-1997 electoral arrangements" and in the "legislation on 
affairs before the handover of sovereignty." 
  It advocated playing the "international card," and called 
for 
"continuing to seek international support" for Britain's 
position on the Chinese issue, and "especially cooperation with 
European allies and the United States" on this issue. 
  It also called for "coming into contact with the Legislative 
Yuan of Taiwan," "reviewing the status of the Taiwan 
representative office in Britain," and "relaxing the 
restrictions" on it. 
  The "report" did not wear any guise. It simply challenged 
China, and even interfered in China's internal affairs in an 
undisguised and even frenzied manner. Any people with a sense 
of justice and with judgment can easily see its essence. 
  The "international card," the "human rights stick," and the 
"Taiwan chess-move [qi 2759]" all are nothing but tricks played 
by the British side since becoming helpless after being strongly 
condemned for its Hong Kong policy; such tricks will get Britain 
nowhere. Facts in the past more than one year prove this. 
  It was not beyond people's expectation that the Foreign 
Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament would "fully 
support" Patten's "constitutional reform package." In November 
1993 and in January 1994, the committee held hearings on the 
Hong Kong issue. It attacked China by saying, without grounds, 
that China "tried to impose a corruptive electoral system on 
Hong Kong" and also proved, without grounds, that Patten's 
package did not violate the Sino-British agreements. The 
committee was, in fact, Patten's mouthpiece and said only what 
Patten wanted it to say. 
  The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the 
British Parliament was written according to a series of hearings 
between July 1993 and February 1994, and according to the 
conclusions it drew from its visits to China, Hong Kong, and 
Taiwan. It proved that Patten had "chosen a correct line." 
This certainly could not deceive anyone. 
  Here, we do not discuss whether the members of the committee 
listened to the voices criticizing Patten when they visited Hong 
Kong and the Chinese mainland. Within Britain, the business 
circles generally were opposed to Patten's package. Some people 
of insight in political circles also criticized the British 
Government's Hong Kong policy. Percy Cradock, the former 
foreign affairs adviser to the British Government who 
participated in the Sino-British talks and was involved in 
signing the Joint Declaration and the following agreements, also 
repeatedly criticized Britain's Hong Kong policy for taking the 
wrong course after October 1992. In his written opinion 
submitted to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, he criticized 
Patten's handling of Sino-British relations and pointed out that 
this practice had led to confrontation and had harmed Hong Kong. 
He advised the British Government to "adopt the only option, of 
maintaining cooperation with Beijing when handling Hong Kong's 
future." After that, he again sent a letter the Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee, pointing out that some of Patten's testimony 
at the committee's hearing was untrue. However, the committee 
not only rejected more objective and responsible opinions such 
as those expressed by Cradock, but also denounced such opinions 
as "both untenable and dishonorable." As it treated different 
and even correct opinions in this way, could people believe that 
the report's conclusions were correct and tenable? 
  The continuing Sino-British disputes were provoked by the 
British side. It was again the British side that undermined the 
Sino-British talks aimed at solving differences and at reaching 
an agreement on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. 
From beginning to end, the British side had no sincerity for 
cooperation with the Chinese side at all, and it had made up its 
mind long ago to act perversely and unilaterally. The report 
pretended to be serious by saying that "if China does not 
cooperate,...it is necessary for the government to act 
independently." It made an unfounded countercharge and tried to 
make people feel that the British side's "independent action" 
was caused by "the Chinese side's unwillingness to cooperate." 
  The Chinese side's sincerity for cooperation was clearly 
demonstrated in the document published by the Chinese side about 
the truth of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political 
arrangements. The British side's practice of closing the door 
to the talks and rejecting cooperation on the issue of the 
political structure also was laid bare by its own White Paper on 
"Representative Government in Hong Kong." Here we quote two 
passages from the White Paper for our readers to make their own 
judgments: 
  "The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong 
Government in the talks was to establish whether an 
understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of 
electoral arrangements which they could commend to the 
Legislative Council in Hong Kong." 
  "When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would not 
be 
possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the British 
draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British representative 
made plain that his instructions did not give him the authority 
to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding." 
  The two passages made it plain that the Sino-British talks 
had to follow the will of the British side, and when it was 
impossible to reach an agreement according to the British side's 
opinion during Round 17 of the talks, the British representative 
simply refused to continue the talks. Look! Did the British 
side have any bit of sincerity for the talks and for cooperation? 
  No matter how the Foreign Affairs Select Committee tried to 
conceal the British side's behavior in undermining the talks and 
rejecting cooperation, it was simply to no avail. The British 
side may "independently" arrange the 1994-95 elections and 
"independently" conduct legislation on affairs before the 
transfer of sovereignty, but all this will come to an end on 30 
June 1997 and will never be able to extend beyond that date. No 
matter whether Patten believes this or not, the facts will 
provide him with a merciless answer.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "More Light, Less Heat on Xi Issue"] </F>
  [Text] While the fate of Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang 
remains obscure pending an appeal, the circumstances surrounding 
his case have been clarified to a certain extent. 
  Not everyone is satisfied with the official accounts that 
have been released by Beijing this week. In a reflection of 
public concern about the secretive way the case has been handled 
so far, local delegates to the National People's Congress (NPC) 
have signed a letter calling on China to give a full account of 
Xi Yang's trial. 
  A number of other people who are generally identified as 
supporters of Beijing have expressed concern about the severity 
of the sentence as well as the wider implications of the case. 
  Many of these people plainly want to be as charitable as 
they 
can towards China while trying to make clear to Beijing 
officials the need to be sensitive to public opinion in Hong 
Kong. 
  China has much to gain from listening to these concerned 
groups and individuals. It also has much to gain, in terms of 
its own credibility, from reconsidering the sentence when the 
appeal is heard. Apart from anything else, local journalists 
need to know where they stand in their dealings with the 
mainland. 
  We hope China will respond to the genuine and justifiable 
concerns that have been raised. 
  But we also hope that public opinion here will not be swept 
by a wave of emotion and indignation. No one disputes that the 
emotions that have been engendered are natural and genuine. But 
the case illustrates a different outlook on life. 
  The sentence was shocking to many people here, but the 
notion 
that China has a right to protect its state secrets should not 
be. 
  Nor should we be shocked by the fact that Beijing officials 
believe the sentence was lenient. 
  What some see as routine journalistic enterprise, Chinese 
authorities view as espionage--although a certain amount of 
confusion has been created by different interpretations of a 
Chinese word which can mean either "espionage" or "stealing 
state secrets". 
  The worst mistake anyone could make would be to adopt a 
patronising tone and point out to Beijing officials "the error 
of their ways". 
  Calm and rational arguments, not inflammatory rhetoric, are 
needed in complex, emotionally charged issues such as this. It 
may be difficult to keep an even keel, but people should avoid 
the extremes of debate. 
  No voice should be stilled for fear of sparking discussion. 
What is needed is more light and less heat. Exaggerating the 
issue serves no effective purpose. Let's aim for more reason 
and less volume.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Many of those just 
appointed by the Chinese Government as the third batch of Hong 
Kong affairs advisers pledged to give full play of their roles 
in the dialogue between the Chinese Government and local 
residents. 
  Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for Democracy and 
People's Livelihood, said, "This provides me a good chance to 
have direct dialogue with the Chinese Government. I will give 
different views if it is necessary." 
  James Wong, a noted composer and a critic, said: "I was much 
surprised to hear about the news of my being invited to serve as 
a Hong Kong affairs adviser. This shows the Chinese Government 
is enlightened, open-minded and ready to listen to different 
views." 
  Chao How-chen, chairman of the Tsuen Wan district board and 
a 
member of the regional council, said Hong Kong is confronted 
with a wide scope of complicated issues in the latter half of 
the transitional period. The Chinese side should solicit views 
from all social stratum. 
  He advised the Chinese Government to have regular meetings 
and make in-depth discussion of Hong Kong affairs. 
  Wan Lam, deputy general-secretary of the new territories 
communities, said, "As a member of the third batch of Hong Kong 
affairs advisers, I will, as always, voice the opinions of 
residents and fishermen in the new territories and do a bit for 
the prosperity of Hong Kong." 
  He believes the Chinese Government is capable of making a 
smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong even if no cooperation 
from the British side. 
  Wang Siu-yee, member of the Kowloon city district board, 
said, the most important thing for a Hong Kong affairs adviser 
to do is to let the Chinese Government know what is happening in 
Hong Kong and what the Hong Kong residents need. 
  For instance, he said, "A sharp gap between the rich and 
poor 
is a big issue in Hong Kong. I will forward views in this 
respect to the Chinese Government." 
  In view of the fact that the Sino-British negotiation on the 
1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong terminated, he 
suggested that the preliminary work committee should speed up 
work in various fields and work out a set of policies in the 
interests of both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland through 
soliciting a wide spectrum of views.

  [Text] Chengdu, April 13 (XINHUA) -- A research institute 
in Sichuan Province has developed an advanced technological 
process that greatly reduces industrial consumption of fuel and 
materials. 
  The "gas separation process by pressure swing absorption" 
(PSA) developed at the Southwest China Institute of Chemical 
Industry (SCICI) is being used in 270 chemical and other 
enterprises throughout China. 
  According to SCICI President Feng Xiaoting, these PSA 
installations consume 500 million kwh less electricity and 
600,000 tons less coal a year than the conventional cooling 
process. 
  That means an additional cut of one billion yuan in 
production cost for the enterprises. 
  In 1985, SCICI won the state scientific progress prize for 
developing the process and industrializing its use. "Nationwide 
application of the process is being promoted by the state 
commission for science and technology," Feng said. 
  "We concentrate on what is most urgently needed by the 
country and enterprises -- that's the secret of our success," he 
said, adding that since 1984, the institute has won national 
prizes for nine scientific accomplishments. 
  Next in importance to psa is a method that reduces use of 
natural gas from 1,200 cubic meters for producing a ton of 
ammonia to 850. 
  The method is specifically meant for synthetic ammonia 
plants 
with a production capacity of less than 50,000 tons a year. 
There are more than 1,000 such plants throughout China, 
including about 80 in Sichuan Province. 
  "If the method is used in all Sichuan plants, that will save 
an annual average of 400 million cubic meters of gas and 250 
million kwh of electricity," Feng said.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP) -- Five years after the 
launch of a massive pro-democracy movement that made China's 
communist regime tremble with fear, the country's leadership is 
again on guard although most dissidents think the time is not 
ripe for another "Beijing Spring." 
  "It's true that social tensions are high and that there are 
similarities with the situation five years ago, but don't expect 
a popular uprising in the near future," said Wang Dan, who 
became one of the student leaders of the 1989 movement. 
  The first demonstrations in 1989 began not in June, but on 
April 15 on the death of former communist party general 
secretary Hu Yaobang. Thousands marched to Tiananmen Square to 
mourn the man who had been sacked two years before for his 
reformist views, and the movement swelled until being bloodily 
crushed on June 4 in the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  Wang's opinion is shared by most other dissidents, many of 
whom emerged from the shadows at the end of last year when they 
began forming groups again and publicly demanding more democracy 
in China. 
  China's economic and political stability are threatened on 
several fronts: Raging inflation, rampant corruption, rising 
unemployment, increasing rural poverty in certain areas, and the 
government's loss of economic control. 
  "The older problems were never resolved, and now new ones 
have emerged," says Ding Zilin, a Beijing University philosophy 
professor and a signatory of one of several letters addressed to 
the government recently demanding more democracy. 
  "If the peasants and workers rise up together, general chaos 
would be the result. We are worried and that is why we wrote to 
the authorities," said Ding, who lost a son in the Tiananmen 
Square massacre. 
  This year's repeated calls by the government for "public 
order" as well as the repeated arrests of dissidents betrays a 
genuine worry on its part. The declining health of Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping, nearly 90, leaves open all sorts of 
questions about the political future of the world's last big 
communist country. 
  Knowing that corruption was one of the sparks that set off 
the 1989 movement, the authorities devoted much publicity to 
Monday's death sentence imposed on a businessman, as well as a 
20-year sentence handed down to a vice-minister, both of whom 
had been involved in a huge financial scandal. 
  Intellectuals here are also aware of the risks they may run 
of mounting sustained protests. 
  "Today, many Chinese and especially the students are afraid 
of instability, because they want to take part in and benefit 
from the market economy, which was not the case five years ago," 
said Yang Zhou, a veteran dissident and spokesman for the 
Shanghai-based Chinese Association of Human Rights. 
  "The mindset has changed in recent years, because people now 
are looking out first and foremost for their own interest," 
added Wang Dan. 
  The shift in Chinese attitudes has moved dissidents to 
reconsider matters. Without abandoning their democratic ideals, 
they are trying to redirect their campaign to deal with problems 
faced in the day-to-day lives of most Chinese such as tenants' 
rights and job layoffs. 
  "We absolutely must be closer to the people," says Bao Ge, a 
human rights campaigner in Shanghai who wants to form a new 
organization dedicated to solving concrete social problems. 
  "One of the things the leadership fears is that dissidents 
manage to integrate themselves into society," said a European 
diplomat in Beijing. "And that is why the campaign of 
repression has not let up."

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Customs Gets Tough: Smugglers Can Be Shot"] </F>
  [Text] Violent and armed smugglers who refuse or resist 
Chinese customs examinations for contraband at sea will be shot, 
according to a new policy that takes effect this year, customs 
authorities warned. 
  "While checking smuggling suspects and ships at sea, armed 
anti- contraband customs personnel can open fire on those who 
resist, try to escape from the examination by using violence, or 
try to recover their confiscated contraband or other smuggling 
evidence," an official for the Beijing-based General 
Administration of Customs (GAC) told CHINA DAILY yesterday. 
  The new policy indicates that the Chinese government is 
intensifying its crackdown on the rising tide of smuggling along 
the country's south eastern coast, said the official, who 
declined to be named. 
  To tackle the widespread problem of smuggling at sea, 
China's 
law since 1989 has authorized anti-smuggling inspectors to use 
weapons against violent and armed smugglers. 
  But the use of weapons by customs personnel has been 
carefully controlled except in some dangerous circumstances. 
  The GAC, to regulate its anti-smuggling efforts at sea, 
requires its staff to wear specified black uniforms and to show 
their identity cards when checking suspects. 
  The inspectors should use designated anti-smuggling ships or 
high-speed motor boats flying China's national flag and bearing 
the customs insignia. 
  The official also stressed that Chinese and foreign ships 
and 
crewmen have the right to refuse an anti-smuggling check at sea 
if the above stipulations are not followed by customs personnel. 
  A few cases of misunderstanding or disputes over customs 
checking have been reported, as people generally are unfamiliar 
with the GAC's regulations on anti-smuggling checks. In 
addition, some unidentified agencies have illegally checked 
ships at sea by posing as Chinese customs officials. 
  Earlier this year, China described some major achievements 
in 
its war against smuggling at sea, thanks to a large-scale joint 
operation launched in the southeastern region last year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (AFP)--Beijing police are 
cracking down on the capital's currency black market following 
the murder of a moneychanger, arresting several traders in 
recent days, one dealer said Thursday. 
  "We can't change money, we're too frightened," said the 
stallholder in the Ritan clothing market, a centre for the 
illegal trade in the Chinese yuan. 
  "The police closed down lots of stalls and arrested the 
stallholders last week for continuing to change money," she 
said, adding that the crackdown followed the murder last month 
of a trader from northwestern Xinjiang province. 
  "He was murdered during a moneychanging deal. We don't know 
who did it," she said. 
  At least four nearby stalls were closed, with notices 
reading 
"Shut on April 8, 1994" pasted across their doors. The 
stallholder said the market was still crawling with plainclothes 
police. 
  China's black market has continued despite this year's 
currency reforms, which included the unification of the dual 
rate system that had previously pegged the yuan officially at 
5.7 yuan to the dollar compared with about 8.7 yuan on swap 
markets and on the street. 
  Traders were buying dollars for up 8.87 yuan last month, 
when 
the foreign exchange market rate was 8.69 yuan and banks, with 
their hefty commission, were giving individuals just 8.48 yuan. 
  The stallholder said she did not know the present black 
market rate.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Beijing is considering a single tax on peasants to 
replace an array of arbitrary charges. A single tax was tried 
by the Ming Dynasty in the 16th century, but it failed to save 
it from tax revolts and eventual collapse. 
  Frustrated by its inability to cap the proliferation of 
arbitrary charges and fees imposed on farmers, which have led to 
violent uprisings among the 800-million-strong rural population, 
policy analysts in the Ministry of Agriculture have proposed a 
unitary tax geared to household income, sources in Beijing said. 
The proposal was put to national leaders for the first time at 
a national agriculture work meeting last month. 
  The ministry is pushing for the new tax to be implemented as 
early as next year in order to guard against tax revolts like 
those last year in Sichuan and Anhui. It would replace the 
existing 3 per cent state agricultural tax and provincial and 
local levies. The single tax idea has already won strong 
support from farmers, the sources said. 
  A survey by the ministry and the State Council's Development 
Research Centre early last month revealed growing friction 
between local cadres and farmers over the actual amount of every 
fee levied last year, a survey team member said. 
  "The peasants were also surprised when the cadres mentioned 
the newspaper and entertainment fees. They said they had never 
seen a movie in their lives!" According to the official, a 
unified tax was seen by Beijing as the main way to calm the 
peasants and bring political stability. "Those in the survey 
were willing to accept rates of 7 or 8 per cent of their income, 
as long as it was fixed from year to year." 
  A State Council decree of last April limited fees to 5 per 
cent of peasant income, but evidence gathered so far suggests 
that this has hardly dented the rapacity of local officials. A 
report in the FARMERS' DAILY [NONGMIN RIBAO] last December 
showed 47 per cent of households did not know about the national 
directive limiting charges to 5 per cent of incomes. 
  The recent survey, which covered four counties in Sichuan 
and 
Hunan, found that taxes consumed an average of 8.4 per cent of 
peasant incomes in 1992, a figure which the official said was 
"almost certainly much higher" in 1993. 
  However, the single tax proposal was likely to run into 
strong opposition from local officials, fearful the central 
government would take most of the revenue, leaving them with 
little. 
  "In fact much of the problem of excessive taxes comes from 
the upper level governments, who demand money for large scale 
irrigation and distribution projects," the official said. "The 
local governments we have talked to say there would be nothing 
left over for their provision of basic services." The official 
said resolving the split of the tax between government levels 
would be the biggest hurdle to overcome. 
  In 1579, Ming dynasty rulers implemented a so called "single 
whip" tax system, meant to check the power of local authorities 
to impose arbitrary charges, requisitions and services from the 
peasantry. But the "single whip" tax is seen by scholars as a 
failure because it came down harder on poor areas than on rich 
ones. Local opposition to the tax contributed to the 
deterioration of imperial finances control in the last few 
decades before the dynasty was overthrown in 1644. 
  Under the Communists, the imposition of charges to pay for 
local services has multiplied since agricultural reforms giving 
peasants control over their own production began in the 1980s. 
The burgeoning tax burdens of China's peasants were singled out 
by scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in their 
1994 Outlook as an important factor causing a "trend towards 
instability" in the Chinese countryside. It said that reducing 
the tax burden on peasants would be difficult this year and it 
would "very likely exceed the 1993 levels". 
  The ministry issued a further warning last week to local 
governments about exaggerating local incomes in order to justify 
higher taxes. "Each household knows its own income, and maybe 
its neighbours', but they can't see what the cadres report to 
the central government," the official said. 
  Despite changes in the countryside, mainland social analysts 
say peasants remain vulnerable to being systematically oppressed 
by the state. "Their unorganised nature makes them vulnerable 
and an easy target of exploitation," said one analyst.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 3112): </F>
"Academic Circles Challenge China's System of Party Leading the 
Government"] 
  [Text] Mainland China's political system is characterized 
by party leadership over the government, and by the blurred 
boundary between the party and the government. This idea that 
the party is above the state has begun to be challenged by legal 
studies circles. 
  Mainland scholar Guo Daohui [6753 6670 2547] published an 
article in the latest issue of FAXUE YANJIU [Legal Research], 
entitled "Authority, Power, or Right -- Pondering Relations 
Between the Party and People's Congress From a Legal 
Perspective," in which he criticized the idea of the party 
exercising leadership over the government. He stressed that in 
a socialist country, the ruling power of the communist party is 
not granted by heaven, and that the communist party is not a 
leading organ above the people's congress. 
  Guo Daohui pointed out that the communist party's power to 
lead is a kind of political rallying force, a persuasive and 
influencing force, and that this kind of power to lead in terms 
of political ideology is different from state power and is not a 
kind of compulsory political force, nor a general restraining 
force on society. He also stressed that the party's leadership 
over society does not equal one-party dictatorship, and that the 
party's power to lead cannot be higher than people's 
sovereignty. The communist party is not the main body of state 
sovereignty, and cannot directly enjoy the right to rule the 
country. 
  Talking about the relations between the communist party and 
the system of people's congresses, Guo Daohui thought that the 
people's congress system has been established and has been 
operating under party leadership, but this kind of leadership 
cannot be understood as the party directly enjoying the state 
power of the people's congress, or that the party is the supreme 
organ of state power. 
  He also cited the amendments to the mainland's Constitution 
in 1978 and 1982 as examples. In both constitutional 
amendments, the words "under CPC leadership" in the sentence 
"the National People's Congress is the supreme power organ under 
CPC leadership" were omitted, and this indicated that the party 
could not surpass the people's congress.

"Breakthroughs in China's Reform of the Property Rights System"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: Property rights comprise a key 
issue in an economic structure and reform of the property rights 
system is a key to the reform of China's economic structure. 
This reform covers a wide range of fields and has substantial 
contents. Practice over the past 15 years has proved that the 
structural reform of property rights. The remarkable results 
attained in this reform have played a decisive role in China's 
entire economic reform and development and are of a great 
significance to China's establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure by the end of this century and to bringing 
about a sustained, stable, and well-coordinated economic 
development. In view of this, we need to make careful studies 
and bold explorations to constantly push forward the property 
rights structural reform in a planned way and step by step. 
Meanwhile, we should also further emancipate our minds, 
introduce new concepts, accelerate reforms on both the 
government and political structures, and pave the way for the 
establishment of a modern property rights system with Chinese 
characteristics in line with the market economy of our times. 
[end editor's note] 
  During the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China has 
firmly grasped the structural reform of property rights, a key 
issue in the economic structural reform, and has boldly carried 
out experiments and explorations, bringing significant changes 
to the property rights relations. Over the past two years, in 
particular, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's important 
remarks made during his trip to southern China and the spirit of 
both the 14th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, property rights relations are 
entering a new historic phase featuring a brand-new system and 
China has property rights reform. 
<H5>  Fundamental Changes Have Taken Place in the Traditional </H5>
Ownership Pattern and a New Ownership Structure Is Taking Shape 
Which Mainly Relies on the Economy of Public Ownership and 
Allows Common Development of Diversified Economic Elements 
  Judging by the proportionate structures of the country's 
total industrial value and total retail sales volume, the 
proportion occupied by the output value of state-owned 
industrial enterprises in the country's total dropped from 77.6 
percent in 1978 to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992; while the 
proportion of collectively run industrial enterprises went up 
from 22.4 to 38.2 percent. Growing out of nothing, other 
industrial enterprises, including those which are 
foreign-invested, individually run, and privately owned, are now 
enjoying an industrial output value which accounts for 13.5 
percent of the country's total. Of the total volume of retail 
sales, the proportions of the state-owned and collective sectors 
dropped from 54.6 and 43.3 percent respectively in 1978 to 41.3 
and 27.9 percent in 1992, while the proportion of other economic 
elements went up from 2.1 to 30.8 percent. This shows that the 
unitary public ownership pattern has been replaced by a 
multiownership structure which mainly relies on public 
ownership, under which the proportion of public owned economy is 
declining while that of the nonpublic owned economies is on a 
gradual increase. What is more, the development of the 
nonpublic owned economies has been constantly accelerated: In 
1992, the added value of state-owned industries, collective 
industries, township and town industries, and foreign invested 
industries went up by 14.4, 28.5, 40, and 48.8 percent 
respectively over the previous year, showing the fact that the 
state owned economy is growing at a slower pace than the 
collective and other economies. By the end of 1992, the total 
number of nonpublic owned enterprises in Guangdong Province had 
already reached 1.171 million with a total of 6.343 million 
employees and a total registered capital of 264.68 billion yuan. 
Nonpublic owned enterprises now account for 52.4 percent of the 
total number of enterprises, higher than the total of state 
owned and collectively run enterprises (31.2 and 16.4 percent), 
resulting in a development trend featuring coexistence and the 
common development of economies under diversified ownerships. 
  Enterprise Experiments With the Joint-Stock System 
Are Undergoing Healthy Development 
  China has strived to create a sound social environment for 
experiments with the joint-stock system and the past two years 
have witnessed the biggest and fastest development of China's 
joint-stock enterprises. As of the end of 1993, there were 
already more than 13,000 enterprises in all sectors 
experimenting with the joint-stock system, of which 9,440 were 
joint-stock enterprises newly established in 1994, registering a 
155-percent increase over the previous year. A total of 182 
joint-stock companies from over 20 of the country's provinces 
and regions have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock 
exchanges, 106 in Shanghai and 76 in Shenzhen (up by 179 and 130 
percent respectively over the previous year), with a total stock 
value (A Share) of about 400 billion yuan. By the end of June 
last year, China already had over 2,000 companies with specific 
fundraising targets, 1,700 of which allowed their workers and 
staff to become stockholders with a total share value amounting 
to 23.5 billion yuan. The companies with specific fundraising 
targets in the five provinces and cities of Guangdong, Liaoning, 
Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, account for 36.7 percent of the 
country's total, with a total share value of 19.2 percent of the 
total. Last year, while actively issuing public shares and 
continuing to act as experimental units for B Shares for 
overseas investors, nine economically strong state-owned large 
enterprises started to raise funds in foreign capital markets. 
Of the nine, six have listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange 
issuing H Shares, such as the Shanghai Petrochemical Works and 
the Qingdao Brewery. Meanwhile, the growth of township and town 
joint-stock cooperative enterprises is also gaining momentum. 
There were already 100,000 such enterprises across the country 
by the end of 1993. In Shanghai, the number of various kinds of 
township and town joint-stock cooperative enterprises reached 
2,993 at the end of 1993 with 115,000 employees. The total share 
value of these enterprises stood at 1.46 billion yuan, of which 
shares of united cooperatives totalled 232 million yuan; shares 
of legal persons, 240 million yuan; and individual shares, 990 
million yuan. Over the past two years, these joint-stock 
enterprises have further standardized their activities to 
gradually bring themselves in line with normal operation. 
<H5>  Introduction of Foreign Funds and Capital Exports Are Under </H5>
Expansion 
  Statistics show that of the 117 countries and regions around 
the world which have made investment in China, Hong Kong 
accounts for the largest proportion, followed by Taiwan and the 
United States. The year 1993 witnessed the biggest amount of 
funds China has ever attracted from outside the country. In 
1993, the number of newly registered foreign-invested 
enterprises stood at nearly 85,000, pushing the total number to 
167,500 with a total registered capital of $245.63 billion. In 
the same year, 83,265 new foreign-invested enterprises were set 
up in China, entailing a total contracted foreign investment of 
$110.852 billion and an actual foreign investment input of 
$25.759 billion, up by 70.6, 90.7, and 134 percent respectively 
over the previous year. By the end of 1993, the accumulated 
total amount of newly approved foreign-invested enterprises 
exceeded 173,975 with a total contract foreign investment of 
$217.216 billion and a total amount of actually used foreign 
funds of $56.912 billion. The five special economic zones of 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan have always been 
regarded as hot spots for foreign investment. By the end of 
1992, the number of foreign-invested projects in these five 
zones totalled 15,300, with a total contracted foreign 
investment of $22.5 billion and a total amount of actually used 
foreign funds of $9.24 billion, accounting for one-sixth, 
one-fifth, and one-fourth respectively of the country's total. 
At present, China has 121 national-level development zones in 
five categories. Of the total, 32 are economic and 
technological development zones which have effectively developed 
and utilized 145 square km of land to established over 7,000 
foreign-invested enterprises, involving contracted foreign 
investment of over $14 billion and actually used foreign 
investment of over $5.5 billion. Projects which entail an 
investment of $100 billion and above now exceed 100. 
  In the past two years, foreign-invested enterprises have 
begun to extend from the coastal areas to inland provinces and 
cities as well as the western part of China. Last year, 
foreign-invested enterprises in five northwestern provinces and 
regions totalled about 3,000, over 10 times as many as at the 
beginning of the previous year, pushing up the proportion in the 
country's total number of foreign-invested enterprises from 0.6 
to 1.6 percent. The five northwestern provinces and regions are 
also enjoying an increasingly large amount of contract foreign 
investment, which already exceeds $5 billion. Qinghai Province 
had only three foreign-invested enterprises in 1991; yet by the 
end of last year, the province had over 60 foreign-invested 
enterprises, with a total investment amount of more than $860 
billion. Beijing also attained remarkable results in 
introducing foreign investment last year with 3,752 new 
foreign-invested enterprises being set up involving a total 
contract investment of $10.39 billion, up by 170 and 430 percent 
respectively over the previous year. 
  China's enterprise investment is directed at areas within 
the country as well as other parts of the world. At present, 
China is the largest recipient of direct foreign investment and 
commercial loans on the one hand, and the largest investment 
exporter among developing countries on the other. By the end of 
last year, China had invested a total of $5.16 billion in 4,497 
enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, of which 2,927 
were trading enterprises and 1,570 nontrading enterprises. 
Fujian Province has been actively engaged in transnational 
cooperative operation. By the end of last year, the province 
had set up more than 190 enterprises in over 30 countries and 
regions, including North America, Europe, Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Japan. Of the total investment of $675.43 billion in the 
province, investment made by the Chinese side reached $356.224 
billion, accounting for 52 percent of total investment. Last 
year, the province received 80 applications for establishment of 
enterprises in overseas areas and approval has already been 
granted to 40 of them. 
<H5>  Operational Patterns of "State-Owned and People-Run" or </H5>
"Public- Owned and Private-Run" Enterprises Are Being Adopted By 
State-Owned Small Enterprises in an Overall Way 
  In the past two years, experiments with new operational 
patterns of "state-owned and people-run" or "public-owned and 
private-run" enterprises, which mainly feature means of lease 
and sales, have become a major reform item in state-owned 
commercial sectors, supply and marketing cooperatives, and grain 
administrations across the country. Enterprises which are 
"owned by the state and run by people" occupy a considerable 
proportion in provinces as well as prefectures, cities, and 
counties in northeastern, northern, northwestern, eastern, 
central, and southern parts of China. At present, many 
provinces and municipalities have attained remarkable results in 
the reform of "public-owned and private-run" enterprises, 
including Beijing, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei, 
Guangdong, and Fujian. Nanjing City has put into practice the 
operational pattern of "public ownership and private management" 
in 35 percent of its small stores which have an annual sales 
volume of less than 2 million yuan; as a result, 80 percent of 
them have made up deficits and increased profits and the profits 
and taxes submitted by some of them are up by as much as 800 
percent. Moreover, most of the staff in these stores have seen a 
100 to 200 percent increase in their salaries. This shows that 
we need to sum up good experiences, give correct guidance, and 
continue to expand experiments in this field. 
<H5>  Markets For Property Rights Exchanges Are Being Set Up In </H5>
Turn and State-Owned Enterprises Have Taken an Important Step in 
Putting "Transformed Enterprises [bian xing 6239 1840]" Up For 
Auction and in "Grafting" State-Owned Enterprises Onto Their 
Foreign-Invested Counterparts 
  At present, markets for property rights exchanges of 
differing scales have been set up in over 20 cities and 
prefectures in many 10 provinces, including Shanxi, Liaoning, 
Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Sichuan, 
Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing, 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning, Kunming, Wuxi, and 
Lanzhou. Henan Province has established more than 20 markets 
for property rights exchanges and readjustments of idle assets. 
With more then 400 full- and part-time technical personnel 
specializing in property rights exchanges, these markets are 
enjoying increasingly brisker business and have produced a 
positive impact on society. By the end of last October, Jilin 
Province had put 436 enterprises up for auction and attracted 35 
million yuan (including mergers) from outside the province 
through property rights exchange markets. To date, Mudanjiang 
City has sold by auction 10 enterprises to South Korea, Hong 
Kong, and people from outside the country, retrieving a total of 
57.52 million yuan. Last September, Hunan Province held a 
property rights exchange fair at which 220 enterprises were put 
up for public auction. In the end, 16 enterprises were sold for 
a total of 63.7 million yuan, while five were leased for 2.901 
million yuan. For example, a Hong Kong company purchased the 
Yueyang Chemical Fiber Factory, which had long suffered 
operational losses, for 2 million yuan while an individual 
businessman purchased one floor of the Yiyang Building for 1.2 
million yuan. Most of those who have bought or taken leases on 
these enterprises are businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan as 
well as domestic private entrepreneurs. Over recent years, 
China has also conducted the reform of transforming state-owned 
enterprises into collectives through mergers and other forms. 
By the end of 1992, 34 collective enterprises in Sichuan 
Province had merged 67 state-owned enterprises. Recently, the 
Shanghai Hailian Lubrication Material Research Institute, a 
small state-owned enterprise, was reorganized into a people-run 
collective enterprise under the joint- stock cooperative system. 
  At the same time, fruitful efforts have also been made in 
"grafting" enterprises with foreign investment. In Wuxi City, 
more than half (170 enterprises) the large and medium 
enterprises have recently "grafted" themselves using foreign 
investment. Quanzhou City in Fujian "grafted" all its 
state-owned enterprises (41 enterprises) with foreign investment 
during the first quarter of last year, putting into practice a 
cooperative system in these enterprises. 
  Growing At a Fast Pace, Individual and Private 
Economies Have Become Active Forces in China's Economic 
Development 
  At present, 28 provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, 
and cities listed as independent units in the state plans have 
drawn up policies and measures for the promotion of individual 
and private economic development. Moreover, all localities have 
gradually standardized their management over individual and 
private enterprises, thus bringing about healthy development in 
the individual and private economies. The present period is 
marked by the fastest development of private enterprises since 
registration and a new situation has been opened up wherein, for 
the first time ever, no provinces are plagued by declining or 
sluggish growth. Currently, the industrial output value, the 
total volume of retail sales, and the industrial and commercial 
taxes of privately run enterprises make up 4.1, 18.1, and 7.8 
percent respectively of the country's total. The industrial 
structure of the private economy tends to be more rational. The 
proportion of privately run enterprises engaged in tertiary 
industries has reached 57.4 percent, of which privately run 
scientific and technological consultation enterprises are 
enjoying the fastest development. At present, the number of 
privately run scientific and technological consultation 
enterprises has reached 3,871, registering a 220-percent 
increase over the previous year, while the number of private 
export-oriented enterprises which earn foreign exchange through 
exports totalled 1,996, with a total amount of 1.58 billion yuan 
equivalent in foreign exchange. Last year, 98,286 new private 
enterprises were set up across the country and, by the end of 
last year, the number of private enterprises across the country 
had reached 23.18 million, with 3.726 million employees [figures 
as published]. The total registered capital of these 
enterprises stood at 68.05 billion yuan and the registered 
capital per enterprise rose from 159,000 in 1992 to 286,000 
yuan, a 79.9-percent increase. In 1993, taxes submitted by 
privately run enterprises (including individual industrial and 
commercial businesses) exceeded 29 billion yuan, an increase of 
over 43 percent compared to the previous year. Guangzhou now 
ranks first in the country regarding the number of privately run 
enterprises, totaling 48,500 by 1993 since 1988. These 
enterprises have a total of 642,000 employees and a total 
registered capital of 18.29 billion yuan. Over 100 percent 
growth has also been registered in other places, including 
Beijing, Hainan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Xinjiang, 
and Jinagsu. 
  Individual industrial and commercial sectors have also 
undergone rapid development. By the end of September 1993, 
China had 17.67 million individual industrial and commercial 
businesses, with a total registered capital of 85.48 billion 
yuan and 29.39 million persons engaged. Meanwhile, China's 
nongovernment-run scientific and technological enterprises have 
also displayed their great vigor. According to incomplete 
statistics, the number of nongovernmental scientific and 
technological enterprises had exceeded 50,000 by the end of 
1993, employing 800,000 people, and their total revenue from 
technological transformation, industrial production, and trade 
amounted to 25 billion yuan. 
<H5>  Continued Progress Has Been Attained in Enterprise Merger </H5>
and Bankruptcy and Both the Industrial and Organizational 
Structures of Enterprises Further Rationalized 
  1. Benefiting from an early start, enterprise mergers are 
enjoying a smooth progress. According to statistics for the 
1980's, 6,226 enterprises absorbed through merger a total of 
6,906 other enterprises in 25 provinces, municipalities, 
autonomous regions as well as 13 independent cities in the state 
plan; as a result, the transferred stock assets totalled 8.25 
billion yuan and 4,095 loss- making enterprises were closed 
down, thus avoiding a further loss of 522 million yuan. The 
past two years have seen more noticeable results in enterprise 
mergers. By the beginning of last year, as many as 10,000 
enterprises had been merged, reducing the number of loss-making 
enterprises by a large margin and activating a great amount of 
tied-up capital. As of the first half of 1992, 2,288 
enterprises had been merged in Sichuan Province, accounting for 
1.4 [as published] of the country's total. According to a 
survey conducted last April in 16 cities, including Beijing, 
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen, over 2,900 enterprises 
had been merged; as a result, the transferred stock assets 
rights amounted to about 6 billion yuan and more than 400,000 
workers and staff were resettled. 
  2. Enterprise groups and enterprises are undergoing 
continued development. By the end of 1993, there were over 1 
million groups and companies (centers) across the country, 
552,000 more than the previous year, an increase of 113 percent. 
Both the number of employees and the amount of registered 
capital also went up by 42.6 and 92 percent respectively over 
the previous year. Guangdong has the largest number of 
companies, totalling 114,000; while Beijing, Shanghai, and 
Zhejiang have seen the fastest growth in the number of 
companies, which stood at 179, 170, and 168 percent 
respectively. Of the 55 large enterprise groups selected as 
experimental units by the state, 26 have been listed as 
independent units in the state plan, 18 have set up subsidiary 
financial companies, and 34 have been granted examination and 
approval autonomy on foreign-related projects. Meanwhile, 
readjustments have been made to the management structure and the 
operational mechanism of over 1,600 enterprise groups, of which 
431 have taken initial shape, thus optimizing the personnel, 
assets, and organizational structures of these enterprises. 
  3. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through 
market competition and have declared bankruptcy according to the 
law. From the promulgation of the "Bankruptcy Law" in 1988 till 
the first half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into liquidation 
according to the law as a result of poor management and long- 
standing financial losses, of which 88 were owned by the state 
and 268 by collectives or other sectors. Shenyang was the first 
city in the country to introduce bankruptcy. On 3 December 
1986, the Shenyang City Government declared the bankruptcy of a 
small crackproof materials factory in Shenyang, the first 
bankrupt enterprise ever in mainland China. As of the end of 
1992, 28 insolvent enterprises in Shenyang had gone broke (two 
of which were enterprises under public ownership). Of the 8,591 
workers and staff involved, 4,294 were given new jobs following 
the transfer of enterprise assets and 121 lived on pension while 
awaiting employment. Total external debts of 75.4 million yuan 
were paid off, thus bringing life and economic efficiency back 
to 11.1 million yuan worth of fixed assets as well as sites 
covering a total area of over 12,000 square meters [figures as 
published]. With 2,914 workers and staff, and 1,200 sets of 
equipment of various kinds, the Chongqing Knitting Mill, which 
covers a total ground area of over 11,000 square meters, has an 
annual production capacity of 16 million knitted pieces and 8 
million tonne of processed chemical fiber. However, due to its 
poor management, long-standing debts, and insolvency, the 
factory had no alternative but to submit an application for 
bankruptcy to the court on 8 June 1992. On 3 November 1992, the 
Chongqing City Intermediate Court handed down the ruling, upon 
which the Chongqing Knitting Mill was declared bankrupt. 
Because it is the first time a large state-owned industrial 
enterprise has ever gone broke in the country, the event has 
sent shock waves through the entire society and has become the 
focus of attention of all sides. In the end, through the 
technical work on all sides, proper arrangements were made on 
the issue. 
<H5>  Rural Enterprises Under the Joint-Stock Cooperative System </H5>
Have Become Another Creation By the Masses of Peasants 
  Statistics show that the output value created by 112 million 
workers and staff of township and town enterprises across the 
country reached 2.9 trillion yuan, up by 60 percent over the 
previous year and accounting for 45 percent of the country's 
total purchase volume of export commodities produced by 
foreign-invested businesses. 
  By the end of 1993, the number of rural joint-stock 
cooperative enterprises had soared to 2.08 million, accounting 
for 10 percent of China's total number of township and town 
enterprises. Last year, leaders of over 20 provinces and 
municipalities, including Beijing, Henan, Sichuan, and Anhui, 
all stressed the need to regard the establishment of joint-stock 
cooperative enterprises as a key issue in the future efforts to 
deepen rural reform. They also urged all rural enterprises, 
newly established or transformed, to try hard to turn themselves 
into joint-stock cooperative enterprises. At present, Henan 
Province has more than 15,000 newly established or transformed 
joint-stock cooperative enterprises. In the rural areas of 
Shandong Province, in order to expand their business scale and 
enhance economic efficiency, some owners of individual and 
private businesses have introduced the joint-stock cooperative 
operation by converting factory buildings, capital, 
technologies, and equipment into shares. As one of the 
birthplaces of China's rural joint-stock cooperative economy, 
Zhejiang Province has been enjoying a strong development 
momentum for all these years. As of last August, there were as 
many as over 60,000 rural joint-stock cooperative enterprises 
across the province, of which 50,000 had evolved from individual 
and private businesses, 800 transformed from rural collective 
enterprises, and 10,000 engaged in other economic fields. 
  Wenzhou City, a well-known experimental field for China's 
reforms, has seen an even faster growth of enterprises under the 
joint-stock cooperative system. By the end of last September, 
the number of joint-stock cooperative enterprises in the city 
went up dramatically from 24,000 in the previous year to more 
than 34,000, of which 21,000 were joint-stock industrial 
enterprises with a total output value of 12 billion yuan and 
accounting for 50 percent of the city's total industrial output 
value. Taxes submitted by joint- stock cooperative enterprises 
amounted to over 500 million yuan, making up 45 percent of the 
city's total financial revenue. Today, the joint-stock 
cooperative economy and individual and private economies account 
for 70 percent of Wenzhou's national economy; therefore, they 
are regarded as the foundation of Wenzhou's market economy. 
  At present, reforms on the housing and land use systems are 
being carried out in depth and real estate management is being 
gradually brought onto the right track. Remarkable results have 
been registered in the appraisal of fixed assets and circulating 
funds, aimed at serving the structural reform of property 
rights. Experiments in reforms on the management system and 
administrative structure of state-owned assets have attained 
further progress and laws and regulations favorable to the 
property rights structural reform are being constantly 
reinforced.

  [Text] From a national meeting on coastal defense 
management that closed in Hangzhou on 16 March, this reporter 
learned the Ministry of Public Security has decided, beginning 1 
April, to organize into a single unit all public security 
coastal defense boats assigned to ensure offshore security and 
crack down on smuggling. These boats will use standardized 
names and serial numbers. When performing antismuggling and 
coastal patrol tasks, boats should bring with them proof issued 
by the Ministry of Public Security and which cannot be 
counterfeited that they are allowed to perform offshore duties; 
personnel performing offshore duty should wear a standardized 
duty-performing badge. Domestic and foreign ships may refuse 
inspection by patrol boats and personnel that do not meet the 
aforementioned requirements. [video shows marine policemen in

  [Text] [Reporter] This reporter has learned from the 
department concerned that since China promulgated its Patent Law 
10 years ago, the legitimate rights and interests of 
patent-holders of all countries have been effectively protected 
in this country. According to Supreme People's Court President 
Ren Jianxin, China's courts at various levels have handled some 
1,900 cases of patent disputes and some 1,600 have been settled 
as of the end of 1993. At the same time, the patent 
administrative organs at various levels handled more than 2,200 
patent dispute cases and settled some 1,700 of them. The 
serious handling of a large number of patent cases has protected 
the legitimate rights and interests of patent-holders, yielding 
a good effect at home and abroad. Some patent-holders involved 
in patent disputes have the following to say: 
  [Wang Yongmin, identified by screen caption as inventor of 
the five-stroke Chinese character identifier] It has been 10 
years since the Patent Law promulgation. The law has protected 
the patent of the five-stroke Chinese character identifier. 
Many factories have signed agreements with me. One or two 
factories that did not and violated my patent rights have been 
fined by the court. 
  [Zhang Li, identified by screen caption as inventor of the 
Lunar Vehicle brand magnetic massager] In my view, we must not 
tolerate patent violators. We should use the law as a weapon to 
effectively protect patent right and sternly deal with the 
violators. However, the Patent Law's implementation is not yet 
fully satisfactory. Many people do not understand the Patent 
Law. It is necessary to step up the publicity for it and make 
it known to everyone. 
  [Reporter] Director China Patent Office Gao Lulin believes 
that the increase of patent disputes indicates both an enhanced 
awareness of self-protection on the part of the patent-holders 
and the ignorance of many people with respect to patent. For 
this reason, the number of patent dispute cases will continue to 
rise.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (CNS) -- Director of the Foreign 
Trade Administration Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation Mr. Zhou Keren stressed at a meeting on 
countering the illegal re-export of textiles yesterday that the 
fight against these activities had to be strengthened in order 
to wipe them out. 
  Mr. Zhou said that a consensus was reached during the 
meeting 
for a heavy crackdown on such illegal practice. Participants 
lent their support and expressed understanding of three punitive 
measures submitted by the ministry, the General Administration 
of Customs and the State Import and Export Inspection Bureau and 
of the punishment handed down to four enterprises found guilty 
of violation of the relevant law. They expressed their 
determination to further fight against the illegal re-export of 
textiles. 
  All of the participants were clearly aware of the serious 
harm resulting from such offences which bypassed the quota 
system administration at home and disrupted the conducting of 
foreign trade while it also ran counter to a commitment made by 
China in bilateral and multi-lateral international agreements, 
resulting in great damage to China's prestige and credit in 
terms of foreign trade in the international community. Illegal 
re-exporting carried out by a handful of enterprises caused 
damage not only to the state, but also to themselves finally. 
Their offence made other law-abiding enterprises subject to 
unnecessary inspection and accusations when undertaking 
foreign-related business. 
  Leading teams have already been set up in Tianjin 
Municipality and Shandong Province to counter the illegal 
re-export of textiles and have worked out measures for 
inspection and handling of the offence. The Shenzhen Import and 
Export Commodities Inspection Bureau and the Shenzhen Bureau of 
Economic Development often join forces in inspecting processing 
plants. 
  The Foreign Trade Ministry, the Administration of Customs 
and 
the State Inspection Bureau will continue to send inspection 
teams to do spot checks on enterprises this year. The 
implementation of any decision made by this meeting will be 
examined, while Guangdong, Shantou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Xiamen, 
Zhejiang and Ningbo have to boost cooperation and coordination 
in carrying out inspections of production, transactions, 
examinations, customs declarations and the export of textiles 
there.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's State 
Development Bank (SDB), one of the three policy-oriented banks 
set up as part of a scheme to reform China's financial system, 
went into operation today. 
  The move will ensure the smooth flow of capital to key state 
projects and provide the central government with a powerful 
vehicle to rein in excessive investment in fixed assets, said 
Yao Zhenyan, president of the new bank. 
  According to Yao, the new bank, basically a merger of the 
six 
investment corporations under the State Planning Commission, 
will handle low-interest loans for important infrastructure 
construction projects and basic industries which have been 
bottlenecks in China's economic expansion in recent years. 
  It is also expected to channel funds for the technical 
renovation of backbone state enterprises. 
  The bank already has 345 large and medium-sized projects to 
support, which include the initial preparations for the giant 
Three- Gorges Dam, construction of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway 
and several big power stations, said Yao, former vice-minister 
of the State Planning Commission. 
  The funding will come from the national treasury, which has 
promised to inject a total of 50 billion yuan over the next four 
years as part of the bank's capital assets. 
  However, the working capital will come mainly from bonds 
issued to financial institutions which have been instructed by 
the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank, to purchase SDB 
bonds at a certain proportion of their new deposits. 
  This year, Yao said, the bank will issue some 65 billion 
yuan- worth of bonds. The first issue of 28.5 billion 
yuan-worth will be made during April and May. 
  The national treasury will grant the bank 1.3 billion yuan 
this year as discount on funded indebtedness. 
  "It is likely that the SDB will sell bonds to Chinese 
individuals and float bonds, though not this year," said Yao. 
  But the new bank president stressed the importance of 
investment efficiency. 
  "As it is a state bank," said Yao, "we must ensure the 
return 
of principal, although we are not aiming at profits." 
  At present, the right to choose target projects will stay 
with the State Planning Commission, "but we have a great say in 
deciding the timing of capital lending after feasibility studies 
of the projects," said Yao. He added that the SDB has a special 
working group comprised of senior SDB officials and experts to 
see that credits flow to the projects most in need of capital. 
  The SDB will gradually set up branch offices in regions with 
a relatively high number of key projects, and establish overseas 
agencies if necessary. 
  According to the 61-year-old president, SDB has set about 
reviewing all the projects taken over by the bank this year. 
  "We will try to see that the projects get 40 percent of the 
funding required this year," said Yao. 
  Sources at the central bank say the formation of the other 
two policy-based banks, designed to support imports and exports 
and agriculture, respectively, is under way.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China produced 
250,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of international 
containers last year, becoming the biggest producer in the world. 
  This was announced at a ceremony held here today to mark the 
inauguration of a Special Containers Committee of the China 
Container Industry Association. 
  The container industry started in the United States in 1956. 
China began producing containers in the 1960s. In 1989, the 
country's annual output of containers amounted to 30,000 TEU. 
  In recent years, a batch of Sino-foreign joint ventures for 
containers was set up in China. Many of them have gone into 
production. The Shanghai Far East Container Co. Ltd., a joint 
venture established by the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan, went into production in December 1992. Last year, the 
company's output reached 11,000 TEU of various containers. The 
quality of the company's products meets international criteria. 
  At present, most of the country's container enterprises are 
located in the Chang Jiang Delta and Pearl River Delta in 
south-east China.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Xiao from the "Opinion" page: "State Slows </F>
Down the Economy"] 
  [Text] The performance in the first quarter of this year 
shows that the central government is slowing the tempo of 
economic development. 
  But, if the government wants to continue calling the tune 
and 
keep the dancers on their feet, it has to watch out for 
inflation and the ailing State-owned enterprises. 
  "Against a background of bold reform moves and high 
inflation, a slight slowdown in the economy is good news," said 
Liu Li, an analyst on macro-economic performance with the State 
Economic &amp; Trade Commission. 
  "It may ease worries that an overheated environment could 
undermine the success of the prospective financial reform 
package." 
  Ever since last September when central government went for 
an 
easy money policy, economists have been afraid that the economy 
may be on the way to overheating. 
  But, despite their deep worries, they prefer a step-by-step 
slowdown in the economy to a sudden application of the brakes -- 
the economic instability caused by an emergency stop is the last 
thing they want to see. 
  And now the first signs of the hoped for slowdown are 
becoming apparent. 
  In the period from January to March the industry grew by 
18.6 
percent, which was more than 3 percentage points down on the 
same period last year. 
  And conditions are favourable to the government side in the 
battle against inflation. 
  Consumer market are fairly stable which is helping the 
government to hold down price hikes. Retail sales in the first 
quarter were 25 percent up on the same period last year, a 5 
percent rise after inflation. 
  And in spite of low interest rates, residents continue to 
put 
their money in the banks. 
  According to Liu, bank savings ballooned to 1,660 billion 
yuan ($190.8 billion). 
  This represents deposits of 180 billion yuan ($20.7 billion) 
since the end of last year. 
  During the first few months of last year, by comparison, 
depositors were cashing in their savings to protect themselves 
from inflation. 
  "The wide range of goods in the shops has boosted consumer 
confidence, and they have learnt from 1988's panic buying and 
are more reasonable when going shopping," said the analyst. It 
is widely believed that a nationwide buying spree is now 
impossible. 
  In 1988 when China first witnessed successive months of 
double- digit inflation rates, it was spend, spend, spend. 
  But this year, more and more people are making fixed-term 
deposits at the expense of current accounts, as is shown by the 
downturn in the curve which traces the ratio between the two. 
  This new savings trend shows that people trust in the 
government's determination to fight inflation. When inflation 
prospects were gloomy in 1988 and in the second half of last 
year, people went for current account deposits and the ratio 
curve peaked. 
  Furthermore, by the end of last month banks had clawed back 
the 140 billion yuan ($16.1 billion) which was issued around 
Spring Festival. The reduction in the money supply will help to 
pull down inflation. 
  And the balance of foreign exchange at the end of March is 
expected to exceed $30 billion, compared with only $21 billion 
at the beginning of this year. 
  "The economy is heading for a healthy status and a soft 
landing is in prospect," said Li Guobin, an analyst at the State 
Information Centre. 
  And industrial growth is going to fall off, he said. 
  Enterprises will continue to suffer money shortages, as is 
shown by the declining ratio between business savings and 
industrial output. And as consumer savings increase, sales will 
wane, increasing stockpiles. 
  Businesses are not optimistic about the immediate future of 
their markets. 
  And the government's tight credit policy will also cool down 
the economy. 
  Central financing of capital construction has decreased 23 
percent in the first quarter, according to Liu. 
  But, although money supply is being squeezed, inflation 
seems 
to continue to grow. Li said that the consumer prices index in 
the first quarter was up 20 percent. And inflation will 
continue to be a major problem in the second quarter of this 
year, making it difficult to predict the course of this year's 
economic development. 
  Leading economist Wu Jinglian said that central government 
must stick to its anti-inflation policy. 
  Another knotty problem is the declining performance of 
State- 
owned enterprises. 
  According to Liu Li, 45.9 percent of State-owned enterprises 
were in the red at the end of February. One third of 
State-owned enterprises suffered losses last year. 
  Economists are worried that the ailing enterprises may delay 
banking reform. For, once the State banks are commercialized, 
they will grant loans according to business performance, rather 
than losing their money in the black hole of unprofitable white 
elephants. 
  Meanwhile, the gap between the booming coastal and inland 
regions is widening. 
  In the first quarter, seven provinces in the east and south 
-- Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui Fujian, Jiangxi and 
Guangdong- contributed 12.2 percentage points to the nation's 
18.6-percent industrial growth. 
  And the country's economic progress cannot be secured if its 
regions continue to dance to different beats.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The shareholding 
system has become a new force in advancing the development of 
the Pudong area in East Shanghai. 
  In 1990, the central government approved the opening of 
China's first stock exchange center in Pudong. Now the center 
has 501 member companies, with 152 kinds of stocks listed. It 
became the country's largest stock market in 1993 when its 
business volume reached 500 billion yuan. 
  To date, 27 companies in Pudong have had their stocks 
listed. 
They raised 15 billion yuan through issuing stocks, relieving 
the fund shortage to some extent. 
  The Lujiazui financial and trade district is accelerating 
the 
construction of some one hundred commercial buildings and 
business centers. 
  The Jinqiao manufacturing district is also speeding up the 
official operation of close to a hundred projects and the 
construction of 200 other projects. The district is expected to 
become a new center of export-oriented industries. 
  Other listed companies at the Shanghai stock exchange center 
also value Pudong as a "golden area". More than half of these 
corporations have invested there, with the total sum exceeding 
10 billion yuan. 
  Some large companies listed at the Shenzhen stock exchange 
have also made inroads in Pudong.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Inspections Improving Product Quality"] </F>
  [Text] Intensified government supervision has effectively 
improved product quality in the market, inspection officials 
said yesterday. 
  Briefing reporters on product quality inspection work, the 
State Bureau for Technical Supervision confirmed that China has 
already established a comprehensive quality inspection system. 
  First initiated in 1985, the system covers inspection of 
product design, sampling, data collection, specialist analysis, 
publishing inspection results, and advising producers on quality 
problems to improve and reexamination of products. 
  The inspection system now comprises 233 State-level quality 
centres, more than 700 ministerial-level inspection centres, in 
addition to 1,700 provincial or regional stations. 
  The centres and stations are responsible for regular and 
irregular inspection, and have played a vital role in improving 
product quality and protecting the legal interests of both the 
consumers and producers, the bureau said. 
  Results have indicated that State inspections have produced 
positive results in improving Chinese product quality. 
  Among the products checked in the last quarterly inspection 
of 1993, 49 which were inspected before had better records than 
21 products checked for the first time. 
  The average satisfactory rate of phosphate fertilizer 
improved from 66 percent in 1989 to 81.9 percent last year, 
while the average satisfactory rate of fire engines and drainage 
pipes rose from 63 and 5 percent in 1991 to 80 and 82 percent. 
  Another typical example was the rapid improvement of 
disposable infusion syringes, whose poor quality brought many 
public complaints over past years. 
  In 1992, the satisfactory rate of these syringes was only 42 
percent but last year it rose to 83 percent, thanks to 
intensified quality inspection and improved production 
management.

  [Text] Los Angeles -- China is working on a 15-year 
economic blueprint to spruce up its basic industries. 
  This was announced by Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State 
Planning Commission, here on Tuesday [12 April]. 
  He was addressing 500 American business leaders attending 
the 
China-U.S. Trade and Investment Conference, organized by the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). 
  The plan envisions an average 9 percent annual growth rate 
for the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s. And 
GDP growth will continue to be on the fast track through the 
first decade of the next century. 
  According to the plan, China will build 1,000 kilometres of 
new railways and 3,500 to 4,000 kilometres of highways each year 
in the future. 
  Also, about 14 million new lines for digital phones will be 
needed each year to expand phone service. 
  Ye said China will augment its handling capacity in ports by 
300 million to 400 million tons over the next 15 years. The 
ports will mainly handle oil and other cargo. 
  A number of large open-pit coal mines will be built to 
increase the country's annual coal production output by 30 
million to 35 million tons each year. 
  And the nation's steel output is expected to surpass 100 
million tons by 2000. To achieve that goal, China has to 
renovate its existing 10 major steel works, while setting up 
some new manufacturing bases. 
  Ye said China is gradually opening its onshore oilfields to 
foreign explorers and developers. The offshore oilfields have 
already been opened. 
  Analysts said that China is picking up momentum in 
developing 
its onshore oil in the country's vast West to offset the 
dwindling output of the old fields in the Northeast and East. 
  By 2010, the country's oil-refining capacity is expected to 
be almost double the 1993 level of 160 million tons. 
  Ye revealed that China will also give priority to developing 
the machinery, automotive, petrochemical and construction 
industries. 
  In the machinery sector, Ye said priority will be given to 
developing basic components, power generation equipment, 
electronic communication systems, computers and aircraft for 
major and spur flights. 
  "The market for automobiles will be huge," Ye added, noting 
that the government's strategy is to enable ordinary families to 
own cars in the coming years.

<F P=106> [Article by Cheng Yuen (4453 0626): "Strike Movements Occur </F>
Frequently on Mainland"] 
  [Text] In recent years, the CPC has consistently 
advertised that mainland China under its rule has been "stable 
and united" and has maintained good "social security." However, 
the real situation has not developed in accordance with its 
wishes, and today mainland China is neither "stable" nor 
"secure," as shown by the fact that political disturbances have 
occurred one after another, the incidence of crime has remained 
high, social security has deteriorated, and some disturbances -- 
which were neither too big nor too small -- have occurred from 
time to time. 
  Let us have a look at the strikes which broke out in some 
mainland provinces during the current sessions of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. 
<H5>  The Reasons Behind the Series of Strikes in Liaoning Province </H5>
  A number of strikes have broken out intermittently in 
Shenyang, Dalian, and Fushun in Liaoning Province since March. 
According to an analysis made by the Liaoning Provincial 
Government, five reasons have triggered these strikes, which 
include: 1) some state-owned enterprises had to be closed down, 
suspended, merged, or converted to other lines as a result of 
reform, so the interests of the staff and workers were affected; 
2) the staff and workers were unable to receive their wages 
because enterprises performed poorly and their products were 
overstocked; 3) some staff and workers were forced to take a 
rest break for half of their working days due to the limited 
production quotas, and their income was reduced accordingly; 4) 
the staff and workers were dissatisfied with the rising prices; 
and 5) party and government cadres benefited more than the 
ordinary staff and workers in the course of reform. 
<H5>  The Staff and Workers in Shenyang Threatened To Call a </H5>
Strike in the Entire City 
  Since last November, more than 80 enterprises and factories 
in Shenyang have failed to pay wages and bonuses to their staff 
and workers, and the lives of nearly 300,000 people have been 
affected. More than 180,000 staff and workers received only 
one-half or two- thirds of their basic salaries and were forced 
to rest at home for half of their working days, and this has 
created strong feelings of dissatisfaction among them. In early 
March, the staff and workers from more than 40 metallurgical, 
chemical, agricultural machinery, and pharmaceutical enterprises 
conducted a slow-down in Shenyang. Some of them held rallies to 
present petitions to the city or provincial governments, airing 
their grievances against inflation, price increases, and 
opposing the merger and stoppage of enterprises. On 11 March, 
approximately 20 enterprises and units spontaneously sent a 
cable to the State Council, proposing that the interests of 
staff and workers be protected during structural reform and that 
their position as masters of the country be strengthened. On 15 
March, the staff and workers from some chemical enterprises in 
Shenyang lodged a petition with the city government, in which 
they proclaimed that enterprises and factories belonged to the 
working class, and everything in them belonged to the ranks of 
staff and workers, and they included the slogans "down with the 
newly emerging nobility!" and "eradicate the new bureaucratic 
bourgeoisie!" The strike spread to 40 enterprises and 
factories, and the staff and workers even threatened to go on 
strike throughout the city and province to protest against 
inflation and the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion 
of enterprises. They called for the right to administer 
enterprises and factories. Up to the present, the staff and 
workers from over 30 enterprises and factories have applied to 
the provincial government to hold rallies in the Workers' 
Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, and the Martyrs' 
Mausoleum, and have called on the government to immediately put 
an end to the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion of 
state-owned enterprises. They also called on the government to 
carry out the guidelines of the central authorities to vest in 
representatives of staff and workers the right to participate in 
making policy decisions regarding factories, mines, and 
enterprises. In addition, they called on the government to 
ensure that any default in payment of their salaries, bonuses, 
and allowances would be avoided in the future, inflation would 
be checked, their living standards would be enhanced, and their 
material benefits would be increased. 
<H5>  Some 10,000 Staff and Workers Planned To File a Petition in </H5>
Beijing 
  The staff and workers in Shenyang planned to enlist 10,000 
people and chartered eight trains to carry them to Beijing to 
present a petition. As the event further deteriorated, the 
provincial government reported the case to the secretary of the 
provincial party committee and governor, who were attending the 
NPC and CPPCC sessions, and asked for instructions from the 
State Council. As instructed by the State Council, the 
provincial leader Gu Jinchi flew back to Shenyang on the 
afternoon of 16 March to handle the affair. 
  Trade Union in Fushun Called for Reorganizing the 
Leading Body of the City Government 
  The coal mine in Fushun, Liaoning intended to cut 20,000 
miners. For this reason, a dozen cases of slowdown actions and 
petitions have been reported since the middle of February. The 
provincial government had to give the miners a pledge that not 
one single person would be reduced and there would be no default 
in the payment of workers' wages, bonuses, and allowances. The 
official trade union of the Fushun Chemical Plant acted as the 
representative of the staff and workers to request a 50 percent 
wage increase and an upward readjustment of factory prices for 
their products, and to express their opposition to importing 
chemical fertilizers, which has made an onslaught on the 
domestic market. The trade union also called for reorganizing 
the leading body of the city government. 
<H5>  Over 300 Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Lodged a Petition </H5>
to the Provincial Party Committee 
  Several strikes have broken out in factories, mines, and 
enterprises in some cities of Shaanxi Province, including Xian, 
Xianyang, and Baoji since the second half of February. In mid- 
March, the strikes further escalated, and over 300 factories, 
mines, and enterprises in Xianyang, Baoji, Hanzhong, and Yanan 
lodged petitions with the provincial party committee. 
Enterprise party committees and trade unions were among the 
units lodging the petitions and in some cases even acted as the 
leading petitioners. On 16 March, some party and government 
leaders from Shaanxi Province, who were attending the NPC and 
CPPCC sessions, hurried back to Xian to deal with the situation. 
<H5>  Over 700 Cadres in Sichuan Ask for Leave </H5>
  One-third of cadres working in 25 departments and offices 
under the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and Government will 
be reduced in the first half of this year. After the news was 
confirmed, over 700 cadres asked for sick leave, annual leave, 
and leave to attend to private affairs since 10 March, and on 14 
and 15 March, another nine commissions and offices under the 
provincial authority had to suspend work due to large numbers of 
people asking for leave. The party committee and government 
reported this emergency to the leading cadres attending the two 
sessions in Beijing, and principal provincial leader Xiao Yang 
immediately returned to Chengdu to handle the affair. Luo Gan, 
secretary general of the State Council also went to Sichuan to 
get acquainted with the situation there. It has been learned 
that there were similar conditions in Chongqing, Yibin, and 
other cities. 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng Stress the Importance of Stability </H5>
  The above strikes broke out during the NPC and CPPCC 
sessions 
and shocked the CPC hierarchy. When Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and 
Qiao Shi met persons in charge of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, 
Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who were 
attending the two sessions, they all stressed that stability was 
necessary in all localities, that reforms should promote and be 
beneficial to stability, and that the importance of stability 
should be properly stressed. They also said that reform 
measures and policies would have an impact on stability; hence, 
where stability was seriously affected, reform should be 
decisively suspended or stopped. This should be regarded as a 
cardinal principle. Jiang Zemin said: Reform must be carried 
out under a stable situation, within the tolerance of the vast 
number of staff and workers, and with their support; otherwise, 
the desired goals of reform will not be achieved.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The first 
construction phase of Shenzhen Yantian port was completed today. 
  As the only deep-water port in south China, the planned 
facilities will consist of 50 berths, each of which has a 
capacity to accommodate ships exceeding 10,000 tons. 
  Sources said that when the berths go into operation, the 
annual handling capacity will reach eight million standard 
containers. 
  The first-phase construction of Yantian port consisted of 58 
projects, including a 24-kilometer highway from the port to 
Pinghu Railway Station, a 72-kilometer highway from the port to 
Huizhou city, six berths with an annual handling capacity of 2.8 
million tons and a container yard with an area of 240,000 square 
meters, and a 6.29-square-kilometer infrastructural base for 
water- and electricity-supply and telecommunications services. 
  The port is designed to be computer-controlled and it now 
has 
hundreds of up-to-date port machines. 
  The second phase of the construction of the port will start 
later this year.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Yunnan Provincial Statistics Bureau on </F>
26 Feb 94: "Statistical Report Issued by Yunnan Provincial 
Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee and government, cadres at all levels and the 
people of various nationalities in our province put into effect 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important remarks made during his 
inspection tour of South China and the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress in a comprehensive way. As a result, 
enthusiasm for seizing opportunities and striving for 
development ran high in various localities and departments, the 
pace of reform and opening up accelerated, economic development 
advanced vigorously, positive successes were scored in 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and gratifying 
achievements were attained in the national economy and various 
social undertakings. According to preliminary statistics (see 
note 1), annual GNP reached 64.8 billion yuan, increasing by 10 
percent over the previous year (see note 2). Tertiary industry 
grew by 15.6 percent, which was faster than primary and 
secondary industry. New achievements were also scored in such 
undertakings as education, science and technology, culture, 
public health, sports, and so on. Major problems existing in 
the economic sphere were: In fixed-assets investment, there 
were too many construction projects in general and the front 
line was overextended, the margin of price increases was too 
large, the foundation of agriculture was relatively weak, and 
state-owned enterprises, some large and medium ones in 
particular, lacked vitality and performed poorly. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  A comparatively good harvest was reaped this year despite a 
lot of natural disasters. Thanks to concerted efforts made by 
the masses and cadres at various levels in combating disasters, 
a relatively good harvest was reaped in the province's 
agricultural production given various natural calamities, 
including drought, floods, cold weather, and so on encountered 
in 1993. Agricultural output value came to 21.4 billion yuan, 
up 2.2 percent over the previous year. Of the total, crop 
cultivation, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery increased 
by 2.3, 2.5, 1.8, and 7.1 percent respectively. Except for 
oil-bearing crops and sugar cane, output of which fell to a 
certain extent, production of other major agricultural products 
was better than last year. Total grain yield reached 10.852 
million tonnes, up by 148,000 tonnes, the second highest in 
history. 
  Output of major farm products was as follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Gratifying achievements were scored in afforestation. In 
1993, 5.5 million mu of trees were planted across the province, 
an increase of 18.4 percent over 1992, and the highest in recent 
years. Output of major forestry products also increased to some 
extent compared with 1992. Of total output, natural rubber was 
96,000 tonnes, up 14.7 percent. Work to protect forest 
resources was intensified, areas hit by forest fires were 
reduced, deficits in forestry declined substantially, the forest 
coverage rate picked up a little, and the administrative 
standard of forests was elevated. 
  Animal husbandry production grew steadily. The number of 
pigs slaughtered and in stock increased, and output of meat, 
milk, poultry, and eggs continued to grow. 
  Output of major animal products and livestock numbers were 
as 
follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fishery production continued to grow. Output of aquatic 
products totalled 58,300 tonnes, up 8.6 percent over the 
previous year. 
  Agricultural production conditions continued to improve. By 
the end of 1993, the aggregate power of the province's farm 
machinery was 7,879,000 kw, up 4.4 percent over the previous 
year; there were 11,700 large and medium tractors, down 15.8 
percent; 184,000 small tractors and rototillers, up 7 percent; 
and 22,600 farm-related trucks, up 5.1 percent. Irrigation and 
drainage equipment was 732,000 kw, down 0.1 percent. A total of 
795,300 tonnes of chemical fertilizer (with 100 percent 
effective content equivalent) were applied during the year, up 
6.9 percent. Total consumption of electricity in rural areas 
was 1.681 billion kwh, up 9 percent, and 550,000 mu of effective 
irrigation acreage was newly increased. However, our capacity to 
combat natural calamities was relatively weak, and the task of 
building farmland with high and steady yields was very arduous 
too. 
  Township and town enterprises developed very rapidly. In 
1993, a gratifying situation was present in the province, in 
which township and town enterprises, created from various 
aspects, grew vigorously, with their total income registering 
22.4 billion yuan, an increase of 71.6 percent over the previous 
year. Revenues of a number of counties (cities), townships 
(towns), and enterprises exceeded 100 million yuan, which 
energetically spurred the economic development of rural areas. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction Industry </H5>
  Industrial production continued to grow, and improvements 
were made in their economic results. In 1993, pushed forward by 
the in- depth reform and the transformation of operational 
mechanisms in enterprises, the province surmounted various 
difficulties, including insufficient power supply, shortages of 
funds, and so on, and attained gratifying achievements in 
industrial production. The value added by industry in the 
entire year reached 26.5 billion yuan, up 13 percent over the 
previous year. Of the total, growth of light and heavy 
industries was 13.1 and 13.4 billion yuan, up 13.5 and 12.3 
percent respectively. The advantages of tobacco processing and 
cigarette production were further exploited, and the total 
output value of the tobacco processing industry increased by 
20.5 percent. The product mix improved to some extent, a number 
of new products were put on sale in markets, and major energy 
and raw and semifinished products, including power generation, 
steel products, and so on, grew steadily. However, affected by 
changes in the market, production of chemical fertilizer, 
plastic film, some textiles, daily necessities, and other light 
industrial products declined to a certain extent. 
  Output of major industrial products was as follows:

  Production and marketing were fairly well linked together. 
In 1993, industrial sales volume at the township level and 
above across the province came to 59.943 billion yuan, up 11 
percent over the previous year, and the rate of production and 
marketing was 97.4 percent. Of the total, light and heavy 
industries came to 30.396 and 29.548 billion yuan, up 13.2 and 
8.9 percent, and their rates of production and marketing were 
99.1 and 95.8 percent respectively. 
  Economic results of the industrial sector continued to 
improve. In 1993, the composite index of economic results among 
industrial enterprises with independent accounting at the 
township level and above across the province rose to 163.39 from 
137.31 in 1992. Of this, the product sales rate was 97.44 
percent, remaining more or less the same as in 1992; the profit 
and tax rate on capital rose from 23.51 to 27.21 percent; the 
profit rate on costs rose from 5.96 to 8.90 percent; overall 
labor productivity (calculated with added value) rose to 39.1 
percent; and the turnover of circulating capital was speeded up 
from 1.75 to 1.93. However, economic performance as a whole was 
still not satisfactory, and the number of loss-making 
state-owned enterprises was still relatively large. 
  Production in the building industry developed rapidly. In 
1993, with increased investment in fixed assets and continually 
deepened reform in the building industry, production by 
construction enterprises quickened their pace remarkably. Value 
added by the building industry this year was 3.9 billion yuan, 
up 24.6 percent over the previous year. State-owned 
construction enterprises performed better, with labor 
productivity reaching 27,546 yuan, up 53.2 percent over the 
previous year, and total profits and taxes handed over to the 
state were 110 and 95 million yuan, up 67.8 and 28.6 percent 
respectively. 
  New achievements were attained in geological survey and 
prospecting work. In 1993, the bureau of geology and mineral 
resources and its affiliated departments completed 117,400 
meters of drilling, two mineral deposits were discovered, and 
reserves of nine major minerals were verified. 
<H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  Investment in fixed assets grew by a big margin and key 
projects were strengthened. Investment in fixed assets realized 
in the whole year was 23.35 billion yuan, up 66 percent over the 
previous year. Owing to a comparatively higher price index for 
investment in fixed assets and allowing for price rises, the 
actual work amount increased by 22.5 percent. Of this total, 
investment by state-owned units, collective units, and 
individuals in cities and villages was 17.745, 3.409, and 2.196 
billion yuan, up 70.7, 67.8, and 33.6 percent respectively. Of 
investment by state-owned units, capital construction investment 
was 10.942 billion yuan, investment in technical innovation and 
transformation was 5.005 billion yuan, and investment in 
construction of commercial housing was 1.375 billion yuan; up 
71.4, 55.2, and 210 percent respectively. Other investments 
made by state-owned units came to 423 million yuan, up 25.7 
percent. As viewed from investment by state-owned units at the 
central and local levels, investment fulfilled in projects 
organized by the central and local authorities were 4.415 and 
13.330 billion yuan, up 58.6 and 75.2 percent respectively. 
State-owned units engaged in 6,847 construction projects during 
the whole year, down 17.1 percent from the previous year, of 
which 3,682 projects were newly established in 1993, down 30.7 
percent. The total scope of construction projects established 
by state-owned units reached 48.184 billion yuan, increasing by 
37.9 percent over the previous year. 
  In investment by state-owned units, the share of tertiary 
industry rose to 57.4 percent from 47.5 percent in 1992, while 
that of transportation and post and telecommunications rose from 
17.4 to 22.9 percent. However, the share of primary industry 
dropped from 3.6 to 2.9 percent, and that of the energy sector 
belonging to the secondary industry dropped from 13.9 to 11.8 
percent. 
  Key construction projects were completed in a relatively 
good 
condition. The investment realized by 36 large and medium 
capital construction projects and 21 technological 
transformation projects above the norm across the province was 
4.198 billion yuan, meeting the requirement of the annual plan, 
and 12 projects and single items were completed and put into 
operation. Among those major projects completed and put into 
operation were generating units 5 and 6 at the Manwan Hydropower 
Station, with an installed capacity of 500,000 kw; the Changning 
Paper Mill, which has an annual capacity of 10,000 tonnes of 
machine-made paper; the passengers' lounge at Kunming Airport, 
with an area of 17,118 square meters; the Guangzhou- Chuxiong 
section of the Guangzhou-Dali Railway, which is 38 km long; the 
renovation of the 398-km Pingyuan-Luoxiong Highway; the Yunnan 
Aluminum Plant, with an annual capacity to electrolyze 10,000 
tonnes of aluminum; Kunming Songhua Reservoir, with a storage 
capacity of 153 million cubic meters; Supa He Hydropower Plant; 
Zhaotong Airport; and so on. 
<H5>  4. Transport, Post, and Telecommunications </H5>
  Transport, posts, and telecommunications grew steadily. 
Value added by this industry was 1.52 billion yuan, up 12.8 
percent over the previous year. However, the contradiction of 
transport failing to meet the demands of economic and social 
development was aggravated, specialized state-owned highway 
transport enterprises lacked vitality as their advantages were 
not properly exploited, and railway transport to other provinces 
was still inadequate, although railway transport on the whole 
operated comparatively well. 
  The transportation volume by various specialized transport 
systems was as follows:

  Post and telecommunications undertakings developed rapidly. 
The province's business volume in post and telecommunications 
in 1993 totalled 558 million yuan, up 55.6 percent over the 
previous year. A total of 3,335 long-distance telephone lines 
were newly opened and there were 10,624 new subscribers during 
the whole year. 
  In the whole province, a total of 358,000 
urban telephone lines were recorded in 1993, 140,000 more than 
in the previous year. Of this, the number of program- 
controlled telephone lines reached 274,000, an increase of 
155,000. The province had a total capacity of 450,000 lines in 
its telephone networks, and the number of telephone sets reached 
346,200, with 86 cities above county level covered by an 
automated switching network of long-distance telephone lines and 
48 cities fitted with international direct dial telephones. 
Both the expansion of urban telephone capacity and the increase 
in long-distance telephone lines in 1993 were unprecedented. 
<H5>  . Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  The domestic consumer market was brisk and thriving. In 
1993, reform in the circulation field developed in depth, there 
was an abundance of consumer goods in the market, and market 
sales were brisk and stable, along with intensified and improved 
macroeconomic regulation and control exercised by the state. 
The retail sales volume of social commodities in the year 
totalled 29.5 billion yuan, up 25.8 percent over the previous 
year, or a real 5.8 percent increase after allowing for price 
rises. As viewed from commodity usage, retail sales of consumer 
goods amounted to 26.1 billion yuan, up 27.6 percent, and those 
of the means of agricultural production amounted to 3.4 billion 
yuan, up 13.3 percent. Of total retail sales of consumer goods, 
those in cities, county towns, and villages and towns below 
county level amounted to 11.6, 7.7, and 6.8 billion yuan, up 
43.2, 22.2, and 12.2 percent respectively over the previous 
year. As viewed from economic sectors, state-owned, collective, 
and individual units increased by 27.1, 22.0, and 27.4 percent 
respectively, and retail sales by peasants to nonagricultural 
residents also increased by 27.7 percent. As viewed from sales 
of major consumer goods, there were increases in some food 
categories and decreases in others, sales of clothing items 
mostly decreased except for fashionable clothes, articles for 
daily use mostly increased, and high-grade durables, including 
color television sets, washing machines, refrigerators, and so 
on increased substantially. The sales volume of major 
agricultural materials, such as chemical fertilizers, 
pesticides, and so on dropped to some extent compared with the 
previous year. 
  The contradiction between the supply and demand of the means 
of production was mitigated. Along with the slowdown of the 
rapidly growing momentum of fixed-assets investment, the 
marketing conditions for the major means of production, such as 
steel products, cement, and so on, which were in comparatively 
short supply for a time, underwent a change from 
panic-purchasing by buyers to the promotion of sales by 
suppliers, prices tended to stabilize, and stocks increased 
somewhat. In 1993, material supply and marketing enterprises 
bought 13.7 billion yuan worth of the means of production and 
sold 14.8 billion yuan, increasing by 33.1 and 38.5 percent 
respectively. Of the total, purchases of ferrous metals and 
building materials grew by 50.6 and 37.1 percent, and sales grew 
by 45.1 and 39.7 percent respectively. 
  Affected by factors including market demands, cost rises, 
and 
readjustment of prices out of policy consideration, market 
prices were fixed high and rose by large margins. Retail prices 
rose by 18.9 percent during the year, of which those in urban 
and rural areas rose by 16.3 and 20.2 percent respectively. 
Residents' costs of living rose by 21.3 percent, and those of 
urban and rural residents rose by 18.8 and 23.3 percent 
respectively. As a result, the lives of some residents 
receiving relatively lower income were somewhat affected. 
  The percentage of price increases with regard to various 
kinds of commodities in 1993 as compared with those in 1992 was 
as follows:

<H5>  6. Foreign Economic Exchange </H5>
  Remarkable achievements were made in foreign economic 
exchanges. In 1993, the province successfully hosted the First 
Kunming Trade Fair, further intensified economic and trade 
contacts with various countries, Southeast and South Asian 
countries and regions in particular. A new, open, 
world-oriented pattern with the vast territory of Southwest 
China as its backing, Kunming as a center, open border cities as 
forward positions, and Southeast and South Asia as focal points 
is taking shape. 
  Foreign trade grew steadily. In 1993, foreign trade 
enterprises continually advanced while overcoming difficulties 
in in-depth reform. According to statistics from the provincial 
economic and trade department, total imports and exports came to 
$840 million, an increase of 25.3 percent over the previous 
year. Of this, imports were $317 million and exports $523 
million, increases of 55.5 and 12.1 percent respectively. 
Spurred by reform and opening up, the export volume of 
machinery and electrical appliances increased substantially, 
with the total amount reaching $102.75 million, up 42 percent 
over 1992. Border trade grew by a wide margin, with its imports 
and exports totalling 2.873 billion yuan in 1993, up 26.6 
percent over the previous year. 
  The tourist industry thrived. In 1993, a total of 405,200 
people including foreign guests, overseas Chinese, and Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots came to visit Yunnan, an 
increase of 29.3 percent over the previous year. Foreign 
exchange earned from tourism amounted to $104 million, up 53.8 
percent. 
  A substantial amount of foreign capital was attracted. The 
year 1993 witnessed the greatest amount of foreign capital 
imported from abroad, and foreign capital actually utilized in 
the year was $187.95 million, 2.8 times more than the previous 
year. Of the total, direct foreign investment and foreign loans 
amounted to $97.02 million and $90.93 million, increasing 3.2 
and 3.3 times respectively. During the year, 509 
foreign-invested enterprises were approved for business 
registration. 
  Satisfactory achievements were attained in foreign economic 
and technological cooperation. During the year, $41.02 million 
worth of contracts for overseas construction projects and labor 
services were signed, up 1.7 times over the previous year, and 
business volume of $25.87 million was realized, up 74.1 percent. 
<H5>  7. Science, Technology, Education, Culture, Public Health, </H5>
and Sports 
  Gratifying achievements were scored in scientific and

  [Text] Nanchang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Jiujiang City in 
east China's Jiangxi Province has improved its transportation 
and telecommunications conditions in the past two years. 
  Situated on the Chang Jiang River, Jiujiang was designated 
an 
open city by the central government in May 1992. 
  Since then, Jiujiang has been working hard to improve its 
environment in a bid to draw foreign investment. 
  The transportation situation has been greatly improved as 
the 
Chang Jiang River Bridge at Jiujiang and the Nanchang-Jiujiang 
Highway were opened to traffic a year ago. 
  The construction of a highway linking Jiujiang and 
Jingdezhen, the "capital of porcelain", is about to start. 
  The Port of Jiujiang is also open to all foreign vessels. 
Routes for container ships from Jiujiang to other parts of the 
world have also been opened. 
  The city is to open air routes to Shanghai, Xiamen, 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou before long, in addition to the 
established destinations of Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang. 
  Three railways including the Beijing-Kowloon line under 
construction now converge at Jiujiang. 
  Communications construction has also been accelerated. By 
the end of last year, all telephones in the city were automated, 
linking Jiujiang with 1,600 cities and towns in China and more 
than 180 countries and regions. 
  The improved environment has attracted a growing number of 
foreign investors. Jiujiang absorbed 30.64 million U.S. dollars 
investment in some 30 industries last year.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Ji Tao (4764 3447) and Trainee Li Xuemei (2621 </F>
1331 2734) "The Municipal Work Conference of Adult Education 
Opens"] 
  [Excerpt] The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the 
municipal people's government jointly sponsored the first 
municipal work conference of adult education on 29 March. Li 
Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, sent a 
congratulatory letter to the conference. Chen Xitong, secretary 
of the municipal party committee, and Li Qiyan, mayor of the 
municipality, also extended their congratulations on the 
convocation of the work conference. Attending the conference 
were Wang Mingda, Li Zhijian, Tao Siping, Hu Zhaoguang, and Chen 
Dabai. 
  In his letter Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, 
extended congratulations on the convocation of the work 
conference and expressed cordial regard to teachers, cadres, 
staff members, and workers throughout the municipality, who are 
engaging in the adult education work. 
  He said: Developing educational undertakings and enhancing 
the socialist spiritual civilization represent not only the 
content of building modernizations in China but also an 
important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. Under the present situation in 
which reform is being deepened and opening up is being 
broadened, it is necessary for us to upgrade in an overall way 
the quality of people in China and to train a large number of 
talented personnel suitable to the demand of modernizations and 
a large number of high-quality laborers. Therefore, it is 
imperative to put education in a strategic position of priority 
development. Adult education is an important component of 
educational undertakings in China and deserves to develop 
vigorously. He urged relevant personnel in the municipality to 
emancipate their minds, to seek truth from facts, to 
continuously deepen the reform by proceeding from the country's 
reality, to promote the healthy development of adult education 
through reform, and to train more outstanding and practical 
talented personnel so as to enable them to play an important 
role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Vice Mayor Hu Zhaoguang delivered a report entitled 
"Emancipate Minds, Seize the Opportunity, Deepen the Reform, and 
Vigorously Develop Adult Education in the Capital" at the 
conference on behalf of the municipal party committee and the 
municipal people's government. In his report he chiefly 
mentioned about the following five aspects: The review of adult 
education conducted by the capital over the past 15 years in 
which reform and opening up have been enforced. The position 
and role played by the adult education in the capital's economic 
construction and social development. The target and mission set 
for the development of adult education in the capital in a 
coming period. The orientation and major contents set for the 
capital to deepen its reform in the adult education. Major 
measures for the capital to vigorously develop its adult 
education. 
  In his report Hu Zhaoguang said: The capital's achievements 
scored in the adult education has been marked. It has fostered 
the schooling systems of adult education; with the capital's 
characteristics; at multiple levels; and with multiple 
standards, styles, and channels. In 1993 the municipality held 
training classes that were attended by 3.01 million personnel. 
However, the present quality as a whole of several millions of 
labor forces in the municipality still cannot meet the demand of 
reform and construction. He urged governments at all levels, 
various industries and trades, and enterprises, to place adult 
education as an important daily schedule; to orient adult 
education into their local and departmental plans for economic 
and social development; and to regard it as an important content 
in arranging, examining, and summarizing their fiscal work. 
  In citing the target and purpose set for the capital to 
achieve in development of adult education in the upcoming 
period, Hu Zhaoguang said: The municipality will concentrate 
its efforts in the coming period on enforcing the "Beijing 
personnel training project to cope with the personnel shortage 
at the high level," "Beijing training project for personnel 
transfer," and "Beijing training project for the staff members 
and workers of township enterprises." By regarding the three 
projects as leading targets, the municipality will promote 
reform and development in the adult education. 
  Wang Mingda, vice minister of education, also delivered a 
speech at the work conference, in which he fully acknowledged 
the achievements scored by the municipality in its education 
work and the characteristics fostered by the municipality in its 
adult education. He also mentioned from the macro angle about 
the important role of adult education and about some issues 
needing attention. He said: The Beijing Municipal Party 
Committee and the municipal people's government have attached 
great importance on the adult education. The content of report 
made at the work conference jointly sponsored by them on adult 
education is substantial and the measures put in the report are 
helpful. The municipality will certainly play a model role in 
developing adult education in the country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China's most celebrated 
dissident Wei Jingsheng is a criminal whose current detention 
and investigation should not be confused with the issue of human 
rights in China, a foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday [14 
April]. "The case of Wei Jingsheng is by no means an issue of 
human rights," spokesman Shen Guofang told a weekly press 
briefing. "Human rights does not simply mean releasing a 
criminal, which is totally irrelevant to human rights," Shen 
added. 
  The spokesman's remarks fuelled speculation that Wei may 
face 
fresh criminal charges following his arrest April 1. The 
Chinese authorities have said Wei, who was released in September 
six months shy of a 15-year jail term for 
"counter-revolutionary" activities, is currently being 
investigated for "suspected new crimes." No official charges 
have yet been brought against the 43-year-old dissident. 
  Shen made similar distinctions concerning the brief 
detentions of pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai 
during the recent visit of French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur. "They are not democracy activists. They are 
criminals, most of whom are still on parole. 
  "Therefore, during such parole the Chinese legal authorities 
have every right to take action," Shen said, adding that the 
detentions "had nothing to do with the visit (of Balladur)." 
However, of the four dissidents detained during the French 
prime minister's visit -- Xu Wenli, Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge and 
Yang Zhou -- only Xu is still currently on parole. 
  Shen also said the Chinese authorities were having 
difficulties handling lists of political prisoners handed over 
for their consideration during visits here by foreign 
dignitaries such as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
"After some investigation, we found a lot of problems with such 
lists. Some people simply do not exist and some people have 
already been released," Shen said. "We often check the contents 
of such lists with those visiting leaders and we found that even 
they did not have a clear idea about the source of such lists 
and the people named in them," he added.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Yongqing (1776 0516 7230) and KEJI </F>
RIBAO reporter Wei Hongkai (7614 3163 0418)] 
  [Text] Washington, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The one-day sixth 
meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and 
Technological Cooperation ended here today. Senior officials 
from both sides in charge of scientific and technological 
affairs reviewed the achievements scored in the past 15 years 
since the 1979 signing of the "Agreement Between the Chinese and 
U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation." 
They also discussed new prospects for strengthening or 
expanding scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation. 
  At the meeting, Song Jian, co-chairman of the meeting, 
Chinese state councilor, and minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, and John Gibbons, assistant to the 
president for science and technology and director of the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy, fully affirmed the tremendous 
achievements scored in scientific and technological cooperation 
between the two countries. They also signed a joint communique 
of this meeting as well as a "Clean Coal Appendix" to the 
"Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Fossil Energy" and renewed 
the "Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Marine Science and 
Technology." 
  Following the meeting, Song Jiang pointed out in a speech: 
This meeting has created new conditions for future Sino-U.S. 
scientific and technological cooperation. He then said: The 
fruitful cooperation between China and the United States 
according to 29 protocols in this regard has yielded some major, 
inspiring results. Such cooperation is not only of great 
significance for the two countries' scientific and technological 
circles but has played an important role in promoting economic 
development and scientific progress and enhances the friendship 
of people in the two countries. He expressed the belief that 
with the meeting's decision on the common objectives for the 
expanded scale and scope of scientific and technological 
cooperation, the cooperation between scientific, technological, 
and economic circles in China and the United States would 
certainly develop toward ever higher aims and in ever broader 
fields. 
  Gibbons said in his speech: There are many opportunities in 
Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation. So it is 
necessary to promote such cooperation. He then pointed out: 
The Clinton administration holds that maintaining a stable 
relationship with a strong and prosperous China is very much in 
the interests of the United States. He said: As a Chinese 
proverb goes, a thousand-mile journey is started by taking the 
first step. China and the United States have taken the first 
step together toward in-depth cooperation at the joint 
commission meeting. 
  According to Chinese science and technology delegation 
members attending the meeting, as one of the important 
activities in Sino- U.S. relations, this meeting stressed that 
both sides should expand their cooperation in the development of 
cancer and AIDS medicines, environmental protection, the 
exploitation and effective use of energy, and in 
high-temperature superconducting materials and rare- earth 
elements. From now on, Sino-U.S. scientific and technological 
cooperation will focus on these four fields. 
  Four representatives from the American Pharmaceutical 
Association, the Council of Environmental Industry, the Power 
Research Institute, and the Auto Engineers Association briefed 
the meeting this afternoon on opportunities for expanding the 
scientific and technological cooperation between Chinese and 
U.S. industries. They earnestly hoped for expanding scientific 
and technological cooperation between the two governments to 
enterprises. 
  The "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on 
Scientific and Technological Cooperation" was signed by 
then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and U.S. President Carter in 
1979. Within the framework of this agreement, the two sides 
signed 29 protocols in education, agriculture, space technology, 
high-energy physics, industrial science and technology 
management, scientific and technological intelligence, 
metrology, atmosphere, oceanography, public health, hydropower, 
earthquake, earth science, environmental protection, basic 
science, construction and urban planning, surface water, nuclear 
safety, nuclear physics, aviation, transportation and 
communication, statistics, fossil energy, topography, 
telecommunications, railways, protection of nature, nonferrous 
metals, and land management. Within the bounds of these 
protocols, relevant Chinese and U.S. Government departments have 
undertaken more than 1,000 projects for scientific and 
technological cooperation and over 10,000 people have exchanged 
visits over the past 15 years. 
  According to the "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. 
Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation," the 
Sino- U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technological 
Cooperation, which guides the agreement's implementation, holds 
a meetings once every two years in the capitals of the two 
countries by turns.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, China's 
vice-premier and foreign minister, held talks with M.J. Qhobela, 
foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon. 
  During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on 
bilateral relations and on the international situation. 
  Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its 
success in last year's general election and the consequent 
establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the 
new government well in making new achievements in maintaining 
domestic peace and in the construction of the country. 
  Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations 
between 
China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of 
bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the 
current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote 
bilateral relations and cooperation. 
  Touching on the situation in the Southern African region, 
Qian noted that the first general election without racial 
discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and 
that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up. 
  This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South 
African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the 
peace process in South Africa.

China's parliament, met with Pjeter Arbnori, president of the 
Albanian people's parliament, here this afternoon.

made special contributions to the progress of mankind. 
  Albania appreciates what China has achieved in the past few 
years, Arbnori told his host.

with coastal areas developing faster. He added that it will 
take great efforts of generations to bring about a fairly high 
level of development in the country's central and western part.

  [Text] Jinan, April 14 (XINHUA) -- China's economy has 
benefited greatly from its close and fruitful cooperation with 
the World Bank during the past 14 years. 
  This was made clear by information released from the 
project- 
inspection meeting jointly held by the World Bank and the 
Chinese Ministry of Finance in east China's Shandong Province. 
  Since 1980, when the country restored its membership in the 
organization, loans provided or promised by the World Bank have 
totalled 16.9 billion U.S. dollars to back 131 projects in 
agriculture, energy, industry, banking and technological 
assistance. 
  Agriculture has always been a main area using World Bank 
loans, with projects covering soil amelioration, cultivation of 
improved varieties, breeding of aquatic products, forestry, 
harnessing of rivers and construction of irrigation facilities. 
  With a 60 million U.S. dollar World Bank loan, salinization 
of soil has been greatly alleviated and flood and drought have 
been well controlled in central China's Henan and east China's 
Shandong and Anhui Provinces. 
  According to a contract on the Yellow River project, the 
World Bank is to provide 360 million U.S. dollars for use in 
projects to prevent flooding, reduce the menace of ice floes and 
silt deposits from the riverbed, as well as to generate 
electricity. 
  This project will greatly promote the economic development 
in 
the regions on the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. 
  China's infrastructure construction is another major area to 
absorb World Bank loans. 
  Construction of seven hydro-electric power stations, 
including two of the country's largest -- Lubuge and Ertan -- 
which has greatly improved electricity supply of China, were 
funded by World Bank loans. 
  Renovation and expansion projects of almost all the 
country's 
harbors and the electrification and improvement of signal 
systems in seven railway projects have utilized loans provided 
by the World Bank. 
  Also thanks to World Bank loans, an expressway from Beijing 
to Tanggu by way of Tianjin and another from Jinan, capital of 
Shandong Province, to Qingdao, a coastal city in the same 
province, have been completed, adding two communication arteries 
in northern China. 
  China has also cooperated actively with the World Bank in 
education, environmental protection and improvement of medical 
services, especially projects of rural drinking-water supply and 
prevention and control of infectious diseases in backward 
regions. 
  The World Bank has highly praised China's implementation of 
projects. Four inspections carried out by the World Bank have 
proved that China is among the countries which have the most 
successful project operations. 
  Nicholas C. Hope, the new director of the bank's China and 
Mongolia office, expressed his satisfaction with China's strong 
management, efficient organization and loan repayments, during 
his visit to Shandong. 
  The World Bank has also carried out research into China's 
economy in coordination with some Chinese government departments 
and has provided policy and other useful advice to the country. 
  It will soon provide technological assistance for China's 
reform of its finance and tax systems and the improvement of its 
legal system, according to officials from the World Bank.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Hainan Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau on 23 February 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by 
Hainan Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and 
Social Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the correct leadership of the Hainan 
Provincial CPC Committee and the Hainan Provincial Government, 
people of various ethnic groups in Hainan Province seriously 
implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and various 
policies laid down by the Central Committee on speeding up the 
development and construction of Hainan Province. Closely 
centering around building the system of a socialist market 
economy, they increased the strength of reforms, expanded 
opening to the outside world, and quickened the pace of 
construction. The national economy made sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development, the economic structure was readjusted to 
some extent, economic strength was further enhanced, and the 
living standard of the people kept rising. Science, technology, 
culture, education, public health, and various other social 
undertakings achieved success. According to preliminary 
calculations, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the whole 
province might reach 20.413 billion yuan, calculated by 
comparable price, an increase of 22.8 percent over that of the 
previous year. In GDP, primary industry grew by 10.5 percent, 
secondary industry by 51.6 percent, and tertiary industry by 
15.3 percent. The growth rate was much faster than the national 
average, which laid a foundation for Hainan's economic and 
social development to further enter a new stage. 
  Major problems in economic operations were: Prominent 
"bottleneck" constraints in basic industries and infrastructure, 
weak agricultural foundation, slow growth of the peasants' 
income, a big margin of prices increase, incomplete tourist 
facilities, and a reduction in the number of international 
visitors. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  Agricultural production grew rapidly and in a sustained 
manner. In 1993, the agricultural added value of the whole 
province amounted to 7.552 billion yuan, an increase of 10.5 
percent over that of the previous year calculated at comparable 
prices. There was an overall development in agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, and major improvement 
in agricultural internal structure. The proportion of animal 
husbandry and fishery in total agricultural output rose from 
32.6 percent of the previous year to 35.6 percent. The added 
value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery 
was as follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In the output of major agricultural products, areas sown 
with 
cereals and sugar canes were reduced and their output dropped as 
a result of drought. The output of oil-bearing crops, 
vegetables, melons, and vegetables all reached an all-time high, 
and especially the output of vegetables, bananas, and mangoes 
increased by a big margin. Scale performance was achieved on a 
preliminary basis, which helped the growing industry develop 
toward the direction of high yield and top quality. Output of 
major agricultural products was as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The production of tropical crops developed steadily. In 
1993, the areas sown to tropical crops in the whole province 
amounted to 44.17 hectares, basically maintaining the level of 
the previous year. There was a rapid increase in the output of 
rubber and dry rubber, coconuts, and binlang [apples]. Output 
of major tropical crops was as follows:

  Fishery production entered a new stage. In 1993, the total 
output of aquatic products in the whole province amounted to 
324,400 tons, an increase of 26.1 percent over the previous 
year, in which the output of marine products amounted to 287,700 
tons, up by 28.1 percent. Aquatic breeding area totalled 40,300 
hectares, an increase of 300 hectares over the previous year. 
  Construction of water conservancy work continued to be 
strengthened, and there was new improvement in the conditions of 
agricultural production. In 1993, cultivated area under 
effective irrigation in the whole province totalled 175,100 
hectares, and the amount of electricity used in the rural areas 
totalled 120.50 million kwh, an increase of 4.7 percent over 
that of the previous year. The amount of chemical fertilizer 
applied for agricultural use (conversion net) totalled 146,500 
tons, a reduction of 2.5 percent from that of the previous year, 
and the total power of agricultural machines amounted to 1.585 
million kw, an increase of 7.6 percent over the previous year, 
in which the power of irrigation machines for agricultural use 
grew by 7.7 percent, and the power of fishery machines grew by 
14.1 percent. 
  Nonagricultural industries in the rural areas developed 
rapidly, and industrial restructuring made major progress. In 
1993, output of nonagricultural industries in the whole province 
amounted to 3.702 billion yuan, an increase of 90.6 percent over 
that of the previous year (incomparable factors of prices 
increase included, the same below), in which rural industry grew 
by 1.6 times, building industry grew by 53.6 percent, industry 
of communications and transportation by 53.3 percent, commerce 
and food and drink by 45.0 percent, and the growth margin was 
faster than that of total agricultural output. A part of rural 
labor was shifted toward secondary industry and tertiary 
industry. At the end of 1993, rural labor engaged in secondary 
industry and tertiary industry in the whole province amounted to 
357,200 people, an increase of 62,500 people over the end of the 
previous year. 
<H5>  II. Industry </H5>
  Industrial production grew rapidly. In 1993, the industrial 
added value of the whole province reached 2.810 billion yuan, an 
increase of 36.2 percent over the previous year, in which the 
industrial added value of the township level and above amounted 
to 2.483 billion yuan, up 32.4 percent. 
  There was overall growth in various economic-type 
industries. 
In the industrial added value of the whole province in 1993,

which foreign-funded enterprises occupied in industrial added 
value of the whole province rose from 13.6 percent the previous 
year to 18.3 percent. 
  Both light and heavy industries grew rapidly. Pulled by 
investment demand, the growth of heavy industry was faster than 
that of light industry, and readjustments were made in both the 
light and heavy industrial structure. In 1993, the added value 
of light industry in the whole province amounted to 1.867

with an area of 142,200 hectares. 
<H5>  IX. Population, Labor, and the Life of the People </H5>
  According to a sample survey of population changes, the 
birth 
rate in Hainan Province in 1993 was 20.81 per thousand, dropping 
by 0.50 per thousand point compared to the previous year, and 
the mortality rate was 5.26 per thousand, dropping by 0.81 per 
thousand. The natural growth rate was 15.55 per thousand, up 
0.31 per thousand. Based on the above calculation, total 
population of the whole province reached 7,011,600 at the end of 
the year, an increase of 147,600 people over those at the end of 
the previous year. 
  Labor employment continued to expand in reform of the 
employment system and social insurance system. In 1993, Hainan 
Province acquired 7,900 university and college graduates, an 
increase of 19.7 percent over the previous year. By the end of

workers, with 983,800 of them working in state-owned units, 
among whom contract-based staff and workers accounted for 27.4 
percent. 
  Occupation recommendation services were just unfolding. In 
1993 the whole province had 51 occupation recommendation

qualifications. These institutions accepted the registrations of 
28,800 people looking for jobs, with 9,800 people successfully

capita, an increase of 13.9 percent over that of the previous 
year, in which net productive income was 883 yuan, an increase 
of 13.6 percent over the previous year. But, due to the impact 
of price rises, a number of low-income resident families in 
urban and rural areas were leading a difficult life, and annual 
per capita net income of 13.3 percent of the rural population 
was below 500 yuan. 
  There was a steady increase in savings in urban and rural 
areas. At the end of the year, balance of savings deposits (city 
credit cooperative savings and postal savings included) of urban 
and rural residents in the whole province reached 18.402 billion 
yuan, calculated by comparable specifications, an increase of 
63.2 percent over that at the end of the previous year. There

meters, and commodity residential flats totalled 462,900 square 
meters. Newly built private residential flats completed in

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (CNS) -- Spokesman of the Chinese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shen Guofang, said at today's 
news briefing that the incident at Qiandao Lake was an 
accidental event involving tourism which should not have a 
negative influence on the relations between the two sides of the 
Taiwan straits. 
  The spokesman said that the Mainland side also deeply 
grieved 
over the accident, and related departments there were conducting 
a full investigation into the event and were willing to hear the 
viewpoints and suggestions on the matter from Taiwan 
compatriots. Mr. Shen said that the further strengthening of 
personnel exchange and contacts in various sectors between the 
two sides was in conformity with the interests of the Chinese 
nation.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman </F>
Comments on Wei Jingsheng Case and Human Rights Issue"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Shen Guofang made a 
relatively long statement at today's Foreign Affairs Ministry 
news briefing in response to questions on the human rights issue 
raised by a number of reporters. 
  He said that the human rights issue is very extensive and 
that China is willing to have international cooperation on the 
issue of human rights. The case of Wei Jingsheng is not an 
issue of human rights. I have talked with many reporters about 
the Wei Jingsheng case and have discovered that reporters do not 
know very much about him. The so-called human rights do not 
simply mean releasing criminals, which is irrelevant to human 
rights. 
  Regarding the request Warren Christopher made during his 
visit to China a month ago, when he asked Qian Qichen to solve 
the problems of the Chinese side's approval of applications for 
family dependents to visit their relatives in the United States 
and of releasing 108 Tibetans, Shen Guofang said not without 
ridicule: I do not know whether reporters have ever been to the 
U.S. Embassy in China, where there is a long line of people 
waiting for visas every day. Many people were not able to get 
their visas to the United States and, as a result, their 
families were broken up. As a matter of fact, many people do 
not want to permanently stay in the United States and only wish 
to visit their relatives and friends there. Regarding the 
namelist of the 108 Tibetans, we often receive similar lists 
from western countries. Upon investigation, however, we have 
found that there are many problems in those lists. 
Investigation has revealed that some of the people did not 
exist at all, some had already been released, and other were 
serving other sentences. When western personalities have given 
such namelists to us, we have tried to verify the contents and 
sources with them, but they themselves could not tell us where 
the information came from.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "U.S. Urged To Keep GATT Re-Entry Promise"] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry yesterday called on the U.S. 
to stand by its pledge to support China's re-entry into GATT and 
criticized the British parliament for 'erroneous' legislation 
regarding Hong Kong. 
  Spokesman Shen Guofang said negotiations are being held with 
the U.S. about resuming China's status in the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  However, although the U.S. is an important nation in GATT, 
it 
is only one of the 105 signatory countries, Shen said during the 
ministry's weekly news conference. 
  Shen said that China is willing to keep friendly relations 
with Britain on the basis of equality and mutual respect. 
  But he criticized the recent report released by a committee 
in the UK House of Commons. 
  Shen said the report defended the "erroneous" attitudes of 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and disregarded basic facts 
about the HK issue. 
  Also, he said China maintains that the crisis over 
inspecting 
possible nuclear sites in the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea should be settled through talks. 
  This message has been delivered to U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State Robert Gallucci, the spokesman said. 
  In other news from the briefing, Shen said: 
  --The government does not want the recent ship fire on 
Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, that killed 24 Taiwanese and eight 
mainlanders to damage the cultural ties across the Taiwan 
Straits; 
  --A National People's Congress (NPC) delegation headed by 
the 
Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun of the Standing Committee will leave 
for New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia on Monday.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Commenting 
this afternoon on the view of Sino-British relations put forth 
in the British House of Commons report, foreign ministry 
spokesman Shen Guofang said that the section on Hong Kong, in 
total disregard of the facts, actually tries to defend the 
series of erroneous practices of Chris Patten on the Hong Kong 
issue and supports him to continue along his mistaken path. 
  Shen Guofang said that China has not yet received the full 
text of the report and that a detailed comment would be made 
following a full study of the report. 
  On the question of the British side's request for a dialogue 
with China on human rights, Shen replied that the Chinese 
Government is always ready to maintain contact with the British 
side based on equal footing and mutual respect. At the same 
time, China also maintains contacts with many other countries on 
the question of human rights. China holds that the concept of 
human rights covers a great deal of ground. The Chinese 
Government has declared on numerous occasions that it abides by 
the World Declaration on Human Rights and will make its due 
contribution to defending human rights and basic freedoms. 
China is willing to carry out international cooperation on 
human rights.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday [14 
April] a British parliamentary report that painted a grim 
picture of post-1997 Hong Kong, depicting Beijing as 
intransigent on the questions of human rights and democracy. 
  While admitting that Beijing had yet to make a full study of 
the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report released 
Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said an 
initial reading showed it to be factually incorrect and 
supportive of London's erroneous policies on Hong Kong. "This 
report, in total disregard of the facts, actually tries to 
defend the series of erroneous practises of the British 
government and (Hong Kong Governor) Chris Patten on the issue of 
Hong Kong," Shen said. It also "supports them to continue on 
their wrong way," he added. 
  The highly critical 100-page report on Sino-British 
relations 
up to and after 1997, when the British colony reverts to Chinese 
rule, said the breakdown in negotiations between Beijing and 
London signalled "the probable end of the process envisaged in 
1984 of a 'through train' to 1997 and beyond. The "through 
train" concept, built into the 1984 Basic Law and Joint 
Declaration on Hong Kong, assumed those elected to the colony's 
Legislative Council (Legco) in 1995 would continue to serve out 
their terms after the handover. 
  However, says the report: "China has announced that the 
Legco elected in 1995 will be disbanded in 1997, and indeed, the 
Chinese may seek to undermine its authority before that date. A 
British government is powerless to prevent this from happening." 
Shen said the Chinese side would comment further on the report 
after making a full study of its contents.

Remarks on Xi Yang Case"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Shen Guofang, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, said regarding the case of MING PAO 
reporter Xi Yang, that the case is being judged and handled 
independently by the judicial department. 
  Responding to a question on detention of some pro-democracy 
elements during the visit of French prime minister to Beijing 
and Shanghai, Shen Guofang said: First I must correct you, they 
are not pro-democracy elements, they are criminal elements. 
Many of them are still on parole, during which period the 
Chinese judicial department has the power to take any action, 
and this is entirely unrelated to the French prime minister's 
visit to China.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng met separately with U.S. and German businessmen here this 
afternoon. 
  In meeting with John Hennessey, chairman and chief executive 
of CS First Boston Group Inc., of the U.S.A, Li said he had 
recently met with executives of several major U.S. securities 
companies, whose China visits indicated that U.S. entrepreneurs 
are very interested in expanding cooperation with China, and new 
content has been added to Sino-U.S. economic links. 
  He said that it is a success that China entrusted U.S. 
securities companies to issue bonds and stocks. 
  Li noted China's stock market, still in its experimental 
stage, is very young. "We will do the work well according to 
China's own conditions and reform plans, as well as drawing 
lessons from successful experience of other countries", he added. 
  He pointed out that China's market is open to all American 
entrepreneurs who are willing to conduct mutually beneficial 
cooperation with China. China hopes to improve and develop 
Sino- U.S. ties in every aspect, he said. 
  The Chinese premier hoped that U.S. entrepreneurs would not 
let the opportune moment slip out of their fingers. 
  Li continued that China's economy has kept a developing 
momentum but communications, transportation, energy and 
infrustructure facilities still lag behind in the country's 
national economy, adding that these fields, in which lie broad 
prospects for Sino- foreign cooperation, will be focused on in 
the country's development drive. 
  Li also briefed the guests on China's financial and tax 
reforms. 
  Hennessey said that it is his firm's long-term strategy to 
cooperate with China and his company will participate in the 
construction of China's key fields. 
  In meeting with Hermann Scholl, chairman of the board of 
Germany's Robert Bosch GMbH, Li said that Bosch, whose 
techniques and products enjoy a good name in China, is a good 
cooperative partner of the country. 
  He noted that there is a long history and remarkable 
achievement for Sino-German cooperation in trade and techniques, 
adding that last year's China tour by German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl opened new prospects for the two countries' economic and 
trade links. 
  Scholl said that the first visit he made after he took 
office 
as chairman was to China and this showed the positive desire of 
Bosch to enhance cooperation with China. 
  He noted that his firm will play a role in helping China 
develop such fields as advanced machinery manufacturing industry.

  [Text] Marrakesh, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
will continue to support China's efforts to become a member of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO), U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said here today. 
  Kantor was speaking after discussions of Sino-U.S. relations 
and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) with Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang. 
  Gu, who is heading a delegation to GATT's ministerial 
meeting 
here, expressed the hope that the negotiation process would be 
sped up for China to re-enter GATT and become a founding member 
of the WTO. 
  He reaffirmed China's principles in the negotiations, which 
are to seek a balance between rights and duties and China's 
status as a developing country. 
  Kantor said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations was 
"beneficial not only to the two countries, but also to the whole 
world." 
  He also noted that the two sides should continue 
consultations to solve the existing problems in the negotiations. 
  The two sides have agreed in principle to start a new round 
of bilateral talks in Washington next month on China's re-entry 
into GATT. 
  The ministerial meeting, which started in the Moroccan city 
Tuesday to sign the Uruguay round trade accords reached last 
December under GATT, will end Friday.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
approved today a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars to support an 
irrigation and power generation project along northern China's 
Yellow River. 
  The "Xiaolangdi multipurpose project" finances construction 
of a 154-meter-high rock fill dam, with a reservoir, 15 large 
tunnels and a spillway to divert the river, handle floods, 
generate power and control sediment. 
  The dam will protect about 103 million people and billions 
of 
dollars in housing, roads, factories and power plants from 
possible catastrophic floods, and reduce sediment flow. 
  The project, in the fertile and heavily populated Xiaolangdi 
region along the Yellow River, will prevent floods that could 
cause billions of dollars in damage and the loss of thousands of 
lives. 
  Flooding problems along the Yellow River date back thousands 
of years, as do China's efforts to regulate the river. China 
has considered the project for about 40 years, which was 
formally identified by the World Bank in 1989. 
  The loan approved today, extending from 20 to 35 years, 
included a loan of 460 million dollars from the World Bank and a 
credit of 110 million from its affiliate, the International 
Development Association.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, 
says that sanctions against North Korea could be imposed if 
Pyongyang refused to comply with International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) safeguards. 
  Gallucci issued the warning at a press conference here 
Thursday following a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin 
Huasun. "But we believe resolution (of the North Korean nuclear 
issue) through dialogue is the best way," Gallucci said. 
  He noted that IAEA Director-general Hans Blix is to report 
on 
the problem to the U.N. Security Council next month. The council 
will then discuss follow-up measures including sanctions if no 
progress is made in the IAEA's efforts to inspect North Korean 
facilities, he said. 
  Gallucci said he has exchanged views not only on the nuclear 
row but also on overall security on the Korean peninsula with 
Chinese Government officials. The talks were productive and 
helpful, Gallucci said, adding that he gives high marks to the 
Chinese Government's position. He thus hinted that China was 
playing a more active role in trying to influence Pyongyang than 
generally thought. 
  Gallucci said he will continue to have close consultations 
with China, Japan and South Korea on the North Korean problem. 
He said a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks 
could be held if Pyongyang honored its agreement with Washington 
reached in New York on Feb. 25, which set two conditions -- 
acceptance of IAEA inspections and inter-Korean dialogue on 
exchanging special envoys. 
  Asked what the United States would do if China opposed U.N. 
economic sanctions against North Korea, Gallucci refused to 
speculate on how individual Security Council members would act. 
  Winding up a three-day visit to China, Gallucci is scheduled 
to leave for Seoul Friday.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A total of 26 
personnel were killed in today's incident in which two U.S. Army 
helicopter were shot down by two U.S. fighter planes in Northern 
Iraq, the chief of staff for European Command said. 
  General Richard Keller told reporters at a hook-up news 
briefing in the Defense Department that there were 26 aircrew 
and passengers involved in the incident and "we have no reports 
of survivors." 
  "This total includes 15 U.S. personnel, three Turkish 
officers, one French officer, two British officers and five 
Kurdish passengers," said Keller who is in the European theater 
command center where he has been monitoring the events of this 
tragedy. 
  The incident took place at about 35 miles north of Irbil in 
Iraq at about 0735 GMT today. 
  One F-15c aircraft fired one AIM-120 Amraam missile, and the 
other F-15c fired one AIM-9 Sidewinder missile downing the two 
UH-60 helicopters, Keller said. 
  He noted that at the time of the incident, the F-15c 
aircraft 
were conducting a routine patrol of the northern no-fly 
exclusion zone. 
  The U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified as Iraqi 
Hind 
helicopters, he added. 
  "We are in communication with our search and rescue team at 
the crash site at the present time," Keller said, "two aircraft 
with 26 remains in fact have departed that site" for a Turkish 
air base at Diyarbakir tonight.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serbs' 
Information Ministry has decided to revoke press credentials for 
all American journalists working in "the Serbian republic" and 
banned them from the territory as of today. 
  The ministry said that as of April 14, work credentials of 
American journalists are revoked and they are forbidden from 
entering the territory of the self-styled Bosnian Serb republic. 
  It also said that press credentials and visas of all foreign 
journalists issued by the UN peacekeeping forces are no longer 
valid. 
  The move followed NATO air strikes against Serb positions 
around the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and 
11. The Serbs accused the United States of siding with the 
Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war, 
and regarded it as an "aggressor." 
  For a long time, Bosnian Serb authorities have been 
dissatisfied with the "distorted and anti-Serb reports" filed by 
U.S journalists. 
  On Tuesday, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia revoked press 
credentials for the AFP News Agency and the CNN TV Network and 
denied a WASHINGTON POST reporter's visa to enter Serbia.

  [Text] United Nations, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council today condemned Bosnian Serbs for blocking the movement 
of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
  The council said in a statement that the actions, which 
affect the safe and free movement of UNPROFOR personnel, have 
violated the Security Council's resolutions. 
  The statement said that "the council affirms its full 
support 
for UNPROFOR in its execution of the council's relevant 
resolutions." 
  The council "demands that all parties, and in particular the 
Bosnian Serb party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of 
movement, and refrain from any further actions which could 
threaten the safety of UNPROFOR personnel." 
  Reports of Serbs' blocking of UNPROFOR movement came after 
NATO launched air strikes against Serb positions around the 
eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde on April 10 and 11.

  [Text] United Nations, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council adopted a resolution today to pave the way for 
Secretary- General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to send a reconnaissance 
team to Aouzou strip, a disputed area between Libya and Chad. 
  On April 4, Libya and Chad signed an agreement concerning 
the 
practical modalities for the implementation of the judgment 
delivered by the international court of justice regarding the 
Aouzou strip. 
  They agreed that the withdrawal of Libyan administration and 
troops from Aouzou should start on April 15, under the 
supervision of a mixed team of 25 Chadian officers, 25 Libyan 
officers and UN observers. 
  Butrus-Ghali wrote to the Security Council Wednesday on his 
intention to send a reconnaissance team to the area to conduct a 
survey of conditions on the ground for the possible deployment 
of UN observers to monitor the Libyan withdrawal. 
  Noting that the team would travel to Libya by UN aircraft, 
the Security Council decided that paragraph 4 of Resolution 748, 
which imposed sanctions, including aviation embargo, on Libya, 
should not apply in respect of the UN aircraft flying to or from 
Libya for the purpose of conveying the team. 
  Resolution 748 was adopted in March 1992 because of Libya's 
refusal to hand over to the United States and Britain two Libyan 
suspects for the Pan Am jet bombing over Scotland in 1988 which 
killed 270 people.

  [Text] Washington, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the morning of 13 
April at the White House, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore met 
with Song Jian, head of the Chinese Government science and 
technology delegation, state councillor, and minister in charge 
of the State Science and Technology Commission; and Wu Yi, head 
of the Chinese Government economic and trade delegation, and 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. They held 
frank and friendly conversations [tan shuai you hao de jiao tan 
0982 3764 0645 1170 4104 0074 6151]. 
  Gore extended his welcome to Song Jian and Wu Yi on their 
U.S. visits and on their respective attendance to the sixth 
session of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation 
Joint Committee and the eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint 
Commission on Commerce and Trade. Gore said: We are very happy 
with the convening of the two sessions. Strengthening 
U.S.-Chinese scientific, technological, economic, and trade 
cooperation will be beneficial to both the United States and 
China and to the two countries people. 
  He said: "President Clinton and I believe that it suits our 
mutual interests for the United States to establish close and 
friendly relations with a strong, stable, and prosperous China." 
  Song Jian said: The Chinese Government has always attached 
importance to Sino-U.S. relations, and has repeatedly expressed 
its views on developing Sino-U.S. relations and its principled 
stance on bilateral issues. Chinese leaders have repeatedly 
stressed that both China and the United States should have more 
trust in each other, reduce troubles, enhance cooperation, and 
avoid [bu gao 0008 2269] confrontations. 
  Song Jian said: The Chinese scientific, technological, 
economic, and trading circles are willing to increase contacts, 
foster close cooperation, and enhance mutual understandings with 
their American counterparts. Such activities are conducive to 
scientific and technological progress, economic prosperity, 
exchanges and visits among the people of the two countries. He 
expressed his hope that both China and the United States will 
hold consultations to resolve problems concerning Sino-U.S. 
relations on a basis of mutual respects, equality, and mutual 
benefit in an effort to develop broader prospects in bilateral 
cooperation and exchanges between the two countries. 
  Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu attended 
the 
meeting.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton warned today that the Serbs would make a mistake to 
treat the U.N. and NATO forces as enemies. 
  Clinton told reporters at a news conference that "that is 
not 
what we are doing. We are trying to get them to honor their 
word, and they would be making a mistake to do that." 
  American warplanes, under U.N. and NATO direction, carried 
out air strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged 
Muslim enclave of Gorazde this week. 
  But Clinton reminded the Serbs that the U.S. had taken no 
action through NATO to try to win a military victory for their 
adversaries. 
  "What we have done is taken military action in Bosnia 
through 
NATO with the approval of the United Nations to get them to 
honor the U.N. rules and to encourage them to do what they say 
they wish to, which is to engage in negotiations," Clinton noted. 
  He said that "the Serbs would be making a mistake to start 
treating the United Nations and NATO forces as adverse 
combatants." 
  Clinton also said he was encouraged by news reports 
suggesting that the Serbs are willing to cease their offensive 
against Gorazde and to return to negotiating table.

<F P=106> ["International commentary" by Li Changjiu (2621 7022 0036) </F>
  "The Most Favored Nation Status Is Not a Bestowal"] 
  [Text] Two countries' most favored nation [MFN] status is 
an equal and mutually beneficial arrangement and a basis for 
both sides to conduct normal trade. It is beneficial to both 
sides and not a bestowal provided by one side to the other. 
Prior to his China tour in March, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher visited Australia. During his visit, Australian 
Foreign Minister Evans explicitly said: "It is our opinion that 
MFN is not something preferential but is a normal basis for 
trade." But when Christopher visited China, he still regarded 
MFN as a carrot and linked it to the human rights issue. 
  Sino-U.S. relations are not based on the same social system, 
the same concept value, or on the same ideology but are 
established on the basis of common interests. Despite their 
different concepts on value and human rights, Sino-U.S. economic 
and trade relations have rapidly developed since the signing of 
a bilateral trade agreement in Beijing which provided each other 
with MFN status in 1979. Sino- U.S. trade volume increased from 
$2.45 billion in 1979 to $27.65 billion last year. Deputy U.S. 
trade representative Barshefsky told the U.S. Congress that 
direct investments by U.S. businessmen in China totaled more 
than $7 billion; in 1993, U.S. business investments in China 
amounted to $3 billion, some 550 U.S. firms had established 
offices in China, and 500 major U.S. firms regarded their 
investments in China as one of their strategic development 
targets. 
  China needs developed countries' capital, technology, and 
equipment for its modernization. When talking about investment 
prospects in China recently, U.S. trade representative Kantor 
predicted that in the coming 10 years, China's investment in 
basic facilities construction alone will amount to $500 billion; 
the United States has competitive strong points in the fields of 
telecommunications, highway, and heavy machinery. Some U.S. 
economic experts estimate that if the United States can obtain 1 
percent of these contracts, this will create tens of thousands 
of employment opportunities in the United States. Following the 
sustained, rapid, and steady development of China's economy, 
China's imports will continuously increase. China's imports 
amounted to $103.95 billion last year and if they grow at 9 
percent per annum, they will amount to $1,000 billion in the 
year 2000. This serves as a large market for the world. As 
long as the United States maintains normal economic and trade 
relations, China will become an increasingly important market 
for U.S. investment, commodities, and labor force. 
  A host of facts prove or suggest that mutual MFN status 
between China and the United States is beneficial to the two 
countries and their peoples. If the United States abolishes 
China's MFN status, China's interests will be damaged but the 
U.S. Government is clearly aware of the following points: 
First, China has a large population and relies mainly on its 
domestic market. Last year, China's exports amounted to $91.77 
billion. Deducting the one-fourth export volume of the 
"three-capital" enterprises and some of the export commodities 
manufactured in the business form of "three come's and one 
compensatory" [processing provided raw materials, processing 
according to provided samples, assembling with provided 
components, and compensatory trade], China's exports do not 
account for a large percentage of its GNP. China relies mainly 
on its domestic market and its ability to rely on its own 
efforts is strong. Second, China's opening up is 
omnidirectional and it is willing to develop economic and trade 
relations with other countries on an equal and mutually 
beneficial basis. So far, businessmen from more than 100 
countries and regions in the world have come to China for 
investment. Last year, investment agreements between China and 
foreign businessmen amounted to $110.852 billion and the 
investments actually made totaled $25.759 billion, of which U.S. 
investments accounted for only a small percentage. 
  Many Americans understand that, should the United States 
abolish China's MFN status, U.S. losses would not be smaller 
than China's because it could lose a large market for 
investment, commodities, and labor force. After Christopher's 
visit to China, the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee held a 
seminar on Sino-U.S. relations in Washington on 15 March. At 
the seminar, some famous entrepreneurs called on the Clinton 
administration to separate the human rights issue from China's 
MFN status and to unconditionally renew China's MFN status. 
Clarkson, vice president of the Boeing Company, said that the 
company "fully supports renewal of China's MFN status" and hoped 
that the U.S. Congress would abolish its annual debate on this 
issue. Denholm, general manager of Chrysler--the third largest 
automobile company in the United States--recently asked the 
Clinton administration to separate the human rights issue from 
renewal of China's MFN status. He pointed out that, at the same 
time as the United States was using the human rights issue to 
exert pressure on China, the German Government had expressed its 
readiness to provide preferential financial aid to create 
conditions for Mercedez-Benz and Chrysler to build a factory in 
China, adding that the United States would harm itself in using 
the human rights issue to impose trade sanctions against China. 
Worlick, in charge of the American Telegraph and Telephone 
Company, expressed the same uneasiness by saying that, in 
retaliating against China, large U.S. companies could be the 
first to suffer. His company has joined the project to build a 
modernized telephone system in China. Worlick said: Only two 
of every 100 people in China have telephone sets. There is huge 
potential in this respect in a country with 1.1 billion people 
and "by the year 2000, China will have the biggest 
telecommunications network in the world." Worlick added: The 
American Telegraph and Telephone Company must remain in a 
favorable position, otherwise it will lose its leading position 
among its opponents, like France, Germany, Sweden, and Japan. 
In a speech on 23 March, President Clinton said that "the 
United States absolutely needs to renew China's MFN status." 
This indicates that President Clinton has a good idea of how 
things stand. The problem is that some so-called idealists in 
the United States are ignorant about China and the world and 
unwilling to lay down the obsolete weapons of carrots and 
sticks. However, we believe that reality is the best teacher to 
awaken these "idealists" to the facts.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A seminar was held 
here today to commemorate Dr. James Endicott, a renowned 
Canadian peace champion and a life-long friend of the Chinese 
people. 
  Among the participants were Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of 
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's 
Congress, Huang Hua, president of the China Society for People's 
Friendship Studies, Canadian Ambassador to China Fred Bild and 
members of the Endicott family. 
  Dr. Endicott was born into a missionary family in Leshan 
city, in China's Sichuan Province, in December 1898, and died in 
Toronto, Canada, in November 1993. 
  The Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign 
Countries (CPAFFC) in August last year conferred on him the 
honorific title of "friendship ambassador," together with a 
certificate. 
  In accordance with his last wishes, Mrs. Endicott and his 
children brought his ashes to spread on the river that flows by 
Leshan, his "second homeland". 
  In his speech, Huang Hua described Dr. Endicott as a foreign 
friend who sympathized with and supported the Chinese people in 
their just struggle. 
  "Dr. Endicott devoted his entire life, energy and wisdom to 
the Chinese people's revolution and national development, to 
friendship between the Chinese and Canadian peoples and to world 
peace," Huang said, adding that Endicott made significant 
contributions in all these endeavors. 
  Recalling the century-old friendly ties the Endicotts have 
with China, CPAFFC Vice-President Xu Qun expressed the hope that 
there will be more and more friends who will, just as Dr. 
Endicott did, concern themselves with the cause of Sino-Canadian 
friendship and make it more bright. 
  A speech written by Bishop K. H. Ting, vice-chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and chairman of the China Christian 
Council, was delivered for him because he could not be present 
for health reasons. 
  Dr. James Endicott's son Stephen Endicott and son-in-law 
William Small also spoke at the seminar. 
  Mrs. Endicott presented to the China National Library via 
CPAFFC the one-volume edition of "The Canadian Far East 
Newsletter", edited and published by Dr. Endicott from 1948 to 
1992, which reported objectively China's socialist construction 
and rebutted anti-China allegations in the West.

  [Text] Moscow, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The defense ministers 
of 11 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
adopted documents to establish a CIS collective security 
committee during an extraordinary meeting here today. 
  Except Moldova, military leaders of all CIS members 
including 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine 
attended the meeting. 
  Moldova, whose parliament allowed the country to join the 
CIS 
last week, has repeatedly stressed that it only accedes to the 
CIS' economic agreements instead of military ones in view of its 
independence. 
  The meeting also approved a draft declaration on security 
coordination among the CIS member states and their stance toward 
the "partnership for peace" plan of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO). 
  The declaration pointed out that the signatories should not 
use force against one another and that the treaty on collective 
security has laid the foundation for the establishment of a 
Euro-Asian defensive alliance. 
  It also said that its signatories regard the "partnership 
for 
peace" plan as a practical choice which is aimed at enhancing an 
all-European cooperation mechanism based on the conference of 
security and cooperation in Europe without enlarging NATO. 
  The "partnership for peace" plan will allow former 
Soviet-led 
Warsaw Pact members to take part in peacekeeping, military 
exercises and other NATO activities without becoming NATO 
members.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Te-yun (4151 1795 0336): "Mainland China </F>
Buys Three K-Class Submarines From Russia"] 
  [Text] Taipei--The age in which noises like the sounds of 
drums and gongs made by mianland Chinese submarines will soon be 
over. Overseas information shows that mainland China has 
ordered three large kilo-class K110 diesel-powered attack 
submarines from Russia. Their operational level of silence is 
quite high, and they will constitute a threat to shipping safety 
in Taiwan waters and the entire western Pacific. 
  Sources pointed out that the unit price of the three K110 
submarines ordered by the mainland is possibly around $250 
million, and three quarters of the payment will be made in the 
form of barter trade. The mainland also used this form for most 
of the payment in buying 26 Su-27 fighter planes from Russia. 
Since this transaction includes importing Russian technology 
and personnel to develop the capacity to produce K-class 
submarines, the main force of submarines using traditional 
motive power of the mainland navy may possibly be K-class 
submarines. 
  However, Russia is not satisfied with the mainland's "buying 
only" three submarines and is ready to ask the mainland to buy 
more "to show sincerity," and may expresse reservations about 
the transfer of technology during the upcoming visit to Russia 
of Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission 
and admiral of the mainland navy. 
  A national report published at the end of March this year 
predicted that the mainland may put the K-class submarines on 
the list of arms to be obtained from Russia. However, when 
asked about the matter, Taipei naval officers were still quite 
surprised and pointed out that at present the mainland has only 
six "quite modern" Han-class nuclear-powered attack submarines 
and that although it has over 80 Ming-class (model 035) and 
R-class (model 033) traditional diesel-powered submarines, more 
than half of them cannot not perform on the high seas, and they 
are old and make a great deal of noise in operation. If in 
addition to the nuclear-powered submarines, the mainland obtains 
K-class submarines from Russia, and if Taipei wants to carry out 
a counter-blockade to safeguard shipping, the two existing 
Stegosaur submarines are not enough in terms of fighting 
capacity.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 KYODO -- The North Korean nuclear 
situation has improved since the UN Security Council adopted a 
statement last month urging it to let inspectors finish their 
checks, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told a Japanese 
newspaper executive. 
  Qian said also he understood Pyongyang's reasons for 
immediately denouncing the statement, the chairman of the 
Japanese-language TOKYO SHIMBUN, Miichiro Kato, told reporters 
in Beijing after the interview Wednesday [13 April]. 
  This is because North Korea insists that the issue should be 
resolved in negotiations with the United States, without United 
Nations intervention, Kato quoted Qian as saying. 
  The U.S. had lobbied Security Council members to pass a 
resolution that would have prodded North Korea to accept 
international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected of 
being part of a weapons development program. 
  China, Pyongyang's last remaining major ally, convinced the 
security council to adopt the nonbinding statement, however, 
stressing the need for dialogue and warning against isolating 
North Korea further. 
  On Wednesday, Qian said, "since the UN Security Council 
announced the presidential statement, it appears that (the 
situation) is heading gradually in a positive direction." 
  "North Korea was against the issue being discussed by the 
Security Council, so I understand its denial (of the 
statement)," Qian added. 
  The foreign minister said that there were "absolutely" no 
plans for North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit China or 
for Beijing leaders to journey to Pyongyang. 
  Regarding the renewal by the U.S. of most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status for China, Qian stressed that support for an 
extension of the status, to be decided on by Washington in June, 
is "very strong" among American business leaders. 
  "If the U.S. does not want its economic relationship with 
China severed, then problems should be resolved," he said Qian, 
without mentioning Washington's linkage of human rights concerns 
with a renewal of MFN. 
  On the possibility of Japan obtaining a permanent seat on 
the 
UN Security Council, Qian said there were differing opinions 
among UN member nations, adding that no formal discussions are 
scheduled on the issue.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (XINHUA) -- South Korea announced 
today that it has withdrawn unconditionally its demand for 
exchange of special envoys with the North as a condition for 
Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with Washington. 
  The announcement was made by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime 
minister and head of the National Unification Board (NUB), after 
a cabinet meeting on reunification and national security policy 
here. 
  The move will likely increase pressure on the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow additional inspection 
of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), analysts here said. 
  Seoul and Washington said earlier that a third round of 
U.S.- 
DPRK high-level talks could be held if Pyongyang honored an 
agreement reached with Washington in New York on February 25. 
  The agreement set two preconditions -- acceptance of IAEA 
inspections and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue on the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  However, the DPRK insisted that the third round of U.S.-DPRK 
talks should be held since it has already met the two conditions. 
  The South Korean government has determined that it is 
impossible to resolve DPRK's nuclear issue only through an 
exchange of special envoys since the DPRK has "clearly shown 
that it has no intention of doing so," Yi said. 
  Consequently, the government has decided against setting the 
envoy exchange as a condition for a third round of U.S.-DPRK 
high- level talks, he explained. 
  However, Yi said, there is no change in the government's 
position that "the nuclear problem will have to be resolved 
above everything else." 
  South Korea and the DPRK have held eight rounds of 
working-level talks on the exchange of special envoys at the 
truce village of Panmunjom since last October, but failed to 
reach any agreement due to differences on the issue. 
  "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for mutual and 
simultaneous 
inspections of each other's nuclear facilities based on the 
joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," 
Yi said. 
  Today's cabinet meeting also decided that South Korea will 
accept all DPRK's "escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps" in 
Siberia, Russia, who wish to settle in the South. 
  Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at 
Siberian logging camps, are said to be "seeking asylum" in South 
Korea, according to official sources here. 
  On Thursday, Russia expressed its willingness to help South 
Korea resettle DPRK's loggers in Siberia. Seoul and Moscow will 
soon hold working-level discussion on this question.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's largest port 
of Shanghai has established sistership ties with Pusan Port of 
the Republic of Korea (ROK). 
  A signing ceremony to the effect was held here Tuesday [12 
April]. 
  The Shanghai port has so far set up sistership ties with 
eight foreign ports. The previous seven are the ports of 
Seattle, New Orleans, the New Jersey Port in the United States, 
Osaka and Yokohama in Japan, Antwerp in Belgium and Marseilles 
in France. 
  As the biggest port in the ROK, Pusan Port handled a total 
of 
almost 70 million ton of goods last year. 
  Since the two countries set up diplomatic relations in 1991 
and especially since Shanghai and Pusan became sister cities in 
1993, trade between the two sides has increased greatly. 
  The two ports pledged to further their co-operation in 
shipping, technology, information and personnel exchanges.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren met here today with Yoshiro Takasaki, chairman of the 
Toyo Seikan Kaisha Company, and Jinemon Konishi, chairman of the 
Konishi Foundation for International Exchanges of Japan. 
  During the meeting, Rong spoke highly of the important role 
that the late Tatsunosuke Takasaki, father of Yoshiro, played in 
developing Sino-Japanese people-to-people friendship and 
economic and trade ties, as well as in the normalization of 
bilateral diplomatic relations. 
  He also praised the son for his continued efforts to further 
the relations between the two countries. 
  "Chinese people will never forget the contributions 
Tatsunosuke Takasaki made in this regard," the vice-president 
added. 
  Yoshiro Takasaki said that, like his father, he would spare 
no effort for the development of the bilateral ties. 
  In addition, Rong expressed his appreciation for the work 
Konishi did to promote bilateral friendly co-operation. 
  Konishi, who used to be the chief secretary to Tatsunosuke 
Takasaki, told Rong that to develop the friendship in a 
sustained way, many famous entrepreneurs and politicians were 
accompanying them on the visit. 
  Rong pointed out that more Japanese investment is flowing 
into China, and the potential for two-way trade is very great. 
  The Japanese guests arrived here Wednesday at the invitation 
of the Beijing municipal government. 
  During their stay here they have acquainted themselves with 
Beijing's investment environment, and discussed new co-operative 
projects with departments concerned, such as the Beijing general 
agriculture, industry and commerce corporation.

  [Text] Cairo, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Two American F-15 
fighters shot down two U.S. Army helicopters over Northern Iraq 
today, according to reports reaching here. 
  The reports quoting a U.S. Pentagon statement said the 
incident occurred approximately 60 kilometers north of Irbil, 
and the U.S. helicopters had been mistakenly identified as Iraqi 
aircraft operating in the "no-fly zone" in Northern Iraq. 
  An official of the U.S. State Department was quoted as 
saying 
"high level" U.N. officials were on board and between 12 and 24 
were dead. 
  Earlier Western reports said the helicopters were shot down 
by Iraqi warplanes in the allied-imposed zone. 
  The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its 
allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf 
war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over 
Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.

  [Text] Baghdad, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Iraqi authorities 
have no knowledge of the incident today in Northern Iraq 
involving the crash of two military helicopters of foreign 
forces there, an official spokesman said. 
  A statement by the spokesman to this effect was carried by 
the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY. 
  The spokesman said the Iraqi Air Force was not engaged in 
any 
activity in the region at the time of the incident. 
  Two U.S. Army helicopters were shot down over the "no-fly 
zone" in Northern Iraq today. 
  Earlier Western news reports said the helicopters were shot 
down by Iraqi warplanes. 
  Later the United States confirmed that they were shot down 
by 
two American F-15 fighter jets. The U.S. helicopters had been 
mistakenly identified as Iraqi aircraft operating in the "no-fly 
zone." 
  It was reported that more than 20 "high-level" people on 
board were killed. 
  The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its 
allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf 
war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over 
Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "It Is Also Necessary To Sound a </F>
Constant Warning Alarm in the Press Circles"] 
  [Text] A prominent characteristic of the illegal 
fundraising activities of Shen Taifu, president of the former 
Changcheng Mechanical and Electrical Science and Technology 
Corporation, was that a small number of journalists were bought 
over by Shen with bribes to whitewash the illicit business, to 
give counsel and publicity to such deals, and to add fuel to the 
flames. Otherwise, how could so many people be taken in and 
such a huge amount of money accumulated by illicit means within 
such a short period of time? Today, this newspaper publishes a 
report about Sun Shuxing, who was found guilty of giving and 
receiving bribes, and Cai Yuanjiang, who was found guilty of 
taking bribes, revealing another aspect of Changcheng's illegal 
fundraising activities. A lesson should be drawn from such 
cases and journalists in particular, should give deep thought to 
such cases and thus raise their vigilance. 
  In the course of developing the socialist market economy, it 
is natural that economic entities of all types are certain to 
pay attention to using the news media and enlisting their help. 
Journalists should also actively orient their work toward the 
economy, the market, and toward the enterprises, and should 
serve the purpose of more quickly establishing the socialist 
market economy. However, they must observe the ethical norms of 
journalism, strictly separate news reporting from advertising, 
and never engage in "paid news reporting." They must not do 
such things as lavishing praise on somebody who pays them money 
or exaggerating the achievements of such bribe-givers, thus 
misleading the public. Otherwise, they may: Go against the 
principle that news reporting must be objective, authentic, and 
fair; sully the reputation of the journalistic undertakings led 
by the party; and they may also disrupt the economic order and 
social stability. It is a regrettable fact that in recent 
years, a small number of journalists have failed to withstand 
the corrosive influence of money fetishism, gave up their 
principles while being lured by pecuniary benefit, and even 
became accomplices of some economic criminals and became bogged 
down in the mire of evil. 
  Last year, the CPC Central Propaganda Department and the 
State Press and Publications Administration jointly issued the 
"Circular on Strengthening the Trade Ethics of the Journalists 
and Banning `Paid News Reporting.'" After that, anticorruption 
was taken seriously in journalistic circles. Various 
journalistic institutions banned "paid news reporting" and took 
this as an important point in their efforts to consolidate trade 
ethics among their personnel. They formulated a series of 
concrete measures according to their specific conditions and 
intensified education, management, and inspection. The vast 
numbers of journalists also strictly practiced self-discipline. 
Through such efforts over the past year, marked results have 
been achieved. However, anticorruption is a long-term task and 
opposing "paid news reporting" is also a long-term task. We 
should not overestimate the results achieved in the previous 
stage and should not underestimate the arduousness of the 
struggle in the future. We must never relax our efforts by even 
the slightest bit. Vigilance must always be maintained, the 
fundamental purpose of serving the people and the socialist 
cause must always be borne in mind, and the fine style of 
working hard and remaining uncontaminated amidst temptations 
must always be kept up. 
  In Shen Taifu's illegal fundraising activities, a very small 
number of reporters did things which were incompatible with 
their trade ethics and in violation of the law. This is a 
painful lesson to learn. The editorial committee of this 
newspaper has laid down anticorruption regulations and has set 
strict demands on our colleagues. We have also established a 
complaint hotline and we welcome strict supervision from people 
in all walks of life. We are willing to join comrades in other 
journalistic institutions in improving the ideological 
consciousness, moral integrity, and work style of the 
journalists and are making efforts for this purpose. 
  Comrade reporters, let us learn a profound lesson from the 
negative experience of Sun Shuxing and Cai Yuanjiang. Always 
bear in mind the great trust placed in us by the party and the 
people, always bear in mind our glorious and sacred mission, and 
always apply the pens, microphones, and cameras in our hands 
properly!

  [Text] On a family planning inspection tour in Guangdong 
Province yesterday, Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister 
of the State Family Planning Commission, noted that Guangdong 
had made progress year after year in family planning. 
  Talking about family planning for the floating population, 
Peng Peiyun said: Guangdong Province, which is experiencing 
rapid economic development, tops the country in terms of the 
size of its floating population. It is very difficult to carry 
out family planning among this section of the population. In 
this regard Guangdong Province has provided a great deal of good 
experience. 
  Peng Peiyun stressed that family planning is a long-term 
task. To do a good job in this respect we must rely on the party 
committee and the government and we, on our part, must exercise 
leadership well. In raising the question of exploring the 
potential of the leading stratum, we mean to encourage leading 
people to seek knowledge about the population theory so that 
they will have a better understanding of family planning work. 
So long as our leading people are enhancing their 
understanding, they will show greater initiative in family 
planning.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Chemical Registration To Stop Deal in </F>
Toxins"] 
  [Text] Chemical traders will have to get environmental 
clearance beginning next month before their goods can be 
imported or exported, an attempt to combat shipments of toxic 
materials. 
  The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) must 
check all chemicals exiting or entering the country, a switch 
from the old system that only required inspection from the 
Customs General Administration. NEPA, along with Customs and 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) 
issued the regulations yesterday. It takes effect on May 1. 
  The regulations were drafted in response to a UN call to 
stamp out unauthorized transfers of toxic chemicals worldwide. 
  And they are also aimed at protecting the national 
environment and the people's health, said Li Hengyuan, deputy 
division chief in charge of solid wastes and chemicals in NEPA. 
  Li said that chemicals play a key role in economic 
development and improving people's living standards, but some 
cause pollution and major health problems. 
  The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 60 
to 
90 percent of the known cancer cases are caused by chemicals. 
  Li said China has experienced rapid development in chemical 
production over the past few years which are widely applied in 
many fields. Add to this a large number of pesticides imported 
for agricultural production. 
  Customs in Shanghai and Guangzhou alone saw imports of 6 
billion yuan (about $700 million) in chemicals in 1993. 
  Nepa has received numerous reports of chemical accidents in 
recent years, Li said.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Zero Tolerance for Illegal Road Tolls"] </F>
  [Text] Chinese authorities will press ahead with their 
clampdown on illicit highway checkposts, charges and fines, 
which block traffic and can undermine social stability, said 
Communications Minister Huang Zhendong at a recent meeting in 
Beijing. 
  A thorough probe will be launched this year by the ministry 
to identify all toll posts across China's 1.07 million-kilometre 
highway network. Then the ministry intends to pool efforts to 
clear out any illegal or excessive tolls. 
  The ministry has also drafted a regulation on the 
installation of highway toll stations, which is expected to take 
effect later this year. 
  Under the rules, the rationale, location and charges of 
highway toll stations will be standardized across the country. 
  The 2,800-kilometre State-level highway from Beijing to 
Shenzhen will be set up as China's first "model road," where all 
the checkposts, charges and fines are based on relevant rules. 
  The "model road" standard will be applied to all State-level 
or provincial-level highways next year. 
  The ministry will also tighten its grip over its own law 
enforcement teams on the highways to rein in any abuses of 
power. To encourage local enthusiasm for highway construction, 
the central government determined years ago that jurisdictions 
borrowing money to build highways and bridges could levy tolls 
to pay back their loans. 
  But many local departments abused the policy and put up 
tollposts without approval, or collected tolls before building 
the highways. Also, many individuals seeking easy money have 
blocked the roads and posed as officials to compel passing 
vehicles to pay "tolls." 
  In some chaotic highway sections drivers and trucking firms 
are afraid of highway bandits at night and irrational charges or 
fines during the day. 
  China's crackdown began in 1990 and has gathered momentum 
since last August as part of the country's anti-corruption drive. 
  More than 10,000 officials participating in the crackdown 
have covered 340,000 kilometres of highways -- about one-third 
of the country's total. 
  Incomplete statistics show that 467 tollposts have been 
removed and 54 irrational highway or waterway charges have been 
halted over the past seven months.

Pakistani Expelled for Traveler's Check Fraud 
  On 10 April, the Guangdong Public Security Department 
escorted a Pakistani called Abud Gehav, who held a counterfeit 
passport, to Guangzhou's Baiyun airport, expelled him, and 
declared that he is not allowed to re-enter the country for the 
next five years. On 28 July 1993 Abud cashed nine U.S. 
dollar-denominated traveler's checks (which had been reported 
lost), at the Bank of China branch in Guangzhou, receiving 2,395 
yuan in foreign exchange certificates. On the same day, he went 
to another Bank of China counter at a hotel to cash his six 
remaining checks. This time he failed and was arrested on the 
spot. On 22 March 1994 he was convicted of swindling. Abud 
accepted the verdict and had no plan to appeal. [Summary] [Hong

Taiwanese Businessman, Partner Abandon Debt-Ridden Company 
  Cai Shunming -- owner of the Daguang Paper Product Company 
Limited, a Fuzhou Taiwan-capital enterprise -- and his mainland 
partner disappeared on 1 April leaving 500,000 yuan in debts 
behind them. Police believe they have not left mainland and are 
looking for them. The company is a sole-capital enterprise with 
$150,000 in registered capital, employing about 300 workers to 
produce tin foil used for religious worship, which is exported 
to Taiwan and South East Asia. On 31 March, Cai halted 
production for six days, claiming them as holidays, but the 60 
workers remaining behind discovered that Cai had gone. The 
company owed the workers two months' pay, 110,000 yuan in rent, 
and some 200,000 yuan of payment in goods. [Summary] [Hong Kong

National 
Concern Over Secret Societies 
  An article in the latest issue of ZHONGHUA WENZHAI (CHINA 
DIGEST) revealed that the Central Commission on Politics and Law 
paid special attention to the activities of secret societies in 
China and took them as one of the ten major targets of the 
anticrime action. The Ministry of State Security also took 
organized crime as a highly dangerous phenomenon to be brought 
under strict supervision and control. The ministry has launched 
three major campaigns against secret societies: From Shaoyang 
in the south, to Harbin in the north. and to Lintong in the 
west. The article, entitled "Are There Mafias in China?" 
revealed that hundreds of criminal gangs often fought each other 
openly in the streets of Shaoyang, western Hunan. The 1991 
anticrime campaign solved 4,041 cases, including 1,096 major 
ones; eliminated 801 criminal gangs; and arrested 6,175 
gangsters, including 1,299 backbone members of the gangs in 
Shaoyang. The crime syndicates in Harbin operated as business 
enterprises, controlling the construction market in the city. 
The article also revealed that crime syndicates in China were 
involved in international criminal activities, such as drug 
trafficking and counterfeiting. [Summary] [Beijing ZHONGGUO

  Fujian 
Quanzhou Uncovers Illegal Arms Sales 
  From January this year to the present, the Quanzhou public 
security organs cracked 5 cases of illegal arms sales, of which 
one was the largest in years. The Quanzhou public security 
organs first cracked an arms sales case in Nanan, by 
intercepting the ammunition delivered by the culprits via 
express mail. The public security organs took note of this 
crime and called on post offices throughout the city to heighten 
vigilance. By the end of last month, the public security bureau 
of Licheng district discovered 50 pellet rifles and 100 boxes of 
pellets in a parcel. They immediately arrested both the sender 
and recipient. The official in charge of the case said it was 
the largest one in the city over the past 45 years. [Text]

Government, Army Join Forces Against Bogus Military Licenses 
  Recently, Fujian's military command and government have 
undertaken joint operations to retrieve all expired military 
vehicle license plates. According to sources, the abuse of 
military vehicle license plates has been rather serious in 
Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi in recent years. Some people 
spend tens of thousands of yuan to get a military or armed 
police license plate "for show," while government officials do 
not have to spend even a cent. There usually are two ways to 
get license plates from military or armed police units: First, 
the Army grants one or two license plates to an enterprise 
jointly run by the military and the local government; second, 
the license plates are for rent. Beginning 11 April, the public 
security department, armed police corps, and various military 
units in Fujian began to carry out inspections and to ban the 
use of military license plates on non-military vehicles.

50,000 Cases of Counterfeiting Cigarettes Solved in 1993 
  According to Fujian Tobacco Bureau chief Jiang Chengkang, in 
1993, Fujian cracked some 50,000 cases of manufacturing and 
selling counterfeit cigarettes, destroying more than 2 million 
packs. According to incomplete statistics, more than 120 illegal 
cigarette factories and 222 illegal cigarette workshops were 
shut down in 1993. Counterfeit famous-brand cigarettes can be 
found everywhere in Fujian. Jiang said the reason counterfeit 
cigarettes cannot be thoroughly eradicated is that law is not 
enforced strictly and that some local governments even shield 
illegal cigarette factories because they turn over large amounts 
of taxes and profits. He said that the smuggling of imported 
cigarettes decreased last year, as people had regained 
confidence in Chinese brands. [Summary] [Hong Kong WEN WEI PO

Shenzhen Handles Corruption Cases 
  Mayor Li Youwei yesterday disclosed that among Shenzhen 
government officials who have absconded with public funds, more 
than 40 are still at large. In 1993, 21 people who escaped with 
money to places outside the border were brought back. This 
batch, plus those who have been brought back over the past 
several years, pushed the number to more than 40, half of them 
escaping with money. Some of them were brought back from the 
countries that have no diplomatic relations with China. He 
estimated that all the escapees had traveled through Hong Kong. 
He said that the 1994 budget for the police, judiciary, and 
procuratorate is 208 million yuan -- a 32.5 percent increase 
over 1993 -- and this sum does not include wages and equipment 
fees for the personnel in these departments. [Summary] [Hong

Criminal Arrested for Stock Transactions Using Stolen Codes 
  On 22 March, a stock organization in Guangzhou used a newly 
designed alarm program to solve a case of using high technology 
to steal secret codes in order to steal and sell stocks. The 
case occurred on 14 March in the Guangzhou Stock Business 
Department of the Shenzhen International Credit, Trust, and 
Investment Corporation. When a stock trader made phone call 
entrusting the department with a transaction in Shenzhen stocks, 
he discovered that his secret trading code had been changed and 
that someone had bought on his behalf 10 lots of "Shenbaoheng" 
at 10.9 yuan per share and sold them later at 10.85 yuan per 
share. Within a dozen days or so, eight similar cases occurred. 
The department installed a monitoring and alarm system for the 
buying and selling of stocks by phone, and carried out overall 
monitoring of various internal business links. On 22 March, the 
criminal entered the trading hall to commit crimes, and the 
monitoring and control system at once accurately indicated his 
location. He was arrested at the telephone and has admitted all 
his crimes. However, whether the criminal committed the crimes 
alone or with others remains to be investigated. [Summary]

  Province-Wide Crackdown on Vehicle Theft 
  Between January and February, 263 motor vehicles were stolen 
or hijacked in Shenzhen, representing a 11.4 percent increase 
over the same period last year. According to Shenzhen's public 
security authorities, 92 percent of the hijackings occurred on 
remote roads on the outskirts, while 86 percent of the thefts 
occurred in the vicinity of residential areas, hotels, and 
restaurants. It is said that criminal syndicates hire thieves

  Shenzhen police recently set up a special operational group 
and office to combat car theft. This morning, a large-scale 
operation was launched to hunt down car thieves after statistics 
-- 105 vehicles and 150 motorcycles stolen in the first two 
months of the year -- showed that car theft has become a major 
problem for the city. According to concerned officials, during 
the operation, first they will issue notices urging citizens to 
report crime, set a deadline for criminals to surrender 
themselves, and ban illegal car transactions and changing car 
colors or license plate numbers. Investigations then will be 
stepped up, leading to the arrest of identified gangs that 
steal, ship and sell stolen cars. Roadblocks will be set up in 
Baoan and Longgang Districts on nine highways leading to Huizhou 
and Dongguan Counties, and 600 officers from the police and 
armed police corps -- including PLA soldiers -- will be deployed 
to mount a 24-hour guard in interception operations. The city 
also will launch a full cleanup of the auto trade and repair 
industry. Auto maintenance plants that refit and handle stolen 
cars must be shut down to await rectification, and some with 
serious involvement may see their licenses revoked. 
Unauthorized remodeling of car engines and changing of license 
plates also will become punishable by law. [Excerpts] [Hong

  Guangxi 
Two-Year Antismuggling Campaign Yields Results 
  Following an intense two-year effort, the Guangxi 
antismuggling force has gained control of smuggling activities 
once rampant along the coast. Antismuggling force officers said 
they had solved 236 smuggling cases involving 540 million yuan, 
and had seized 1,369 cars, 1,874 motorbikes, and 8,121 
television sets. The recent smuggling activities display three 
characteristics: 1) They concentrated in economically open 
areas like Beihai, Qinzhou, Dongxing, and Fangchenggang, with 
cars and electric machinery as the main items; 2) Drug and gun 
smuggling occur mostly in border areas, exploiting the 
complicated terrain there; 3) Smuggling is run by individuals. 
Guangxi has adopted the tactic of "making arrests at sea, 
intercepting on the coast, carrying out inspections on land, and 
tightening up controls over markets." Last year, Beihai Customs 
solved 47 smuggling cases involving 180 million yuan, seizing 
350 cars, 8,600 air conditioners, 4,523 color televisions, and 
5,992 compressors. A particularly serious car smuggling case 
that was solved in Qinzhou straddled four provinces, three 
regions, and one city, and involved some $11.2 million.

Large Number of Abducted Women, Children Rescued 
  Miss Liu, 18, has left her 57-year-old "husband" and 
returned to her native place in Jingxi County, thanks to rescue 
efforts by the police. One year ago, she was sold by human 
traffickers to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is 
thousands of kilometers from her hometown. A person in charge 
of the Guangxi Office for Cracking Down on the Abduction and 
Sale of Women and Children said that Guangxi is one of the 
country's major disaster areas for the abduction and sale of 
women and children, and that according to statistics, the number 
of women and children abducted and sold in Guangxi ranks second 
in the country, just after Sichuan. In order to crack down on 
the abduction and sale of women and children, Guangxi's public 
security organs have adopted many measures simultaneously, and 
have tried their best to rescue abducted and sold women. 
According to reports, since 1991, public security personnel 
have rescued thousands of women and children every year. From 
August to September 1993, Guangxi carried out a special campaign 
to crack down on the abduction and sale of women and children, 
and the whole autonomous region transferred more than 60 public 
security personnel from nine cities and prefectures, organized 
them into six work teams, and sent them to Hebei, Shandong, 
Anhui, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, to verify 
and rescue women and children who had been abducted and sold. 
During the campaign, 84 women and children were rescued. In 
1993, Guangxi cracked more than 1,740 cases of abduction and 
sale of people, detected 1,928 human traffickers, crushed 292 
criminal gangs, and rescued 997 women and 72 children. At the 
same time, Guangxi's public security organs and women's 
federation launched extensive propaganda throughout the region 
against the abduction and sale of women and children, and also 
strengthened education for women, so as to achieve the effect of 
prevention and rectification by the masses. [Text] [Hong Kong

important cases of economic crime, such as graft and bribery. 
In the first two months of the year, a total of 211 major and 
important cases were investigated and handled, accounting for

management sector, with a total of 273 cases involving these 
sectors handled in the first two months this year. Parties 
involved in these cases included eight cadres at or above the 
county and office level. 2) There are imbalances between 
different areas in terms of the processing of cases. For 
instance, in less than a month and a half, from 28 January to 4 
March, the procuratorial body of Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, 
a remote impoverished area in the west, solved five cases of

10 hours. Since the Yinchuan Public Security Bureau started to 
conduct activities to "ferret out criminal gangs and crack down 
on roving bandits" in December last year, it has wiped out more 
than 30 robbery or roving criminal gangs, and has recovered 
stolen money and property amounting to more than 700,000 yuan. 
In February this year, the Xiji County Public Security Bureau 
arrested a criminal involved in a serious ambush case. The 
bureau also succeeded in arresting 11 other robbers and thieves 
and solving more than 40 other cases. In January, the 
Shizuishan Mining Bureau cooperated with the public security 
organs to arrest a thief. This led to the solving of nine 
criminal cases. From December last year to the end of February 
this year, public security organs throughout the region solved a 
total of 1,082 criminal cases of various kinds, of which 291 
were major cases, and seized stolen money and property amounting 
to 1.749 million yuan. Various localities also have conducted 
different forms of special struggle in light of conspicuous 
problems in social order. People complained about bicycle 
thefts, so Yinchuan organized a 100-day special struggle against 
the stealing of bicycles. As a result, 1,217 bicycles were 
retrieved and most were returned to their owners. Yinnan and 
Guyuan Prefectures focused efforts on activities to crack down 
on encroachments upon the interests of peasants. Since January 
this year, the public security organs have retrieved returned to 
the collective or peasants 500,000 yuan's worth of property and 
livestock for agricultural production. At present, the Ningxia 
Regional Public Security Department has made arrangements for 
conducting a region-wide "spring struggle" to continue to 
sternly crack down on various kinds of crimes, and to organize 
the police forces to strengthen control over social order and 
precautions against crimes. It wants to provide a good social 
environment for the opening of the meetings of the region's 
people's congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. [Summary] [Yinchuan NINGXIA RIBAO in Chinese 31 Mar

Qinghai 
Major Drug-Trafficking Case Cracked 
  Recently, the Qinghai public security organ cracked a major 
drug- trafficking case, in which 6,220 grams of heroin were 
seized. It was the most serious case in the province ever. The 
culprits, Chen Ziyong and You Yutai, two peasants from 
Zhejiang, were apprehended according to the law. [Text]

Anticorruption Campaign Successful 
  Qinghai Province has scored initial success in fighting 
corruption, as more than 94 percent of cadres at and above the 
county level have undergone self-examination and 
self-correction. A number of cases of violation of law and 
discipline have been investigated and handled, and new progress 
has been made in the operation to rectify unhealthy tendencies 
in different trades. An anticorruption campaign was launched in 
last August. By the end of last year, most leading bodies at 
and above the county level throughout the province had called 
self-examination and self- correction meetings for cadres. To 
cope with the issues exposed, party and government organs at all 
levels have formulated and revised regulations to promote 
honesty and clean government. Meanwhile, discipline inspection 
and supervisory organs at all levels have intensified the system 
for processing letters of complaint and handling visits from 
complainants. The numbers of letters and of visits received 
have been increasing remarkably since last August. The 
provincial discipline inspection commission and supervisory 
department alone processed more than 1,000 complaints lodged by 
letter or visit from September last year to February this year. 
Last year, discipline inspection and supervisory organs 
throughout the province placed on file and processed a total of 
559 cases of violations of law or discipline, and disciplinary 
actions were taken by the party and the government against more 
than 200 offenders. Cases involving criminal violations have 
been transferred to judicial organs for further processing. So 
far in the province, more than 1,000 service charge items have 
been sorted out and reviewed, of which 206 classified as 
arbitrary and unreasonable have been sorted out and revised. 
Most localities and government departments now are studying to 
learn methods of disconnecting the managerial relations of 
economic entities from their related party and government 
organs. [Summary] [Xining Qinghai People's Radio Network in 
Mandarin 2300 GMT 5 Apr 94] 
Shaanxi 
14 Major Corruption Cases Solved 
  Courts in Shaanxi recently cracked 14 corruption cases 
involving 27 state workers. This was announced by a provincial 
court chief. Of the 27 criminals, three were sentenced to death 
for embezzling public funds, three to life imprisonment, and the 
remaining 16 to three to 15 years' imprisonment. [Summary]

Shanghai 
Success in Uncovering Tax Evasion 
  In the first three months of this year, following the 
adoption of the new taxation system, Shanghai's taxation 
department followed the clues in 208 tax evasion cases, solving 
104 of them, in which the taxes evaded amounted to more than 6.9 
million yuan. There were 17 serious cases in which the amount 
of taxes evaded exceeded 100,000 yuan, while cases involving 
legal persons numbered eight. [Summary] [Hong Kong ZHONGGUO

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Feminism is this 
year's hot topic for foreign students in Beijing as the World 
Conference on Women is due to be held in the city in 1995. 
  The Beijing Language Institute held a campus debate between 
two teams of Chinese and foreign students, respectively, 
recently, exploring the topic "equality between the sexes, 
forever impossible?" The debate drew an audience of over 100 
foreign students studying in Beijing. 
  The six-strong team of foreign students from the Beijing 
Language Institute proved a tough rival for their Chinese 
counterparts, both in the Chinese language and arguments, the 
judges from the institute said. 
  Taking the position that men and women can never be equal, 
the foreign team said that physical conditions, social customs 
and division of labor will not allow real equality between the 
sexes. But the Chinese team argued that as a half of the 
society, women can and must play an equal role to men's. 
  The debate ended with an even score. Two Chinese and two 
foreign students won prizes for "best debater". 
  The students said that they realized there is really a gap 
between the rival opinions, and they learned a lot about how 
different the situations in specific countries are. 
  It was the first campus debate between Chinese and foreign 
students ever held by the institute, which was the first college 
to take in foreign students for studying Chinese on the 
mainland. It is the seventh consecutive year that it has 
sponsored debates in the Chinese language for foreign students.

  [Text] Hefei, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province, a major 
farming area in China, has mapped out a series of new policies 
to promote agricultural development and increase farmers' 
incomes. 
  Addressing the annual session of the provincial people's 
congress, Anhui Governor Fu Xishou said recently that the 
province will continue to pay close attention to agricultural 
production. 
  Fu said that the original land contracting system will be 
further improved in line with specific conditions in Anhui. 
Farmers can extend leases for another 30 years after their 
contracts expire. 
  Furthermore, the right to use farmland can be transferred, 
leased, used for mortgage or as shares of a company during the 
contracting period, he said. 
  Land leases can be extended for 50 to 70 years if farmers 
contract for wasteland and barren hills, he added. 
  Later this year, the provincial government will announce 
other flexible policies for the land contract system. 
  The development of agriculture in the province will focus on 
expanding acreage sown in high-yield and high-quality rice and 
other grains, a provincial government official said. 
  In 1994, the province plans to plant grain crops on six 
million hectares in order to harvest 25 million tons, matching 
1993 production. 
  Anhui's cotton output is expected to reach 300,000 tons in 
1994, about 40,000 tons more than last year. Its oilseed 
production is projected to match last year's 1.56 million tons. 
  To meet these targets, Anhui province will try to raise 
output in six existing grain and cotton production centers and 
eight new ones listed during the 1990-95 period, the official 
said. 
  Moreover, Anhui plans to choose 10 major counties, 20 
agricultural production bases and 50 villages to undertake a 
comprehensive agricultural development project, designed to 
expand a diverse economy in rural areas, the official said. 
  He said that provincial authorities will make sure that 1.14 
million tons of fertilizer and 7,650 tons of pesticide will be 
supplied to local farmers this year. 
  The provincial government has also decided to help three 
million poor rural residents solve food deficiencies over the 
next three years and to enable them to eliminate poverty within 
five years and lead a good life within eight years, he said.

  [Text] Fuzhou, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Jia 
Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian CPC Committee, today resigned 
his position as governor. 
  The Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress 
held a meeting this morning, accepting Jia Qinglin's resignation. 
  Jia Qinglin, 54, ssumed the offices of standing committee 
member and deputy secretary of the Fujian CPC Committee when he 
was transferred to Fujian in 1985. Replacing Wang Zhaoguo in 
November 1990, Jia took charge of the work of the Fujian 
Government and successively assumed the office of vice governor, 
acting governor, and then governor in April 1991. When party 
secretary Chen Guangyi was transferred to the post of Civil 
Aviation Administration of China chief at the end of last year, 
the CPC Central Committee appointed Jia Qinglin as party 
secretary. At the meeting of leading cadres held at that time, 
Jia urged his subordinates to "regard wholeheartedly serving the 
people as their fundamental purpose and working for the 
interests of the people as their motto." Local people say that 
Jia Qinglin is honest, kind, upright, and prudent. He sets 
strict demands on himself and enjoys a high reputation. 
  The Fujian People's Congress Standing Committee accepted 
Chen 
Guangyi's resignation from the office of chairman of the 
people's congress on 6 April. It has been reported that the 
Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress will hold 
a meeting on 16 April to elect a member and chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Fujian People's Government.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 13 (CNS) -- Vice Director of the 
Fujian Tourism Bureau Mr. Luo Jian said that the unfortunate 
accident at Qiandao Lake affected provincial tourism to a 
certain extent, but he believed that this would be temporary and 
that the development of tourism between Fujian and Taiwan would 
prove beneficial to both sides. 
  Mr. Luo Jian said that Fujian had rich tourism resources and 
was the main place of origin of Taiwan compatriots. Since 1987, 
more and more Taiwan compatriots had come to Fujian to visit 
their ancestral homes and resorts and to make religious and 
business trips. According to statistics, the province had 
received some 340,000 Taiwan compatriots last year, the most 
since the 90's had begun. 
  Mr. Luo said that the tourism departments in Fujian and 
Taiwan had coordinated with each other in giving services to 
Taiwan compatriots and in recent years such cooperation had not 
only boosted the development of Fujian tourism but also that of 
Taiwan. Artificial blocks stopping Taiwan compatriots from 
travelling to the Mainland would benefit neither side. 
  Fujian's tourism facilities had improved, with its present 
foreign-related 100 hotels, 50 of which were star-grade as well 
as 14,000 standard rooms and nearly 30,000 beds to basically 
meet the demands of overseas visitors. 
  Mr. Luo also said that the provincial tourism departments 
had 
been emphasizing travel safety and had enacted a set of 
management regulations. These departments conducted safety 
inspections of various tourism services every year and trained 
employees to guarantee safety measures. Even if an individual 
accident occurred, Mr. Luo, added, the departments would handle 
it with the utmost efficiency.

  [Excerpts] Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Mao 
Zhiyong visited Dongguan Township, Linchuan County, from 2 to 6 
April to conduct a survey. He stressed that the current 
situation is indeed excellent in rural areas and that the 
peasants have shown a greater initiative in promoting 
production, especially in growing grain. Party and government 
leaders at all levels must conscientiously implement the 
guideline laid down by the central meeting on rural work and 
work really hard to stabilize grain output and help the peasants 
increase their income. [passage omitted] 
  Local peasants told Mao Zhiyong: Now that the party central 
authorities attach importance to agriculture and have offered 
good policies, the grain price has been rising and thus farming 
promises good returns. Mao Zhiyong replied happily: 
Agricultural production is subject to very strict seasonal 
conditions. It is now time to start spring farming. You should 
never miss the right time for farming. I hope you will have a 
deeper understanding of the importance of agricultural 
production and rural work. In particular, you must pay great 
attention to grain production--it is necessary to keep the grain 
sowing area stable. At the same time, it is necessary to keep 
an eye on key measures for promoting production, with the focus 
placed on raising per-unit-area yield with a view to increasing 
the gross output. [passage omitted] 
  Mao Zhiyong noted: During the main grain growing period, we 
must not only ensure a steady increase in grain output but also 
make every effort to help the peasants increase their income so 
that they will become rich sooner. [passage omitted] 
  Mao Zhiyong pointed out: + In order to increase their income 
and become rich sooner, our peasants should promote a 
diversified economy, improve management, and expand production 
scale while developing grain production. [passage omitted] 
  Mao Zhiyong said: As far as the rural work is concerned, we 
have many tasks to perform but the most basic matter is to work 
in a down-to-earth manner to intensify grass-roots 
organizations. To do a good job in this aspect, we must focus 
our attention on building organizations at the village level 
with party branches as their core and on developing the economy 
at the village level, thus ensuring that all duties are 
undertaken by the right people and sufficient funds are 
allocated to run the businesses. 
  Mao Zhiyong said: At the moment the situation is excellent 
in rural areas. However, we still need to remain cool-headed, 
work in a down-to-earth manner, and further explore bright 
prospects. We have set out the key tasks and our leaders at all 
levels certainly need to further improve their work style, go 
down to the grass-roots level, publicize the policies among the 
peasants, adopt appropriate measures to help the peasants 
promote production, and solve the actual problems. [passage 
omitted] 
  After his stay in Dongguan Township, Mao Zhiyong also paid a 
visit to Suji Township, which has long been a cotton producing 
area. There he conducted a survey on this year's cotton 
production, publicized rural policies among the peasants, and 
encouraged the peasants to grow more cotton, do a better job, 
and fulfill this year's cotton output quota.

of Qingdao has achieved good economic results through boosting 
its marine industry. 
  Over the past few years the city has been establishing a 
marine industry that includes the development of bio-engineering 
and comprehensive use of aquatic resources. 
  Despite having two-thirds of the marine scientists and 
researchers in China, Qingdao did not start taking advantage of 
its research findings until recently. 
  To tap ocean resources, Qingdao drew up a ten-year 
development plan and formulated preferential policies regarding 
fund raising, loans and tax reductions some years ago. 
  The technology of artificial breeding and raising of prawns 
jointly developed by local research institutions and colleges 
has built up a business with an annual product value of more 
than three billion yuan. 
  Research has also been completed in the breeding and raising 
of abalones. 
  Medication extracted from marine substances have been made 
and have found a growing market. 
  Decay-prevention materials produced by a local chemistry 
institution have been applied to most of the marine-related 
industries nationwide.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai security authorities are suing a local 
journalist who wrote articles about the unsavoury ties between 
police and nightclubs with underworld links in the city. 
  In an attempt to silence the criticism, the police have 
directly contravened the instructions of the senior patriarch 
Deng Xiaoping, who offered his personal protection to the 
reporter. 
  The case could prove a watershed in determining which counts 
more: the law, or the personal instructions of a senior leader. 
  Xu Keren, who writes for the lively XINMIN EVENING NEWS 
[XINMIN WANBAO], was detained in January after the paper ran a 
series of articles revealing the links between the Shanghai 
Public Security Bureau (PSB) and the city's nightclubs, 
according to sources at the paper. 
  The articles showed that the PSB directly ran some 
nightclubs 
and colluded with owners to charge exorbitant fees, from which 
it received kickbacks. 
  Xu was released a day later after the ailing Deng, who was 
in 
town for the lunar new year, reacted against the interference, 
the sources said. 
  "We must protect the pen as well as the sword," Deng was 
reported to have said on hearing of the incident. The 
10-character statement, relayed through his daughter and 
unofficial press aide, Deng Rong, was enough to ensure that Xu 
was released from detention, the sources said. 
  After Deng left Shanghai in mid-February, the PSB filed a 
libel suit against Xu and the paper's editors alleging that the 
articles were "malicious" and "without foundation". 
  Court officials are understood to be gathering material and 
advice from party and government leaders in Shanghai on how to 
proceed. 
  "The case has not opened yet, so no one is willing to 
discuss 
it right now," a source said last night. 
  "The police believe that they can achieve through legal 
means 
what senior leaders stopped them from doing through harassment." 
  Xu's home phone has been bugged and he is under constant 
surveillance from plainclothes policemen. 
  His passport, revoked in February as he tried to board a 
plane for Japan where his wife lives, has not been returned. 
  "Xu's situation remains precarious, but all staff on the 
paper as well as some central leaders are behind him," one 
source said. 
  XINMIN EVENING NEWS is one of only nine government-run 
papers 
nationwide whose circulation increased last year. 
  The paper had already had one confrontation with the local 
PSB at the time of Deng's visit, when it was barred from 
reporting on the beating to death of an innocent bus driver on 
January 1 by nightclub guards who were believed to be off-duty 
PSB officers. 
  The real nature of the so called "1-1" incident is still 
murky, but there are rumours that the VIPs inside the nightclub 
(whose parked limousines had blocked the road, precipitating the 
incident) were part of Deng's entourage, some of whom had 
arrived in Shanghai in early December. 
  Among Chinese liberals, the Shanghai PSB has the worst 
reputation for intimidation and harassment in the whole of China. 
  The recent round-up of dissidents in China during visits by 
leaders from the United States, Japan and France was said to 
have been carried out most efficiently in Shanghai, where 
surveillance may be even stricter than in the capital. 
  The Shanghai PSB's business empire, part of which was the 
subject of Xu's reports, has run rampant since the mid-eighties 
and is said to include nightclubs and other service businesses.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province plans to restrict its urban unemployment rate at below 
three percent this year by relying on market forces, according 
to an official of the provincial labor department. 
  He said that the provincial government plans to introduce a 
competitive labor market system province-wide over the next five 
years to pave the way for the creation of a market economy. 
  Now, more people have found jobs on various type of labor 
markets, in a change from getting job assignments from the 
government, he said. 
  Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in China, 
currently 
has 70 labor markets, 500 job placement agencies, and 7,000 
labor service enterprises and workers' training centers. 
  In 1993 700,000 urban residents in Zhejiang found jobs 
through labor markets and nearly 60,000 residents were employed 
following vocational training, he said. 
  As a result, the urban unemployment rate went down to 2.6 
percent, he added. 
  The provincial authorities have decided to open a number of 
major labor markets in urban areas, and job-placement agencies 
in all counties and cities this year, he said. 
  In 1994 Zhejiang will also improve the social insurance 
system consisting primarily of old-age pensions and unemployment 
insurance, he said. 
  The premium will be shared by the state, the collectives and 
individuals, according to local officials. 
  Specifically, the mutual pension insurance system will be 
introduced in half of prefectures and cities, while unemployment 
insurance will be extended to all urban workers, he said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Xie Fei, secretary 
of the Guangdong provincial party committee, said on Wednesday 
[13 April] that his province anticipates more investment from 
Japanese entrepreneurs. 
  In his meeting with a Japanese economic delegation, he said 
that the investment conditions in Guangdong have been greatly 
improved and the market enlarged. "Guangdong looks forward to 
expanding economic and technological cooperation with Japanese 
counterparts," the secretary said, adding that the prospect for 
future cooperation is bright. 
  The top party official of the province noted that since 
China 
adopted the policies of reform and opening up, Guangdong's gross 
domestic product (GDP) has increased by 13 percent annually over 
the past 15 years, with the GDP in 1993 up 21 percent over 1992. 
  Guangdong now has three special economic zones, four 
state-approved economic development zones, six new- and 
high-technology development districts and four free trade zones. 
  There are eight airports and a dozen express highways, 
including those under construction, in the province. 
  Xie Fei said that in 1992, foreign investment in Guangdong 
amounted to 4.8 billion U.S. dollars, and in 1993, investment 
was 9.6 billion U.S. dollars. The two years' total is almost 
equal to that in the previous 13 years. 
  More overseas investment would help tackle Guangdong's newly 
emerged problems in its efforts to link up the local economy 
with the world's, Xie said, noting that overseas management 
experience and skills are also needed.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- More bananas, 
litchis, longan and mangoes were grown in Guangdong last year 
than in any other Chinese province -- and for the previous five 
years, too. 
  That little-known fact is part of the outcome of the 
province's farmers turning to produce for which there is strong 
market demand. 
  They have been doing that for the past 14 years, and now the 
market-oriented agriculture in south China's Guangdong Province 
has attained full development. The agricultural structure has 
been greatly rationalized. 
  Last year, agricultural output of Guangdong topped 88.6 
billion yuan (about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars at the 1993 
exchange rate), with a growth of 3.5 percent over the previous 
year. Average income of local farmers has also increased by a 
large margin. 
  Through the export of agricultural products, Guangdong 
earned 
2.1 billion U.S. dollars last year. 
  The province has taken a lead in doing away with unified 
purchase and sale of agriculture products and has lifted price 
controls on all the main products, encouraging farmers to adjust 
their activities to market demands. 
  To increase farming profits, the sown area of improved 
varieties of rice and cash crops has been greatly expanded. 
  Highly efficient and profitable agricultural sectors 
including breeding of aquatic products, animal husbandry and 
forestry have developed into pillars of the rural economy, 
together with farming. 
  Output value of aquatic products in 1993 accounted for 
one-fourth of the province's total produced by agriculture. 
Deep-sea fishing has also boomed, with the number of pelagic 
fishing boats in operation making up a third of China's total. 
  Guangdong's output of meat last year reached 2.6 million 
tons, holding the country's third position, and turning the 
province into a large producer of meat from having been a large 
consumer. 
  Five thousand large, intensive and highly modernized 
production centers for fruit, flowers and vegetables have 
mushroomed all over the province, creating tremendous profits 
for it. 
  Improved processing abilities of various agricultural 
products and the establishment of multi-layered retail and 
wholesale markets have also played an important role in boosting 
local agriculture.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 14 (CNS) -- Director of the State 
Bureau of Secrecy, Mr. Shen Hongying, yesterday attended a work 
meeting in Shenzhen on state secrets. He said that the special 
economic development zones needed to highly emphasize and 
strengthen their secrecy work. 
  The meeting summarized Shenzhen's present secrecy work, 
indicating that the frequent foreign economic exchange of the 
city, which is in the front line of China's reform and opening 
to the outside world, has led to arduous and complicated secrecy 
needs. Such work showed there was increasing urgency and 
importance in its implementation. 
  The meeting stressed that the various departments should 
adopt measures to strengthen and improve their secrecy work and 
its inspection, paying attention to such work in key regions and 
departments and in the training of security personnel.

3556): "`Vagabond Reporters' Swarm Into Guangzhou"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A 
27-year-old graduate from the Chinese Language Department of 
Beijing University named Xiao Cao not long ago suddenly made the 
strange decision to resign from public office. He went to 
Guangzhou from Hunan and joined the expanding ranks of "vagabond 
[liu lang 3177 3186] reporters." 
  He is working as a reporter for a newspaper that can be 
distributed only in the province. During the day, he is busy 
going to streets and lanes, and in and out of government 
institutions, to earn a floating salary several times higher 
than that in the hinterland. At night, he sleeps in an office 
on two desks joined together. 
  In comparison with regular reporters in Guangzhou, he has no 
residency or house, does not enjoy free medical service or other 
benefits, and is apt to lose his job at any time. 
  For all these reasons, "vagabond reporters" have no fear in 
competing with regular reporters. They grab "real news" 
whenever and wherever they can, showing their talents in press 
circles. Guangdong newspapers now ranked third in the country. 
Guangdong has more than 120 kinds of newspapers distributed 
throughout the country and some 280 kinds of "restricted 
publications" distributed only in the province. New newspapers 
keeping appearing at sidewalk newsstands. 
  As there are many "restricted publications," there are many 
restrictions on distribution and advertisements, and as funds 
also are limited, these publishing houses are willing to recruit 
"vagabond reporters" who do not have many burdens. As a matter 
of fact, openly distributed newspapers also like to employ 
"vagabond reporters" to make up the shortage of local reporters. 
After the influential XIANDAIREN BAO [Modern People Journal] 
switched to a daily newspaper, it said that it would select 
reporters mostly from among the "vagabond reporters." 
  Generally speaking, the salaries of "vagabond reporters" are 
much higher than those of regular reporters. The "vagabond 
reporters" employed by XIANDAIREN BAO generally earn more than 
2,000 yuan a month, and some may earn 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a 
month. Regular reporters envy them very much. 
  Many "vagabond reporters" live an army-like life. DONGFANG 
YEBAO [Oriental Evening News] provides its "vagabond reporters" 
with a dormitory, bicycles, pagers, and food. 
  However, "vagabond reporters" are sometimes worried about 
their future and feel they are living under others' roofs. 
  Initial statistics show that there are now about 100 
"vagabond reporters" in Guangzhou. Yang Yikai, director of the 
Publication Management Section of the Guangdong Provincial News 
and Publication Bureau, told this reporter that "their capacity 
should not be underestimated." 
  The presence of a large number of "vagabond reporters" 
supports the emergence of new newspapers. Director Yang pointed 
out: At a time when there is a large variety of readers, 
advertisements, and contingents, the appearance of "vagabond 
reporters" and the emergence new newspapers will bring about 
prosperity in the press industry and the competition will force 
old newspapers to improve their quality.

<F P=106> [By Huang Yiming: "Hainan Province Grows Up Quickly"] </F>
  [Text] The economy of Hainan, China's youngest province, 
has been developing at high speed and its investment environment 
has improved remarkably, Governor Ruan Chongwu told CHINA DAILY. 
  The situation was the result of years of work, he said, 
which 
had laid strong economic foundations for the province. 
  The island's gross product is expected to rise 18 percent 
this year to 27 billion yuan ($3.1 billion). Output from 
manufacturing industry is forecast to go up 30 percent to 13.03 
billion yuan ($1.494 billion) and output from agriculture is 
expected to rise 10 percent to 9.74 billion yuan ($1.12 billion). 
  At the same time local revenue is expected to be 3.35 
billion 
yuan ($0.38 billion), an increase of 18.4 percent, Ruan said. 
  The province is set to improve the preferential policies it 
uses to attract more foreign investment, he added, and it will 
work hard to adjust its economic structure to improve returns. 
  The 34,000 square kilometre island is China's second largest 
behind Taiwan. It is also the largest of the country's five 
special economic zones, though it is the smallest province. 
  The island's position in the South China Sea places it at 
the 
centre of the Asia Pacific region and makes it a convenient 
staging post for trade between China and Southeast Asia. 
  But it has managed to avoid the industrial pollution which 
afflicts many of China's developing provinces. Indeed, plants 
flourish in this natural greenhouse. 
  The island government has had more autonomy than most other 
regions since the Chinese government made it both a province and 
special economic zone in April, 1988 . 
  It was given clearance to use preferential policies in its 
development of State Land resources, appraisal and approval of 
basic construction projects, control of foreign currency, 
finance, tax and the management of people into and out of the 
province. 
  These have helped maintain the vigour and vitality of the 
province. 
  Six years ago, the place's industry and agriculture were 
both 
rather backward. 
  But it worked hard to make use of its natural advantages and 
so its economy began to develop rapidly. This process has been 
helped particularly by the practical policies brought in by the 
provincial government, which stressed efficiency and the 
creation of a solid foundation for economic development. 
  The island's electricity capacity is now 800,000 kwh, twice 
the figure in 1987, providing electricity of 2 billion kilowatts 
a year. 
  Hainan has built 17 ports and 59 berths with an annual 
handling capacity of 11 million tons linked to 15 domestic 
shipping lines and connecting with 24 countries and regions. It 
has also established the Hainan Ocean Transport Company, with 
five 10,000-ton ships. 
  The island has 14,000 kilometers of road -- more for its 
size 
than anywhere else in China -- and an expressway is being built 
from east to west across the island. 
  Thirty-three air routes come out of Haikou and Sanya 
airports 
connecting all major domestic cities plus Bangkok and Singapore. 
  Telecommunications are near perfect as 100,000-phone lines 
connect it with China and more than 210 countries and regions. 
  Along with the improvement in the investment environment, 
more and more foreign investors have come to the special zone. 
  Last year, the province attracted $730 million from abroad, 
61.5 percent more than in 1992. Moreover, $238 million in 
foreign loans and $80 million in debt issues was used to build 
up the province's infrastructure. 
  The foreign exchange income from tourism last year was $113 
million, 11.8 percent higher than 1992. 
  All these efforts indicate Hainan is becoming more open and 
has the necessary conditions for large-scale development. 
  In order to establish more perfect socialist market economy 
and to keep it growing "Hainan will positively promote reforms 
in all fields," said Ruan. 
  "The emphasis of reform is to put the company system into 
practice in State-run enterprises. Moreover, we will work to 
reform the tax management system, administration, the housing 
system and so on. 
  "The purpose of what we do is to create a perfect 
environment 
for all tourists and investors from home and overseas."

<F P=106> [By reporter Cui Weiwei (1508 1550 1550): "The Province </F>
Achieves Remarkable Results in Building Highway Networks"] 
  [Excerpt] After three years of construction, Liaoning 
Province has achieved obvious results in building highway 
networks. The 3,254 projects concerning highway networks 
planned by the province for the past three years have all been 
completed, 6,020 km of road surface has been asphalted, 2,296 
bridges have been extended by 64,056 meters, and 4,643 km of 
roadbeds have been rebuilt. Meanwhile, all province-renowned 
mountains, such as Fengchengqujia, Daling, and Xiuyanbeidaling, 
that blocked the traffic for a long time in the past, have all 
been got through. The province has also put an end to the 
history of there being no bridges on 898 rivers. Construction of 
the main highway framework has been under way in an all-around 
manner. Construction of the Shenyang-Benxi, the 
Shenyang-Tieling, the Shenyang Around-the-city expressways will 
be completed and open to traffic by 1 October 1995. The 
pre-phase work for the construction of Shenyang-Shanhaiguan 
Expressway is under full swing. 
  As demanded by the provincial road traffic situation and by 
the economic layout, the province defined the strategic goal of 
building highway networks beginning 1991. It is also decided 
that at the late stage of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, the 
province will complete the building of the Shenyang-Dalian, the 
Shenyang-Siping, the Shenyang-Dandong, and the 
Shenyang-Shanhaiguan high-class highways as well as the Shenyang 
Orbital Expressway and the Shenyang coastal high-class highway. 
Meanwhile, on the basis of initially erecting the main highway 
framework that links up various cities with high-class highways, 
the province will comprehensively build highways in various 
counties and townships. All counties and townships will be 
linked up with asphalted highways to form a network and then 
cars will be able to directly drive from counties and townships 
to expressways. Thanks to the construction in the first three 
years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the provincial 
highway network has become perfect day by day, and the general 
quality of the network has improved remarkably. Comparing the 
end of 1993 to the late stage of the Seventh Five-Year Plan 
period, the total mileage of highways increased by 1,529 km, 
high-class and less-high-class pavement increased by 5,210 km, 
bridges extended by 70,000 meters, the highway density rose from 
27.5 km for per 100 square km to 28.54 km, and the mileage 
available for trafficking despite rainfalls increased from 
29,690 km to 34,317 km. Among the 43 land counties, the counties 
linked up with others through asphalted highways rose from 6 to 
9. Meanwhile, the townships and towns accessible by the 
oil-transporting roads increased from 662 to 844, and the 
villages accessible by highways increased from 14,620 to 14,909 
in number. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gansu provincial party committee secretary Yan 
Haiwang addressed a provincial forum on family planning 
yesterday, stressing that it is necessary to view family 
planning as a matter concerning the implementation of social and 
economic strategy. We must not waver, but be determined and not 
slack off in our work, and we must make sure that the set target 
for population control is fulfilled, he said. 
  This forum, called by the provincial party committee and 
government during a break amid the provincial people's congress 
session, is for the purpose of urging local authorities to take 
effective measures to do a good, solid job in family planning 
work while concentrating on economic construction. During the 
forum, the provincial party committee and government commended 
and presented awards to the 14 prefectures, autonomous 
prefectures, and cities that comprehensively fulfilled last 
year's population control plan. A written pledge on management 
by objective regarding population control for the year 1994 was 
signed by the 14 prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities. 
  After the signing ceremony, acting Governor Zhang Wule 
addressed the forum, urging all localities to make family 
planning work more scientific. To this end they need to focus 
attention on five tasks: First, it is necessary to improve the 
family planning operational mechanism on a scientific management 
basis. Second, it is necessary to intensify working organs at 
the township and village levels. In the process of opening up 
and reform, family planning organizations must not be abolished 
or merged, neither must the size of staff be reduced. Third, it 
is necessary to launch a drive in a planned way to select a few 
six-good [liu hao] villages. Fourth, it is necessary to 
comprehensively implement procedures for performance of family 
planning management contracts and rigidly to curb the practice 
of bearing extra children in violation of discipline. And 
fifth, it is necessary to continue to invest more to increase 
the reward for family planning executive personnel, and properly 
solve the issue of remuneration for and recruitment of family 
planning executive personnel in rural areas. 
  Having reviewed the situation in population in our province, 
provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang said: Each 
year our province sees a net population increase of 300,000 or 
more, equivalent to the population of a medium-sized county. 
However, our province's arable land is decreasing by the area 
of a medium-sized county each year. The gap derived from this 
increase and decrease makes the contrast still sharper between 
excessive population and scarce land. Therefore we must always 
treat family planning as one of the tasks of top priority and 
devote great efforts to it. 
  Provincial leaders also present at yesterday's forum were 
Sun 
Ying, Li Zuling, Song Zhaolong, Pu Junhe, Chen Qiling, Ying 
Zhongyi, and Lao Chongzhi. Some comrades from the provincial 
family planning sector attended the forum.

  [Text] Urumqi, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China has made much 
headway in the prospecting and development of oil and natural 
gas in its three major basins in northwest China. 
  Up to now a total of 34 oil-gas fields have been found with 
a 
proved oil-bearing area of over 1,200 square kilometers in the 
three basins of Junggar, Tarim and Turpan. 
  Scattered in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region, the basins cover a total area of 740,000 square 
kilometers. 
  Scientists from home and other countries have proved that 
the 
basins have good generative conditions for oil and natural gas. 
  They predicted that reserves in the basins hold billions of 
tons of oil, about one-fourth of the total onshore oil resources 
in China. 
  In the early 1980s, China began its efforts to find new oil 
resources in the western part of the country as part of the 
country's oil development strategy. 
  Since then, a large-scale oil prospecting and exploration 
campaign involving big investment has started on the Gobi Desert 
of Xinjiang. 
  Local petroleum scientists said that oil prospecting and 
development there has entered a very active and fruitful period. 
  Some nine new oil and natural gas fields have been 
discovered 
in the 130,000-square-kilometer Junggar Basin in northern 
Xinjiang in the past ten years, including Xiazijie, Huoshaoshan, 
Beisantai, Cainan, Shixi and Mahu. 
  In the Tarim Basin, which is 560,000 square kilometers in 
area, nine oil-gas fields have been found in the last five years. 
  Six new oil-gas fields have been discovered in the Turpan 
Basin, though prospecting and exploration started only three 
years ago. 
  Now 18 oil-gas fields have been built or are under 
construction in the three basins. They have had a production 
capacity of 11.79 million tons of crude oil annually. 
  Petroleum geologists have made surveys of deep geological 
structures of the three basins and discovered 75 large 
oil-bearing structures. And beginning this year there will be a 
"peak stage" when more oil-gas reserver will be found in the 
three basins. 
  Now there are over 50,000 oil workers and over 100 drilling 
and geological teams working in the basins. The prospecting is 
expanding and wells are being sunk deeper, from 3,000 meters to 
more than 6,000 meters.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the </F>
Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, at the provincial propaganda, 
organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work 
conference on 31 March] 
  [Text] 1. The departments under party committees should 
work in line with the requirements for the development of the 
situation and upgrade their awareness of being submitted to and 
serving the work of the party as a whole. 
  Of all the fronts and departments under the leadership of 
the 
party, propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and 
united front work departments occupy extremely important 
positions. Since the implementation of the important talks made 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection of south China in 
1992 and the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the 
propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united 
front work departments under the provincial party committee have 
done a lot of work and made good achievements in comprehensively 
implementing the basic line of the party and accelerating the 
pace of reform, opening up, and modernization. There is an 
extremely important experience. That is, so long as the 
departments suit the changes of the situation and are submitted 
to and serve the general task of the party will they be able to 
ceaselessly enhance vitality, upgrade their work quality, and 
make contributions. This has become a basic principle to 
arrange the work of all fronts and all departments. 
  According to the current international and domestic 
situations, the party Central Committee defined the overall work 
situation as follows: Grasp favorable opportunities, deepen 
reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and 
maintain stability. Being submitted to, serving, and realizing 
this overall situation is high above everything and more 
important than any other things. The work in all aspects of the 
province, including the propaganda, organizational, discipline 
inspection, and united front work, should unconditionally, 
highly, and consciously be submitted to and serve the overall 
situation of the whole party. Thus, we should strive to make 
contributions to promoting and realizing this overall situation. 
  The key to realizing the overall situation of the party is 
to 
well handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. In the aspect of economic restructuring, our country 
has entered a new stage of linking package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas. A series of major reforms as 
defined by the central authorities this year can be regarded as 
a battle to tackle the most difficult problems. The reforms 
that should be carried out this year touch on the readjustment 
of the deep-layered contradictions, the interest pattern, and 
the interest relations. So, it is considerably difficult to 
carry out the reforms. If we dare not tackle or tide over these 
difficulties, we will lose historical favorable opportunities. 
Under such circumstances, it will be difficult to maintain the 
current sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national 
economy and the stagnation of reform will possibly bring about a 
strained circumstance characterized by slow economic growth rate 
and high inflation. There are great difficulties in reform. If 
we do not carry out reform, the difficulties will be more 
serious. We should rely on deepening reform in order to make 
development. Only when we unswervingly deepen reform will we be 
able to extricate ourselves from the strained circumstances and 
to create new productive forces. Development is our fundamental 
purpose. Only through development, will we be able to make the 
country strong and the people rich. Therefore, development is 
always an essential criterion. By no means does development 
have no contradictions. The failure to regulate and control the 
macroeconomy or to enliven the microeconomy will affect not only 
the sustained and sound development of the economy but also 
social stability. There are many contradictions in development. 
But, the contradictions are even more serious if we do not make 
development. Fundamentally speaking, so long as we conduct 
reform we will be able to maintain stability and ensure a 
long-term order and stability of the country. However, the 
difficulties in reform and the contradictions cropping up 
through development will add new unstable factors. Therefore, 
we must pay full attention to maintaining stability, do a good 
job in maintaining stability and eliminate all unstable factors 
in the bud. Otherwise, nothing will be accomplished. In short, 
reform, development, and stability are related to and promote 
one another. We must organically combine reform with 
development and stability, persistently promote development with 
reform, promote stability with reform and development, and use 
stability to ensure the smooth progress of reform and 
development. 
  The key to enable departments to submit consciously to 
their work and to serve the overall situation of the whole 
party's work is to cultivate a strong sense of the overall 
situation and a firm concept of entirety, rationalize their 
relationship with the overall situation and entirety from the 
high plane of implementing the party's basic line on one central 
task and two basic points, be good at accurately finding out 
their own positions in the overall situation, actively and 
appropriately give play to their own role in line with their own 
functions, and make due contributions to realizing the overall 
situation of the whole party's work. It is hoped that all 
departments of the party committees at all levels across the 
province will enhance common understanding, work together with 
one heart in times of difficulty, and raise the work of various 
departments to a new height in the course of caring for, 
supporting, and participating in deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
  2. We should further implement the task of using the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the 
whole party by organizing the people to study focusing on Volume 
No. 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." 
  Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party is one of 
the most important and fundamental ideologies of the whole party 
and an important ideological guarantee for realizing the overall 
situation of the whole party's work this year. Since the 14th 
party congress, particularly after the publication of Volume 
no.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the issuance 
of the central decision on study, party and government top 
leaders at all levels have taken the lead in the study, 
personally attended to it, and created a study upsurge in the 
whole province. The present issue is that we must 
conscientiously study how to deeply and continuously carry out 
this study, realistically regard the study of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as one of the fundamental tasks of party 
committees at all levels and of all departments, and study it 
well. It is necessary to continuously integrate the study of 
Volume No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" with the 
study and implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and at the same time, 
study new skills and have a good command of new knowledge. The 
study tasks in face of our cadres at all levels are very 
arduous. Without study, one cannot become a powerful leader 
with a sober mind, and cannot successfully carry out reform and 
development under the market economic conditions. Without 
study, one will become backward and be eliminated during the 
rapidly developed era. 
  To successfully carry out study on Volume No.3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "decision" of the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the 
socialist market economic knowledge among cadres at all levels, 
particularly cadres at and above the county level, chiefly, 
first of all, cadres at all levels, particularly the leading 
cadres, should enhance their awareness in study, try their best 
to reduce social intercourse at their own work posts, and set 
aside more time for strengthening study; second, party 
committees at all levels and leading party groups of all 
departments should resolutely adopt the method of concentrating 
some time for grasping the study of their central groups; and 
third, adopt the methods of sharing the study tasks to all 
levels and strive to rotationally train cadres at and above the 
section (township) level across the province during this year 
with the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, "theory," and "decision" as the main substance. 
We should uphold the principle of combining theory with reality 
and exert efforts to apply the study to practical use. It is 
necessary to integrate the study with the summing up of 
experience of reform and development in one's own locality, 
department, and unit, and combine the ideology and concept with 
the problems in work in the course of studying how to deepen 
the current reform so as to provide a powerful ideological 
guarantee for accelerating reform and promoting development. In 
seeking unity of thinking, we should, through study, 
emphatically resolve the following several issues: First, we 
should firmly embrace the idea of dialectical unity among 
reform, development, and stability, break with the erroneous 
understanding of setting these three things against one another 
and separating them from one another, discover and resolve in a 
timely manner the new problems emerging in the work concerning 
reform, development, and stability, and make these three things 
coordinate and promote one another. Second, we should firmly 
embrace the new concepts commensurate with new circumstances, 
break with the outmoded ideas formed under the planned economic 
structure in the past, make great efforts to master the 
knowledge concerning the socialist market economic law, and 
enhance our ability of promoting the economic structural reform 
and accelerate the development of the socialist market economy. 
Third, we should firmly embrace the concept that the 
development of the socialist market economy is in agreement with 
the party's ideals, purpose, and noble moral sentiment, overcome 
the influence caused by money worship, hedonism, and extreme 
individualism, continuously temper ourselves through party 
spirit, and enhance our ability to resist corruption and prevent 
evolution. Fourth, we should firmly embrace the pioneering 
spirit of improving ourselves through unremitting efforts and 
struggling arduously, overcome such erroneous ideas as being 
content with small progress, maintaining what has been achieved 
by predecessors, fearing difficulties, and blaming everyone and 
everything but oneself, enhance the courage to face up with the 
challenges of all sorts in the course of reform and development, 
and serve as enthusiastic pioneers who share a common fate with 
reform and make contributions to reform and development. 
  3. We should give full play to the party's advantages in 
propaganda and ideological work and provide effective support by 
media and ideological guarantee for reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  With the theory of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the fundamental principle, the party's 
propaganda and ideological work should be devoted to arming the 
people with scientific theory, to guiding the people with 
correct public opinions, to modeling the people with noble 
spirit, and to inspiring the people with excellent works. This 
is the overall disposition and strategic idea for strengthening 
propaganda and ideological work in the process of building the 
socialist market economic structure. It is a huge systems 
engineering to attain these four goals. The provincial party 
committee should make overall planning and work out measures to 
attain these four goals step by step. Party committees at all 
levels and the propaganda and ideological fronts should exert 
positive efforts in arming the people with theory, guiding the 
people through mass media, conducting ideological education 
among the people, and making culture flourishing in line with 
these four goals. In addition, new experiences should be 
summarized and created to make contributions to attaining these 
four goals. 
  Now, we are precisely at the key period of building the 
socialist market economic structure and carrying out the four 
modernizations. Party committees at all levels and all 
propaganda and mass media departments should pay special 
attention to guiding the public opinion under the guidance of 
the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
expanding reform, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability." Mass media departments should comprehensively and 
accurately propagate the party's basic line, principles, and 
policies, propagate the "decision" of the third plenary session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and propagate the good 
methods, good examples, and good experiences concerning reform, 
development, and stability. The people should be guided to show 
concern for, support, and plunge into reform, correctly handle 
the relations between the overall interest and the partial 
interest and between the long-term interest and the immediate 
interest, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the 
central authorities with a view to winning the hardest battle of 
reform. We should vividly and specifically propagate the 
province's strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to 
promote the overall development and the province's principles 
and favorable policies concerning opening up in a bid to create 
a good environment of media for expanding the opening up of the 
province. For such sensitive issues as anticorruption, 
commodity prices, and public security, with which the masses are 
concerned, press and mass media departments should show positive 
concern, check what is evil and advocate what is good, and treat 
them prudently in order to help create a good environment of 
mass media characterized by political and social stability. We 
should pay high attention to strengthening the investigation and 
analysis of the public opinions in society and the mental state 
of the masses in various fields, and then give correct guidance 
to and help the masses enhance understanding, unite ideas, and 
resolve contradictions. 
  The party committees at various 
levels and their propaganda departments should further 
supervise, manage, and guide the press work. The mass 
propaganda should persistently implement the principle that 
literary and artistic workers should serve socialism and the 
people and the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom 
and a hundred schools of thought contend, carry forward the main 
melody, and advocate a variety of styles. We should concentrate 
main energy on upgrading quality; make the press and radio and 
television programs further conform to the party's line, 
principles, and policies; put the central link of economic 
construction in a prominent position; loudly play the main 
melody of reform; press close to the reality, the masses, and 
the livelihood; and make our works loved by the people. 
  In regard to the aspect of rejuvenating socialist culture, 
we 
should pay attention to grasping the creation of literary and 
artistic works, the mass cultural activities, and the management 
of cultural markets. We should take the creation and 
improvement of the art of Hebei as a general target; take the 
implementation of the "project for ranking first in five 
aspects," and the launching of the campaigns of "learning from 
Chengde modern drama troupe, creating first-grade works, and 
striving for the first class" as motivation; and create a group 
of outstanding skilled persons and a number of artistic works 
reflecting the main melody of the times. The provincial party 
committee and the provincial government will give handsome 
awards to the spiritual products that produce great impacts at 
home and abroad. The cultural and sports activities for the 
masses should be regarded as an important matter and should be 
held annually in a well-arranged and well-planned manner so as 
to enhance the physical quality of the people and have the 
people enjoy a high level of spiritual satisfaction while 
resting after tense labor. The confused management of cultural 
markets is a prominent problem that the broad masses of the 
cadres and the people complain strongly about. We must be 
determined and exert great efforts to straighten out the 
cultural markets. The propaganda departments under the party 
committees should coordinate with the work in this regard. The 
cultural, radio, and press and publication departments should 
assume responsibilities for the management of the cultural 
markets. Simultaneously, the procuratorial, judicial, and 
security departments should make concerted and positive efforts 
to coordinate with the management of cultural markets. Wiping 
out pornography, dealing blows to unlawful activities, and 
straightening out cultural markets should be brought into line 
with the plan for comprehensively improving social order and be 
carried out on a responsibility basis. The party and government 
leaders of the localities with serious problems and the leaders 
of the departments in charge of the trades should first be 
called to account. Those who violate laws should strictly be 
punished according to regulations and rules but never be treated 
leniently. 
  4. We should further grasp the improvement of the ideology 
and work style of the party and government leading bodies and 
set up leading cadres' encouragement and restriction mechanisms. 
  Through the shift of the terms of office, the readjustment 
of 
leading bodies, and the amalgamation of prefectures with cities 
made last year, the party and government leading bodies at 
various levels have effectively been strengthened. The majority 
of the leading bodies have a strong enterprising spirit, are 
able to work together with one heart, and are full of vitality. 
However, we must notice that some comrades lack the sense of 
enterprising and the sense of responsibility, are satisfied at 
the current situation, and lack lofty aspirations and ideals of 
constantly forging ahead, doing undertakings, and creating 
achievements. With floating work styles, some comrades are 
ideologically lazy and lack the spirit of working hard and 
solidly. In line with the actual conditions of the current 
leading bodies, we should take the improvement of ideology and 
work style as a focal point, continue to strengthen the 
construction of the leading bodies at various levels, pay 
particular attention to improving the mental outlook and unity 
of the leading bodies. The key to improving the mental outlook 
of the leading bodies hinges on accurately understanding the 
situation; comprehensively treating challenges and favorable 
opportunities; resolutely preventing and overcoming the state of 
being weak, fearing difficulties, and shrinking back; further 
mobilizing the revolutionary spirit of constantly forging ahead; 
and further carrying out the practice of making concerted 
efforts for undertakings. 
  The key to solving the lack of 
coordination and unity among leading bodies is to establish and 
improve all systems and rules of procedure on democratic 
centralism, overcome arbitrariness, strictly use systems to 
standardize the acts of each and every member of the leading 
bodies, and do a good job in resolving the issue on building a 
party to serve the interests of the people and relying on party 
spirit to hold powers. With these starting and resting points, 
we will become selfless, open, and aboveboard, and will support 
and understand each other, and live in harmony. Particularly, 
party and government top leaders should set examples with their 
own conduct, serve as models for safeguarding unity among 
leading bodies, resolutely attend to the goal of not speaking 
and doing things that are disadvantageous to unity, dare to and 
be good at dissolving all contradictions affecting the unity of 
leading bodies, and enable the "leading bodies" to realistically 
become united leading collectives with militancy. 
  To strengthen leading bodies and enhance their fighting 
capacity, we must enhance their ideology and rely on systems to 
guarantee the accomplishment of this work. It is necessary to 
establish the mechanisms of incentive and restraints for leading 
bodies and leading cadres. In this connection, we must 
establish a system and method to scientifically evaluate the 
performance of cadres, clarify the substance, tasks, and 
priorities of the evaluation work, make the evaluation work 
practical, and at the same time, rely on all departments, and 
the masses of grass-roots cadres, and make the work procedures 
public and democratic. Through one year of efforts, we should 
establish an evaluation system and the mechanisms of incentive 
and restraints at all levels across the province, instill a 
powerful impetus that "it is not realistic not to work, not to 
do a good job, and to do shoddy work" among leading bodies and 
leading cadres so that those who do well feel proud and elated 
and those who do a bad job feel the pressure. 
  In the recruitment of cadres, under the premise of strictly 
upholding the principle on party spirit, we should give priority 
to promoting and placing in an important post those cadres whose 
achievements are proved outstanding through evaluation, or give 
them appropriate political treatment and material awards; 
regarding those cadres whose work achievements are not obvious 
and the achievements are average, we should give them a 
yellow-card warning and urge them to rectify and improve 
themselves with a set time limit; regarding those cadres who 
fail to fulfill the work targets, accomplish nothing, and have a 
very poor work record, we should resolutely make readjustment; 
and regarding those who are actually incompetent, we should 
demote or dismiss them. Thus, through equal competition, we may 
select the superior and eliminate the inferior, stimulate the 
broad masses of cadres to the forefront of reform, opening up, 
and economic construction to struggle and fight at their own 
work posts in the course of practice, and to participate in 
competition. On the issue of cadres, if a party committee fails 
to work this way, its cadres will not be happy, the common 
practice of the ranks of cadres will not be healthy, and their 
work will not be able to forge ahead. 
  At present, the problems on treating cadres with a 
factionalist viewpoint and recruiting cadres through personal 
relationship and the feeling of gratitude and resentment; the 
problems on offering official posts, making lavish promises, and 
cultivating personal power; the problems on recommending cadres 
to the organizations in name but in fact rigidly demanding money 
for promotion or job arrangements for some cadres; and some 
unhealthy trends in the selection and recruitment of cadres, 
such as establishing ties and getting in by the back door to ask 
for an official post, have still existed in some localities and 
units at varying degrees. Party committees and the organization 
and personnel departments at all levels should resolutely resist 
and oppose these unhealthy trends, consciously uphold the 
principle of judging cadres by their party spirit and recruiting 
cadres according to their actual achievements, be just and 
upright, not sticking to one pattern, select the wise and use 
the competent, and boldly promote and recruit cadres who have 
ability and political integrity. It is necessary to expose and 
criticize those who appoint people by favoritism and for the 
sake of getting profits, and get by the back door to ask for a 
post, and punish in line with party and administrative 
discipline those who fail to correct themselves after repeated 
education and whose cases are serious. Meanwhile, through 
deepening reform of the cadre personnel system, we should 
accelerate the establishment of a set of mechanisms and systems 
for evaluating and recruiting cadres that fit the socialist 
market economic structure and effectively prevent unhealthy 
trends in the selection and recruitment of personnel. 
  5. Guidance should differ according to different cases, 
give prominence to priorities, and conscientiously build the 
party's grass-roots organizations well. 
  Implementation of the party's line, principles, policies, 
and 
tasks, ultimately, depends on the party's grass-roots 
organizations which should play their role as political cores 
and fighting bastions and depends on the more than 3 million 
communist party members in Hebei who should play their leading 
and exemplary role so that they can lead the vast number of 
cadres and the masses to work indomitably. However, many 
grass-roots organizations of the party, especially those in 
rural areas, have failed to successfully perform their role, 
which has seriously affected the implementation of the party's 
principles, policies, and various tasks. Party committees at 
all levels should have firm determination and exert great 
efforts to realistically improve and strengthen the party's 
grass-roots organizations and build them into a good and solid 
foundation. Improvement of the party organizations in rural 
areas and those in enterprises are two major tasks, and great 
efforts should be exerted to make them successful. 
  In rural areas, we should give different guidance according 
to different cases, with the focus on achieving a fairly 
comfortable life. First, we should successfully consolidate and 
improve advanced party branches and enable them to lead the 
masses to achieve a fairly comfortable life ahead of others. We 
should also earnestly summarize their experiences and use their 
typical cases as examples. Localities where conditions permit 
may also adopt the method of mergence, allowing advanced 
villages to merge some backward villages. Second, we should do 
a good job in transforming backward party branches and make 
particular efforts to tackle the problems of those whose work is 
stagnant or partly stagnant. In some cases, we may assign 
leading cadres to hold the responsibility for guiding some 
villages or assign relevant departments or advanced villages to 
provide assistance and support to help backward party branches 
improve their own quality, develop their collective economy, and 
enhance their unity and combat strength. In others, counties 
and townships may send work teams to villages to help them 
select party branch secretaries, establish party branch leading 
bodies, accurately select the roads to affluence, and start the 
steps of development. In still others, counties and townships 
may directly send cadres to assume posts in villages, who will 
organize the leading bodies, select the road of development, and 
leave after the villages achieve a fairly comfortable life and 
village cadres are selected. Town and township are the 
foundation and the county party committee is the key to 
conscientiously carrying out rural party building. County and 
township party committees should regard the above-mentioned work 
as the most important task in party building, work out specific 
plans for it, and clarify the targets and measures so that this 
big, difficult, and long-standing problem can be solved well. 
  The establishment of the modern enterprise system and the 
rapid development of shareholding enterprises, enterprise 
groups, foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprises, and 
urban and rural collective enterprises have put forward many new 
questions and new demands on improvement of grass-roots party 
organizations. We should have the courage to probe into the new 
ideas for enterprises' party building to conform to this 
situation in line with the criterion of "three advantages" and 
with the spirit of reform. Organization departments, together 
with other relevant departments, should actively participate in 
state-owned enterprises' experiment with the establishment of 
the modern enterprise system and explore the position, 
functions, role, and styles and methods of activities of 
enterprise party organizations under the modern enterprise 
system. They should also conduct in-depth investigation and 
study and put forward specific opinions on how the various types 
of nonstate-owned enterprises establish party organizations, 
carry out activities, and play their role. The general demand 
is that all economic organizations should strengthen party 
building boldly, those without party organizations should 
actively create favorable conditions to build party 
organizations, and those which have already established party 
organizations should standardize their position and functions, 
actively carry out the party's work, and give play to the party 
organizations' due role. When building new enterprises in the 
future, party organizations should be established 
simultaneously; when the enterprises' administrative bodies are 
established, the bodies for party affairs should also be 
established simultaneously; and when production and operation 
start, the party's activities should also start simultaneously. 
  Leading party groups of institutions of higher learning 
should fully understand the historical duties they shoulder, 
actually strengthen the ideological and political work among 
college students and teachers, young teachers in particular, 
strengthen the building of party branches of departments of 
colleges, and continue to develop and expand the ranks of party 
members. The vast numbers of teachers, students, and 
administrative staff of colleges should be educated and guided 
to foster correct outlook on life and outlook on value and to 
combine their personal fates with the destiny and future of the 
motherland. These leading party groups should also correctly 
approach the current situation and the series of major policy 
decisions of the CPC Central Committee in an effort to make 
positive contributions to safeguarding social stability, 
maintaining the campus stability, and promoting reform and 
development. 
  6. We should profoundly and persistently launch the 
anticorruption campaign, closely integrate the building of party 
style and the improvement of administrative honesty with reform 
and development, and make them promote each other. 
  In accelerating the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, party committees and governments at all 
levels should all the more attach importance to building party 
style and improving administrative honesty and should oppose all 
sorts of corrupt phenomena in a sustained, resolute, and 
unremitting manner by regarding the opposition as the basic 
condition for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
development and as a basic task on party building and on the 
building of political power. Practice has incontrovertibly 
proved that the opposition to corruption has not hampered the 
development of reform, opening up, and economic development but 
has vigorously promoted the constant development of economic 
construction and enabled the province to set a record high in 
all major economic targets last year. It is wrong to set the 
anticorruption campaign against reform, opening up, and economic 
development. We should clearly notice, however, that corrupt 
phenomena have not yet been resolved and the anticorruption 
tasks remain very arduous. Therefore, we should on no account 
lower our guard and become careless. In line with the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, in close combination with the 
realities of Hebei, and based on the already scored 
achievements, we should launch the anticorruption campaign in a 
profound, sustained, and more effective manner in order to make 
new progress continuously. Party committees and governments at 
all levels should, like they did in the second half of last 
year, make their principal party and government leaders 
personally take a hand in anticorruption work, make party and 
government organs grasp the work in coordination by proceeding 
from their own units. This work should be grasped level by 
level, with each assuming responsibility for its own work. All 
fields from higher to lower levels should act together in line 
with the unified arrangements and dispositions of the CPC 
Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party 
committee, and the provincial government in order to win the 
general war. 
  This year's anticorruption campaign should be continuously 
focused on the three tasks, as defined by the central 
authorities, of making leading cadres honest, clean, and 
self-disciplined in performing official duties, investigating 
and dealing with major and appalling cases, and correcting 
unhealthy trends. To truly achieving success in these three 
tasks and to truly and profoundly launching the anticorruption 
campaign until results are achieved, the key lies in the 
administrative honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres. 
"The rain is leaking in the ground of the house, but the 
leaking must be plugged in the ceiling." If a leading cadre 
fails in maintaining administrative honesty and in being strict 
with himself, he will lose the basic condition for organizing 
and guiding his locality and unit to oppose corruption. Being 
dishonest and even corrupt, a leading cadre will seriously 
deviate from the masses, lose the support of the people, lose 
the right of leadership, and, finally, ruin himself. Being 
honest and self- disciplined, a leading cadre will talk with 
perfect assurance and have the cohesive force in opposing 
corruption and advocating administrative honesty. Therefore, 
party committees at all levels and leading party groups of all 
departments should actually pay attention to the administrative 
honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres and resolve and 
correct problems in a timely manner whenever they are found. 
This year, in encouraging leading cadres to maintain 
administrative honesty and to be self-disciplined, we should 
conduct comparison, examination, and correction in line with the 
"five regulations" defined by the third plenary session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission and with the problem of 
infringing upon the interests of enterprises. In addition, we 
should look back on the implementation of the "five regulations" 
set forth by the central authorities at the preceding stage and 
the "ten forbiddens" set forth by the provincial party 
committee, and then make continued efforts to resolve problems. 
Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions should also be 
honest in performing official duties and being self-disciplined, 
abide by disciplines and laws, oppose all sorts of negative and 
corrupt phenomena, such as abusing powers to seek personal gain, 
embezzling public funds, accepting bribes, and spending without 
restraint. Leading bodies at all levels should hold democratic 
activity meetings to conduct conscientious self-examination and 
self-correction based on sufficient preparations and on a 
unified time limit. 
  Principal responsible comrades of the 
party committees at various levels should have the daring to 
make strict checks. The discipline inspection and supervisory 
departments at various levels should achieve supervision and 
examination and avoid doing their work perfunctorily. The 
practice and activities that are forbidden in the five new 
regulations of the central authorities and those violating the 
interests of the enterprises should stop immediately. The 
problems with clear lines of demarcation should be corrected in 
the course of examinations according to the five new 
regulations. We should examine the problems without clear lines 
of demarcation before handling them. 
  The functional departments under the party committees and 
governments at various levels should assume dual 
responsibilities in the struggle against corruption. On the one 
hand, they should be administratively honest and 
self-disciplined and consciously correct their dishonest 
activities; on the other hand, they should realistically grasp 
the correction of the unhealthy practice within their 
departments. Most of the problems within trades are connected 
with the business activities of the trade departments. All 
departments at the provincial level should actually assume 
responsibility, guide the improvement of the contingents of the 
trades, and improve the work style of the trades. As for the 
departments and trades with serious unhealthy practice, that the 
people have strong complaints, and with failure to correct their 
unhealthy practice, their leaders should first be called to 
account. By the end of the year, we should mobilize the cadres 
and the masses across the province to make a general assessment 
of the work styles of the trades, select the best and the worst 
through the assessment, commend those with achievements, and 
investigate and affix the responsibility of the worst. 
  In opposing corruption, we should persistently treat the 
problems by looking into both the root causes and symptoms and 
pay attention to both penalty and prevention. We should not 
only resolutely investigate and handle unlawful and 
undisciplined cases but also solve the deep-layered problems 
relating to systems and policies. We should attend to both 
"opposition" and "construction" so as to gradually set up a 
mechanism of ending corruption that is suitable to the market 
economic system. All levels and all departments, particularly 
law enforcement departments and the personnel at the posts 
directly in charge of personnel, financial, and material affairs 
should set up a mechanism to effectively restrict and guard 
against the activities of abusing power for selfish ends, set up 
and perfect a system that the people from higher levels downward 
supervise one another, and bring into play the supervisory 
functions of the laws, the party discipline, the administrative 
procedures, and the masses. We should strengthen the study of 
policies; pay attention to discovering the imperfect aspects and 
existing problems in the course of implementing specific 
policies, management systems, and regulations and methods; sum 
up experiences; draw lessons; and set forth opinions on solving 
problems. It is necessary to resolutely implement the central 
regulations on separating administrative charges from the income 
from fines and confiscations. The provincial financial 
department should firmly attend to working out methods for 
implementing the regulations and strive to thoroughly solve the 
problems in this regard by the end of this year. 
  7. We should realistically strengthen the work of the united 
front work department of the party, unite with all the forces 
that can be united, and serve the safeguarding of social and 
political stability and the promoting of modernization. 
  Along with the deepening of reform and opening up, the 
gradual setup of the socialist market economic system, and the 
readjustment and changes of the social economic structure, the 
united front work department of the party has expanded its work 
from the political sphere to various social spheres, including 
the economic, cultural, and scientific and technological 
spheres; from large cities to small ones; from higher layers to 
the grass roots; and from the province to the places at home and 
abroad. This grand united front worker contingent has the 
advantages of having intensive knowledge, higher layers, wide 
contacts, many domestic and overseas friends. So, it is an 
extremely precious force in the province's modernization. In 
front of the new situation where the scale of the united front 
is ceaselessly expanded, the number of its targets continues to 
increase, and its tasks continue to become heavier, the party 
committees at various levels should further upgrade their 
understanding about the important positions and functions of the 
united front in the new age, enhance the ideas about the united 
front, grasp and apply this magic weapon, and have it become a 
powerful motivation to safeguard and develop the political 
situation characterized by stability and unity and to promote 
the economic construction and all social undertakings. 
  The 
party committees and governments at various levels should 
positively encourage and support members of the organizations of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members 
of the democratic parties, and non-party personages to conduct 
activities of investigating and studying the major issues of 
reform, opening up, spiritual and material civilizations, and 
the people's livelihood to achieve the inspection and motions 
work and to have them realistically participate in and discuss 
political affairs; should conscientiously and fully consult with 
personages of democratic parties and nonparty personages before 
the promulgation of major policy decisions; and should 
accurately treat their opinions and suggestions to make the 
policy decisions more suitable to the objective reality and to 
avoid making mistakes. We should pay attention to arranging 
jobs, particularly real jobs, for the personages outside the 
party, including democratic party personages, and ensure that 
they have both jobs and rights. Simultaneously, we should 
continue to encourage the personages who have contacts with 
democratic parties and the united front to bring into play their 
role as a go-between in bringing in foreign capital; to 
establish close contacts with overseas large financial groups, 
large enterprises, large monetary organizations, and well-known 
personages; to do more concrete deeds in the aspect of bringing 
in foreign capital; and to make more contributions to 
implementing the provincial strategy of promoting the 
development of the export- oriented economy and expanding the 
scale of opening up. We should strengthen the work toward the 
intellectuals, be concerned about and improve the working and 
living conditions of the intellectuals, and vigorously encourage 
and support a part of intellectuals to work at civilian-run 
enterprises, civilian-run educational organizations, and 
civilian-run scientific research institutions or to take the 
lead in running civilian-run enterprises and institutions so as 
to bring into full play their wisdom, intelligence, and 
sacrificing spirit. 
  We should bring into full play the united front's peculiar 
functions for coordination and alleviating contradictions and 
create a stable and united political environment for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. We should pay attention 
to having the personages on the united front to disseminate 
reform among the masses whom they are able to contact with, to 
help get rid of their doubts about the new contradictions and 
new problems cropping up in the course of reform, and to have 
the personages of all circles understand and support various 
reform measures. Our province has comparatively more minority 
nationalities and heavier religious tasks. So, we should guide 
and unite with both believers and the masses without beliefs to 
develop production and to take the path of seeking common 
wealth. We should comprehensively and accurately implement the 
party's policies toward religions. We should not only respect 
the freedom of religions and beliefs and protect normal 
religious activities but also strengthen the management of 
religious affairs and ban and deal blows to various activities 
of committing crimes in the name of religions so as to mobilize 
the broad masses of believers' patriotic enthusiasm and to make 
contributions to safeguarding social stability and promoting 
economic development. 
  8. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over 
propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united 
front work and create a new situation in the work in various 
aspects. 
  Propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and 
united 
front work are great matters that should be attended to by the 
party committees. Strengthening the leadership of the party 
committees is the key deciding the fact that whether or not the 
work in these aspects can form a new momentum in the new age and 
whether or not a new situation can be created. The party 
committees at various levels should take the overall situation 
into consideration, be sure that the party should administer 
party affairs, and persist in the principle of taking a two-hand 
approach and be sure that both hands are tough. At the time of 
continuously strengthening the leadership over the economic 
work, we should realistically grasp the propaganda, 
organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work; 
and have these fronts accurately and positively bring their 
functions into play in the course of implementing the basic line 
of the party, realizing the work of the party, and building 
Hebei into an economically powerful province. 
  As they attend to economic work, party committees should 
also strictly apply the system of responsibility for management 
by objective to these aspects of work. Party committees at all 
levels should consider and plan for economic development, 
reform, opening up, and propaganda, organizational, discipline 
inspection, and united front work in an all-around manner. 
After collective study, they should also specify the tasks of 
propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united 
front work as they do economic tasks, quantify the tasks as much 
as possible, and then clarify the responsibilities and assign 
tasks for every member of leading bodies and all relevant 
departments to fulfill within a definite time. Fulfillment of 
these tasks should be included in the annual targets for which 
pertinent leaders and departments are responsible and be 
appraised at the end of the year. The results of the appraisal 
should become an important criterion for judging the performance 
of leading cadres and the work level of the entire leading 
bodies. 
  Efforts should be made to improve the work departments and 
cadres' contingents of party committees to upgrade their overall 
quality. Contingents of cadres who are politically strong, 
professionally competent, and honest and upright in work styles 
should be established. We should intensify ideological 
education. We should educate cadres to correctly treat fame and 
gain under the condition of the market economy based on party 
spirit and the spirit of respect for work characterized by 
selfless devotion and faithfulness to duties so as to enhance 
their awareness of the mission and sense of responsibility. We 
should make active efforts to create favorable conditions and 
adopt various measures, such as selecting cadres to conduct 
advanced study and sending cadres to other localities for 
observation activities or conduct investigation and study, to 
help the contingents of cadres further emancipate their minds, 
update their ideas, broaden their field of vision, enrich their 
knowledge, correct their thinking and work that are incompatible 
with the new situation and new tasks, and increase their skills 
for their own work. These contingents should be improved 
organizationally. For the leading posts in the departments, we 
should select a number of comrades who have both political 
integrity and abilities, are in the prime of life, have 
undergone the training of grass-roots work, know both politics 
and economy, and have pioneering and realistic spirit. Cadres 
of propaganda, organization, discipline inspection, and united 
front work departments, on the premise that they are kept 
relatively stable, may also be exchanged with the cadres in 
charge of economic work so that they can learn from each other's 
strong points to offset their weaknesses and enhance their vigor. 
  We should change work styles, go deep into grass-roots 
levels, and summarize new experiences and work out new ideas in 
the process to continuously understand new conditions and 
address new problems. Following the in-depth development of the 
reform designed to establish the socialist market economy 
system, the party will encounter many new conditions in its own 
building and various work and need to step up efforts and devote 
time to study, explore, and address them. Party committees at 
all levels and leaders of propaganda, organization, discipline 
inspection, and united front work departments should organize 
personnel, devote time, and go down to grass-roots levels to 
conduct investigation and study of the new conditions and new 
issued that have cropped up and map out methods to address them. 
We should enable the various work of party committees to suit 
the needs of reform and development in a more timely and 
effective manner and enable party committees to make greater 
contributions to the grand cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the endeavor of building an 
economically strong province.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Chen Li (7115 0500): "Persistently and </F>
Unremittingly Deepen the Anticorruption Campaign"] 
  [Text] On 29 March, at the eighth (enlarged) plenary 
session of the autonomous regional discipline inspection 
commission, Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, stressed: Anticorruption work should submit to and 
serve the overall task of the work of the entire party. This 
can be summarized as two sentences: The first one is that the 
anticorruption campaign must facilitate the sustained, rapid, 
and sound development of the national economy of the whole 
region; and the other is that all sorts of corrupt phenomena 
arousing complaints among the masses must be eliminated in a bid 
to deepen reform and maintain stability. 
  At the eighth (enlarge) plenary session of the regional 
discipline inspection commission held on 28 March, Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's speech made at the third session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of this 
session were relayed and implemented, the experience gained from 
opposing corruption at the preceding stage was summarized, the 
situation we were facing was analyzed, and the tasks for the 
anticorruption campaign in the foreseeable future were arranged. 
The session held on 29 March was attended by Qian Fenyong, Bai 
Enpei, Wuyunqimuge, Yu Xinglong, Yun Bulong, Zhaorigetu, Nai 
Deng, Ba Shijie, and Zhang Hesong. And Bai Enpei presided over 
the session. 
  Wang Qun said: This year is a key year to press forward the 
overall reform and make breakthroughs in major fields and is an 
extremely important year to effect sustained, rapid, and sound 
development of the national economy. At the moment, the 
situation of Inner Mongolia is good in general, like that in 
other areas of China. Party committees and governments at all 
levels and party leading comrades at all levels must obtain a 
clear understanding of the current situation, enhance the sense 
of the whole, and launch the anticorruption campaign based on 
the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. 
  Wang Qun appraised the achievements scored in opposing 
corruption at the preceding stage as: "The general situation was 
good and development was sound." He said that this could be 
manifested in the following three aspects: First, leaders at 
various levels enhanced their understanding of the principle of 
"taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands" 
and their consciousness in opposing corruption. Second, some 
substantial results were achieved in the anticorruption 
campaign, initial results were achieved in the self-examination 
and self-correction by leading cadres, some corrupt elements 
were subjected to investigation and punishment, and the 
spreading trend of some unhealthy practices and corrupt 
phenomena were put under control. Third, in addition to these 
initial results, the anticorruption campaign at the preceding 
stage played a positive role in promoting the improvement of the 
entire social mood and the sustained and sound development of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. Of course, while 
affirming achievements, we should also understand that our 
anticorruption work still lags behind in understanding, work, 
and results. To sum up, the task on the anticorruption campaign 
remains extremely arduous and thus our unremitting efforts are 
needed. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: To continuously deepen the 
anticorruption campaign through persistent efforts in line with 
the region's realities, we should, what is most important, seek 
unity of our ideas and enhance our understanding in the 
following three issues: 1) the issue concerning the guiding 
principle of "taking a two handed approach and being tough with 
both hands;" 2) the issue of persisting in the anticorruption 
campaign while developing the socialist market economic 
structure; and 3) the issue of fully understanding the 
long-duration, arduousness, and complexity of anticorruption 
campaign. 
  Wang Qun said: Whether we can thoroughly implement the tasks 
set forth by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission and whether we can launch anticorruption 
campaign in a profound, sustained, and effective manner and 
achieve obvious and inspiring results in the campaign depend 
primarily on our endeavor of strengthening leadership and 
adopting effective and practical measures to implement the 
guidelines of the central authorities and the arrangements of 
the regional party committee down to every grass-roots area. 
  For this, Wang Qun stressed: First, we should truly 
strengthen the leadership over the anticorruption campaign. 
Party committees and governments at all levels must grasp the 
anticorruption campaign all together. Principal leading 
comrades must assume personal responsibility for and personally 
dispose the building of party style and the anticorruption 
campaign, must personally research the conspicuous problems 
concerning corruption of their own localities and departments, 
must personally organize and guide the investigation and 
handling of major cases, and must personally coordinate the work 
in various fields in an effort to unfailingly grasp the 
anticorruption work of their own localities and departments. 
Second, we should define duties and pay attention to 
implementation. In line with the principle that whoever takes 
charge of the work should assume responsibility, we should 
establish the responsibility system for building party style and 
improving administrative honesty. In this aspect, work should 
be divided up clearly, each unit should perform its work well, 
and each level should grasp, bring along, and assume 
responsibility for the work of the next lower level. When a 
locality or department fails in building party style, 
strengthening administrative honesty, and opposing corruption, 
its top party and government leaders should assume major 
responsibility for the failure. And, when a department at the 
next lower level fails in building party style, strengthening 
administrative honesty, and opposing corruption, leaders of the 
department of the next higher level should assume 
responsibility. Third, we should closely rely on the masses and 
encourage and mobilize the masses to provide clues for crimes 
according to facts, and the legitimate rights and interests of 
the persons who provide the clues should be safeguarded. 
Fourth, we should strictly enforce discipline. We must handle 
law violation cases in strict accordance with laws. The cases 
whose verdicts should be withdrawn, the cases which should be 
sentenced to imprisonment, and the cases which should be given 
severe penalty should be do so based on facts according to laws. 
Fifth, we should give prominence to focal points and have a 
good command of key points. This year, the general pattern of 
the anticorruption work will remain unchanged. But, all 
localities and departments should strive to promote the sound 
development of the entire anticorruption campaign in line with 
their respective realities, with the problems strongly 
complained by the masses as the points to make breakthroughs. 
Sixth, we should give full play to the functional role of 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs, people's courts, 
and people's procuratorates. In the anticorruption campaign of 
this year, party committees and governments at all levels should 
pay attention to strengthening leadership over and support to 
these organs and bringing their role into full play. 
  Wang Qun said in conclusion: Launching the anticorruption 
campaign is an extremely important and urgent political task set 
forth by the CPC Central Committee to the whole party and is a 
major event that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the 
party and the country. Party committees and governments at all 
levels, leading cadres holding important posts at all levels in 
particular, should enhance their sense of concern, truly bear 
their political duties, and persistently and unremittingly 
deepen the anticorruption campaign in order to make new 
contributions to ensuring and promoting reform, opening up, 
economic construction, and social and political unity and 
stability. 
  Attending the session held on 29 March were Han Wengui, Yao 
Xiang, and Feng Zhilai, deputy secretaries of the regional 
discipline inspection commission. Also attending were standing 
committee members and members of the regional discipline 
inspection commission, 24 persons in all. The Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission also sent persons to attend the 
session for giving guidance. Attending the session as observers 
were leading comrades of various league and city party 
committees who are in charge of discipline inspection work; 
secretaries of discipline inspection commissions under various 
league and city party committees; directors of supervisory 
bureaus (sections) of various leagues, cities, and forestry 
administration; responsible comrades of the discipline 
inspection groups (commissions) dispatched by the regional 
discipline inspection commission to the organs directly under 
the regional authorities; and responsible comrades of 
departments concerned.

  [Text] When inspecting work in Baodi County on 29 March, 
Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed 
out: We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 
central rural work conference, further enhance the understanding 
of the important position and role of the suburban-type 
agriculture, stabilize the areas sown to grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops, increase their per-unit yields, achieve 
success in the "vegetable basket" project, develop diverse 
production and township enterprises, optimize the structure, 
improve efficiency, develop the rural economy in all sectors, 
and then ensure the efficient supply of farm and sideline 
products and substantially increase peasants' income. The 
present is the crucial period for spring farming. We should be 
mobilized and seize the opportunity to combat drought to ensure 
wheat field management and spring sowing, ensure that this 
year's summer grain output is not lower than last year's, and 
reap a bumper harvest in the whole year. 
  Gao Dezhan arrived in Baodi County without fanfare early in 
the morning. He inspected the antidrought work and spring 
plowing and conducted investigation and study on implementation 
of the guidelines of the central rural work conference. He 
first came to the wheat field along the Jinwei Highway in 
Dakoutun Town to inspect how wheat seedlings were growing. Gao 
Dezhan greeted Yang Zizhong, a peasant who was working, 
cordially talked with them, asked him in detail about 
irrigation, fertilizer application, and wheat field management, 
and also asked whether he had difficulties. He said to the 
rural cadres beside him: We should mobilize town, township, and 
village cadres and every peasant household and adopt every 
possible means to strengthen wheat field management, do a good 
job in spring farming, and reap a good harvest of summer grain. 
Gao Dezhan then visited the farmland in Xiliuzhuang Village of 
Haohezhuang Township. He asked Wang Ruihai, secretary of the 
township party committee, and Li Fa, secretary of the village 
party branch, about rural work. He urged all townships to 
attach importance to application of science and technology to 
agricultural development, make agricultural scientific and 
technical service organizations successful, and serve 
agricultural production well. When he saw the newly planted 
poplar trees along the roads, he said happily: Tree planting 
not only can improve the natural environment and promote 
agricultural development but also is a way to achieve affluence. 
We should mobilize the masses to plant trees, green and enliven 
the land, and make the masses prosper. When inspecting spring 
plowing in Chenjiaan Village of Shiqiao Township, Gao Dezhan 
said to rural cadres: You have worked hard at the grass-roots 
levels. It is hoped that you will do a better job in the mass 
work and promote agricultural production and rural economy. 
Please convey my regards to the people. Gao Dezhan also came 
to the Huanqiu Enterprise Group, Haitai Industrial Co. Ltd., and 
Meizhong Wood Product Co. Ltd. to inspect their production, 
management, and construction. 
  After this, Gao Dezhan listened to the work reports of the 
Baodi County party committee and government and held a 
discussion. Gao Deshan said: The Baodi County party committee 
and government have paid close attention to their work, and 
their work ideas are also very good. It is hoped that they will 
do a still better job and open up a new situation in rural work. 
The central authorities have held the rural work conference. 
We should make earnest efforts to do practical work and rapidly 
implement the guidelines of the conference to the letter. He 
emphasized: Districts and counties engaged in agriculture 
should mobilize the people, seize the opportunity, race against 
time, and combat drought to ensure wheat field management and 
spring plowing in the right season. This is a task of prime 
importance in the current rural work. We should exert great 
efforts to stabilize the areas sown to grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops and increase their per-unit yields, pay 
attention to the key links, and adopt comprehensive measures to 
win a bumper harvest in summer grain. The summer grain output 
and the whole year's production of this year should not be lower 
than last year's. To carry out the "vegetable basket" project 
and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, 
fisheries, and township enterprises, we should take the road of 
optimizing the structure and improving efficiency. In short, we 
should ensure the efficient supplies of farm and sideline 
products and substantially increase peasants' income. 
  Speaking on how to mobilize people to successfully carry out 
current agricultural production and rural work, Gao Dezhan 
pointed out: Rural cadres at all levels should be mobilized 
first. They should enhance the sense of urgency and 
responsibility toward spring plowing and wheat field management, 
strengthen ideological and political work as well as 
organization work, invest more labor forces and money, and carry 
out meticulous management to make up for the unfavorable 
conditions we encountered in winter and ensure the stable 
increase of summer grain. We should also mobilize the entire 
society. All relevant departments and cadres at all levels 
should make spring plowing a success in order to reap a bumper 
summer grain harvest, go deep into rural areas and grass-roots 
levels, do practical work, give the green light, and provide 
good service. All trades and professions in Tianjin should 
support agriculture, the antidrought work, and spring farming 
and truly resolve difficulties and problems for the endeavors to 
combat drought and ensure wheat production and spring plowing. 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further enhance the 
understanding of the important position and role of Tianjin's 
suburban-type agriculture. We should truly understand that 
agriculture is the foundation for the national economy and for 
reform, development, and stability. Greater importance should 
be attached to the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops when developing the suburban-type agriculture. We should 
also understand that achieving success in the production for the 
vegetable basket is a task of prime importance in developing 
Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture. We should develop the 
high-yielding, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture on 
the premise that the production of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops is stabilized. We should coordinate the 
development of township enterprises and diverse production with 
the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. The 
characteristics of Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture should be 
reflected in the high level of development, high science and 
technology content, high per-unit yields, and high economic 
efficiency. Supporting and developing agriculture with 
industry, we should continuously increase agricultural 
investment, strive for high efficiency in industry and high 
output in agriculture, continuously increase peasants' income, 
and develop the rural economy in all sectors.

<F P=106> [Article by Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "High-Ranking </F>
Military Officers on Use of Force Against Taiwan"] 
  [Text] In late February, the division-level party 
committees of various armed services, various arms of the 
services, and various major military regions transmitted 
Document No. 9405 which was issued by the CPC Central Military 
Commission General Office; they also organized discussion 
meetings. The CPC Central Military Commission General Office 
demanded that, through studies and discussions, the document be 
implemented throughout the Army and viewed as the central task 
and duty. 
<H5>  Themes of the Document Issued By CPC Central Military </H5>
Commission General Office 
  Document No. 9405 was a general report on: A speech by Liu 
Huaqing, of the Central Military Commission, made on 9 February 
when he met the division-level cadres of the three armed 
services in Xiamen; a speech by Air Force commander Cao 
Shuangming during an inspection trip to Shanghai Air Force Unit; 
and a speech by 2d Artillery Corps commander Yang Guoliang when 
he inspected a certain missile unit in Zhejiang. The themes of 
their speeches were: Develop and improve modernized equipment 
for the three armed services amid the reform and make 
preparations for counterattacking the subversion and destruction 
from hegemony as well as its military threat; and stress that 
hegemony, Japanese militarism, and Li Teng-hui's "Taiwan 
independence," "one China and one Taiwan," and two-China 
policies are the main enemies facing the three armed services. 
<H5>  "Use Military Means To Settle Taiwan's Separation" </H5>
  Liu Huaqing said when meeting the division-level cadres of 
the three armed services: Whether a war will break out across 
the strait depends to a large extent on Li Teng-hui and the 
governing stratum in Taiwan. We do not want to see war breaking 
out across the strait because war will bring harm and 
destruction to the Chinese nation but this cannot be determined 
by our subjective expectations. The biggest sorrow and 
humiliation to a country and nation is its being split up and 
its invasion and occupation by other stronger powers. 
Concerning Taiwan, we have waited for 45 years and we can still 
wait, but this kind of waiting cannot be endless, nor can it be 
taken as tolerance of the activities promoting "Taiwan 
independence," "one China, one Taiwan," and two Chinas, or 
allowing foreign forces to intervene in Taiwan. Whether or not 
we will use military means and when we will use them depends on 
the development of the abovementioned matters. Taiwan is openly 
opposed to using the "one country, two systems" method of 
reaching reunification and this openly indicates that: Taiwan 
wants to follow the road of "Taiwan independence" in the future, 
a road which will lead to a test of military strength between 
the two sides of the strait. Li Teng-hui also pins hopes on the 
subversion of the mainland by the United States and the West as 
well as the interference and peaceful evolution being carried 
out by them. Judged from the development of things, the use of 
military means to settle Taiwan's separation is the eventual and 
only choice. When we use military means to settle reunification 
of the two sides of the strait and crush "Taiwan independence," 
we must mainly consider the interests of the broad masses of 
patriots in Taiwan, the degree of loss to the economic 
construction in Taiwan, and the price we have to pay in military 
and economic terms. We made preparations regarding this point a 
long time ago. 
<H5>  Three Urgent Reasons For Developing the Air Force </H5>
  Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming made a speech to Shanghai 
Air Force Unit when a number of China-made J-18 II aircraft were 
commissioned into the unit. In a speech entitled: "Expedite 
the Building of a Modernized Air Force," he stressed the urgency 
for developing the air force: 
  1. It is to defend the motherland's territorial airspace and 
safeguard the socialist undertaking; 
  2. It is to resist hegemony and the aggression and 
interference of neighboring countries; and 
  3. It is to prepare for accomplishing the great undertaking 
of reunification of the motherland and for crushing "Taiwan 
independence" and the invasion of Taiwan by foreign countries. 
<H5>  Cao Shuangming: "There Is No Other Choice" </H5>
  Cao Shuangming pointed out that Li Teng-hui is stepping up 
the effort to develop in the direction of "Taiwan independence" 
and to enlist and collude with the anti-China and anti-communism 
forces in the United States and Japan, in an attempt to turn 
Taiwan into an international dispute, reach the goal of 
separating Taiwan from Chinese soil. If things develop in this 
direction, we cannot other than adopt resolute and decisive 
military means to liberate Taiwan. There is no other choice.

<F P=106> [Article by Lin Sha (2651 3097): "Causes of, and </F>
Countermeasures Against, Losses in State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] State-owned enterprises are a leading force in 
China's national economy and the main source of national 
revenue. The losses made by some state-owned enterprises over a 
long period of time is a hot topic of general concern to the 
public. Thoroughly studying the causes of the serious losses 
and formulating strong and steady countermeasures to curb losses 
and increase profits have become very immediate tasks. 
<H5>  I. It Is Necessary To Thoroughly Analyze the Causes of </H5>
Losses Made By State-Owned Enterprises 
  There are many reasons why state-owned enterprises make 
losses and these are roughly as follows: 
  1. The Policy Factor. 
  At present, some state-owned enterprise losses are 
caused by the as yet unstraightened cost relationships and the 
rather low prices fixed by the government for their 
products. Across the country, the industries on which 
losses are concentrated, such as the coal and oil industries, 
are mainly affected by the policy factor and their losses are 
comparatively great. What these industries produce have a 
bearing on all trades and industries and tens of thousands of 
households. They are important bulk materials and the State 
adopts a particularly prudent attitude toward their prices. 
However, given the fact that 90 percent of consumer goods and 
70 percent of the means of production have already had their 
price controls lifted, the fact that their prices are 
continually rising and the low transfer prices of the products 
whose prices are fixed by the government, it is unavoidable that 
these enterprises make losses because they "buy at high prices, 
sell at low prices, and are pressed at both ends." 
  2. The irrational factors left over from the traditional 
structure. 
  Although the "Regulations on Changing the Management 
Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" 
have been promulgated, rather serious problems still exist in 
the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises. First, 
they have not all had their decisionmaking rights guaranteed. 
State-owned enterprises have not had government administration 
separated from enterprise management and government supervisory 
departments still exercise too much, and too rigid, control over 
them with the result that their initiative for production and 
management is greatly affected and they cannot proceed smoothly 
in acquiring new equipment and producing new generations of 
products. Second, the enterprise management responsibility 
mechanism is unsound. Although enterprises have some 
responsibilities for production and management, their property 
rights relationships have not been thoroughly settled. This 
determines that they can continue to use the state's "iron bowl" 
and they still do not assume responsibility for management risks 
or even for bankruptcy. Third, the enterprise interest 
mechanism is insufficient. There has not been much change in 
the situation which has been formed for a long time whereby "the 
government manages enterprises and the enterprises manage 
society" and enterprises' burden from society is still rather 
heavy. 
  As the planned economy is changing to a market economy, 
some contradictions which accumulated over the years under the 
old structure have gradually been exposed, causing many 
state-owned enterprises to shoulder too heavy a burden, lack 
stamina for development, be incapable of adjusting to market 
changes, and to get bogged down in losses. First, their 
financial and debt burdens are heavy. According to 
statistics from Hebei Province, as of the end of 1992, the 
long-term borrowings by the economically independent industrial 
enterprises at and above the township level across the province 
had reached 30 billion yuan. Special loans to the industrial 
enterprises within the budget totaled 18 billion yuan, of which 
medium-term outstanding loans stood at 3.9 billion yuan and 
losses not yet made good came to 1.7 billion yuan plus 3.7 
billion yuan in hidden losses [qian kui 3383 5719]. 
Second, enterprises are overstaffed and shoulder a heavy 
burden. Ordinary state-owned enterprises have 
approximately 20 to 30 percent redundant staff. Since the 
current social security system is unsound, it is difficult to 
place them in society. Moreover, there is a high percentage of 
retired personnel. The retired personnel in ordinary 
state-owned enterprises account for 20 percent or more of their 
total staff and workers and those in some enterprises even 
account for 50 percent. At present, the yearly public insurance 
expenditure for state-owned enterprises across the country comes 
to 30 billion yuan. Third, machinery is outdated, 
technology and expertise are backward, and consumption is 
high. The current loss-making enterprises are mostly 
China's key enterprises. Under the old planned economic 
structure, their profits were all turned over to the State, 
their depreciation rates were low, and they were unable to carry 
out major technological transformation. As a result, they are 
backward in technology and equipment, their products are poor in 
quality and highly priced, and they have lost competitiveness. 
  3. The economic operation factor. 
  Since last year, China's industrial output and fixed 
assets investments have increased by too much, the restriction 
of the factors of production has further been consolidated and 
the restriction of resources has become increasingly salient. 
This is firstly reflected by the short supply of energy 
resources and raw and semifinished materials and their 
continually rising costs. The state has readjusted the 
prices of coal, crude oil, electricity, and transportation and 
has twice increased the interest rates for bank loans and 
increased the wages of staff and workers. The enterprises 
themselves have had difficulty digesting these factors of 
increasing expenditures and decreasing profits, which have 
pushed costs up considerably and so some profit-making 
enterprises have begun to make losses or increase their losses. 
According to an estimate by Hebei Province, industrial 
enterprises at and above the township level across the province 
had to pay an additional 760 million yuan, representing 88.4 
percent of the new losses, as a result of the rising costs of 
raw and semifinished materials, electricity, and transportation, 
as well as the increased wages of staff and workers. As price 
controls on crude fuels are being lifted and oil and grain 
prices are being increased this year, this will push costs up 
further. Second, the grim financial situation, fund 
shortages, the resurgent "debt chain," and the increase of funds 
in arrears have both aggravated the contradictions of fund 
shortages and increased the interest burden of enterprises. 
Moreover, the proportion of debt owed by loss-making 
enterprises is high and banks do not grant loans under normal 
circumstances. Therefore, some enterprises have reduced 
production somewhat, reduced production by half, or even 
suspended production. Furthermore, enterprise circulating funds 
are mainly borrowed from banks and the funds owned by 
enterprises are seriously insufficient, so they operate with 
debt in arrears and shoulder too great a burden. 
  4. New problems arising amid reform and opening up. 
  Implementation of the new fiscal and accounting systems 
and the new taxation system causes some profit-making 
enterprises to make losses or incur heavier losses. These 
are new circumstances arising amid reform and opening up. The 
new reformed accounting system which uses new accounting methods 
such as: Calculating the reserves for bad debts; speeding up 
depreciation, including current expenses in current profits and 
losses; and which is intended to increase the operational funds 
of enterprises and enhance their stamina for development are 
completely necessary for the long-term development of 
enterprises. However, this has also increased their costs and 
this, coupled with the exposure of hidden losses, has caused the 
lowering of book profits and increased losses. According to 
Shandong statistics, as a result of implementing the new fiscal 
and accounting system, in 1993, local state-owned industrial 
enterprises within the province's budget had a decrease in book 
profits of 1.326 billion yuan and additional losses of 500 
million yuan, with 250 new loss-making enterprises emerging. On 
the whole, the implementation of the new taxation system does 
not increase the burden on enterprises but, due to changes in 
the tax structure and the taxable categories, the tax burden on 
some enterprises will increase and their losses will also 
increase. 5. The enterprise internal management factor. 
  The fact that some enterprises make profits and others make 
losses given the same external environment shows that they are 
not all worthless. Most loss-making enterprises have made this 
or that policy mistake and have varying degrees of improper 
operation and management as well as other problems. These are 
operational losses. At present, it is generally true that 
operational factors affect the enterprise profits. This is 
mainly reflected by the following: First, enterprises lack 
strict scientific management of their production and operation, 
do not have a fixed work force, do not calculate materials 
consumption, do not have quality inspection, do not give clear 
awards and punishments, the utilization rates of their capital, 
equipment, and manpower are low, and their waste is serious. 
Second, blindness sometimes exists in certain aspects of 
management decisionmaking. Without seizing the opportunity for 
development, they often do not resolutely and scientifically 
adapt to the unpredictably changing market demands. They either 
hesitate and initiate projects too late or engage in precipitate 
and indiscriminate production. Third, the leaders of some 
loss-making enterprises engage in short-term behavior. During 
their terms of office, they hold views of temporary management 
and lopsidedly satisfy the immediate interests of staff and 
workers and are not willing to make great efforts at 
technological transformation and at producing new generations of 
products. Some even hide themselves under the protective 
umbrella of the state's "policy-permitted losses." They hold an 
indifferent attitude toward losses, feel no pressure, and are 
without motivation. The leaders of some enterprises have their 
incomes increased rather than decreased. Precisely due to the 
weaknesses in the enterprise management mechanism, these 
negative ideas and acts are produced. In the absence of 
effective restrictive measures, it is not easy for these 
loss-making enterprises to curb losses and increase profits on 
their own initiative. 
  It should be pointed out that enterprises used to make 
comparatively small losses under the planned economic structure 
because the state covered their hidden losses with large 
subsidies and by supplying cheap raw and semifinished materials. 
As they are changing to a socialist market economy, it is a 
normal phenomenon and conforms to objective economic laws that 
loss-making enterprises exist. They are both the direct 
result of the competition between enterprises and a 
characteristic in the course of readjusting the industrial 
structure. At present, China is in a crucial period where the 
old structure is changing to a new one. Following the 
introduction of a series of important reform measures, such as 
readjusting the prices of some means of production, increasing 
the interest rates for bank loans, and readjusting the original 
industrial structure which is seriously irrational, it is 
unavoidable that loss-making enterprises will increase. 
  But we should see that of the many factors that 
contribute to the serious losses currently incurred by 
state-owned enterprises, the factor of normal losses and the 
factor of abnormal losses coexist, intertwine with each other, 
and should be analyzed in a scientific way. In this way, we 
should find the specific reasons why China's enterprises do not 
achieve high economic efficiency and then find the solution. 
<H5>  II. Resolve the Problem of Losses Incurred by State-Owned </H5>
Enterprises Through Reform 
  We should establish a socialist market economic structure so 
that there will be new historical conditions for the thorough 
resolution of the long-term problem of state-owned enterprises' 
achieving low economic efficiency. However, the market economic 
structure has to be established through reform and continuously 
improved. Therefore, only by further deepening reform can we 
once and for all resolve the problem of serious losses incurred 
by state-owned enterprises. 
  1. Deepening reform and changing the mechanism are the key 
to curbing losses and increasing profits. 
  Loss-making enterprises are the necessary cost to be paid 
for 
social and economic development. The point now is that losses 
have not become a driving force for the readjustment of the 
industrial structure and of the product mix and are not able to 
promote the flow and restructuring of assets. Although many 
state-owned enterprises make losses for years while the state no 
longer grants them subsidies, yet their losses are normally 
registered in the account book and some losses are, in practice, 
compensated for through increased loans. Fundamentally 
speaking, this practice whereby enterprises appear to assume 
responsibility for their performance but, in fact, do not assume 
any responsibility is caused by China's current enterprise 
system. The background to the unseparated government 
administration and enterprise management, which has long 
prevented state-owned enterprises from eradicating losses, is 
that government administration and capital are unseparated, 
namely that the government's function of social and economic 
management is not separated from the function of the owner of 
state assets. The background to the difficulty in guaranteeing 
enterprises' decisionmaking rights is the undefined property 
rights system. The background to the unsound self-restricting 
mechanism of enterprises is that there is no strict property 
rights restriction. Behind enterprise nonstandard behavior is 
the fact that enterprise owners are absent from management. We 
can say that all of the deep- seated problems regarding 
state-owned enterprise losses are directly related to the 
current enterprise system and its property rights relationship. 
Therefore, the key to curbing losses is to straighten out 
property rights relationships, establish the property rights of 
enterprise legal entities, change the management mechanism of 
state- owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise system 
in which the "property rights as well as the rights and 
responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government 
administration and enterprise management are separated, and 
scientific management is established," so that enterprises can 
become independent legal entities which operate independently 
and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses, receive 
economic interests, and assume responsibility for management 
risks. This is the market economy's essential demand on 
enterprises. Only by having enterprises operate independently 
and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses, can they 
become qualified competitors in the market, can they actively 
respond to market signals, and can effective market competition 
be established. 
  After we have defined property rights and thoroughly 
separated government administration and enterprise management, 
the functions of the government as the administrator of society 
and as the asset owner are separated and the control and 
management of state-owned assets are separated. The reaminder 
are only operational losses and thus the fittest will survive. 
When enterprises make losses, they should have their legal 
entities' assets reduced, whether they are purely state-owned 
enterprises or joint-stock enterprises which own state-owned 
assets. If an enterprise makes losses for a long time and its 
funds are insufficient to repay its debts, it should be declared 
bankrupt according to the provisions of the "Bankruptcy Law" and 
its managers and all its staff and workers will suffer losses 
such as losing their jobs. In the meantime, it is also 
necessary to remove all obstacles to property rights entering 
the market and establish a sound mechanism for asset 
restructuring. We cannot just compel loss-making enterprises to 
curb losses and increase profits but we must also enable 
enterprises which always make losses to have repeated 
opportunities for development. 
  2. Creating a fine external environment is the precondition 
for curbing losses and increasing profits. 
  The government should have a great determination to 
thoroughly change its functions, properly manage its own 
affairs, and delegate those functions which they should not 
retain. This is a big question regarding how the 
superstructure suits the economic foundation and promotes 
economic development. If no substantive progress is made in 
this respect, it is difficult to deepen reform or to curb losses 
and increase profits. To be specific, first, the 
government needs to exercise proper macroeconomic regulation and 
control and prevent great fluctuations in economic growth. 
It should, for example, properly control the scale of 
investment in fixed assets, otherwise it will disrupt the 
balance between the credit, financial, foreign exchange, and 
materials systems, causing a grim financial situation and 
mounting inflationary pressure. If so, industrial enterprises 
will have difficulty in maintaining normal production, let alone 
improving returns. Second, it is necessary to improve 
social service and change it to a reality wherein the government 
attends to society. Only by paying close attention to 
amplifying the social security system and to establishing the 
reemployment mechanism, removing various unequal policy 
environments as soon as possible, and surrendering the current 
enterprise function of attending to society back to the 
government can we make state-owned enterprises lay down their 
burden and develop without a burden. Third, the 
government should strengthen guidance for industrial 
policies. It is necessary to readjust the product mix with 
industrial policies so as to reduce the great losses arising 
from structural contradictions. 
  Moreover, we should formulate loss-curbing policies under 
the guidance of industrial policies and should support 
loss-making enterprises which engage in new industries, 
promoting the upgrading of their management and technology and 
equipment so that they can curb losses and increase profits. As 
for those loss-making enterprises engaged in sunset industries, 
we should switch them to other lines of production or declare 
them bankrupt. Fourth, it is necessary to actively and 
steadily proceed with price reform. Deepen price reform, 
remove price controls on all products that can enter the 
competitive market, subject their prices to the market, and 
prevent the government from interfering in the formation of 
their prices, so that the enterprises which produce and deal in 
these products can really become the main body of the market, 
creating conditions for enterprises to participate in fair 
competition. 
  3. Paying attention to the internal factors is the starting 
point for curbing losses and increasing profits, 
  The more important thing for enterprises is to 
thoroughly change the old habit of "waiting for, relying on, and 
asking from" the government and banks. Instead, they should 
look inward and make internal improvements. First, change the 
concepts and foster a strong market awareness. They should 
be in the forefront of market competition, organize production 
in keeping with market needs, quicken the pace of producing new 
generations of products, and make efforts to do better than 
others regarding product variety and quality and in new 
generations of products." Second, attach importance to 
product quality. Quality is the lifeblood of enterprises. 
They should foster the idea of putting quality first, 
vigorously proceed with and improve total quality control, 
establish a quality assurance system, and pay close attention to 
quality in various aspects. Third, strengthen enterprise 
internal management. As enterprises are having greater and 
greater decisionmaking rights, they should pay more attention to 
"strictness" and strengthen management. Their point is to 
strengthen the fundamental work of enterprise management and, 
particularly, to strengthen cost management, field management, 
equipment management, and group development, at the same time 
enforcing strict labor and processing discipline. Fourth, 
vigorously promote the technological progress of 
enterprises. In a period of speedy economic development, 
it is more necessary to rely on scientific and technological 
progress in order to curb losses and increase profits. By 
adopting new technologies, new techniques, new equipment, and 
new materials and enhancing the utilization rates of energy 
resources and raw materials, we miust insist on the road of 
mainly expanding the technological contents. Fifth, 
mobilize the masses and make concerted efforts to resolve the 
difficulties. It is necessary to bring into play the 
initiative and creativity of staff and workers and enhance their 
sense of assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses. 
It is necessary to adopt practical measures, such as 
stimulating staff and workers to put forward ideas and proposals 
and starting double-increases and double-savings [shuang zeng 
shuang jie 7175 1073 7175 4634] activities to really curb losses 
and increase profits. 
  4. Strengthen leadership is the necessary condition for 
curbing losses and increasing profits. 
  At the changeover of the old and new structures and with the 
unsound internal management mechanism of enterprises and the 
nonstraightened external environment, it is difficult to some 
extent to merely rely on an enterprise's own strength to improve 
its performance. Governments and supervisory departments at all 
levels should strengthen leadership of the work of curbing 
losses and increasing profits. First, establish the 
target responsibility system and further strengthen the 
mechanism of assuming responsibility for losses. It is 
necessary to delegate the target of curbing losses and 
increasing profits to enterprises, workshops, groups, and 
individuals and link the interests of staff and workers with the 
reduction and curbing of losses. Second, adopt specific 
loss-curbing policies. It is necessary to list the names 
of big loss-making units in the locality or in the trade, 
analyze the causes of losses in turn, put forward solutions, and 
set a time limit for them to curb or reduce losses. For those 
enterprises which have made losses over a long period of time 
and which are hopeless at curbing their losses, we should 
resolutely shut them down, suspend their operations, amalgamate 
them with other enterprises, or switch them to the manufacture 
of other products. Third, continue to pool and use the 
loss-curbing funds already established and help loss-making 
enterprises to curb losses and increase profits. In recent 
years, most places have set up special funds for curbing losses, 
supported and reinforced enterprise "blood-making" functions, 
and have obtained remarkable achievements. In the circumstances, 
the state should set aside some money to set up the loss-curbing 
funds and join hands with them in various provinces to curb 
enterprise losses.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese government 
has begun to tackle the problem of the loss of state property by 
improving legislation and tightening management. 
  The loss finds expression primarily in that, when a foreign- 
funded enterprise or a stock company is set up, assets of a 
state- owned enterprise are often not evaluated precisely. 
Consequently, these assets turn, through different channels, 
into assets of collectives, individuals or foreign investors. 
  A survey conducted last year shows that two-thirds of the 
10,000 state-owned businesses establishing joint ventures with 
overseas firms did not evaluate their state-owned assets. 
  Chinese economists estimate that the loss resulting from 
lack 
of evaluation or under-evaluation of state-owned assets when 
Chinese companies launch joint ventures with overseas firms 
amounts to 30 billion yuan a year. 
  The loss stemming from lack of evaluation or 
under-evaluation 
of state-owned assets when existing enterprises become 
joint-stock companies is also enormous, they say. 
  An official of the state-owned assets administration said 
that the unpaid use of state-owned assets to set up 
profit-making businesses and the existence of large numbers of 
money-losing state- owned companies also cause serious losses of 
state-owned assets. 
  He estimated the loss of such assets over the past decade at 
500 billion yuan in total. "The loss of tax revenues and the 
loss of state-owned assets have become two serious problems in 
China's economic life," he said. 
  The Chinese government has made it clear that the 
state-owned 
sector will serve as the mainstay of China's economy in the 
course of shifting to a market economy, he noted. 
  The state-owned sector is still growing despite the policy 
of 
encouraging the common development of multi-economic sectors, he 
said. 
  For example, the value of state-owned assets climbed 14 
percent in 1992 to 3,069.7 billion yuan. 
  The official said that the loss of state-owned assets runs 
counter to the Chinese government's reform policy. 
  Economists attribute the loss chiefly to the absence of a 
unified and effective system for managing state-owned assets, 
ill-defined functions of departments in charge of managing 
state-owned assets at all levels and loopholes in existing laws 
and regulations. 
  The Chinese government is now taking a series of measures to 
stem the loss, they said. 
  The most important measure is to evaluate state-owned 
assets. 
Last year 10,000 state-owned enterprises finished evaluating 
their assets, and another 10,000 will do so this year. 
  China currently has 1,000 accountants' and auditors' offices 
authorized by the government to evaluate such assets, the 
official said. 
  He said that when establishing a Sino-foreign joint venture 
or a joint-stock company, a state-owned enterprise must have an 
assets evaluation certificate approved by the state-owned assets 
administration. 
  He said that the standing committee of the national people's 
congress is drafting a law on state-owned assets and formulating 
a set of regulations on the supervision and management of assets 
in state-owned enterprises and another set of regulations on how 
to assess the increase in the value of state-owned assets. 
  He said that when a state-owned enterprise changes its 
property rights in the future it must evaluate its assets, 
define its property rights and clear its debts.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- To regulate its 
antismuggling efforts at sea and to strictly crack down on 
smuggling according to law, the General Administration of 
Customs [GAC] has amended the "Procedure Governing Customs 
Antismuggling Tasks at Sea" [the "Procedure"] and has further 
specified the regulations governing its antismuggling work at 
sea. 
  The new regulations stipulated: Customs departments will use 
antismuggling vessels and motor boats as their principal tools 
in conducting antismuggling tasks at sea. A customs 
antismuggling vessel has a gray hull and a white pilot-house. 
"Chinese Customs," written in Chinese calligraphy, is painted 
in red on both sides of the pilot-house. The PRC national flag 
will be at the top of the mast. A registration number 
consisting of two properly written Chinese characters and a 
three-digit number, such as "Customs 9xx (or 8xx, 7xx, 5xx, 
2xx)," is painted on both sides of an antismuggling vessel. 
Additionally, "Chinese Customs," written in Chinese, and a 
four-digit number are painted on both sides of an antismuggling 
motor boat, which has a warning light at its stern. While 
conducting official tasks at sea, customs antismuggling 
personnel will wear customs or marine antismuggling uniforms. 
Customs uniforms are black in color during spring, autumn, and 
winter. A customs official will wear black uniform pants and a 
white short-sleeved shirt during summer. He will also wear a 
white hat with a logo that bears the national emblem, wheat 
head, and the customs insignia. He will wear a black tie. 
Marine antismuggling work uniforms are blue-gray in color. A 
marine antismuggling official will wear an armband on the left 
arm of his jacket; and the armband has the customs insignia and 
"Chinese Customs" written in Chinese and English. He will wear 
a gray felt cap with a logo that is identical to the white hat, 
bearing the same national emblem, wheat head, and customs 
insignia. Antismuggling personnel carry customs work identity 
cards and investigation cards and will show them when conducting 
inspection duties. 
  It has been learned: The GAC urged all China's customs 
departments to strictly uphold the "Procedure" while conducting 
antismuggling tasks at sea. The GAC emphatically pointed out: 
Chinese and foreign vessels and crewmen may refuse an inspection 
at sea if a customs vessel conducting antismuggling examination 
has violated the above stipulations. 
  The customs regulations stipulate: While conducting 
antismuggling duties at sea, customs personnel can open fire, 
according to law, on smuggling suspects and vessels that disobey 
orders and try to escape, shield smuggling activities with arms, 
violently resist examination, or try to recover their 
confiscated contraband or other smuggling evidence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Continued Reform Vital to National </F>
Stability"] 
  [Text] Reform is the only way to guarantee a country's 
stability and development, government officials and economists 
said after reviewing China's economic progress in the first 
quarter of this year. 
  The economy has experienced a high growth rate this year, 
the 
Chinese Business Times newspaper reported on April 9. 
  But inflation has worsened. 
  "The most serious problems we face are inflation and the 
recession in the State-owned sector," said Wu Jinglian, an 
economist at the State Council's Development Research Centre. 
  In the first two months of this year, retail prices rose 20 
percent over the same period last year, according to the State 
Statistics Bureau. 
  And rising inflation is destabilizing. 
  For more than 10 years, economic development has been 
subject 
to central government policy fluctuations, which have in turn 
prioritized reform, development and stability. 
  And the economy has done very well encouraged by a policy of 
speeding up reform, which was affirmed during Deng Xiaoping's 
South China trip in the spring of 1992. 
  But economic chaos, particularly in the financial sector, 
has 
been an unwelcome side effect. 
  In July 1993 central government had to adopt measures to 
cool 
down the overheated economy and restore financial order. 
  And since then the stress has been on stability rather than 
development, as was affirmed at the Second Plenary Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this March. 
  Price control is essential for stability, said the 
newspaper. 
  And the government will do all it can to keep inflation 
below 
10 percent this year, three percentage points lower than last 
year, according to Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  Administrative measures have been adopted to control 
inflation, although the government understands that economic 
steps hold the key to solving what are, after all, economic 
problems. 
  Fresh milk has been set at O.9 yuan (10 cents) per kilogram 
in Beijing. 
  And since this price is 0.2 yuan (2 cents) lower than its 
real cost, the Beijing Milk Company is providing subsidies of 
1.5 million yuan ($170,000) for every 7,500 kilograms produced, 
according to Xiao Chunyuan, manager of the company. 
  The company only earned 10 million yuan ($1.16 million) 
profit last year -- 60 percent of which came from its tertiary 
operations. And after paying out the subsidies and 8.5 million 
yuan ($980,000) of value-added tax, the company actually earned 
nothing from its production and sales last year. 
  And the Beijing Milk Company is relatively healthy as 
State-owned enterprises go. Administrative obligations and the 
heavy burden of feeding retired and idle employees mean that 
many State companies are losing money hand over fist. 
  And keeping these companies going is part of the State's 
stability plan. 
  And inflation is better than unemployment, according to Li 
Yining, an economist at Beijing University. 
  As long as people are in work, endemic violence and crime 
can 
be avoided. Social stability is at stake, he said. 
  And stability does not mean stagnation, according to 
economists. 
  Modification of the State sector would help the enterprises, 
said Wu Jinglian. 
  Economist Du Runsheng said that privatizing State 
enterprises 
would reduce central government's financial burdens. 
  Luo Zhaohong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, said the nation's funds should not be wasted on 
rescuing a sector guided by outworn economic principles. 
  To ease the State's financial burden, about 100 billion yuan 
($11.5 billion) treasury bonds are to be issued this year. 
  The bonds are popular with investors because they pay more 
than bank savings, and are safer than stock and real estate 
investments. 
  But problems have occurred with non-governmental 
fund-raising 
the first three months of this year, said the newspaper. 
  Many companies took advantage of local development policies. 
They obtained local authority paper agreements promising 
favourable business terms, and then used these documents to lend 
credibility to local newspaper advertisements promising 
impossible returns. 
  The government has adopted measures to crack down on these 
fraudsters, said the newspaper.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Yu Xiaodong, 29, quit 
his job as a lawyer at the state-run Guizhou Economic Law Firm 
in southwest China to set up a private law office. 
  The Huaxia Law Office was set up with 120,000 yuan (14,900 
U.S. dollars) in investment provided by Yu and his two partners. 
  It has hired eight other lawyers and experts in finance, 
real 
estate and securities as consultants. 
  The Huaxia Law Office is only one among the burgeoning non- 
governmental law firms in China, a major change from the past, 
when all the lawyers were on the government pay-roll and called 
"state legal workers". 
  The latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that 
there were 502 non-governmental law firms in the country by the 
end of 1993, two and a half times the number in 1992 or 10 
percent of all the law firms in China. 
  This is part of a reform package to change the existing 
lawyer system, "to serve the nation's drive for a market economy 
and establishment of a democratic legal system," said Gan Jihua, 
vice- chairman of the All-China Lawyers Association. 
  The non-state law offices include co-operative and 
partnership and other forms of firms, he said, adding that the 
state firms are still necessary, especially in less-developed 
regions. 
  As a result of reforms since last June, China has witnessed 
remarkable progress in the number of lawyers and law offices, 
and their services to society, Gan said. 
  By the end of 1993 there were 66,700 lawyers, working as 
permanent legal consultants for 185,800 government agencies, 
enterprises and individuals. 
  They handled 483,300 domestic civil, commercial and criminal 
cases in 1993, and 18,400 cases with foreign interests involved 
-- 21.5 and 25.2 percent up respectively over the previous year. 
  Another reform measure was a decision to allow compatriots 
of 
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to take the examination for the 
lawyer's certificate on the mainland. 
  The Ministry of Justice also ratified applications by 41 
overseas law firms to establish branches in China. Some 200 
others are waiting to be approved, Gan disclosed. The Junhe Law 
Firm in Beijing opened China's first overseas law firm branch 
last August. China promulgated the "professional ethical code 
for lawyers" at the end of last year. The country's lawyers' 
law is still in the making, and is expected to be issued next 
year. Gan said the draft has been revised 11 times. It will be 
submitted to the State Council for discussion this year. 
  He said China's law industry still lags behind those in the 
developed countries. For instance, the number of lawyers in 
China accounts for 0.06 per thousand, while the rate in the U.S. 
is three per thousand. 
  Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said that the country will 
need 
75,000 lawyers in 1997, and 150,000 by the year 2000.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- China has published 
its white paper on population, the environment and development 
in the 21st century today, charting the course of the country's 
long-term economic and social development. 
  The white paper, "China's Agenda 21" was released at a press 
conference jointly held by the State Planning Commission and the 
State Science and Technology Commission. 
  Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning 
Commission, 
said that the Chinese Government has formulated the agenda in 
line with the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on 
the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 
1992. 
  He said that, in accordance with China's actual 
comprehensive 
conditions, the agenda puts forward overall strategies, 
policies, measures and plans to promote the coordinated and 
sustained development of the economy, society, natural 
resources, environment, population and education. 
  The agenda will become a guiding document for the 
formulation 
of China's long and medium-term plans for the national economy 
and social development, and will be embodied as important 
contents and objectives in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan 
(1996-2000) and the development program until 2010. 
  Meanwhile, it is also a manifestation of the seriousness in 
action and firmness in principle of the Chinese Government in 
implementing the U.N.'s agenda, he added. 
  The agenda is written in over 200,000 Chinese characters in 
20 chapters. It has 78 projected areas under four headings: 
Sustained Development Strategies, Social Sustained Development, 
Economic Sustained Development, and Rational Utilization of 
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. It was drafted 
by 300 experts and scholars from 52 government departments and 
social organisations. 
  At the same time, the Chinese Government has also organized 
related departments to draft "the priority projects plan for 
China's Agenda 21", with the first 63 priority projects selected 
in favor of international co-operation, on the basis of more 
than 500 project proposals. 
  Chen said that the implementation of the program will not 
only solve crucial problems such as population expansion, 
environmental deterioration and resources shortage, but also 
promote public participation so that sustained development in 
China can get experience which can help foster the economic 
development and environmental protection in the Asia-Pacific 
region, and throughout the world. 
  He said that the total input for the first priority projects 
is estimated at 3.76 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60 percent 
will be guaranteed domestically, while the other 40 percent will 
come from international co-operation. 
  The domestic part of the input will mainly come from 
government investment and loans, or be raised by the localities; 
while international co-operation will be carried out in forms of 
multilateral and bilateral co-operation, grants, loans, joint 
investment and BOT (building, operation and transfer). Chen 
said he was optimistic about the prospects for the financial 
support of these projects. 
  Chen said the United Nations Development Program has paid 
great attention to the drafting and implementation of "China's 
Agenda 21" and has decided to include the agenda in its 
co-operative projects with the Chinese Government.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese economists 
today forecast the country's gross national product (GDP) would 
increase by 11.5 percent this year. 
  The prediction was the latest made by economists from the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics 
Bureau. 
  The economists said that, normally, the economy will not 
experience a setback abruptly after it has rushed at high speed 
for two consecutive years. The growth rate is also welcome as 
it prevents ups and downs in the economy and maintains a stable 
social order. 
  "In addition, it benefits foreign investment and the income 
of the Chinese people," said economist Li Jingwen. 
  An improved economic environment, increasing investments and 
an expanded infrastructure last year will continue to play a 
firm role in pushing the economy, he said. 
  What the experts are anxious about is inflation, which has 
been rising for five months since the last quarter of 1993. 
  According to the Statistics Bureau, prices in the first 
quarter of this year went up more than 20 percent nationwide 
over the same period of last year. In 1993 China's inflation 
rate was 13 percent. 
  The economists attributed the driving up of prices to 
complicated factors, instead of the sole reason of imbalance in 
supply and demands. 
  However, they expressed satisfaction with the various 
methods 
which the government has adopted to curb inflation. 
  "If things go smoothly, the price hikes will be controlled; 
at the same time, the economy will avoid being stalled," Li said. 
  Last year the Chinese Government imposed a macro-control 
policy to cool down the overheated economy. But both officials 
and scholars said they hoped that the economy would continue to 
rise at a moderately high speed. 
  The economists noted that further GDP growth will be 
basically promoted by increased investment. Investment in fixed 
assets this year will stand at about 1,500 billion yuan, up 12 
percent over 1993. 
  "But we can bring fixed investment under control if we 
control new bank notes and loans," Li said. 
  The experts advised the government to move actively but 
cautiously in the reform this year to avoid uncertainty among 
the masses of the people. 
  They also predicted that the actual per capita income of 
urban residents will rise by 10 percent this year, and retail 
sales by 8.8 percent. 
  Meanwhile, urban bank deposits are expected to increase by 
26 
percent.

  [Text] Changchun, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The No. 1 Automobile 
Corporation Group in Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, is 
making efforts to expand its export volume. 
  Recently it exported 220 trucks to Thailand. Sources said 
that it was the group's third batch of trucks exported abroad 
this year, bringing the total shipped up to 735 trucks. 
  This month, another 900 trucks will be exported to 
Indonesia, 
Myanmar [Burma] and Laos. 
  The CA-142 Liberation truck is the major product of the 
corporation. Since 1991, the truck has been exported to 13 
countries and regions. 
  To expand its exports, the corporation has turned out 
automobiles according to the demands in different countries and 
regions. 
  Now it can make 12 kinds of trucks with different engines. 
  The corporation has also set up production bases in other 
countries, with the first a joint venture to assemble trucks set 
up in Tanzania in 1992. The venture has now begun production.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A former Executive 
Councillor and the former treasury secretary of Hong Kong had 
their telephones bugged for a long time because they had close 
relationship with China. 
  This was revealed by Alex Tsui, a sacked investigator of the 
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) during the 
second day of the inquiry into his sacking yesterday. 
  Tsui claimed he was ordered by his boss, Jim Buckle, to 
investigate Yeung Kai-yin, the former transport secretary and 
secretary for treasury, because Yeung was found to have a close 
relationship with the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch. 
  "Jim Buckle immediately wrote a report and shortly after 
that 
Yeung left the government," Tsui said. 
  Tsui also disclosed that former executive and legislative 
councillor "Rita Fan's (phones) had been bugged for a long 
period" in 1993. 
  In addition, he alleged that buckle was preparing a 
political 
target list for use by the British Government after 1997. 
  "He (Buckle) told me that we had to prepare a list of names, 
a list of targets. The targets will first be those who are 
involved in corruption,. "And later the list should include 
political targets," he said. 
  The list would collect all dirty things related to the 
targets. And these documents would shipped to Britain after 
1997, he added. 
  "Indeed, the ICAC has done the work of the special branch, 
that's true," Tsui said. 
  He deemed that a key reason for his dismissal was the 
conflict with Buckle over the change in the role of the ICAC to 
include political vetting. 
  However, ICAC official Jim Buckle issued a statement shortly 
after the hearing, saying what Tsui said is totally ungrounded. 
  Responding to the news coming to light yesterday, Fan, now a 
member of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory 
Committee for the Future Government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative region, said, "I would be very concerned if what 
Mr. Tsui said was true." 
  She warned that such an "intrusion into her privacy" could 
shatter the long-time image of the ICAC being an independent 
body committed to combating corruption. 
  Yeung, who resigned last September after 30 year's service 
in 
the government, reacted with shock, saying his close links with 
XINHUA officials were a result of his work. 
  But he asked, "since the signing the of joint declaration in 
1984, can you tell me who in the civil service has not had a 
close relationship with the Chinese side?"

<F P=106> [By reporter Shi Lujia (2457 7627 0163)] </F>
  [Text] London, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- The British Parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Select Committee issued a report on Sino-British 
relations on 13 April, openly supporting the perverse acts of 
Hong Kong Governor Patten and the British Government on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  The committee held eight hearings from July 1993 to February 
this year, to prepare the long report which is entitled: 
"Sino-British Relations Around 1997." At the hearings, many 
people of insight criticized Patten and the British Government's 
policy on the Hong Kong issue, called for setting sights on 
overall Sino-British relations and for cooperation with China, 
and opposed confrontation. However, ignoring the facts, the 
report asserts that Patten's constitutional reform package does 
not violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the "Basic Law," 
and the agreements reached between Chinese and British foreign 
ministers; and holds that Patten was correct in unilaterally 
announcing his constitutional reform package in October 1992 
without consulting China beforehand. The report states the 
committee supports the British Government in continuing to do 
things in its own way and in submitting the entire political 
reform package to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for 
examination. The report says: Given the current deadlock, it 
is impossible to win China's cooperation by revising the reform 
package. On the contrary, such an act will only draw opposition 
from a sizable number of people on the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council, impair the Hong Kong Government's prestige, and may 
jeopardize Hong Kong's stability and economic order. For this 
reason, the committee "supports the foreign secretary in 
refusing to strike a deal with China," and says the Hong Kong 
governor should submit "as soon as possible" the entire bill to 
the legislative council for examination. 
  Without the least reason, the report blames China for the 
slow progress in Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks, 
claiming that, if China continues to obstruct the group from 
holding further talks, the Hong Kong Government will have no 
choice but to submit the necessary legislation to the 
legislative council so Hong Kong's laws can be revised and made 
regionally-oriented before sovereignty is transferred to China. 
  Moreover, in the "political and foreign relations" section, 
the report suggests relations between the British Parliament and 
Taiwan's Legislative Yuan be strengthened; and urges the British 
Government to re-examine the status of Taiwan's office in 
Britain and to relax restrictions on it. The report also 
encourages Britain to discuss the so-called Tibet human rights 
issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. 
  Observers here have pointed out that, at a time when 
Sino-British relations are already in a very difficult state 
because of Britain's perverse acts over the Hong Kong issue, the 
British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report 
will inevitably create more adverse effects on relations between 
the two countries; therefore, the report should attract people's 
attention.

  [Text] Hong Kong 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The XINHUA 
News Agency Hong Kong Branch spokesman today made a statement on 
the report on Sino-British relations issued by the British 
Parliament Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The following is 
the full text of the statement: 
  We have yet to see the full text of the "report." Judging 
from the excerpts that have been revealed so far, we can see 
that the report by the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee has ignored the objective fact that Chris Patten's 
political reform package violated the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings reached 
between the Chinese and British governments, refused to adopt 
the suggestions of some official British participants that the 
British government resume cooperation on the basis of the 
agreements between the two sides, deliberately confused the 
truth, supported the British Government's policy of further 
confrontation with China, boosted Chris Patten's "three 
violations" political reform package, openly recommended that 
Britain play the "international card" on the Hong Kong issue, 
and openly advocate intervening in Taiwan and Tibet, which are 
China's internal affairs. The "report" also made wanton and 
unreasonable attacks on certain provisions in the Basic Law of 
the PRC Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The report is 
a negative example; it makes people see how veteran colonialists 
racked their brains in exploiting every opportunity to continue 
their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. However, all 
these efforts are futile. Nobody can change the Chinese 
Government's determination to reclaim Hong Kong and restore 
sovereignty over it as scheduled in 1997. The Chinese 
Government has announced more than once: We will establish the 
first government and legislature of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of the Basic Law and National People's Congress resolutions. No 
decisions made unilaterally by Britain during the transition 
period on key issues straddling 1997 will be recognized by China.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Some Hong Kong 
newspapers criticized the report released yesterday by the 
British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee as a 
"negative example", "self-contradictive policy" and "challenging 
report" in editorials published today. 
  "WEN WEI PO" said the report rendered a firm support to 
Chris 
Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, and his political 
constitutional reform scheme. It also declared that the British 
side would take its own action in the latter half of the 
transitional period. 
  This showed the intention of the British Government not to 
adhere to the principles of the Basic Law, and to refuse to work 
for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and try to put up 
new obstacles for the formation of the future government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
  The aim of pursuing a tough policy toward China by the John 
Major administration is to win support of the British Parliament 
and alleviate its domestic pressure, the paper said. 
  The "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" said, analysing suggestions 
raised in the report, one can see the British government is 
self- contradictive in its policy toward China. 
  For instance, it said, the report admits China will turn 
into 
an economic power in the next century and there is a need to 
keep a good relationship with China on the one hand, but advises 
the British Parliament to develop ties with Taiwan on the other 
hand. 
  It is known to anyone that China opposes the policy of "two 
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". If the British Government 
get in touch with Taiwan, its relationship with China will sure 
to fall back. 
  In addition, the report showed a wish to solve the 
Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong, but at the same time 
supported Governor Patten in his bid to deliver to the 
legislative council his political reform bill, which China 
strongly opposed, the paper added. 
  The "TA KUNG PAO" described the report as a "challenging 
report". It interfered in China's internal affairs without using 
any packing, it said. 
  It will be fruitless for the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee to cover up the fact that the British side sabotaged 
the Sino-British negotiations on the 1994-94 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong, the paper said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions of Policy"] </F>
  [Text] The conclusions of Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee are as unremarkable as expected. Having no power to 
alter British Government policy, and with no influence over 
China (except perhaps in provoking further outbursts of venom 
over British perfidy), the committee has largely confined itself 
to voicing support for the Governor's political reform proposals. 
  It endorses Chris Patten's handling of the reform package 
and 
the thinking behind it - even though it warns that the 
Government will have to weigh up how far China will be prepared 
to use economic weapons as a reprisal for democratic changes 
here and admits that Britain will be powerless to prevent China 
disbanding the Legislative Council elected in 1995. 
  Given the all-party support the Governor's policies have 
enjoyed to date, any different conclusion would have been 
astonishing. The Governor need not fear his stance will be 
undermined by Parliament in such a public manner, whatever may 
happen behind the scenes at the Foreign Office. 
  But in areas where it has gone out on a limb, the committee 
deserves a serious hearing. On matters of citizenship, it 
recommends that both the wives and widows of ex-servicemen and 
the non-Chinese ethnic minority population should be given full 
British citizenship. 
  It also has come out in support of proposals for a statutory 
Human Rights Commission, despite the negative attitude of the 
Hong Kong Government, and the Governor's assumption that this 
would antagonise China. The committee has been more outspoken 
on China's human rights record than anyone in the British or 
Hong Kong governments, and is scornful of those who claim to 
detect "significant progress" on this front. 
  Sadly, the ruling Conservative Party is too bound up in its 
own internal problems at present to heed the awkward suggestions 
of an all-party foreign affairs watchdog. Nevertheless, other 
Members of Parliament will take note. There is still hope the 
committee's positions will prompt some tough questioning of 
Government policy in future debates on Hong Kong, immigration 
and human rights.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- Vice Premier and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Qian Qichen met the director of 
the Hong Kong newspaper TA KUNG PAO, Mr. Wang Guohua, and the 
chief editor, Mr. Tsang Tak-shing, at the Diaoyutai State Guest 
House today. Mr. Qian was also interviewed on this occasion on 
a number of issues covering Hong Kong, Taiwan, the international 
community, and China's foreign affairs. 
  On the Hong Kong issue, Mr. Qian pointed out that a 
breakdown 
of negotiations between the Chinese and the British sides mainly 
affected the transition of the legislative body but not the 
administrative structure because it is subject to a major 
change, including the replacement of the administrative head but 
not the general civil servants. The legislative body should 
have remained intact through to 1997 but now it will have to be 
reelected. Other matters will be handled in accordance with the 
Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This meant 
that it was just a partial breakdown while the "one country two 
systems" will be adopted. 
  Mr. Qian said further that there would be no direct 
transition of the three-tier assembly to be seen in the 1994 and 
1995 elections to be held unilaterally by the British Hong Kong 
Government. It was, he said, up to the future special 
administrative region to set up another administrative structure 
by holding another election which would be based on the Basic 
Law and on the actual situation at that time. 
  Mr. Qian said that hopefully a steady transition was 
possible 
with concerted efforts by the Hong Kong people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China Firm on Its Own Agenda"] </F>
  [Text] Those who believe Hong Kong to be the centre of the 
universe will still be cheering the British Parliament's Foreign 
Affairs Committee (FAC) report long after others have forgotten 
it. 
  The down-to-earth majority will merely find confirmation 
that 
a handful of people in London, as in Hong Kong, remain mired in 
Tiananmen, long after the world and events have moved on. 
  Or are they using Tiananmen to inflate their own egos and 
one 
of several justifications for unstinting support of Governor 
Chris Patten's brand of political reforms for Hong Kong. 
  They also seem to be doing it in a most provocative fashion: 
urging self-determination for Tibet, strengthening diplomatic 
ties with Taiwan, calling for amendment to the Basic Law, as 
well as the internationalisation of Hong Kong. 
  It is unlikely that China will be provoked. Having decided 
to go its own way with the British abandonment of "convergence" 
and the "through train", Beijing will be inclined to ignore this 
toothless tiger and carry out its own plans for Hong Kong in 
1997. 
  The non-reaction cannot be unexpected to members of the FAC. 
Nor indeed, the British government. Sir Percy Cradock told 
them as much. 
  To quote the sinologist and architect on the British side of 
the Joint Declaration: "We have no legal obligation to put 
forward the Patten reforms... we have a moral and a political 
responsibility to push democracy as far as we can in Hong Kong 
in special circumstances. 
  "But that certainly does not cover pushing democracy to the 
point where the Chinese carry out a vicious backlash and undo 
much of what you have done before... It is of little benefit 
and of great damage to set up disputed arrangements which are 
merely going to be torn down in 1997 when the Chinese take over." 
  As sure as the sun rises that will now come to pass. And 
Beijing will do it without further discussion. 
  China's ambassador Mr Ma Yuzhen put it even more succinctly 
to the FAC: "You may be aware of a prevalent view expressed by 
some senior British officials that they do not believe China 
will re- establish Hong Kong's three-tier councils for fear of 
international pressure. 
  "May I say they are grossly mistaken if they really think 
so. 
In the absence of an agreement between China and Britain, China 
will definitely disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three-tier 
councils on 1 July 1997. 
  "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's 
three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the 
Basic Law. To say otherwise... is irresponsible and misleading 
to the British public and the people of Hong Kong." 
  Sir Percy thinks Hong Kong people will pay a price for this. 
The down-to-earth will find little solace in agreeing with him.

<F P=106> [By Chen Wei-ming (7115 1792 0682) ] </F>
  [Text]The British Keep Neither Faith Nor Dignity 
  According to a source in Beijing, an authoritative CPC 
person 
talked about the situation in Hong Kong in early March. He 
pointed out that the British unilaterally disrupted the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, unilaterally tore up agreements 
reached between the governments of the two countries, and 
publicly declared that those agreements were not binding. Such 
an act was unexpectedly committed in the 1990's, and by a state 
which claims to be democratic. This has exposed to the world 
the reputation of the so-called democratic state. How can its 
sincerity be trusted if it showed no consideration for its own 
dignity? 
  The authoritative person said: The British chose 
confrontation. Let them do it for as long as they wish. 
However, they must be clear that they cannot capitalize on Hong 
Kong for this purpose without end. We will not allow Britain or 
any hegemonist to lead us by the nose. The People's Government 
of China is not a government under the Ching Dynasty, nor like 
the Kuomintang Government, nor like Argentina, which can be 
bullied by military means. The British must be aware that if 
they go on with the confrontation, they will not attain their 
political motives. Conversely, they will lose the interests 
they originally had. We will certainly eliminate the influence 
of colonialism in Hong Kong, otherwise, we will not be able to 
justify ourselves to the Chinese nation. The era in which China 
was oppressed and controlled by others ended 45 years ago. If 
the British are unwilling to cooperate with us, we will no 
longer stretch out our hands in cooperation. It looks as if the 
tension and deterioration of the Sino-British relations will go 
on until the next century. 
China Keeps a Close Watch Over the Trends in Hong Kong [subhead] 
  The source added: A senior CPC official said recently at a 
discussion with nonparty personalities that after the foundation 
of cooperation was disrupted by the British, the CPC would keep 
a closer watch over British moves in politics, economics, and 
society in Hong Kong during the transition period, in accordance 
with Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Hong Kong issue. He 
said: We have clearly indicated that since the British chose to 
have confrontation rather than cooperation with China, all 
affairs unilaterally arranged by the British side must be 
terminated on 30 June 1997, and they will be examined and 
approved again by the sovereign state according to the Basic Law 
after the sovereignty of Hong Kong is handed over and the 
colonial rule put to an end. The "three-tier council system" 
masterminded and formed by the British side will also be 
terminated on 30 June 1997 as well. Some people spread the 
rumor that the British-style parliamentary system will remain in 
force after 1997. This is an idle dream, as well as cheap 
swindling, of the colonialists. 
  The aforementioned official continued: Moreover, we have 
clearly and repeatedly said that if drastic political changes, 
turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation emerge during 
the transition period, and if people plot to turn Hong Kong into 
an international political city, which will lead to economic 
chaos in Hong Kong, we will be forced to reconsider the timing 
and mode of recovering Hong Kong. 
  The official further said: We do not hope that such drastic 
changes, turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation will 
emerge, because Hong Kong is a territory of China, and Hong Kong 
compatriots are Chinese. The achievements made by Hong Kong in 
its construction are chiefly a crystallization of wisdom and 
diligence of the Hong Kong compatriots. However, as the British 
are playing their old tricks before pulling out of the colony, 
we must be prepared for the worst. Otherwise, we will commit a 
glaring blunder toward the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Government of 
Hong Kong sent 117 Vietnamese boat people back home today, under 
the voluntary repatriation program of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, despite a series of riots being 
continued at local detention centers. 
  The Vietnamese sent back home today included 51 men, 29 
women, 22 boys and 15 girls. 
  This brought to 3,425 the total number of Vietnamese 
migrants 
who had returned voluntarily this year, and to 42,038 the total 
number of returnees since the program started in March 1989. 
  Vietnamese boat people in the detention centers on the 
territory staged one after another rounds of demonstrations and 
hunger strikes since the multi-national meeting held in Geneva 
in February this year passed a proposal on the Vietnamese 
repatriation. 
  In a conflict at Whitehead Detention Center between Hong 
Kong 
police and camp prisoners last week, over 200 Vietnamese were 
hurt. A total of 557 canisters of tear-gas were reportedly fired 
at the detention center.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" by China editor Cary Huang] </F>
  [Text] Beijing is moving to press the Hong Kong government 
to change its newly formulated financial policy, which Chinese 
researchers claim to be a plot to create a "bubble economy" that 
will burst after 1997. 
  A research report suggests Beijing should urge the Hong Kong 
government to clamp down on speculative activities in the real 
estate market. 
  It proposes that the Chinese government should negotiate 
with 
the Hong Kong authorities to increase land supply and speed up 
the redevelopment of land in urban areas, thus easing the short 
supply of housing and cooling down the bubble economy created by 
property speculation. 
  It says overheating in the property market has greatly 
worsened Hong Kong's investment environment and undermined its 
status as an international business centre. 
  Chinese sources said yesterday that the report, jointly 
prepared by researchers from China-funded institutions and 
enterprises in the territory concluded that the Hong Kong 
government had amended its long-term financial policy to create 
a bubble economy in the runup to 1997. 
  Last month's 1993-94 Budget report presented to the 
Legislative Council by the Financial Secretary indicated a 
policy change by the authorities, Chinese sources cited the 
research findings as saying. 
  Following the breakdown of the 17-round marathon 
Sino-British 
talks over constitutional reform, the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office ordered local China-funded research institutions 
to conduct an overall study into the Hong Kong government's 
financial and economic policies in the later transitional period. 
  It was aimed at exposing any plot by the British to 
undermine 
Hong Kong's economy after its attempts in the political field 
failed. 
  The report said the Hong Kong government had moved to 
undermine the territory's financial basis by cutting its revenue 
structure. It had narrowed the tax base by cutting corporate tax 
from 17.5 per cent to 16.5 per cent and increasing the income 
tax allowance. 
  It said the corporate tax of 17.5 per cent was the lowest in 
the world as far as ratio was concerned, and the smallest in the 
world regarding share of total government revenue. 
  The report said every government should depend for its 
revenue mainly on direct taxation--corporate and personal income 
tax--as both reflected the overall economic situation of a 
community. 
  But the government had amended its financial policy to shift 
its revenue sources from healthy economic growth to speculative 
activities in property and stock markets. 
  "It sounds like repeating the experiences in South America 
in 
the 19th century," said a Chinese economic source referring to 
the bubble economy created by colonists. 
  The Hong Kong government was to blame for the overheated 
property market, and was the biggest speculator in the 
territory. Through encouraging speculative activities on the 
real estate market and receiving as much as 75 per cent of its 
revenue from the sector, the government was capable of cutting a 
healthy, substantial and steady revenue from other sectors. 
  The revenue structure was an apparent plot to undermine the 
financial position of the future Special Administrative Region 
government.

  [Text] Twenty local deputies to China's National People's 
Congress (NPC) have signed a letter requesting the full text of 
the verdict against jailed Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang. 
  They decided to press ahead with the request despite China's 
decision earlier this week to issue a statement on the offences 
allegedly committed by the Ming Pao reporter. 
  Eight deputies did not sign the letter. 
  Xi, a Chinese national living in Hong Kong, was arrested in 
Beijing late last year on charges of espionage and stealing 
state banking secrets. 
  He was tried in a closed court and sentenced to 12 years in 
prison. 
  In the past two days, local deputy Peter Wong has collected 
20 signatures from the 28 NPC local deputies for a letter to NPC 
chairman Qiao Shi requesting a full text of the verdict against 
Xi. 
  Among those who did not sign were Xinhua News Agency 
director 
Zhou Nan and his assistant Lee Wui-ting. 
  Surveyor Kan Fook-yee also refused to sign because, he said, 
it insinuated China had mishandled the case. 
  Educator Wong Kwong-hon refused to sign the letter because 
he 
did not want to be involved in the controversy over the case. 
  "I believe the verdict is reasonable under the Chinese 
judiciary system," he said.

  [Text] Facing an abrupt decline of up to 70 percent of 
inbound tourists from Taiwan, Hong Kong's tourism industry 
appealed to Taipei yesterday to reconsider its ban on tour 
groups visiting China. Howard Young, Legislative Council 
representative for the tourism industry, said the ban, imposed 
by Taipei in response to China's handling of the deaths of 24 
Taiwan citizens in a fire aboard a boat in Zhejiang last month, 
was "bad for Hong Kong". 
  A Taiwan travel agent predicted there could be as much as a 
70 percent decrease in Taiwanese arrivals in the territory. 
  A spokesman for the Taiwan Travel Agents Association said 
cancellations from customers planning to travel to China had 
been pouring in since the boat tragedy. With 1.8 million Taiwan 
residents entering Hong Kong last year, many of them en route to 
China, the impact of the ban on the territory could be 
formidable. 
  Taiwan is Hong Kong's No 1 tourism market, accounting for 
almost 20 per cent of all tourist arrivals. 
  Although not all China bound Taiwanese tourists stop in Hong 
Kong, those who do spend far more than the average tourist. 
HKTA [Hong Kong Tourist Association] figures show Taiwan 
tourists spent $13.9bn here last year. 
  The HKTA spokeswoman, Penny Byrne, said that since the ban 
applied only to group travel, the territory would not be as 
adversely affected as thought. 
  "Companies that specialise in group tour traffic will be 
hurt," Byrne said, adding that medium range hotels and retailers 
would feel the pinch the most. 
  Airlines which carry Taiwanese tourists to China are also 
expected to feel a significant impact, at least in the short 
term. These include Cathay Pacific, China Airlines and Dragonair. 
  A Dragonair spokesman said: "There must be some short-term 
impact." 
  A Taipei official at Cathay Pacific, which has up to 15 
flights a day to Taiwan, said the carrier had already begun to 
notice a drop- off in demand for Hong Kong-bound seats. 
  "We have seen some cancellations, mainly on group travel to 
China," he said. 
  A Cathay official said that because only 20 per cent of 
China- bound travellers came in groups, the airline did not 
expect to be severely affected. 
  Cathay estimates about 60 per cent of passengers boarding 
its 
Hong Kong flights go to China. 
  Hunter Eu, deputy director general of the Taiwan Tourism 
Bureau, said Hong Kong would definitely feel the ban. 
  One Taiwanese airline official said outbound travel to China 
was on the decline even before the boat tragedy as many tour 
groups had come back from China complaining about horrendous 
service.

  [Text] Hong Kong's senior customs official last night 
dismissed claims that the department is helping China crackdown 
on the smuggling of state secrets into the territory. 
  The Beijing-funded Hong Kong China News Service reported 
yesterday that Hong Kong last year passed to Shenzhen 
authorities 49 cases of "official document" smuggling. 
  Mainland customs officials said Chinese tourists wanted to 
sell economic and trade secrets. 
  Last night a legislator, Emily Lau, accused Beijing of 
"muddying the waters" by releasing the report soon after 
journalist Xi Yang was jailed for stealing economic secrets. 
  Don Watson, the Customs and Excise commissioner, said no 
documents were given to Chinese authorities. 
  "We have co-operation with the Chinese on a number of issues 
but not official documents," he said. 
  Mainland customs officials reported 20 cases of tourists 
trying to smuggle classified documents out of China in the first 
three months of this year.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's most 
developed county -- Wuxi, Jiangsu Province -- today opened a 
four-day trade fair in Hong Kong today, offering 50 projects 
involving about 100 million U.S. dollars. 
  The projects include an iron and steel plant, a power 
station, super markets, a gas plant, a sewage disposal factory 
and land releasing. 
  This is the second time Wuxi has given a trade fair in the 
territory since last year. 
  Wuxi is claimed to be the no. 1 county among China's top 100 
counties for two successive years because of its economic and 
social development. 
  In 1993, its GNP was 12.54 billion yuan (about 1.44 billion 
U.S. dollars), with a total industrial and agricultural output 
value of 48.024 billion yuan (about 5.52 billion U.S. dollars) 
and its exports were valued at 6.6 billion yuan (about 0.76 
billion U.S. dollars), ranking first in China.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Friendly Cooperation, Smooth </F>
Transition--Greeting the Seventh Anniversary of the Signing of 
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macao"] 
  [Text] Today is the day to commemorate the seventh 
anniversary of the signing of the joint declaration on the Macao 
issue between our government and the Portuguese Government. 
This date of great significance coincides with the visit to 
China by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who came 
to China to sign the joint declaration seven years ago. We 
warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the 
joint declaration and wish the current visit of Prime Minister 
Anibal Cavaco Silva full success. 
  The Macao question is one left behind by history. Our 
country, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one 
country, two systems," began talks in Beijing in June 1986 with 
the Portuguese Government on solving the Macao question. Based 
on a friendly, frank, and pragmatic spirit, both sides reached 
an agreement after a short period of nine months and, on 13 
April 1987, officially signed the joint declaration on the Macao 
issue. The joint declaration stipulates that the Macao region 
is Chinese territory, that the Chinese Government will resume 
sovereignty over Macao on 20 December 1999, that by then the 
Macao Special Administrative Region of the PRC will be 
established and will practice "one country, two systems," that 
Macao's current social and economic systems and way of life will 
remain unchanged and its laws will basically remain unchanged, 
and that, during Macao's transition period, the Portuguese 
Government will be responsible for administering Macao, and will 
continue to promote Macao's economic development and maintain 
its social stability, while the Chinese Government will 
cooperate in this area. The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration 
is a historic document of profound significance and has 
established a model for solving problems between countries left 
behind by history. The signing of the joint declaration enabled 
bilateral relations between China and Portugal to enter a new 
stage. 
  In March 1993, the First Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress examined and passed the Basic Law of the Macao 
Special Administration Region of the PRC. The Basic Law is 
Macao's fundamental law and has fixed in legal form the Chinese 
Government's basic principles and policies toward Macao as 
explained in the Sino- Portuguese joint declaration. It 
provides concrete regulations for the main contents of Macao's 
social, political, economic, cultural and other fundamental 
systems and has been warmly welcomed and extensively supported 
by the Macao compatriots. 
  Over the past seven years since the signing of the joint 
declaration, the friendly and cooperative relations between 
China and Portugal have developed smoothly. In recent years, 
the mutual visits by the senior leaders of China and Portugal 
have forcefully promoted the development of bilateral relations 
as well as the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal 
on the Macao question. Both the Chinese and Portuguese sides 
have seriously implemented the joint declaration and have 
carried out very fruitful cooperation. The Sino-Portuguese 
Joint Liaison Group has held 19 plenary sessions and many expert 
conferences. Both sides have made headway in a series of 
problems faced by Macao during the transition period, such as 
language, public service, law, and Macao's bid to join the 
relevant international organizations; both sides also 
successfully solved the problems of financing the construction 
of the Macao International Airport and the domain of aviation 
agreement. In recent years, the completion of large projects in 
Macao one after another have injected new vigor into Macao's 
economic development. Macao enjoys social stability and 
economic development, and its residents live and work happily. 
The sincerity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and 
Portuguese sides in implementing the joint declaration is the 
guarantee for maintaining Macao's stability and development. 
Seriously implementing the joint declaration and realizing 
Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999 
are in the common interest of both China and Portugal. Practice 
has proven that cooperation is good for both the Chinese and 
Portuguese sides and is good for Macao as well. 
  At present, Macao has approximately five years left in its 
transition period, and both the Chinese and Portuguese sides are 
facing some difficult tasks. As long as both sides set store 
for the overall situation of Macao's stability and development 
and consistently stick to close consultations and strengthen 
friendly cooperation, they can surely solve various problems 
arising from Macao's transition period and can create conducive 
conditions for Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of 
power. We believe that, with friendly cooperation and common 
efforts by both the Chinese and Portuguese sides, Macao's steady 
transition and smooth transfer of power can surely be realized.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan is embarking on a 
comprehensive war against trade in endangered species products, 
particularly rhino horn and tiger parts, an official with the 
Council of Agriculture [COA] said Thursday [14 April]. 
  The announcement comes on the heels of the US announcement 
Monday that it was hitting Taiwan with trade sanctions because 
of its unsatisfactory efforts to stop such trade. 
  Li Chin-lung, secretary-general of the COA, a cabinet-level 
organization directly in charge of carrying out Taiwan's 
conservation policies, said that to win the war, Taiwan will 
first have to carry out four major tasks requested of it in 
March by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES). 
  The four tasks include consolidating stocks of endangered 
species products, reinforcing marking of the products, 
accelerating the passage of a revised wildlife protection law, 
and tightening the crackdown on the trade, Li said. 
  Li said cracking down on the trade in rhino horn and tiger 
parts will be given top priority, and added that it would take 
from three to six years to fully comply with the CITES request. 
  Li made the pledge after a meeting between COA officials and 
officials from the Ministries of Finance, Economic Affairs, 
Justice, Education, and the Department of Health, all of which 
are expected to back the COA's action plan. 
  At the Executive Yuan, meanwhile, COA Chairman Sun 
Ming-hsien 
said a new conservation strategy would be mapped out within 
seven days. He also announced that a national wildlife 
conservation and plant protection conference will be held in 
mid-July. 
  Additionally, Sun said, another 130 conservation police will 
be added to the conservation army around the island, and more 
wildlife protection units will be established under central, 
provincial, and county governments. 
  COA efforts will also include strengthening conservation 
education programs and promoting information and personnel 
exchanges with Asian countries in conservation education, Sun 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs has authorized the United States to board and inspect a 
Taiwan trawler carrying suspected illegal Mainland Chinese 
immigrants, a ministry official confirmed Friday [15 April]. 
  "The U.S. has our full support...to inspect the Jinn Yih," 
an 
official with the ministry's Department of North American 
Affairs told CNA on condition of anonymity. 
  The Kaohsiung-based Jinn Yih, according to foreign wire 
service reports, was first spotted by American surveillance 
planes Sunday, 360 kilometers southwest of San Diego and heading 
toward the California coast. The United States suspects the 
vessel is carrying about 200 mainland immigrants. 
  After the ship was contacted by U.S. Coast Guard cutters, 
however, it did an about-face and headed westward, with the 
cutters trailing. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry official said the information 
he 
had indicated that the Jinn Yih was still headed toward Hawaii, 
and would probably not turn back toward the continental United 
States. As of Friday, the ship was 800 kilometers southwest of 
San Diego. 
  The Jinn Yih had been a drift net fishing boat before it had 
its license revoked by the Council of Agriculture in March 1993. 
The Council said it has not kept tabs on the ship since that 
time. 
  The official said the ministry is trying to contact the 
owner 
of the ship so it can uncover information on the cargo. 
  The SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE carried a report on the boat 
Thursday, quoting Stanley Wang, the Information Office director 
of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs in San 
Francisco, which handles private Taiwan-U.S. exchanges in the 
absence of official diplomatic links. 
  Wang said in the report that the ROC is eager to combat the 
smuggling of illegal mainland immigrants into Taiwan, where more 
than 20,000 illegal mainland immigrants have been arrested over 
a four-year period. 
  International criminal syndicates generally charge residents 
of Fujian Province on the Chinese Mainland more than U.S.$25,000 
each to be smuggled into the United States. Once there, the 
immigrants typically work in harsh conditions to pay off their 
debts, the CHRONICLE said.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan is expected to 
buy some 200 patriot missiles, similar to those used by the 
US-led alliance in the 1991 Persian Gulf war against Iraqi Scud 
missiles, informed sources and the producer of Patriots said 
Thursday [14 April]. 
  A spokesman for Raytheon Co. told CNA that "we expect Taiwan 
to buy Patriots, but we are still waiting for word from the 
Taiwan Government in order to finalize the deal." 
  He said that negotiations for the sale have been going on 
for 
sometime, and there are still some differences to be ironed out 
before a final deal can be reached. 
  Informed sources here said that the two sides have yet to 
agree on the price of the missiles and other matters. 
  The sources said that the patriot air defense system 
batteries Taiwan plans to purchase will be an improved version 
of the Patriots used in the Gulf war. 
  According to the US Defense Department, after studying the 
missile's performance in the war, the US Army and Raytheon have 
made both hardware and software improvements on the system aimed 
to increase accuracy.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan has suspended 
screening entry applications by Mainland Chinese citizens to 
protest what it said was Beijing's callous handling of the boat 
fire that killed 4 Taiwan tourists at the end of last month. 
  However, Liu Peng-chun, commissioner of the Bureau of Entry 
&amp; 
Exit, told the press Thursday [14 April] that the government has 
not restricted local people from visiting their relatives on the 
mainland. 
  "Visits to the mainland are handled in accordance with the 
statute on relations between people on Taiwan and the mainland," 
Liu said. "All that visitors are required to do is report to 
the government prior to their departure for the mainland." 
  Nevertheless, he pointed out, plans by government agencies, 
including the ministries of education and interior, to invite 
700 mainland professionals here have been halted. 
  The Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao Lake disaster were 
found dead along with two mainland guides and six crew members 
aboard a burned pleasure boat that had been taking them across 
the lake, which is in the eastern mainland Province of Zhejiang, 
on March 31. Relatives of the victims and Taiwan media have 
speculated that the tourists were robbed and murdered before the 
boat was set afire. 
  The incident strained relations between the two sides after 
Beijing refused to allow the relatives of the victims to return 
their bodies to Taiwan and limited their movement on the 
mainland earlier this week. 
  Also on Thursday, Premier Lien Chan again ordered relevant 
government agencies to help the victims' relatives seek 
compensation from Beijing.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- The Chinese Association 
for Human Rights Thursday [14 April] wrote the United Nations 
Human Rights Commission to call its attention to the March 31 
Qiandao Lake tragedy, in which 24 Taiwan tourists mysteriously 
died, and to the callous handling of the case by the Mainland 
Chinese authorities. 
  Kao Yu-jen, president of the Taipei-based human rights body, 
urged the UN commission to request the mainland authorities 
conduct a full investigation into the tragedy. 
  In his letter to commission Chairman Peter Van Wulfften 
Palthe, Kao said while travel accidents are not uncommon in any 
country, the Qiandao Lake incident was extraordinary, and the 
handling of the incident was inhumane and culpable. 
  All 32 people aboard the ship, including the Taiwan tourists 
and 8 mainland Chinese crew, were burned to death in a small 
room on the ship's lower deck while the boat was touring a 
scenic lake in Zhejiang Province, Kao wrote. 
  Zhejiang authorities conducted autopsies on some bodies 
without relatives' consent, in violation of Mainland Chinese 
law, and all news media were barred from the scene, Kao said. 
  "We are saddened at the loss of so many lives, and we are 
also disappointed at the outright disrespect of human rights and 
dignity on the part of the Chinese authorities in handling the 
case," he said. 
  In another letter to Jakob Moller, chief of the 
Communications Branch under the United Nations Center for Human 
Rights, Kao said people in Taiwan are grieved at the loss of so 
many lives, but they are especially shocked by the culpable and 
incompetent behavior of the Chinese authorities in handling the 
incident. 
  Kao noted that the families were ordered to sign papers 
stating that the death was "accidental," despite the fact that 
investigations into the incident had just begun. 
  Although the Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan in not a 
member of the United Nations, Kao wrote, Taiwan is certainly a 
member of the international community. He said that people in 
Taiwan want to know the answers to several prominent questions, 
including: 
  1. Why were all 32 victims found in the small, lower deck 
room with only one exit? 
  2. Why didn't the passengers attempt to jump overboard if 
a fire threatened their lives, especially the boat crew, who 
were believed to be good swimmers? 
  3. Why did the communist authorities insist on cremating 
the bodies near the accident site and refuse requests to move 
the remains to nearby Hangzhou for cremation? 
  4. Why were Taiwan reporters barred from the site and 
mainland news coverage heavily screened and edited before 
release? 
  Kao appealed to the UN Human Rights Center to ensure the 
mainland Chinese conduct a full investigation of the case and 
publicize any results.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan will hold 
bilateral tariff reduction negotiations under the framework of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with the 
Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand beginning April 25, the 
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) announced Thursday [14 April]. 
  BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will represent Taiwan 
at the talks, to take place in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok 
respectively. 
  The Philippines has requested Taiwan to slash import duties 
on 61 items, while Thailand has asked for lower tariffs on 33 
items, and Malaysia 24 items, Lin said. The tariff-cut requests 
focus on agricultural and fishery products, textiles, machinery 
equipment, and small cars, he added. 
  The forthcoming tariff negotiations will be the first such 
talks between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries. Taiwan has 
held similar talks with Australia, Chile, Hungary, New Zealand, 
South Africa, Turkey, and the United States. 
  Meanwhile, similar talks between Taiwan and Japan will be 
held April 27-28 in Tokyo. BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao 
will lead the Taiwan delegation to the Tokyo talks. 
  Bilateral tariff reduction talks with GATT contracting 
parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to 
the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 14 (CNA) -- A European 
union (EU) official Thursday [14 April] extended his support for 
Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) during a meeting with Republic of China [ROC] Economics 
Minister P.K. Chiang. 
  Leon Brittan, vice president of the Commission of the 
European Union, said however, that the EU is concerned about 
Taiwan lowering its customs tariffs and removal of non-tariff 
trade barriers, especially those related to the import of 
European wine and liquor. 
  Brittan also asked Taiwan to bring its government 
procurement 
program and service market into line with regulations laid down 
in the GATT Uruguay Round accord. 
  Brittan said before Taiwan enters GATT it must remove trade 
barriers and adjust its custom tariffs. 
  Chiang asked Brittan to submit an EU list of desired tariff 
reductions as soon as possible, so that both sides could engage 
in bilateral talks in the near future. 
  Chiang, who met with Brittan for 45 minutes, was accompanied 
by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and the Board of 
Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Yen-chao. 
  Meanwhile, the Taiwan delegation to the GATT ministerial 
meeting here earlier met with Swiss Public Economy Minister 
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. 
  Delamuraz and Chiang discussed Taiwan's plans to open its 
service market, especially the financial and insurance sectors. 
Chiang also asked Delamuraz to submit a tariff reduction list 
so that Taiwan can begin bilateral talks with the Swiss before 
June, when a GATT working party meeting on Taiwan's membership 
bid is set to meet. 
  Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade body in 
1990 and was granted observer status in September 1992. It 
hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

<F P=106> [By C.C. Chen and Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] London, April 13 (CNA) -- A group of influential 
British parliamentarians Wednesday [13 April] called for world 
support of Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  Speaking at a news conference after they unveiled a report 
on 
Britain-Mainland China relations, the lawmakers also suggested 
that the world find a way to give Taiwan a voice in the United 
Nations. 
  The report, prepared by the House of Commons' Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee, also reviews Taiwan's role in political and economic 
development in the Asia-Pacific. 
  Noting that Taiwan is seeking increased presence on the 
world 
stage, the report says other countries can effectively help 
Taiwan gain a say in world affairs by supporting Taiwan's GATT 
bid. 
  As one of the world's major trading powers, the report says, 
Taiwan should be admitted to the Geneva-based world trade forum 
as soon as possible, regardless of the result of Beijing's GATT 
membership application. 
  The report notes that Taiwan has applied to join GATT as a 
separate customs territory, not a country. "This probably can be 
used as a model for Taiwan to join other international 
organizations," the report says. 
  It adds that Taiwan should be allowed a voice in the United 
Nations. Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since 
Beijing assumed the UN China seat in 1971. 
  The report continues that the world is obligated to persuade 
Communist China to continue its gradually expanding exchanges 
with Taiwan. It further advises the world, particularly 
Communist China, to take into account Taiwan's desire for a 
formal place in the international community. 
  The report urges the British Government to further improve 
relations with Taiwan and better its treatment of Taiwan 
representatives in London. 
  The 110-page report is the result of a year-long study by 
the 
11-member Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee held a 
series of public hearings on prospects for London-Beijing ties 
and its members also visited Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland 
China to collect information about developments in the three 
Chinese societies. The report is expected to become an 
important reference for the British Government to formulate its 
future policy toward Beijing and Taipei. 
  The committee's chairman, David Howell, said he was 
impressed 
by Taiwan's democratic reforms during his trip to Taipei last 
September. 
  Howell pointed out that improvements in Taipei-London 
relations are not related to conflicts between Britain and 
Mainland China over Hong Kong, which reverts to communist rule 
July 1, 1997. 
  "Britain should attach greater importance to its ties with 
Taiwan since Taiwan has a dynamic booming economy and a 
gradually maturing democratic system," Howell added.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance 
has decided to limit the amount of fruit travelers can bring 
into Taiwan to two kilograms, down from the current six kgs, 
customs officials said Thursday [14 April]. 
  The decision was made after years of abuse of the 6 kgs rule 
and after calls from customs officials to forbid the tourist 
import of fruit. 
  In 1993, the Council of Agriculture asked customs to boost 
its enforcement of the regulations, as illegal fruit retailers 
were abusing the rules by asking tourists to help them import 
large quantities of duty-free fruit. 
  The abuse caused grave concern among fruit growers in Taiwan 
and led the Directorate General of Customs to suggest 
prohibiting tourists from bringing in fruit altogether. The 
proposal, however, was rejected because it violated consumer 
rights. 
  The Ministry of Finance finally resolved the dispute by 
cutting the legal fruit import limit to 2 kilograms. The new 
limit will take effect after approval by Finance Minister Lin 
Chen-kuo.

  [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Four Taiwan legislators 
left for the Netherlands Wednesday [13 April] to sue the United 
Nations in the International Court of Justice in the Hague for 
refusing Taiwan entry into the world body. 
  The four-member group, headed by Chen Tze-nan, deputy 
convener of the legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic 
Progressive Party [DPP], will also visit Geneva, where they will 
ask the UN Commission on Hunan Rights to condemn Beijing for its 
callous handling of the Qiandao Lake disaster in southeastern 
China, in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. 
  The three other members in the group are [first name 
indistinct] Chang and [first name indistinct] Chen of the DPP 
and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling Kuomintang. 
  Chen said prior to his departure that the group will ask the 
Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, which is based 
at the Hague, an "alternative United Nations" founded in the 
Netherlands in 1991 by ethnic minorities and peoples seeking 
independence, to file the lawsuit in the international court on 
behalf of Taiwan. 
  "It is a fact that Taiwan is a sovereign country, and it is 
unreasonable for the United Nations to keep us out," Chen 
explained. 
  Mainland China took Taiwan's UN seat in 1971 and has since 
blocked Taipei's attempts to regain membership in the world 
organization. Last September, the UN General Assembly, under 
pressure from Beijing, rejected a proposal by 10 Central 
American countries to have the body discuss UN membership for 
Taiwan. 
  "Our move mainly aims to arouse the attention of 
international news media to how unreasonably Beijing has blocked 
Taiwan's movements on the world stage," Chen stressed.

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A Taiwan food industry 
delegation left Friday [15 April] for Subic Bay in the 
Philippines, where it will look at investment possibilities. 
  Led by Fu Kuang-yen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Gourmet 
Powder Industrial Association, the group comprises a dozen 
senior business executives. 
  Group members include Secretary-General Shen Ta of the 
Taiwan 
Association of Frozen Food Industries, Secretary-General Wang 
Yuan-chuan of the Taiwan Regional Association of Carbonated 
Beverage Industries, and Secretary-General Shih Fu-yuan of the 
Taiwan Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers. 
  Taiwan and the Philippines are jointly building a 
325-hectare 
industrial park in Subic Bay, and Lu said Taiwan investors could 
use the site as a production base from which they could sell 
foodstuffs to neighboring Vietnam and Singapore, whose residents 
have a taste for Chinese food. 
  The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei on Tuesday. 
  Meanwhile, Vice Chairman Wu Kuan-hsiung of the China 
External 
Trade Development Council (CETRA) will head a mission to the 
Philippines and Indonesia beginning April 24. 
  Wu said the CETRA mission will go to Subic Bay and to Batam, 
Medan, Surabaya, and Jakarta in Indonesia to seek trade and 
investment opportunities for Taiwan's machinery manufacturers. 
  The visits of the two delegations are regarded as part of 
domestic investors' efforts to push for increased investments in 
Southeast Asian countries in response to the government's 
southern strategy.

billion of investment into Indonesia in the coming three years, 
part of the effort to comply with the government's go-south 
investment policy. Vice Economic Minister S.J. Lee made these 
remarks at a press conference held after his return to Taiwan 
from a 9-day trip to Indonesia as the leader of the 33-member 
Taipei delegation. The group comprised senior executives from 
state-run enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs. Lee said his ministry will try to speed up 
efforts to materialize the go-south investment policy, greatly 
advocated by both President Li and Premier Lien, by helping 
government-owned and private enterprises with investments in 
Southeast Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Vietnam, and 
the Philippines. During the 9-day stay in Indonesia, senior 
executives of seven state-run enterprises and their Indonesian 
counterparts reached a consensus on 13 joint venture investments 
and technical cooperation projects.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan 
Power Company will begin commercial single-cycle operation of 
its Hsinta plant near Tainan in mid-1995, with gas turbines and 
other power generation equipment provided by Siemens, a global 
electronics-electrical firm. 
  Siemens' Milwaukee-based Power Generation Group (PWU) said 
Thursday [14 April] that at least eight of the 15 gas turbines 
ordered by Taipower will be manufactured, assembled, and shipped 
to Taiwan soon. 
  With the equipment, Taipower's Hsinta plant will become the 
largest power plant on the island, a facility capable of 
producing 2,364 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power a 
city of more than two million residents. 
  When the Hsinta plant begins combined-cycle operation in 
1998, it will become the world's largest power plant for 
60-hertz cycle generation. Electricity in Taiwan, like in North 
America and several other countries in Asia, is generated on a 
60-hertz cycle, it added. 
  The gas turbines to be installed in the Hsinta plant are 
worth about US$500 million, and are Taipower's second order from 
Siemens. The first gas turbines manufactured at the PWU were 
exported to Taipower's Nan Pu Combined-Cycle Power Station in 
1992. 
  In addition to the gas turbines, Siemens will supply five 
steam turbines, 15 heat recovery steam generators, plant 
instrumentation and controls, and other equipment to Taipower. 
  Taipower will begin to add the steam turbines to the Hsinta 
plant's gas turbine operation in late 1996.

hopes to strengthen trade ties with Taiwan, Economic Affairs 
Minister P.K. Chiang [words indistinct] Taiwan minister made the 
statement after meeting with Sri Lanka's Trade and Commerce 
Minister A. R. Mansoor, who is leading a delegation to the 
ongoing ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  Chiang is heading a 15-member Taiwan delegation to the 
four-day GATT meeting, which opened Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Both sides exchanged views on how to boost bilateral trade 
cooperation, he noted. 
  Chiang said he also expressed Taiwan's willingness to 
promote 
trade ties with Sri Lanka. 
  "I told my Sri Lanka counterpart that any bilateral 
relationship would be substantially strengthened if official 
trade offices could be established in each other's territories," 
he said. 
  The offices will certainly help protect the interests of 
traders and investors, thereby paving the way for increased 
trade exchanges, he elaborated. 
  The Sri Lanka minister pledged he will convey the proposal 
to 
the Colombo government and work on ways to promote trade with 
Taiwan, he added.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A ranking police official 
on Friday [15 April] denied the US accusation that Taiwan has 
become a drug transit center. 
  Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police 
Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here 
seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms 
of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of US 
dollars. "Without the police crackdown, those drugs would have 
been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other 
countries," he said. 
  The US State Department submitted the 1993 International 
Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress earlier in the 
month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production of illicit 
amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in the 
laundering of drug money. 
  According to the report, Taiwan has become an important 
Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of 
the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy 
merchant marine traffic. 
  Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, 
admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against 
drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only 
NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by 
Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared 
with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States. 
  He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug 
addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can 
get help to kick their habits. 
  Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of 
drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154 
kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993. 
  Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on 
May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade 
heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide 
campaign against drug smuggling.

  [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China said Thursday [14 
April] that, while its return to GATT does not depend solely on 
the good will of the United States, it would like US support for 
its candidacy. "There are 105 contracting parties in GATT and 
the United States is only one. While we notice the importance 
of the United States, it is also clear that the United States 
cannot be equated with GATT," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen 
Guofang said during a weekly news briefing. Shen was reacting 
to remarks by US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who said 
Tuesday that China must open its market more if it wants to 
rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  A founding member of GATT, China left the organization after 
the founding of the communist regime in 1949 and requested 
readmission in 1986. Beijing wants to rejoin GATT this year in 
order to take part in the future trade organization that will be 
created in January 1995. China's reintegration is one of the 
main topics at the Marrakesh, Morocco, summit where the final 
GATT accord concluding the Uruguay round is to be signed. 
  While implicitly rejecting Kantor's criticism, the spokesman 
said, China wanted the United States to support China's 
candidacy. "We have also noted that the US government has 
repeatedly promised to staunchly support China's re-entry to 
GATT. We hope that that United States will make good on this 
promise," Shen said.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry said here today he took "full 
responsibility" for the incident in which two U.S. helicopters 
were shot down by two U.S. fighter planes in Northern Iraq this 
morning. 
  Perry told reporters at a special news briefing that the 
helicopters were Army UH-60 Blackhawk and the fighter planes 
were Air Force F-15c. 
  The incident took place at approximately 35 miles north of 
Irbil in Iraq at about 3:30 am eastern daylight time when the 
helicopters were attacked by missiles fired by the fighter 
planes. 
  "Apparently the U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified 
as Iraqi Hind helicopters operating in the northern no-fly 
exclusion zone," Perry said. 
  There were about 12 American crew members on the two 
helicopters and more than 20 passengers including U.N. officers 
from several nations. 
  Visiting British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind said at 
the 
news briefing that two British officers were likely to be killed 
in the incident. 
  Perry expressed regrets over the tragic incident, adding 
that 
"I take full responsibility for today's tragedy" and "I pledge 
that I will take a direct role in ensuring that the 
investigation is conducted as thoroughly, as quickly as 
possible." 
  General John Shalikashvili also expressed "deepest sorrow 
and 
regret" over the incident, saying that "as chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff I feel a sense of personal responsibility for 
this tragedy and the loss of so many lives."

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- A delegation of 
leading Chinese business executives will travel with Premier Li 
Peng on his official visit to four Central Asian nations next 
week, as a way to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  This will be the first time for a delegation of business 
figures to accompany a top government leader on a trip abroad. 
  The entrepreneurs' delegation will be led by President Zheng 
Hongye of the China Council for the Promotion of International 
Trade (CCPIT). It will include executives of the China 
National Construction Engineering Corporation, China National 
Petroleum Corporation, China National Textiles Import and Export 
Corporation, China Electronics Import and Export Corporation, 
and an iron-steel industrial and trade group, which has grown 
largely from the previous China Metallurgical Import and Export 
Corporation. 
  For the business figures to travel with the head of 
government has been arranged in the light of international 
practice, said Zheng Hongye in an interview with XINHUA. 
  He added that it would on the one hand help enrich the 
program and results of the visit, and on the other hand, serve 
to propel bilateral economic and trade cooperation, thus helping 
the Chinese entrepreneurs to open up the world market. 
  The new practice, introduced against the backdrop of China's 
efforts to speed up the establishment of a socialist market 
economy, is very conducive to the expansion of foreign economic 
and technological cooperation, Zheng said, adding: "This is 
also meant to let diplomacy better serve reform, opening and 
economic development." 
  An advance group has made a study tour of Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, with what Zheng called 
"generally good" results. 
  During Premier Li's visit, the Chinese entrepreneurs will 
meet and talk with their local counterparts on possibilities or 
even specific projects of cooperation in the fields of 
construction, textiles, electronics, telecommunications, 
metallurgy, petro- chemical and mineral resources, with the 
prospect of signing a range of agreements or letters of intent, 
according to Zheng. 
  The CCPIT last year welcomed large groups of business 
personalities who travelled with leaders of their countries on 
trips to China. 
  "This has produced a positive impact on the enhancement of 
mutual understanding and cooperation between Chinese and foreign 
business circles," Zheng said. 
  China and the four Central Asian nations, which are close 
neighbors, with highly complementary economies, enjoy vast 
potential for expanding cooperation, Zheng said. 
  The arrangement for business figures to travel with the 
first 
top Chinese leader on a visit to Central Asia reflects the 
importance China attaches to developing trade and economic 
cooperation with the four nations, he said.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has extended its dragnet on dissent, 
detaining another leading intellectual who was active in the 
official Protestant Church and sympathetic towards the free 
labour union movement. 
  Xiao Biguang, a professor of Chinese literature at Beijing 
University, was detained by six officers from the ministries of 
Public Security and State Security at his home on Tuesday. 
  His home was searched and several books and manuscripts were 
confiscated, a relative said. 
  Prior to his detention, Professor Xiao, 32, had been under 
constant police surveillance for about week. 
  He is being held under a "shelter and investigation" order 
issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau and has not been 
allowed visits from his family. 
  The police did not say why he was being detained. 
  The detention order simply stated that he had engaged in 
"illegal activities" related to State Council Document No 56, 
issued in 1980, an administrative decree on the use of "shelter 
and investigation", which technically has no legal basis. 
  However, Professor Xiao was a friend and colleague of the 
well- known jurist and labour activist, Yuan Hongbing, who was 
detained last month. It is believed Professor Xiao might have 
been detained in connection with Mr Yuan's case and or his work 
in the official Protestant Church. 
  Mr Yuan was detained on March 3 in the southwestern city of 
Guizhou and has been kept incommunicado ever since. 
  His wife has been to the Ministry of State Security in 
Beijing four times to inquire about her husband's whereabouts 
but officials at the ministry refused to discuss the case. 
  When she tried to contact the Guizhou State Security Bureau, 
officials denied knowledge of Mr Yuan's arrest. 
  Another labour activist, Zhou Guoqiang, who was detained in 
Beijing at the same time as Mr Yuan has also been refused 
contact with his relatives. 
  Meanwhile, a government spokesman has defended the crackdown 
on dissent saying all those detained or arrested in the past six 
weeks were not democracy activists but "criminals" many of whom 
were still on parole. 
  "While such criminals are on parole, the Chinese judicial 
authorities have the right to take action against them," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said yesterday. Mr Shen 
criticised Western politicians and journalists for concentrating 
on a few famous dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and not looking 
at the wider human rights situation in China. 
  The case of Mr Wei was not a human rights problem, he said. 
  "Human rights is not about releasing criminals and other 
irrelevant issues." 
  Mr Shen said many Western journalists did not understand who 
Mr Wei really was but when asked if he himself had met the 
former Democracy Wall activist, he dodged the issue. 
  "Just meeting someone is not necessarily the best way to 
understand them," he said.

  [Text] MING PAO has been informed by its lawyers in 
Beijing that after hearing Xi Yang's appeal, the court upheld 
the guilty conviction and the 12-year jail sentence. MING PAO 
workers will hold a massive protest tonight. Cheung Sau-wan 
reports: 
  [Beginning recording] [Cheung] After deliberating on all the 
details of Xi Yang's appeal this morning, the Beijing Municipal 
Higher People's Court upheld the original sentence, that is, the 
12- year jail term and the deprivation of all political rights 
for two years. The written decision has been handed to Xi Yang. 
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court spokeswoman, a Miss 
Fan, said that the court had examined all the evidence and 
arrived at the decision on the basis of law. 
  [Fan, in Mandarin] The Beijing Municipal Higher People's 
Court on the morning of 15 April made a public announcement 
about its decision on the Xi Yang case. The result was to 
uphold the guilty conviction, the reason being that, after 
examination and a hearing, the court judged that the 
intermediate court's verdict complied with the law. 
  [Cheung] The spokeswoman also said that Xi Yang was present 
when the decision was read out this morning and learned of the 
result right away. She also said that because Chinese law takes 
the second trial hearing to be the final appeal, the defeat of 
an appeal against conviction means that no more appeals can be 
lodged. After the written decision was announced, Xi Yang was 
immediately whisked away to a penal institution to begin serving 
his sentence. 
  [Fan, in Mandarin] After the decision was announced he was 
sent to a penal institution to serve his sentence. The whole 
thing ended after the decision had been announced. 
  [Cheung] MING PAO learned of the failure today through its 
Beijing lawyers and has decided to hold a massive protest 
tonight. Cheung Sau-wan, Commercial Radio. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Eighth Plenary Session of the Discipline 
Inspection Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee 
was held in Nanchang this morning to convey and implement the 
spirit of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, sum up the province's anticorruption work 
in the previous period, and work out a plan for the work in the 
next stage. Of the 29 members of the provincial discipline 
inspection commission expected to attend the session, 25 were 
present. Also present at the session were 295 persons including 
secretaries of the prefectural, county, and city discipline 
inspection committees, supervision bureau directors of 
prefectures, counties, and cities, and persons in charge of the 
discipline inspection and supervision organizations of units 
directly under the provincial government and universities and 
colleges. Provincial leaders Mao Zhiyong, Zhu Zhihong, Lu 
Xiuzhen, Ma Shichang, Shu Huiguo, and Feng Jinmao; and Huang 
Minxin, Xie Li, and Jia Yian, deputy secretaries of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission, attended the 
session. The Central Discipline Inspection Commission also sent 
people to attend the session. [passage omitted] 
  At the session, Xie Li and Jia Yian conveyed General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Wei 
Jianxin's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission. On behalf of the Standing 
Committee of the provincial discipline inspection commission, Ma 
Shichang, Commission secretary, delivered a report entitled 
"Submit to the Overall Interests of the Entire Party, 
Unswervingly Carry Out the Anticorruption Struggle." Provincial 
Party Secretary Mao Zhiyong made an important speech. 
  In his speech, Mao Zhiyong pointed out: Carrying out the 
anticorruption struggle in a thoroughgoing, sustained, and more 
effective way is an important guarantee for deepening reform, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability. It is 
necessary to approach the struggle from the strategic height of 
safeguarding reform, development, and stability, and to work 
hard to achieve good results in the struggle. As far as 
anticorruption work in the next stage is concerned, stress 
should be placed on continuing to implement the three tasks, 
encouraging honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres in 
performing official duties, intensifying investigation and 
handling of major and important cases, and effectively checking 
unhealthy practices. He stressed: In carrying out the 
anticorruption struggle, we should have a firm grasp of economic 
construction, the center of all our work, to enable the struggle 
to better serve economic construction and reform and opening up 
to the outside world. In terms of work planning, we should 
carry out anticorruption work simultaneously with reform and 
development tasks. We should closely follow the major measures 
taken in reform and development and inspect law enforcement. In 
determining and handling cases of economic discipline 
violations, we should make a specific analysis of specific 
cases. He urged: We should solve deep-seated problems of 
corruption by deepening structural reform, pay close attention 
to the departments and links where corruption emerges most 
easily, and by deepening reform establish and improve an 
internal management system, a supervisory mechanism, and laws 
and regulations. He stressed: Party committees and governments 
at all levels should have the overall situation in mind and 
effectively strengthen leadership over the anticorruption 
struggle. 1. Party and government organizations should work 
together to carry out the anticorruption struggle under the 
leadership of the party committee, with principal leaders taking 
charge personally. 2. We should strengthen inspection and 
supervision and give specific guidance in specific matters. 3. 
We should vigorously support the work of discipline inspection, 
supervision, and judicial organs. 4. We should guide the 
anticorruption struggle through correct public opinion. 
  In his report, Ma Shichang, Standing Committee member of the 
provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission, reviewed the main aspects of 
work since the commission's seventh plenary session. [passage

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, provincial leaders Yan 
Haiwang, Lu Kejian, Zhang Wule, and Sun Ying attended the 
discussion of the delegation of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous 
Prefecture attending the Second Session of the Eighth Provincial 
People's Congress. 
  Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang pointed out: To 
develop Gannan Prefecture's economy, it is necessary to attach 
importance to the gap in economic development, heighten the 
fighting spirit, and unite as one to carry out the work. While 
affirming the development achievements already made by the 
prefecture, Yan Haiwang said: On the basis of implementing the 
preferential policy given in the past to the economic 
development of minority nationality areas, the provincial 
authorities must continue to give them powerful support in 
various fields of endeavor. While developing its economy, the 
prefecture must base itself on self-reliance and hard work, 
acknowledge the gap of economic development, shun from regarding 
it as a mental burden, heighten its fighting spirit, not lose 
sight of its achievements, and accelerate development. He urged 
greater national unity and proper handling of the relationship 
of reform, development, and stability. 
  At the discussion, Zhang Wule remarked: While developing the 
economy, Gannan must bring its superiority in natural resources 
into full play, make vigorous efforts in opening up to the 
outside world and developing its natural resources, and turn 
superiority in natural resources into real economic superiority. 
Meanwhile, the provincial authorities must make a resolution to 
do more solid things for the prefecture. 
  At the discussion, Lu Kejian and Sun Ying also said: As a 
piece of treasured land, Gannan has huge development potential 
and is highly promising in further development. Now they should 
[words indistinct]. They hoped that the people of all 
nationalities in the Gannan Prefecture would be of one heart and 
one mind, would manage themselves increasingly well, and would 
strive for ever greater development.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730) "Yanshan </F>
Petro-Chemical Corporation Expands Economic-Technical 
Cooperation With Fangshan District"] 
  [Text] On 29 March the Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation 
of Beijing Municipality and the Fangshan district people's 
government jointly sponsored the second work conference on 
economic and technical cooperation. The personnel from both 
sides happily got together and signed an agreement amid an 
enthusiastic atmosphere on the continuous expansion of economic 
and technical cooperation. Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, attended the conference and extended 
congratulations on the successful Yan-Fang cooperation and 
encouraged the corporation and district to be an example of 
linking between industry and agriculture in the municipality and 
to achieve new development under the new situation in the 
worker-peasant alliance. 
  Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation is located in Fangshan 
district and possesses the strong points of the raw materials, 
technologies, and talented personnel of chemical industry. 
Fangshan district has the strong points of vast territory, 
natural resources, labor forces, and farm and sideline products. 
In September 1992, the corporation and district signed an 
agreement on Yan-Fang economic and technical cooperation; 
according to the guideline of supplementing each other in strong 
points and paying attention to mutual benefit and interest; 
under the support of the municipal party committee, the 
municipal people's government, and China National Petro-Chemical 
Corporation; and under the concern and guidance offered by the 
leading personnel, including Chen Xitong. Since then, they 
enacted their cooperation in an overall and conscious way. Over 
the past one-odd year, the number of enterprises jointly run by 
the corporation and district has reached more than 100 and shown 
a more than 200 percent increase over the figure scored before 
the signing of agreement. Of these enterprises, almost 50 
projects are with the total investment of more than 1 million 
yuan. More than two thirds of township enterprises in Fangshan 
district have set up cooperation with the plants, institutes, 
and companies under Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation in the 
fields of chemical industry, building materials, architecture, 
tourism, non-staple foodstuffs production, and of building small 
industrial zones. Their business operation has initially 
created a situation with the cooperation in all directions and 
among multiple industries and trades. Their business has not 
only turned out good economic results but also promoted the 
consolidation and enhancement of the worker-peasant alliance as 
well as the integration between urban and rural areas. 
  At the conference Gao Guozhang, vice president of the 
installation company under Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation, 
and Liu Shui, secretary of the Shilou town party committee of 
Fangshan district, delivered speeches on describing their 
typical cooperative business and speaking glowingly of the 
cooperative achievements scored under the friendship of workers 
and peasants. Their speeches are earnest and their sentiments 
put in their speeches are sincere. After hearing the speech 
given by Liu Shui at the conference with regard to that the 
people of Shilou town will never break faith in conducting 
cooperation with the corporation because they can increase 
knowledge and experience in following the corporation to do 
business and talented personnel can come out through the 
cooperation, Chen Xitong immediately praised his words as 
excellent. 
  Amid the joyful and excited music Liu Haiyan, president of 
Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation, and Jiao Zhizhong, head of 
Fangshan district, signed their names on the agreement of 
continuously economic and technical cooperation. An agreement 
on eight specific cooperative projects was also signed by the 
personnel from the units concerned. 
  Yang Anjiang, secretary of the party committee under Yanshan 
Petro-Chemical Corporation, and Li Qingyu, secretary of the 
Fangshan district party committee, also delivered speeches at 
the conference, in which they put forward demands for both sides 
to further conduct cooperation. The personnel from both sides 
put forward that efforts should be made to enhance the work of 
making overall arrangements in line with the "Longteng" plan and 
"Huyao" project newly set forth by Fangshan district as well as 
the development strategy set forth by the corporation with 
regard to "perfecting the main projects, having two flanks 
achieve development, opening more channels, and injecting 
vigor". They also put forward that by regarding science and 
technology as a guide, efforts should be made to continuously 
upgrade the cooperative scope and grade; to expand and deepen 
the cooperative fields; to actively expand the cooperation to 
the aspects of tourism, culture, tertiary industry, and market 
construction; and to foster a pattern of cooperation in all 
directions. 
  At the work conference Li Yi, executive vice president of 
China National Petro-Chemical Corporation and deputy secretary 
of the leading party group under the corporation, also delivered 
a speech on extending warm congratulations on the successful 
Yan-Fang cooperation and heartfelt thanks for the support given 
by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal 
people's government to the cooperation. He said: The Yan-Fang 
cooperation has revealed the vitality of cooperation between 
enterprises and localities and has a universal significance on 
the petro-chemical industrial front in China. The people of 
Fangshan district have made important contributions to the 
development of Yanshan Petro- Chemical Corporation. It is hoped 
that both sides should get along well from generation to 
generation, closely rely on each other, go through thick and 
thin together, and commonly achieve development. The state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises should play a leading role in 
local economic development, supplement one another in strong 
points, and commonly become wealthy. Enhancing the cooperation 
between enterprises and localities represents a demand for 
establishing modern enterprise systems and cannot be done 
without the support of localities. The cooperation conducted by 
the corporation and district represents a demand for building 
socialist spiritual civilization and maintaining the social 
stability. He urged the Yan-Fang cooperation to further achieve 
development with a high starting point and high technologies. 
  In his speech Chen Xitong said: He was so happy to attend 
the work conference and the enthusiastic atmosphere revealed 
from the worker-peasant alliance made him excited and touched. 
The Yan-Fang cooperation that has achieved new development 
under the support of China National Petro-Chemical Corporation 
has a bright future. The enterprises and the district 
encountered contradictions in the past, which adversely affected 
the worker-peasant relationship and social stability. What we 
are now witnessing is the friendly feeling prevailing among 
workers and peasants, the words from the bottom of people's 
hearts on mutual dependence, the increasing consolidation of 
worker-peasant alliance, and the increasing enhancement of 
Yan-Fang cooperation. Hereafter, the corporation and district 
should say or do what is favorable for unity and don't say or do 
what is unfavorable for unity. They should strive to become the 
best model district and enterprise in establishing ties between 
workers and peasants. 
  In his speech Chen Xitong fully acknowledged the spirit of 
Yan-Fang cooperation with regard to supplementing each other in 
strong points and paying attention to mutual benefit and 
interest. He pointed out that in enforcing the socialist market 
economy, the cooperative field conducted by both sides should 
become much wider, and that they may develop in an overall way 
their cooperation into the aspects of tertiary industry and 
culture. The wider and deeper cooperation is more favorable for 
narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas and between 
workers and peasants. The Yan-Fang cooperation has achieved new 
development under the new situation. It is hoped that after the 
first and second developments, it will achieve third and better 
development! 
  Attending the work conference were Lu Yucheng, vice mayor of 
the municipality; and responsible persons from the municipal 
level commissions and offices concerned, China National 
Petro-Chemical Corporation, Yanshan Petro-Chemical Corporation, 
and Fangshan district.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- The experts of both 
sides of the Sino-British Liaison Group have held an informal 
talk on the right of residence in Hong Kong, mutual exemption of 
visas, and other issues. After the talk concluded, Chinese 
representative Chen Zuoer indicated that to encourage the Hong 
Kong people who have emigrated to other areas to return to Hong 
Kong, the Chinese side will leniently handle the question of the 
right of residence for these people. 
  Chen Zuoer said: The Chinese side welcomes Hong Kong's 
permanent residents of Chinese nationality who have emigrated 
to, and become citizens of, a foreign country to return to serve 
Hong Kong, because they are familiar with Hong Kong and many are 
experienced specialized professionals. Their return after 
emigrating will demonstrate that they still have feelings toward 
Hong Kong and China. 
  He stressed: To encourage Hong Kong emigrants to return, the 
Chinese side will adopt a fairly lenient measure to handle the 
question of the right of residence for those who return. 
However, this is to help those who return to continue serving 
Hong Kong. The measure is by no means aimed at encouraging 
those who are still in Hong Kong to emigrate to foreign 
countries. Chen Zuoer indicated no matter what measures are 
used, the Chinese side will, on the basis of relevant laws, 
strive to have the current relevant regulations and provisions 
of Hong Kong converge with the relevant provisions of the Basic 
Law of the future Hong Kong Autonomous Administrative Region.

  [Text] Premier Lien Chan has blamed Washington for making 
what he billed as selective, unfair, and unjust decision by 
singling out Taiwan as its first target of trade sanction under 
the Pelly amendment for inadequate wildlife protection. 
  It is the first time that Taiwan has been hit with trade 
sanctions of any kind from any nation. Lien told lawmakers that 
this is a selective action running counter to fair and just 
principle as well as ignoring the concerted effort the ROC 
[Republic of China] Government and people have made in 
ecological and wildlife protection. Lien's reaction came a 
couple of hours after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the 
measure to subject Taiwan to sanctions on the grounds that the 
island failed to satisfactorily end illegal commerce in rhino 
horns and tiger parts. 
  The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its deep 
regret 
and dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's obviously unfair 
and unjust sanction of the ROC, it said.

  [Text] Madrid, April 15 (XINHUA) -- UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali reaffirmed here today that the United 
Nations "will not hesitate" to use force again in time to 
protect the UN peacekeeping forces and maintain peace in Bosnia. 
  Addressing a joint press conference after talks with Spanish 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the UN chief expressed his 
cautious optimism on a negotiated settlement of the conflict in 
Bosnia. 
  On Russia's complaint that it had not been consulted on the 
NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia on Sunday and 
Monday, Butrus-Ghali argued that the Russian authorities had 
been informed from New York before the attacks. 
  He said he shared the view Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
sounded during his visit to Spain earlier this week that force 
could not put an end to the war in the area. 
  Dialogue should be encouraged, but "if the UN peacekeeping 
forces face risks and relevant UN resolutions allow us to use 
force, we should not hesitate to resort to force," Butrus-Ghali 
said.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi today held talks on hastening the peace process 
in Bosnia, the first since NATO air strikes against Serb 
positions. 
  Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy and 
director 
of civil affairs of the peacekeeping forces in former 
Yugoslavia, told reporters that they discussed how to push the 
peace process in Bosnia and that the talks were "fruitful". 
  Although "regrettable", the UN peacekeeping forces' demand 
for NATO air strikes against Serb positions was "necessary," as 
the safety of UN military observers and residents in the Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde was being threatened, he said. 
  He restated that the UN peacekeeping forces would strictly 
remain neutral and not be partial to any side. 
  After NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions 
near the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and 
11, the Serbs suspended all contacts with the UN peacekeeping 
forces, especially the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia 
Michael Rose, who ordered the air strikes. 
  As a result, the relations between the Serbs and the UN 
forces have reached an impasse. 
  The Serbs accused the United Nations of siding with the 
Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war. 
  During his talks with Akashi, Karadzic said that the UN 
peacekeeping forces had not made Gorazde a de-militarized zone 
in accordance with an agreement in 1993. 
  He said that the Muslims owned powerful military forces in 
Gorazde and constantly launched attacks on the Serb positions. 
  He also said that it was necessary for the Serbs to keep 
political contacts with the UN civil leaders as they could not 
cooperate with the military leaders of the UN peacekeeping 
forces for a certain period of time. 
  Karadzic described today's meeting, approved by the supreme 
headquarters of the Serb forces, as "a good thing." 
  The supreme headquarters of the Serb forces met this 
afternoon on the military and political situation in Bosnia 
after the NATO air strikes. 
  The Serb military leaders said that conditions for 
normalizing their ties with the UN forces' military leaders were 
not ripe at present, but agreed that the Serb leader could keep 
contacts with the UN forces' civil leaders when necessary. 
  Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin and co-chairmen of the 
international conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenburg have been working to bring the Serbs back 
to the negotiating table. 
  As a result of the efforts by the three mediators, Bosnian 
Serbs had made some compromise to ease the rising tension in the 
area. 
  Stoltenburg termed the talks between Karadzic and Akashi, 
which were held when relations between Serbs and the UN 
peacekeeping forces worsened, as "very important." 
  Churkin said that make some progress was made at the talks 
in 
solving the Bosnia conflict.

  [Text] United Nations, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council today demanded that Bosnian Muslims and Serbs refrain 
from any action which might worsen the situation in and around 
the UN- designated safe area of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  The council was concerned over the situation in the Muslim 
enclave and regretted that a UN military observer died of 
injuries suffered in the Serb onslaught there, according to 
council president Colin Keating of New Zealand. 
  The council "condemned this blatant violation of council's 
resolutions," he said. 
  He added that the council supported the efforts made by the 
UN protection force in Bosnia to improve the situation there, 
and welcomed diplomatic initiatives to the same end, including 
those of Russia. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit the 
region 
early next week.

  [Text] Washington, April 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher urged Russia today to influence the 
Bosnian Serbs to stop its offensive on Gorazde so as not to 
trigger new NATO air strikes, reports said. 
  Quoting an unnamed State Department official, the Associated 
Press said Christopher called Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and asked him "to use his influence with the Serbs." 
  The official said Christopher made the telephone call before 
Kozyrev left to Belgrade, capital of the Serb Republic. 
  "He told the foreign minister that, given the situation on 
the ground in Bosnia, it was quite likely that NATO would have 
to respond to a U.N. request for 'close air support,'" the 
official said. 
  "And he urged Foreign Minister Kozyrev to use his influence 
with the Serbs to keep this from being necessary." 
  Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed by 
Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake on the Bosnian situation. 
  A British warplane was shot down today over Gorazde, a 
Bosnian town mainly populated by the Muslims and was on the 
verge of being taken by the Serbs. 
  The plane was trying to retaliate against a tank that 
reportedly fired directly into Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe 
area" for the Bosnian Muslims, NATO said. The pilot ejected as 
the plane exploded.

  [Text] United Nations, April 17 (XINHUA) -- The U.N. 
Security Council today condemned escalating military activities 
by the Bosnian Serb forces in Gorazde, warning them of possible 
consequences. 
  "Council members are particularly disturbed that aggressive 
military actions were taken by the Serb forces against Gorazde 
simultaneously with cease-fire negotiations," said Council 
President Colin Keating of New Zealand. 
  Keating made the remarks to reporters after the council 
failed to approve a Pakistan-drafted resolution, which calls for 
lifting arms embargo against Bosnia. 
  "Council members support the actions UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] has taken to date to deal with these threats and remind 
those concerned of the consequences under its resolutions if 
aggressive actions continue," said Keating. 
  Gorazde, a U.N.-designated a "safe area," has been under 
Serb 
offensive for 19 days, in which more than 200 people have 
reportedly been killed and almost 1,000 wounded. 
  Under a Security Council resolution on establishing safe 
areas in Bosnia, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has the 
right to protect these areas with force. 
  In addition, Keating also condemned the harassment and 
detention of U.N. peacekeeping troops throughout Bosnia. 
  Up to now, almost 200 U.N. hostages have been taken by the 
Serb forces in retaliation for two NATO air raids last week on 
the Serb positions. 
  In his remarks, Keating emphasized diplomatic efforts to 
defuse the tension. 
  "Council members encourage intensified diplomatic efforts to 
achieve a cease-fire and to reestablish negotiations for a 
comprehensive peace settlement," he said. 
  "The talks being held by the foreign minister of the Russian 
Federation at this time are welcomed along with the efforts of 
the United States special envoy and the European Union," he 
added.

  [Text] Moscow, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev left here Saturday [16 April] for 
Belgrade to discuss Bosnian settlement, according to Russian 
Foreign Ministry sources. 
  In Belgrade, the capital of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, Kozyrev "will take part in talks on Bosnian 
settlement," the sources said. 
  The talks will also be attended by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's special envoy in the region Vitaly Churkin, who also 
is deputy foreign minister. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, both Kozyrev and 
Churkin persuaded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
to cancel plans for new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs who, as 
NATO said, had shelled the town of Gorazde in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned 
Kozyrev 
on Saturday morning to tell him that NATO aircraft were ready to 
launch new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs, the ITAR-TASS said. 
  Kozyrev immediately informed Churkin, who was in the Serb- 
controlled city of Pale near Sarajero, about his telephone talk 
with Christopher. The Russian envoy soon contacted Bosnian Serb 
leaders and reported back that there was no artillery shelling 
of Gorazde. 
  In addition, Bosnian Serb army commander General Radko 
Mladic 
assured Churkin that his troops will not storm Gorazde or shell 
it. 
  Moscow quickly relayed this information to Washington and 
preparations for new air strikes were cancelled, the ITAR-TASS 
said. 
  However, the news agency reported, Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka on Saturday that Serb troops 
have not entered Gorazde but have seized all strategic heights 
around it.

  [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said today that he has changed his 
assenting stance toward Russia's participation in NATO's 
"partnership for peace" plan after the Western military bloc 
launched air raids on Bosnian Serbs without consulting Moscow. 
  Grachev told the INTERFAX News Agency that he has been an 
enthusiastic supporter for Russia's participation in NATO's 
partnership program and has explained its necessity to officers 
of all ranks. 
  However, he added, NATO's air strikes indicated that the 
idea 
of the "partnership for peace" plan is only in words. 
  Grachev's remarks came a day after Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said Moscow has dropped plans to immediately join 
the program. 
  On April 10 and 11, NATO staged two air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions southwest of the Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde. 
  After the NATO strikes, Russia's Foreign Ministry, Defense 
ministry and parliament issued statements accusing NATO and the 
U.S. of violating the UN Charter by unilaterally ordering the 
operation without consulting other permanent members of the UN 
Security Council, especially Russia. 
  The statements said that NATO regards Russia as its equal 
partner in words, but treats the country as an unimportant 
"little partner" in deeds. 
  As NATO's actions are not in keeping with its promises, 
Grachev said, the definition of the "partnership for peace" 
plan, the principles for Russia's participation and the 
country's role within it should be reviewed. 
  NATO's partnership plan offers limited military cooperation 
to former Soviet-led Warsaw Pact members by allowing them to 
take part in peacekeeping missions, military exercises and other 
NATO activities without becoming its members.

  [Text] Moscow, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Sunday [17 April] that Moscow is 
seeking for the best ways of keeping partnership-cooperation 
ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
  After returning from a 24-hour trip to Belgrade, Kozyrev 
told 
reporters that "partnership with the North Atlantic alliance was 
our (Russia's) choice from the very outset." 
  "Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a 
letter 
to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at 
present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these 
ties," the Russian foreign minister stated, commenting on 
Russia's approach towards NATO's Partnership for Peace Program. 
  He said Moscow is ready to discuss whether a framework 
agreement should be signed first, which is to be followed by a 
broader one, or whether Moscow should conclude a broader 
partnership pact, without signing a preliminary agreement. 
  "We want a more serious and substantive agreement adequate 
to 
relations that should exist between NATO and the superpower of 
Russia...... [ellipses as received] Especially an agreement 
which will exclude unilateral actions, particularly military 
ones, in areas where we have to closely cooperate," Kozyrev 
pointed out. 
  Moscow has agreed in principle to join the NATO plan, which 
offers east European and former Soviet republics cooperation but 
stops short of letting them join the alliance. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Kozyrev has 
postponed 
his visit to Brussels scheduled for April 21 to sign the 
Partnership for Peace deal, apparently angered by NATO's air 
strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina last week.

<F P=106> [By Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Russia and the `Partnership for </F>
Peace'"] 
  [Text] Recently, Russia has spoken in different voices on 
whether or not it will join NATO's "partnership for peace" 
program. By announcing on 6 April that Russia would join the 
program in the near future, President Yeltsin temporarily put an 
end to the argument in Russia. It is reported that Russia is 
likely to sign the program's framework agreement on 21 April. 
  The "partnership for peace" program was approved at a NATO 
summit meeting early this year. Its main contents are: NATO 
will not be expanded for the time being, but will establish a 
partnership with countries in Eastern Europe and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] so that they can "make 
a gradual transition toward NATO member status." 
  Russia welcomes the NATO "partnership for peace" program, 
holding that it will prevent another split in Europe, but that 
it is not fully in keeping with Russia's interests. The Russian 
Government is sharply divergent on whether it should join the 
program. The Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry hold: 
Russia cannot prevent NATO from developing relations with East 
European countries. If Russia disregards this reality, it will 
be excluded from the new European security system. 
Participation in the program will be conducive to coordinating 
its relations with the United States and other Western countries 
and it can transform this program internally to make it conform 
to Russia's interest. Russian parliamentary leaders and others, 
however, are opposed to hurriedly joining the NATO mechanism on 
the grounds that it is out of keeping with Russia's status as a 
big power and that it will probably result in Russia losing its 
room for diplomatic maneuvering and its right to carry out arms 
trade and hamper strategic cooperation within the CIS. The 
parliament's International Affairs Commission approved a 
resolution saying that only when NATO accords Russia "special 
status" will it join the program. 
  Under such circumstances, while announcing that Russia would 
join the program, President Yeltsin emphatically pointed out: 
Russia's partnership with NATO should "be in keeping with 
Russia's status and role in world and European affairs and with 
Russia's military strength and nuclear status" and "be different 
from other countries' relations with NATO in terms of scope and 
contents." Judging by the Russian leader's statement, the 
"special status" Russia is seeking in the NATO program generally 
includes the following aspects: allowing Russia to attend NATO 
membership meetings and join in making important policy 
decisions; recognizing Russia's "special responsibilities" 
toward the former Soviet region; and taking into consideration 
Russia's interest on such issues as military transformation and 
defense structures. Moreover, Russia also wants to link its 
participation in "partnership for peace" with its participation 
in the G-7 economic group so as to get more economic aid. 
  Russia's demand for a "special relationship" poses a 
difficult problem for NATO. Acceding to its demand is 
tantamount to a recognition that the CIS belongs to Russia's 
sphere of influence, thus upsetting the course of Eastern 
European states joining the program. Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Ukraine have warned NATO that "accommodating 
Russia" is likely to scuttle the entire "partnership for peace" 
program. 
  In fact, NATO and Russia have their own axes to grind. The 
United States and its allies are attempting to fill the 
"security vacuum" in Eastern Europe and establish a new system 
of European security, with NATO as the nucleus. Russia, 
however, is worried that NATO will place Eastern Europe in its 
sphere of influence and thus threaten Russia's security 
interests. Therefore, it wants to maintain Eastern Europe as a 
buffer zone, with Russia and the West guaranteeing its security. 
It wants to develop a partnership for Europe as a whole through 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This actually reflects the 
strategic differences between the two parties. Consequently, 
even if Russia signs the "partnership for peace" program, it 
will still bargain hard with the West about the essence of this 
program.

Nakao's contributions to the promotion of Sino-Japanese economic 
ties when he was in charge of Japan's international trade. 
  Nakao briefed Li on the current political and economic 
situation in Japan, saying that Japan and China should establish

  Almost all the countries and regions in the world support 
China's early re-entry of GATT and become a founding member of 
the WTO, Gu said.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] China says that the U.S. Government should take 
concrete action to fulfill its promise to support China's 
rejoining GATT. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made 
this remark on Thursday [14 April] in Beijing during the 
ministry's weekly press conference. Li Peichun was there: 
  [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] Spokesman Shen Guofang's 
remarks came just after the Chinese and American trade 
negotiators reportedly encountered difficulty in their talks on 
China's re-entry into GATT in Morocco. Although the specific 
difficulty has yet to emerge, the Chinese representative has 
reiterated that trade should not be mixed up with social issues. 
Meanwhile, U.S. trade negotiator Mickey Kantor said that China 
has to make more efforts before it is accepted by the 
multilateral trade agreement. 
  [Shen Guofang in Chinese] The U.S. Government has promised 
on several ocassions its firm support for China's re-entry into 
GATT, we hope that... [fades into Li Peichun's comments] 
  [Li Peichun] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said 
Beijing has noticed the importance of the U.S. in GATT, but he 
has stressed that the U.S. is merely one of the 105 contracting 
countries and should not be equated to the international body 
itself. 
  Shen Guofang said the U.S. Government has repeated its 
promise to support China's re-entry, and it should make real 
efforts to materialize its commitments. China's re-entry is one 
of the main issues of the GATT ministerial meeting in Morocco. 
  On another subject, spokesman Shen Guofang criticized a 
report published on Wednesday by the House of Commons on 
London's ties with Beijing. Shen Guofang said the part 
concerning the Hong Kong issue disregards facts and defends 
Governor Chris Patten's erroneous approach to his political 
reform. Commenting on London's desire to hold talks with China 
on human rights, which is expressed in the same report, Shen 
Guofang said that Beijing is willing to talk with any country, 
but on the basis of equality and mutual respect. 
  Finally, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said China hopes 
that 
relations along the Taiwan Straits will not be adversely 
affected by the Qiandao Lake case, in which 24 Taiwan tourists 
died in Zhejiang last month. Reacting to Taiwan's suspension of 
various exchanges with the mainland, Shen Guofang said closer 
links along the Taiwan Straits are in the interest of all 
Chinese. He added Beijing will listen to proposals from Taiwan 
in handling the case. 
  For China Radio International, I am Li Peichuan. [end

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A 
ministerial meeting of GATT ended here today with the adoption 
of the world's biggest trade deal designed to frame a better 
global economic order. 
  The deal, or the "Marrakesh declaration," which formally 
endorses the Uruguay-round trade accords reached last December, 
was signed by ministers from more than 120 industrial and 
developing countries. 
  The deal provides for a 40-percent cut in the world's 
tariffs, a move which will add some 200 billion U.S. dollars to 
the global income every year in the next decade. 
  The declaration officially approved the creation of a World 
Trade Organization (WTO) to replace GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) in theory from January 1, 1995, marking "a 
new era of global economic cooperation" and in response to the 
widespread wish for "a fairer and more open multilateral trade 
system." 
  It said that the developing countries have played "a 
remarkably active role" in the Uruguay round, "a historic step 
towards a more balanced and integrated global trade partnership." 
  China signed the Uruguay-round accords and an agreement on 
the WTO, which will pave the way for its re-entry into GATT and 
for its WTO membership. 
  The less developed countries should enjoy "more favorable 
treatment," the declaration stressed, pledging continued support 
to them in trade and investment. 
  It said that the WTO, the new world trade watchdog, will 
increase aid "substantially" to developing countries. 
  In the declaration, the ministers hailed the conclusion of 
the Uruguay-round trade talks as a historic achievement, which 
will boost "trade, investment, employment and incomes all over 
the world." 
  They also put emphasis on environmental issues and 
sustainable development. 
  The ministerial meeting in the Moroccan oasis city started 
Tuesday and was attended by 124 nations.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: Developing Countries Have Mixed Feelings About </F>
New World Trade Framework" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The 
ministerial meeting of GATT ended here today with the adoption 
of the world's biggest trade deal, labeled "the Marrakech 
Declaration". 
  To judge by speeches and talks both in and out of the 
meeting, many developing countries expected and supported such 
an agreement, and the creation of a World Trade Organization 
(WTO) designed to structure a better global economic order. 
  On the other hand, they also have reservations and even 
worries about the conclusion of the Uruguay-Round trade talks. 
  An opening international economic environment and a complete 
set of international trade regulations are necessary for a 
developing country to improve its economy. As one 
representative from a developing country said, "the future of 
the global economy and the prosperity of developing countries 
will depend on the opening-up of the international trade system." 
  This GATT agreement achieved a wide range of market-entry 
promises, stressing the principle of freedom in international 
trade and improving multilateral trade regulations. This 
achievement has been welcomed and basically supported by 
developing countries. 
  They believe that by this agreement, which has strengthened 
multilateral trade regulations and will establish a mechanism to 
solve possible trade disputes, developing countries will be less 
discriminated against. 
  Representatives from developing countries also pointed out 
that the implementation of the Uruguay-Round agreement and the 
establishment of a world trade organization to replace GATT will 
inaugurate a new phase in world trade, bringing greater 
cooperation, more investment, more employment and faster 
economic growth. 
  At the same time, some representatives from developing 
countries hold the opinion that the final outcome of the talks 
doesn't attach enough importance to profits of developing 
countries, and that the clauses related to market-entry are 
still insufficient. 
  They said that this final agreement does not match 
concessions made by developing countries during the talks, and 
could even be harmful to a few debtor countries. 
  They also expressed their worry about clauses on society in 
general, especially those concerning the rights of workers. 
"The rights of workers should be certainly protected, but it 
shouldn't be used as an excuse to interfere in the internal 
affairs of other countries," said one representative. 
  They also worry that clauses on society may be contained in 
the guiding principles of a world trade organization. 
  Although there were many reservations and concerns about the 
final outcome of the Uruguay-Round talks and the establishment 
of a world trade organization, most developing countries still 
place great hope in such an organization, which is expected to 
emerge in the near future. 
  Many people from developing countries expected that a world 
trade organization will bring them equal and ample opportunities 
to participate, and will give substantial assistance to the 
least developed countries on special and favorable principles. 
  They hope the organization will promote the establishment of 
a fairer new international economic order and take efficient 
measures to guarantee the competitive capacity of developing 
countries and further improve their ability to enter 
international markets. 
  Only because a large number of developing countries 
supported 
the Uruguay-Round agreement and the establishment of a world 
trade organization was it possible for ministers from more than 
120 countries to sign the world's largest trade deal.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Mrs. Elsie Tu, 
senior British national and now newly-appointed Hong Kong 
adviser to China, said her first priority concern is the 
peaceful transition of Hong Kong in 1997. 
  "I really believe most Hong Kong people, probably 90 percent 
at least, want 1997 to go through peacefully," said the 
81-year-old woman, who has served in the Urban Council for 31 
years and is concurrently member of the Legislative Council. 
  In a recent interview with XINHUA, Elsie Tu said, "Hong Kong 
people work very hard to build up the economy. If we have 
political disturbance, political instability, it will certainly 
and eventually affect the economy." 
  "In case it (political disturbance) affected economy, people 
would move business out of Hong Kong and people lose jobs. 
That's what the people are worried about," she added. 
  She said that she received both written and oral 
congratulations from local residents after she was appointed 
Hong Kong affairs adviser to the Chinese side earlier this month. 
  "Because the talks between China and Britain broke down, I 
think it's necessary for us to make some kind of bridges with 
China to have cooperation so as to understand each other's 
viewpoints," she said. 
  "If the government can't do it, let's the people do it. Then 
it's the people's idea not the government's idea," she said, 
adding "that's better than the views of Mr. Patten." 
  "One or two of the press said to me 'whether or not you 
compromise your position and make you support China'. I said, 
'Have you ever seen me compromise?'" 
  "It's not intended to be a honor (to be appointed as the 
adviser). It's responsibility," she said, adding "since the two 
governments cannot agree, it's up to us, the citizens, to try to 
find some ways of helping make the transition smooth," she said. 
  Mrs. Elsie Tu has lived in Hong Kong for 43 years since she 
came to Hong Kong in 1951. She has served as the supervisor and 
teacher of a local school, Mu Kuang English school, which she 
and her Chinese husband set up in 1954. "I understand the 
grassroots better than I understand the business," she said. 
  Her familiarility with fellow residents has been 
strengthened 
since she became a member of the Urban Council in 1963. For 31 
years, she has spent most of her time, at least twice a week, 
interviewing people, usually middle-and-low-pay workers. 
  "The only rest I get is Sunday evening when I go with my 
husband for dinner and that's my holiday," she smiled. 
  "Probably, apart from very well off people who don't need 
any 
help, I had probably some contacts with most families in Hong 
Kong," she said. 
  "That is the foundation that people trust me because I don't 
talk politics to them, I only talk about how to improve social 
conditions," she said. 
  Mrs. Tu is expected to go to Beijing to receive the adviser 
appointment next month. "As an adviser, I would like to explain 
China's attitude towards Hong Kong and Hong Kong's feelings to 
China," she said.

  [Text] Macao, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva arrived here today for a four-day 
official visit following his week-long visit to China's mainland 
from April 10 to 16. 
  The prime minister's entourage includes over 60 leading 
Portuguese businessmen. 
  On his arrival, Silva said that he has brought good news to 
Macao, which has become a symbol of the friendship between the 
two peoples of China and Portugal. 
  He said that during his visit to China's mainland, from the 
very beginning to the end, Macao was a very important topic in 
the talks he had with senior Chinese leaders. 
  The Portuguese Government has made great efforts to 
safeguard 
the prosperity and interest of Macao, so has the Chinese 
Government, he said. 
  The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, signed between the 
governments of China and Portugal in 1987, has been implemented 
conscientiously by the two sides through dialog and friendly 
cooperation, said the Portugese leader, stressing that such 
understanding is the most powerful guarantee of Macao's progress 
and development in the future. 
  During his stay in Macao, Silva will meet with Guo Dongpo, 
director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao Branch, preside over the 
opening ceremony of the Macao friendship bridge and visit the 
international airport site and other key projects here.

the second Macao-Taipa bridge, namely the friendship bridge, was 
held here today. 
  Visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, 
Macao 
Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira, XINHUA NEWS AGENCY 
Macao Branch Director Guo Dongpo and Jose Manuel Machado, 
secretary assistant of Transport and Public Affairs Department, 
Macao Government, attended the opening ceremony. 
  Jose Manuel Machado said that the project, a symbol of 
friendship and cooperation between the governments of Portugal 
and China, is of great significance to Macao. 
  It is expected to boost the development of local tourism, 
real estate and many other industries and would become an 
important auxiliary project to the Macao International Airport, 
he said.

    [Editorial report] Lisbon RDP Antena 1 Radio Network in 
Portuguese at 1732 GMT on 17 April carries a 28-minute recording 
of an interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva 
conducted in Macao earlier in the day by Teledifusao de Macao 
[TDM]. The interviewers are TDM's Mario Rui de Castro, Fatima 
Cid, and by an unidentified local journalist. 
  Asked to comment on criticism levelled at him by the weekly 
EXPRESSO and by the secretary of the Portuguese Episcopal 
Conference for not speaking about human rights during his visit 
to China, Cavaco Silva says: "Portugal, in terms of human 
rights, has the same stance as the remaining 11 European Union 
[EU] countries. There is no difference. In 1992 I had the 
opportunity to speak with the Chinese prime minister about this 
matter. And I did so once again in Beijing. It was very clear 
that Portugal has a different position, interpretation, emphasis 
-- as the Chinese say -- when it comes to human rights. I 
believe this matter should not be discussed in public because if 
it is, it will not be effective, therefore those who made such 
statements in Portugal regarding my visit did so through 
ignorance because they were not at the meeting and they do not 
know what I told the Chinese leaders." 
  In connection with this question, the prime minister goes 
on: 
"I would like to add that it was I, myself, personally, who in 
the last few days, almost in the last few hours, negotiated with 
the Chinese authorities the possibility of the church of Macao 
maintaining relations with religious organizations outside 
Macao. With a view to preserving, obviously, relations between 
the church of Macao and the Vatican." 
  The prime minister is then questioned about the matter of 
the 
nationality of the people of Macao. He says: "Those with 
Portuguese passports are Portuguese now and in the future. 
Portugal will not withdraw anyone's nationality. However I 
knew that there was some concern regarding the implementation of 
the Chinese nationality law in the future here in Macao and 
therefore I broached this subject with the Chinese authorities. 
The answer I was given by the Chinese leaders was that they do 
not intend to impose Chinese nationality on Macanese people of 
Portuguese descent." 
  When asked about the future of civil servants in Macao, 
Cavaco Silva says: "It is essential for Macao that its special 
characteristics and identity remain after 1999, that Macao's 
character goes beyond the end of the Portuguese administration. 
An important contribution to this can be made from those 
working in the public sector. Therefore I believe it is in 
Macao's interest, and I stress in Macao's interest, that the 
current civil servants remain so after 1999 and nothing should 
be done against this principle. It would be a terrible mistake 
for Macao and even for Portugal if we were to create the 
conditions for all the civil servants to leave Macao." 
  Later in the interview, Cavaco Silva speaks of the changes 
in 
China, saying: "I have noticed a significant change in China 
regarding the economy. I believe it is difficult to describe 
what is happening in China today. I said yesterday and I say it 
again, the whole country looks like a construction site, with a 
thirst for economic development and growth which I believe does 
not exist anywhere else in the world. It would be a mistake for 
Portugal and for the EU to ignore one of the largest world 
markets in the very near future." 
  He is then asked for his opinion on whether the British are 
defending the interests of Hong Kong in their dealings with 
China. Cavaco Silva replies: "I think it is not up to the 
Portuguese prime minister to comment on the Hong Kong transition 
process. I answer for the Macao transition process." 
  Returning to the subject of the Chinese economy, he says: 
"It appears to me that there is virtually total flexibility and 
economic openness. The Chinese authorities say this is the 
appropriate way to eliminate the poverty which still exists in 
China. I was amazed. It is difficult to imagine before coming 
here what is happening in the Chinese economy. I believe that 
China will be an economic power in the 21st century if the 
current rate of development is maintained. No one in the world 
will be able to ignore China. I have been saying for a long 
time that it would be a mistake for the western world, the EU, 
the United States to ignore a country with 1.2 billion people 
and which is fundamental for world stability and peace." 
  Asked to confirm that he advocates openness by the EU to 
China, Cavaco says that "all economic restrictions have 
disappeared, all financial restrictions. There are no 
restrictions on visits by prime ministers, so it does not make 
sense to maintain restrictions on visits by heads of state. I 
would describe this as hypocrisy by Europe, so let us put an end 
to it and let us fully normalize relations between the EU and 
China." 
  Cavaco Silva goes on to confirm that the Chinese authorities 
expressed the wish to have President Soares visit China. Later 
he confirms that the Chinese have acknowledged the importance of 
a Portuguese cultural presence, of the Portuguese language, in 
Macao. He adds that it was important for more Portuguese to 
speak Chinese, and he regrets the fact that so few people speak 
Portuguese in Macao. "I would like the inter-penetration of 
cultures to be more visible with regard to language -- with 
Chinese speaking Portuguese and Portuguese speaking Chinese." 
  Questioned about the Portuguese Government's commitment to 
joint ventures between Macao, Portugal, and China, Cavaco Silva 
says that although the government backs these, "the Portuguese 
Government cannot be too much of an umbrella for Portuguese 
businessmen. We want them to have initiative and innovation, 
and to take risks. But in this case we have decided to provide 
special help. In May another business delegation will visit 
China, Macao, and Guangzhou. Obviously, these will be private 
initiatives. The Portuguese Government is not going to lead 
businessmen by the hand -- they will have to act and show their 
ability. You have to struggle here -- it has not all been done, 
things have to be built. I hope they will not give up easily. 
It would be a mistake if, after the political welcome which was 
reflected onto the economic side, our businessmen do not insist 
on being present here in Macao, Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Shanghai, 
and Beijing." 
  He continues: "I have great confidence in the future, that 
is why I brought to Macao a message of confidence in the future, 
and this is what I asked the Chinese authorities to support. 
The message from Beijing to Macao was clearly one of confidence 
in the future." 
  Cavaco Silva then speaks of TAP-Air Portugal's plan to 
integrate Air Macao: "The government will help, things are 
going well. I cannot give details but I can say that the 
negotiations saw some progress in Beijing." When asked if Air 
Macao would have Portuguese investment, he says that "the signs 
point to that, but first we need to have the airport. I have 
not seen the airport so I don't want to talk about this yet." 
He goes on to say that he believes that the airport would be 
positive for Portugal because "it is the missing link to the 
outside world for Macao. Macao will gain autonomy and a special 
link with Europe and Portugal. That is why I said here in China 
that we want and offer Portugal as a platform for China's, and 
in particular Macao's, penetration in the EU." 
  Asked about the Portuguese economy, Cavaco Silva expresses 
his belief that a recovery is under way; he is confident that 
the inflation rate will stand at 5 percent, between 5 and 6 
percent. 
  The prime minister goes on to reiterate that Macao should 
come under the government's jurisdiction. "I think that more 
than ever the question of Macao is a foreign policy issue and as 
1999 draws near the foreign policy aspect tends to surface. It 
is more a question of negotiating with China about the future of 
Macao and about the Portuguese presence in Macao, than a 
question of resolving administrative matters." 
  In conclusion, he leaves a message for the Portuguese and 
Chinese who live in Macao. "My message is one of confidence in 
the future. I believe there are reasons -- especially after the 
talks in Beijing with the Chinese authorities and after 
observing the evolution in the implementation of the Joint 
Declaration during the last seven years -- I believe that are 
reasons to think that Macao will continue to enjoy stability, 
which is important, will continue to enjoy a strong economic 
growth, and will continue to enjoy progress."

  [Text] A Taiwanese Government source, quoting intelligence 
reports, claimed yesterday that 24 Taiwanese tourists who died 
in a mysterious boat fire on the mainland last month were in 
fact murdered by a group of renegade Chinese soldiers. The 
source said People's Liberation Army troops, armed with 
flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death the tourists and 
eight Chinese crew while the boat was touring Qiandao Lake in 
Zhejiang province on March 31. 
  Mainland authorities discovered the murders the next day but 
covered them up and ordered the loot to be returned because "the 
impact of the incident could be far-reaching", the source 
claimed, quoting intelligence he described as "authoritative". 
  The deaths have seriously strained uneasy relations between 
Taiwan and China, bitter rivals since the Chinese civil war 
ended in 1949. Relatives of the victims have accused Beijing of 
covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. They raised 
several questionable points, including why the victims did not 
jump ship when the fire began and were instead huddled in the 
small cabin below. Relatives visiting the death scene last week 
to recover victims' remains said the authorities restricted 
their movements. They said officials had also insisted the 
remains be cremated in China instead of being taken to Taiwan. 
  China acknowledged the blaze might have been caused by 
"saboteurs". It pledged that the culprits would be severely 
punished after Taiwanese leaders called Chinese authorities 
"bandits ... trampling on human lives". 
  In Beijing, officials from the State Council and the 
ministries of foreign affairs and defence could not be reached 
for comment on the new allegations. 
  Taiwan will suspend all group tours to China from May I and 
has declared 11 scenic spots, including Qiandao Lake and Lhasa 
in Tibet, high-risk areas for travel. About 10,000 Taiwanese 
have already backed out of tours to China, with about 450 group 
tours already canceled at a cost of US$11.4 million (HK$88 
million) to Taiwanese travel agents. Chinese officials estimate 
that more than one million Taiwanese travellers last year pumped 
at least $589 million into China's economy. 
  The island has also suspended subsidised cultural and 
educational exchanges with China, and the Economics Ministry has 
recommended putting on hold applications for new or additional 
investment in China and expansion of imports from the mainland. 
  China has urged authorities in Taiwan to "handle the matter 
in a rational and cool-minded manner so as to avoid a setback in 
relations". Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin appealed 
for increased ties with Taiwan and the restoration of direct air 
post and maritime links, major Chinese newspapers said 
yesterday. "The reunification of China is a historic mission, 
the will of the people and irreversible," Mr Jiang was quoted by 
the papers as saying at the end of a five-day meeting of the 
State Council. 
  Beijing has given assurances the fire was purely accidental 
and repeatedly said it was no reason for a deterioration of 
relations between the two sides. During the meeting, Premier Li 
Peng called for Taiwanese business to invest in China even as 
many were announcing the cancellation of projects in protest of 
the boat fire. 
  Despite an 18-year-old modernisation drive, the PLA, which 
encompasses all three armed services, operates largely above the 
law, analysts say. Hong Kong maritime officials say many 
Chinese smuggling syndicates operate with the navy's tacit 
consent. They say PLA coastal patrols often raid ships and 
seize their cargos on the pretext of curbing smuggling. 
Military officers have been seen driving righthand-drive cars, 
which cannot be legally registered in China and are presumed to 
have been stolen in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Officials and relatives 
of the victims who died in the March 31 Qiandao Lake boat 
disaster Monday [18 April] said they were skeptical of Beijing 
reports that three men involved in the killing of 24 Taiwan 
tourists had been arrested. 
  Beijing's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY said Sunday that Wu Lihong, 22, 
Yu Aijun, 23, and Hu Zhihan, 24, all from Zhejiang Province, 
robbed the tourists and then killed everyone on board the ship. 
  This is the first time that Beijing has admitted that the 
deaths were not the result of an accident, but resulted from 
foul play. 
  Mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng said Monday in Beijing that 
the boat disaster was a major criminal case. He said that those 
arrested would be dealt with according to the law. 
  Li also offered his condolences to those killed in the boat 
disaster. He made the remarks in a news conference before his 
departure for a visit of the Central Asian States and Mongolia. 
  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said Beijing failed 
to provide any details of the accident other than the names of 
the three men arrested. They urged Beijing authorities to 
disclose the reason and method behind the murder in written 
statements. 
  They said that the lifting of a Taiwan ban on cross-strait 
cultural and other exchanges imposed in the wake of Qiandao 
disaster would hinge on whether these details were released. 
  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary-General 
Li 
Ching-ping, also said that Beijing's report that three men were 
arrested in connection with the case was not enough, he demanded 
a detailed report on the investigations. The foundation is 
Taipei's conduit for unofficial dialogue with Beijing. 
  He said that Beijing's summary report through XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY only bred more doubts and misgivings about the case. 
  Ko Chen Hui-mei, mother of victim Kao Yu-lan, said she did 
not believe three men could overwhelm all 32 people on board. 
She suspected the three were scapegoats. 
  Meanwhile, Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei Association 
of Travel Agents, said Monday that a planned boycott of mainland 
travel starting May 1 would continue.

  [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] has ordered its representative office in Indonesia to help 
protect the safety of Taiwan businessmen there in the wake of a 
labor riot in the northern Sumatran city of Medan, a Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Spokesman said Monday [18 April]. 
  "We have expressed our concern about the medan labor rioting 
to the Indonesian Government and have ordered our representative 
office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for our businessmen 
there," said Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the Ministry's 
Department of Information and Cultural Affairs. 
  According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest 
at 
a medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last 
Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the 
economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops and cars in 
Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one 
person was reported killed. 
  Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office 
in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and 
life there has begun to return to normal. 
  He added it remains to be seen whether the incident would 
affect the government's "southern strategy," which encourages 
Taiwan manufacturers to invest more in southeast Asia instead of 
Mainland China. "We'll keep close watch on developments in 
Indonesia," he noted. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien told a 
Legislative Yuan committee meeting that the Medan labor riot has 
not inflicted any damage on Taiwan-owned companies in Indonesia. 
  Yang pointed out Taiwan businessmen are generally regarded 
as 
"foreigners" in Indonesia, so they have not been affected by the 
anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment there. 
  Another Vice Economic Affairs Minister, S.J. Li, also said 
the ROC need not change its "southern strategy" simply because 
of the recent labor riot in Indonesia. 
  "The Indonesian Government is obligated to protect Taiwan 
investors since the two countries signed an investment guarantee 
agreement in 1990," Li explained. 
  During his recent visit to Jakarta, Li, on behalf of the ROC 
government, further signed a reciprocal tax exemption accord 
with Indonesia to avoid double taxation on investors from each 
side. 
  "Indonesian officials once assured me that Indonesia seeks 
steady economic development and will do its best to protect 
foreign investors," Li noted. 
  "I believe Indonesia will properly resolve its recent labor 
unrest soon," Li said. 
  Taiwan is the third largest foreign investor in Indonesia 
after Japan and Hong Kong, with its total investment standing at 
US$4.03 billion at the end of 1993.

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said 
Friday [15 April] that the government will take necessary steps 
to minimize the possible impact on farmers brought about by 
Taiwan's admission into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). Lien made the remarks while receiving the chairmen 
of farmers' associations from around Taiwan. 
  Around 3,000 farm association representatives and farmers 
rallied in Taipei today, demanding that the government look out 
for their interests. 
  In meeting Premier Lien, Chien Chin-ching, chairman of the 
Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association, submitted a statement 
calling on the government to maintain the ban on rice imports 
and to raise NT$100 billion to compensate farmers hurt by the 
opening of Taiwan's produce market. 
  The farmers also asked the government to implement a pension 
scheme for farmers, to lift restrictions on real-estate 
transactions involving farm land, to form a supraministerial 
organization to help farmers cope with the impact likely to be 
brought about by Taiwan's admission into GATT, and to increase 
the budget for agricultural development. 
  Lien promised that a governmental task force would be 
established to study ways to help farmers, who he said have long 
been the "weak group" in Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Military authorities 
should seek ways of improving the electronics installed in the 
Mirage 2000- 5 jet fighters Taiwan has bought from France, 
Legislator Ting Shou- nhung said Monday [18 April]. 
  The Kuomintang lawmaker made the call after a military 
intelligence bureau publication revealed that Mainland China 
imported two Mirage fighters from France last year and has 
removed electronic equipment from one of the fighters for 
research. 
  Ting, convener of the Legislative Yuan's national defense 
committee, said France apparently has adopted a two-pronged 
strategy of simultaneously selling mirage fighters to both 
Taiwan and Mainland China. 
  Against this background, Ting said, the military should 
consider improving the performance of the fighters, particularly 
their electronic systems and equipment. 
  France agreed to sell Taiwan 60 Mirage 2000-5s for about 
U.S.$6 billion in 1993. The first batch is expected to be 
delivered in 1996. Taiwan has also ordered six Lafayette-class 
frigates from France. 
  Under pressure from Beijing, France announced earlier this

  [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- About 55 percent of all 
Taiwan manufacturers and exporters support the government's 
suspension of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges after the March 31 
Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed 
while visiting Mainland China, according to survey results 
released Monday [18 April]. 
  As many as 55.6 percent of those surveyed said they 
supported 
the government's temporary suspension of cross-strait exchanges 
in order to pressure Beijing to give satisfactory answers about 
the deaths, widely believed to be the result of foul play. 
  However, 52.4 percent of the respondents said they opposed 
an 
across-the-board suspension of cross-strait exchanges. 
  Meanwhile, 57.6 percent predicted that the government will 
further restrain cross-strait exchanges if Beijing fails to 
satisfactorily explain the incident. 
  Among the 105 Taiwan manufacturers who have invested or are 
preparing to invest in Mainland China, 40 percent agreed that 
the current restraint of cross-strait ties will have a negative 
impact on their mainland investments. Some 45.7 percent 
disagreed. 
  Fifty-eight percent of the 105 investors said they will 
uphold the government restrictions on cross-strait ties, while 
20 percent said they will not hold to the restrictions. 
  Results of the April 11-15 survey were compiled from 252 
responses.

  [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Pro-independence 
sentiment in Taiwan hit an all-time high after the March 31 
Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists killed while 
visiting Mainland China, according to results released by the 
Gallup Poll Sunday [17 April]. 
  The survey showed that following the Qiandao Lake tragedy, 
27 
percent of the 1,011 polled supported Taiwan independence, a 
record high, and 45.6 percent opposed Taiwan independence, a 
record low. 
  The survey also showed that 74.2 percent of the respondents 
believe communist China is hostile to Taiwan. 
  In southern Taiwan, the support for Taiwan independence was 
about equal with support for unification, standing at 36.7 
percent and 36.4 percent respectively, the survey found. 
  The survey indicated that some who were previously 
supporters 
of reunification are now neutral while some who were previously 
neutral are now supporters of independence, the local media 
reported. 
  About 8.5 percent of those surveyed said that Taiwan will 
declare independence in the next five years, while 42 percent 
said they believe the status quo will prevail. 
  In the next ten years however, 8.9 percent said they believe 
Taiwan will declare independence and 14.3 percent said Taiwan 
will maintain the status quo. 
  Survey results were compiled from 1,011 responses by people 
20 years of age or over. The survey has a margin of error of 
3.1 percent.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Chen Mingyi, 54, was 
today elected governor of south-east China's Fujian Province, at 
the closing session of the seven-day Second Meeting of the 
Eighth Fujian Provincial People's Congress. 
  Chen, a native of Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, has 
been vice-president of Xiamen Institute of Aquatic Products, 
deputy director of Fujian Provincial Committee of Science and 
Technology, vice-governor of Fujian Province and deputy 
secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist

Eighth Fujian Provincial People's Congress. 
  Jia, 54, is a native of Jiaohe County of north China's Hebei 
Province. He is concurrently secretary of the Fujian Provincial 
CPC Committee. 
  Governor Chen, asked about how to seize the current 
opportunities to accelerate the development of Fujian, said that 
it was necessary to actively carry out reform in various fields

  Besides, he said, it is imperative to continue to adopt the 
policy of opening to the outside world, to promote economic 
cooperation between the province and the outside world, 
particularly Taiwan, which is located across the Taiwan Straits.

  [Text] Communist Party stalwart Chen Mingyi was yesterday 
elected governor of Fujian province, replacing Jia Qinglin who 
takes over as the chairman of the law-making body, the Fujian 
People's Congress. Mr Chen, 54, was deputy party secretary in 
Fujian and has been Mr Jia's right-hand man since 1985. 
  The reshuffle was confirmed unanimously by 464 delegates at 
the provincial people's congress. Speaking to reporters after 
his election yesterday, Mr Chen said he would continue to put 
Taiwan affairs at the top of his agenda. He said that, in 
particular, he would focus on protecting Taiwanese investment in 
Fujian and would push for early direct links with the Kuomintang 
stronghold. Despite repeated overtures from Beijing, the 
Taiwanese Government has steadfastly refused to open direct 
communication, transport and government contacts with the 
mainland. 
  The new governor also pledged to work closely with Mr Jia to 
further improve the economy. Fujian, in spite of its close 
proximity to Taiwan, has lagged far behind economically booming 
Guangdong, a fact sources attribute to a lack of co-operation 
among the province's top officials. 
  On other matters, both Mr Chen and Mr Jia said they would 
continue to crack down on the smuggling of illegal workers from 
Fujian to the United States. But they admitted Fujian's long 
coastline made anti-smuggling efforts difficult. 
  Meanwhile, sources said the provincial leadership had 
decided 
to postpone the election of two vice-governors due to 
differences of opinion at the top. They said the original plan 
was for congress delegates to elect two vice-governors to fill 
the vacancies left by Mr Chen and another vice-governor, Li 
Mingkang, who was expected to retire soon.

  [Text] On the morning of 15 April, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government held a telephone 
conference to devise plans for our province to deal strict blows 
to serious criminal activities. 
  Sun Shuyi, member of the standing committee of the 
provincial 
party committee and secretary of the commission on politics and 
law of the provincial party committee, attended and addressed 
the conference. Vice Governor Wang Yuxi presided over the 
conference. Meng Qingfeng, director of the provincial public 
security department, read the program of action. 
  The conference pointed out: The priorities to attack this 
activity are criminals who harm the society, affect stability, 
and engage in active sabotage activities; hooligans and local 
ruffians who engage in major crimes of violence, gang up to 
commit crimes, ride roughshod on the streets, and play tyrant in 
their home villages or towns, which the people hate bitterly; 
criminals who steal or damage the country's railway, 
communications, power, water conservation, and oil field

  [Text] The provincial scientific and technological award 
meeting was ceremoniously held at Nanjiao Guesthouse in Jinan on 
the morning of 15 April. 
  In 1993, the broad masses of scientific and technical 
workers 
across the province conscientiously implemented the principle of 
invigorating Shandong through science and education, made 
important contributions to invigorating Shandong's scientific 
and technological undertakings and promoting economic 
development, and achieved more than 2,800 major scientific and 
technological findings, 61 of which attained the domestic 
leading or advanced level. The meeting presented awards to some 
scientific and technical workers who won the 1993 state 
invention award, the state scientific and technological progress 
award, the state spark award, and the provincial scientific and 
technological progress award, and the spark award. 
  The meeting was presided over by Jiang Chunyun, secretary of 
the provincial party committee. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee and provincial governor, gave 
a speech at the meeting. He pointed out: It is necessary to 
fully recognize the new tasks and new demands which economic and 
social development has set on scientific and technological work, 
actively promote the conversion of scientific and technological 
achievements into practical productive forces, further 
strengthen the popularization of scientific and technological 
achievements, perfect the science and technology popularization 
system, stabilize the ranks of scientific and technological 
popularization workers, improve the conditions for popularizing 
science and technology, and form a tremendous force in society 
in which all people attend to the work of popularizing science 
and technology. Zhao Zhihao stressed: To rely on scientific 
and technological progress to invigorate Shandong's economy, the 
crucial issue involved is to have a rank of scientific and 
technical personnel who are rigid in ideology and strong in 
skills. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the 
principle of holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field 
open, do a good job in the transfer of professional personnel 
and in structural adjustment, and make the distribution of 
scientific and technological resources more rational. We 
should actively attract personnel in a planned manner, 
strenuously train and cultivate scientific and technical 
backbone forces for the next century, and unceasingly strengthen 
Shandong's ranks of scientific and technical workers. 
  Jiang Chunyun gave a speech at the end of the meeting. He 
set forth four demands. First, all localities across the 
province should firmly cultivate the concept that science and 
technology are the primary productive forces. If we want to 
maintain a sustained, steady, and sound development in the 
national economy and to smoothly realize the grand objective of 
the national economic and social development, we must attend to 
the development of science and technology which are the primary 
productive forces with great determination, daring, and 
strenuous efforts. The party and government top leaders at all 
levels should personally attend to the primary productive 
forces, take the lead in learning science and technology, and 
unceasingly broaden and enrich their own knowledge. Second, we 
should give play to the creativity of scientific and technical 
personnel to the greatest extent, fully mobilize their 
enthusiasm, and realistically regard them as representatives of 
real productive forces. It is necessary to conscientiously 
implement the party's policy on intellectuals, create a good 
work and living environment for them, and enable them to work 
freely, to display their talent and ability, and to make greater 
contributions. Third, it is necessary to unswervingly follow 
the path of combining economy with science and education and 
realistically rely on science and technology to promote our 
economic development. Science and technology should 
realistically serve the main battlefield of economic 
development. The educational sector should cultivate more 
outstanding and competent economic, scientific, and technical 
professionals. Fourth, it is necessary to rely on deepening 
reform to instill vigor and vitality into scientific and 
technological work. In line with the demand of building the 
socialist market economy, we should promote reform of the 
scientific and technological system, reform and improve the 
scientific and technological management system, and strengthen 
the vitality and motivation of scientific and technological 
development. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that the broad 
masses of scientific and technical workers will promote their 
achievements, advance in the wake of victory, boldly scale the 
heights of science and technology, and make greater 
contributions to invigorating Shandong through science and 
education and promoting better and more rapid economic 
development in Shandong. 
  Provincial leaders Li Chunting, Lu Maozeng, and Ma Zhongcai 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] The provincial conference of public security organs 
on fighting corruption and promoting administrative honesty 
ended on 16 April. The conference proposed efforts be made to 
implement the principle of taking both radical and stopgap 
measures to effect a comprehensive management of public 
security, strengthen education on the purpose of the party, the 
mass line, the legal system, and on preventing and fighting 
corruption among the public security cadres and policemen, and 
enable the broad masses of public security cadres and policemen 
to ideologically build a strong defense line for resisting 
corruption and guarding against evolution. 
  Since the promulgation of the decision of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council on launching anticorruption 
struggle last August, public security organs across the province 
have solidly and effectively carried out their work and made 
noticeable achievements. During this period, they investigated 
and handled a total of 59 law-and discipline-breaking cases of 
various descriptions, handled 71 persons in line with law as 
well as party and administrative discipline, and initially 
checked the random levy of fares, fees, and forced donations, 
abolished 127 items on unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary 
requisition of donations and exaction of fees from enterprises 
and 370 items involving random levies from peasants. While 
conducting cherish-the-people month activities, public security 
organs at all levels have checked some unhealthy trends and 
corrupt phenomena which the people showed strong reaction and 
maintained closer ties between the party and cadres, between 
cadres and the masses, and between the police and the people. 
  Addressing the conference, Sun Shuyi, member of the standing 
committee of the provincial party committee and secretary of the 
commission on politics and law of the provincial party 
committee, pointed out: Public security organs have held 
law-enforcing powers. The corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends 
emerged in the course of law enforcement are the major problems 
reflected by the people. This year public security organs at all 
levels should adopt effective measures to check the problems on 
arbitrarily collecting fees, fines and forced donations, paying 
attention to human relationship while handling cases and issuing 
certificates or licenses, making things difficult for the 
masses, and extorting money or articles from the people that 
exist in some units in order to win trust from the people. 
Regarding the cases on law and discipline violations involving 
cadres and policemen, we should adopt a resolute attitude, 
investigate the cases through to the end, and handle them with a 
serious and conscientious attitude. It is necessary to further 
establish and perfect laws and regulations and fundamentally 
check the breeding and development of corrupt phenomena.

  [Text] When meeting the press in Beijing on the afternoon 
of 10 March, Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee; and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, both of whom are 
Shanghai deputies currently attending the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] said: We have earnestly 
studied and examined Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" 
and, following the instructions of the party Central Committee 
and the State Council, will thoroughly study the situation and 
grasp the spirit and guidelines of the report to ensure that 
Shanghai's work is properly carried out. The central 
authorities' policy of promoting the tax revenue sharing system 
is a general demand. Shanghai, as a part of the country, should 
comply with the demand and make more contributions to the nation 
while developing its economy. 
  Wu Bangguo said: We should not practice the socialist market 
economy without having any rules. Reform of the financial and 
taxation system is designed to regularize the interests between 
the state and enterprises and between the central and local 
authorities. The characteristics of our original taxation system 
are that there were too many tax categories and the tax burdens 
were not reasonably shared. This will create difficulties for 
fair competition between enterprises. We actively support the 
implementation of the tax revenue sharing system. The 
excessively small percentage of the central financial revenue 
will have adverse effects on macroeconomic regulation and 
control. If the general situation is out of control, Shanghai 
also will be unable to develop. Regarding the system of sharing 
between the central and local authorities, our position is as 
follows: Shanghai will resolutely carry out anything that has 
been decided by the central authorities; Shanghai will not be 
exceptional on things that apply to the whole country; Shanghai 
will make more contributions to the central authorities annually 
while developing its economy. 
  Huang Ju said: Implementation of the tax revenue sharing 
system is a major reform that concerns the overall situation. 
In carrying out the reform, we have to consider the need to 
strengthen the central authorities' macroeconomic regulation and 
control ability and to pay attention to rallying localities' 
enthusiasm. In deciding the sharing relationship between the 
central authorities and Shanghai, the central authorities once 
again assured that the policy of developing and opening up 
Pudong will not change and that the original mechanism with 
which Shanghai repays its own foreign debts will not change. 
All these show the party Central Committee and State Council's 
support for Shanghai's work. The only way for Shanghai is, 
under the conditions of macroeconomic regulation and control, to 
strive to make the "cake" bigger to make greater contributions 
to the country.

  [Text] In a recent notice, the Provincial Port Navigation 
Supervision Bureau requested that all port navigation 
departments resolutely stop nonpassenger boats from the 
unauthorized ferrying of passengers. Since the beginning of the 
spring tourism season, unauthorized ferrying of passengers by 
nonpassenger liners in various localities has seriously 
endangered water traffic safety. The Provincial Port Navigation 
Supervision Bureau asked port navigation supervisory offices at 
city and prefectural levels to intensify spot checks against 
boats engaging in carrying passengers in violation of the rules. 
Nonpassenger boats desiring to transport passengers must obtain 
approval from shipping authorities at the county level and 
above, with strict observance to maximum load capacity and 
should be equipped with standardd lifesaving and fire prevention 
facilities.

  [Excerpt] Zhejiang Provincial People's Government held the 
Third Plenary Meeting yesterday afternoon. The meeting aims to 
make plans for carrying out the current tasks in accordance with 
the guiding spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth 
Provincial People's Congress, which emphasizes the division of 
labor and the importance of defining responsibility. 
  Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke at the meeting. After analyzing 
the current situation and defining the major points of this 
year's work, he put forward the following requirements for 
carrying out the work. 
  First, continued efforts should be made to improve the 
division of labor as well as the supervision and inspection 
system. Each department should further divide its tasks and 
assign such tasks to specific units and personnel. The work 
responsibility system should be strengthened. Particularly 
important is the establishment of the responsibility system for 
major leading personnel. It is necessary to carry out routine 
supervision and inspection, as well as routine feedback to 
ensure work accomplishment. Such work should be integrated 
with an evaluation conducted by each organization so as to 
ensure each and every public functionary will conscientiously 
work hard to achieve Zhejiang's goals and tasks. 
  Second, it is necessary to strengthen our investigation and 
research in a bid to find out new situations and problems. 
Leaders of each department should determine the topics of 
their investigation and conduct research in the light of their 
own work. They should focus their studies on special issues and 
current trends. Particularly, they should study various new 
situations and problems that appear during the course of reform. 
In conducting such investigation and research, they should try 
to achieve results applicable to the real work. During their 
investigation and research, they should try to determine various 
work models. In this way, they can push forward all kinds of 
work by showing such exemplary models. 
  Third, it is necessary to tighten administrative disciplines 
and ensure that such administrative disciplines are unified and 
are universally observed. Many reform measures will be 
introduced this year. During the course of reform, interests 
involving many factors are bound to be readjusted. 
Consequently, the interests of some localities and departments 
will be affected to some extent. All departments concerned 
should have a correct understanding and firmly foster an 
awareness of the overall interest so as to ensure that partial 
interests will be subservient to overall interests and current 
interests will be subservient to long-term interests. They 
should never use various excuses to delay the implementation of 
the central authorities' policies and measures because of the 
interests of their own departments or localities. Leaders at 
all levels should conscientiously become a supporter for the 
unification of administrative disciplines and ensure that all 
policies and measures introduced by central and provincial 
authorities will be carried out smoothly. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the unity among all 
leaders so as form a great force in carrying out our tasks. 
Great efforts should be made to maintain unity in our leading 
groups. To achieve unison among all leading personnel, we 
should pay more respect to others' opinions, have more 
discussions with others, give more support to each other, and 
advocate criticism and self-criticism. We should further uphold 
and improve the responsibility system for administrative 
leaders, have a rational division of labor, clearly define the 
responsibility, and be more coordinated in our work. Meanwhile, 
we should pay attention to ideological and political work among 
our workers and staff personnel. 
  Wan Xueyan said: Building a socialist market economy is a 
completely new subject to us. Cadres at all levels face a 
tremendous task of learning this subject. In this year, we 
should pay particular attention to theoretical studies, 
particularly Volume Three of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping." We should try to have a profound understanding of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
We should study well recently-promulgated economic laws and 
regulations as well as economic policies and improve our 
knowledge about market economy. [passage omitted]

  The Egyptian-Chinese relations are remarkably strong and are 
based on mutual understanding and support in the face of various

  [Text] London, April 17 (XINHUA) -- British Defence 
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today criticized the people who have 
advocated that more air strikes could halt combat in Bosnia. 
  Speaking on BBC Radio, the British defence secretary said 
that air power could not determine the outcome of the Bosnian 
war, although he denied that air strikes had failed and insisted 
that air strikes had reduced U.N. casualties there. 
  Rifkind argued that only massive ground forces would have 
that impact, but he maintained that the United Nations should 
remain non- partisan. 
  Meanwhile, Lord Carrington, former U.N. envoy to Bosnia, 
criticized today the West's policy failure in Bosnia. 
  Speaking on BBC TV, Lord Carrington said that with regard to 
the U.N. peace efforts in Bosnia, "everything has gone wrong." 
  It would be "madness" for the United Nations to wage war 
against the Bosnian Serbs, he stressed.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr--Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen met Portuguese Foreign Minister Barroso on the 
afternoon of 12 April in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Vice 
Premier Qian welcomed Foreign Minister Barroso, who had come to 
China for a second visit and was accompanying Prime Minister da 
Silva. Qian Qichen said that the Chinese and Portuguese prime 
ministers had conducted very good talks. Barroso said that he 
was very happy to meet Vice Premier Qian again. He indicated 
that Prime Minister da Silva's current visit was very successful 
and that this showed the good relations between Portugal and 
China. 
  Qian Qichen said that China and Portugal had successfully 
resolved the Macao issue and that this had become a good example 
of resolving historical problems through friendly consultation. 
He hoped that the power transfer in Macao would proceed 
smoothly and that this process would occur in a situation of 
stability and cooperation between the two countries. 
  On China's relations with the European Union, Qian Qichen 
said that the European Union is an important trade partner of 
China; but in comparison with the United States and Japan, the 
potential for economic and trade development has not been 
brought into play. Barroso said that Portugal favors European 
Union efforts to develop relations with China. Portugal is of 
the opinion that developing Portuguese-Chinese friendly and 
cooperative relations corresponds with the interests of the two 
countries' people, and Portugal supports China's reentry into 
GATT. Qian Qichen stressed that in international affairs, China 
dedicates itself to preserving peace and stability; no matter 
what happens in the world, China will continue its role in 
protecting peace and stability. 
  During the meeting, the two foreign ministers exchanged 
views 
on other international issues. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu was present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs have 
agreed an international buffer force to enter the Muslim enclave 
of Gorazde, according to U.N. Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway 
today. 
  The spokesman said that Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N. 
representative for former Yugoslavia, had been informed of the 
Serb decision at Pale today, the stronghold of Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic, where Akashi and Karadzic had been 
meeting in a bid to break the deadlock over the enclave. 
  Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders 
on 
a truce for the besieged southeastern Muslim enclave and the 
release of some 200 U.N. personnel. 
  According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16 
U.N. 
soldiers and three military observers -- were released by 
Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday [17 April], three 
days after they were detained in retaliation for NATO air 
strikes.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs agreed 
today to ease their siege of Gorazde and allow an international 
buffer force to enter the Muslim enclave as a result of 
negotiations with the United Nations, according to U.N. 
Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway today. 
  The spokesman said that under the agreement, a 350-strong 
U.N. force will go into Gorazde, home to 65,000 residents and 
refugees, in Southeastern Bosnia. 
  Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N. representative for former 
Yugoslavia, had been informed today of the Serb decision in 
Pale, the stronghold of Bosnian Serbs, where Akashi and Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had been meeting in a bid to break 
the deadlock over the enclave. 
  the serbs, besieging Gorazde for nearly two years, have 
agreed to withdraw their weapons from within a three-kilometer 
zone around the city, to be followed by talks on a more 
permanent exclusion zone later, the U.N. spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders 
on 
a truce for the Muslim enclave and the release of some 200 U.N. 
personnel. 
  According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16 
U.N. 
soldiers and three military observers -- were released by 
Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday, three days after 
they were detained in retaliation for NATO air strikes. 
  Two NATO air strikes in the past two weeks, provoked by the 
Serb siege of Gorazde, had heightened tension between the Serbs 
and the U.N. 
  The agreement also provided for a multinational peacekeeping 
battalion of British, French, Ukrainian, Egyptian and a small 
Nordic medical unit to enforce the truce and restore calm in the 
area, Holloway said. 
  It was unclear so far when the U.N. troops would move in.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Serbian tanks 
entered the embattled town of Gorazde today across shattered 
Muslim positions around the town despite U.N. officials' 
announcement that a truce had been reached. 
  U.N. officials said that 21 people had been killed Sunday 
[17 
April] and 55 wounded and that the fightings were even more 
tense after the ceasefire announcement. 
  "Bosnian army defenses around Gorazde have collapsed. They 
are non-existent," U.N. Peacekeeping Force Spokesman Rob Annink 
said, adding that "there is nothing to stop them except a 
command of their own political leadership." 
  The Serb siege of Gorazde, a Muslim enclave declared by the 
U.N. as a "safe area," provoked two NATO air strikes last Sunday 
and Monday. 
  Serb forces retaliated against the NATO strikes, detaining 
U.N. personnel last week and shooting down a British war jet 
over Gorazde Sunday. 
  This was the first NATO aircraft downed during military 
operations in Bosnia. 
  With the Serbs continuing their siege despite U.N. efforts 
to 
broker a ceasefire, U.N. chief representative for Yugoslavia 
today admitted that "the means at our disposal are not 
sufficient to cope with the situation." 
  At least 200,000 people have been killed or missing in the 
fightings between the Muslims, Serbs and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

"Deng Nan Confirmed in Front of Chinese and Foreign Reporters 
That Deng Xiaoping Is In Good Health"] 
  [Text] Beijing 15 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Deng Xiaoping is in 
very good health [shen ti fei chang jian kang 6500 7555 7236 
1603 0256 1660], and is much concerned with China's 
construction, Deng Nan, vice minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission confirmed to reporters here today. 
  She said that there are all sorts of rumors about her 
father's health overseas, which they had got quite used to, and 
would sometimes joke about. Each day, my father follows his 
routine practice and completes his set work as before, including 
a lot of reading. He continues to go for a stroll every day, 
and we even played bridge together the evening before last. 
  The State Council Information Office called a news 
conference 
for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Media Hotel today, and 
Chen Yaoban, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, and 
Deng Nan, vice minister of State Science and Technology 
Commission were invited to brief reporters on the white paper, 
"China's Agenda 21-- Population, Environment, and Development of 
China in the 21st Century," and answer their questions. 
  One after the other, several foreign reporters asked Deng 
Nan 
about Deng Xiaoping's health. Deng Nan answered: I quite 
understand your concern for my father's health. There are often 
all sorts of rumors about my father's health, which we have 
gotten quite used to. Sometimes, we joke about them. My father 
is in pretty good health, and is very much concerned with 
China's construction, including the entire implementation of the 
targets set forth in "China's Agenda 21." 
  At the news conference, Deng Nan said: Everyone is equal 
before Chinese law. 
  Deng Nan made that point when answering foreign reporters' 
questions on the sons and daughters of some cadres in China 
abusing their power. 
  Deng Nan said: You have all learned recently that Li 
Xiaoshi, a former vice minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. 
To my knowledge, Li Xiaoshi is also from a senior cadre family 
background. To my mind, anyone, either the man on the street or 
the son of a senior cadre, so long as he violates the Chinese 
law, will be meted out due legal sanction.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- The daughter of Deng 
Xiaoping, Ms. Deng Nan, said that her father was in good health 
and still did much routine work including reading a lot of 
material and taking walks. She added that she and her father 
had played bridge the day before yesterday. 
  Ms. Deng made the remarks in reply to questions related to 
the state of her father's health when attending a press 
conference at the State Council press office in her capacity as 
the Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, together with the Vice Minister of the State 
Planning Commission Mr. Chen Yaobang, both of whom elaborated on 
a White Paper on China's population, environment, and 
development in the 21st century. 
  Ms. Deng said that she understood the wide concern for her 
father's health and that she and her family members were used to 
various rumours regarding her father's state of health and even 
joked about them. She repeated that her father was in a good 
state of health and clearly showed his care for the build-up of 
the country including the White Paper on the outlook for China 
in the next century. 
  Speaking on the White Paper, Mr. Chen said that it employed 
the spirit of the United Nations Environment and Development 
Convention held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June, 1992, and 
was worked out by the Chinese Government with the participation 
of 52 departments and social institutions involving 300 experts 
with four revisions. The paper was discussed and endorsed at a 
meeting presided over by Premier Li Peng last March 25. 
  The paper, based on the State situation and population as 
well as environment and development, makes known the general 
strategy for promotion of coordination of the economy, society, 
resources, and the environment in a bid to achieve continuous 
development. It will serve as a guiding document for a medium- 
and long-term programme for national economic and social 
development. It will also be used as a reference in the 
formulation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the programme for 
the year 2001.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- Deputy Director of 
China's State Science and Technology Commission, Ms. Deng Nan, 
who is the daughter of Deng Xiaoping, said today at a press 
conference arranged by the Information Office under the State 
Council that China's law was equal for all. 
  She made these remarks in reply to a question regarding the 
apparant private gains made by some sons and daughters of 
leading cadres in China through their political power. 
  Ms. Deng said that everyone knew about the 20-year jail 
sentence handed down to a former deputy director of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, Li Xiaoshi, and to her 
knowledge, Le Xiaoshi was also the son of a senior cadre. She 
said she believed that irrespective of whether it was an 
ordinary person or the son or daughter of a leading cadre, they 
would receive the same punishment under the law if they were 
found to have breached the country's law.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Laixi (3769 0171 0823) and Li Chunlei </F>
(2621 2504 7191)] 
  [Text] Harbin, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- While on an inspection 
tour in Heilongjiang, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing 
Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice 
premier of the State Council, stressed that Heilongjiang 
Province has advantages in the areas of resources and industry. 
The current difficulties faced by the province are temporary 
ones encountered in the course of advance. Under the leadership 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council, it is 
entirely possible to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy with the 
efforts of the people of the entire province. 
  From 12 to 17 April, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by 
Heilongjiang's party and government leaders, including Sun 
Weiben, Tian Fengshan, and Cong Fukui, and other comrades, 
arrived in Daqing, Zhaodong, Harbin, and other areas for 
inspection tours to conduct investigations. 
  Comrade Yue Qifeng [deputy secretary of Liaoning party 
committee and Liaoning governor] participated in the inspection 
tour from beginning to end. 
  Zhu Rongji visited drilling sites, factory workshops, 
state-owned granaries, grain stations, rural seed growers, and 
farm product markets to have a cordial conversation with 
workers, farmers, and shop assistants. He inquired in detail 
about their production, business, and living conditions. He 
also called on cadres and workers of state-owned 
forestry-industry farms and land reclamation farms to hold talks 
with them. In Harbin, he held several talks with the leaders of 
relevant departments directly under the provincial government 
and leaders of prefectures and cities, enterprises, and 
factories to discuss ways to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy. 
After affirming Heilongjiang's important contributions to the 
state and the achievements the province has scored since the 
introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, he 
said: The party Central Committee and the State Council pay 
special attention to Heilongjiang's economic development. 
Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, I, together with 
other comrades from the relevant departments under the State 
Council, have come here to conduct investigations and studies 
and to discuss with the provincial leaders new ideas for reform 
and development and measures for overcoming the current 
difficulties and for developing the economy. 
  Zhu Rongji stressed: The difficulties which have cropped up 
in the course of Heilongjiang's economic development are 
temporary difficulties in the course of advance. There is no 
doubt that they can be overcome. In solving these problems, the 
most important thing we must do is to unify the thinking of the 
cadres and people of the whole province, enhance their 
understanding, and change their concepts. The characteristics 
of Heilongjiang's economy are that it has resources and that 
industry and state-owned enterprises occupy a large proportion 
of the economy. This is a factor restricting economic 
development, but is also an advantage for invigorating the 
province's economy. So long as the province does its work in a 
down-to-earth manner in accordance with requirements for 
developing a socialist market economy, it will be able to 
transform these factors of restriction to favorable conditions 
for developing the economy. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang is the nation's important 
grain producing province and is also the nation's largest 
strategic base for grain reserves. It has great potential for 
grain production. Its 80 million mu of low-yielding farms can be 
improved; moreover, it has another 50 million mu of wasteland 
that can be reclaimed for farming. The central authorities 
attach great importance to agriculture. They are adopting 
measures to narrow the gap between the princes of agricultural 
and industrial products and are increasing investment in 
agriculture. So long as Heilongjiang upholds the principle of 
taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, 
makes full use of its advantages, readjusts its planting 
structure, popularizes fine seed strains, and develops a 
diversified economy, it will be able to turn agriculture into an 
important pillar for invigorating its economy. He pointed out: 
Town and village enterprises in Heilongjiang are not well 
developed, and farmers' incomes are increasing at a slow pace, 
but Heilongjiang's industry has enough technological strength to 
support the development of town and village enterprises. The 
prospects are promising in this area. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang Province is an important 
industrial base in China. In particular, it has various 
categories of heavy industries; its technological strength is 
strong, and in terms of equipment Heilongjiang is not bad at 
all. The province should make the upgrading of state-owned 
large- and medium-size enterprises the focus of its economic 
work and enhance the leading role of these enterprises. The 
fundamental way to deal with the difficulties encountered by 
state-owned enterprises is to deepen reform and to effectively 
change their operating mechanisms in line with the requirements 
for building modern enterprises. In building a modern 
enterprise system, the most important thing to do is to separate 
government administration from enterprise management. The 
government should not interfere with an enterprise's decisions 
regarding normal operations. The government's main task is to 
supervise the leading bodies of enterprises and macroeconomic 
environment. 
  While in Harbin, Zhu Rongji inspected the ordnance 
enterprises which were encountering relatively greater 
difficulties. He stressed: Ordnance enterprises should 
continue to carry forward the spirit of self-reliant work to 
build an enterprise with arduous efforts, and change their way 
of operation and management in line with the requirements of a 
market economy. At the same time, they should make accurate 
decisions regarding switching from the manufacture of military 
products to that of civilian products. First, they should 
undertake more labor-intensive projects, instead of projects 
that need a large sum of capital, so as to employ more surplus 
labor; second, they should undertake more technical 
transformation projects instead of capital construction 
projects, because this is an effective way to get quick returns 
with less investment; third, they should no longer rely on 
appropriations to undertake new projects. They should use their 
own capital or bank loans, but should consider their ability to 
repay loans; and fourth, they should undertake more service 
projects instead of concentrating entirely on industrial 
projects. 
  Touching on debts among enterprises, Zhu Rongji said: In 
settling arrears among enterprises this time, new methods will 
be adopted to deal with the new characteristics. The state will 
not inject large sums of funds to settle arrears caused by the 
shortage of funds for investment in fixed assets. When funds 
raised by localities for projects are insufficient, the relevant 
prefectural authorities must quickly readjust their capital 
construction scale and channel their funds into other areas so 
as to ensure the minimum amount of funds; otherwise, banks will 
suspend loans for the projects. It is necessary to foster a 
concept of the legal system, strengthen settlement discipline, 
and prevent the accumulation of new arrears while settling the 
old ones. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang has the advantage in opening 
to the outside world. It should work harder to absorb and 
utilize foreign capital. While developing all-directional 
trade, it should strive to improve border trade, rectify the 
border trade order, readjust border trade structures, and adopt 
strict measures to control quality so as to promote the healthy 
development of border trade. 
  While inspecting Daqing, Zhu Rongji pointed out: Daqing has 
made immortal contributions in changing the concept that "China 
is poor in petroleum." Daqing should inherit and carry forward 
the fine tradition of building an enterprise with arduous 
efforts which took shape during the all-out effort to prospect 
for oil, and make greater contributions to the state. It should 
adopt advanced technology and strive hard to stabilize its oil 
output at the current production level before the year 2000. At 
the same time, it should strive to simultaneously develop 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, 
and fishery, improve urban planning, and build itself into a 
prosperous area in the north. 
  During the few days of investigations and studies, Zhu 
Rongji 
and other leaders of the relevant departments under the State 
Council he was leading discussed with the comrades from 
Heilongjiang new ideas for reform and development. They also 
solved some practical problems in economic development for 
Heilongjiang, especially for its ordnance and coal enterprises, 
as well as for state-owned forestry-industry and land 
reclamation farms. 
  Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were comrades 
from the relevant ministries and commissions under the State 
Council, including Liu Zhongli, Guo Shuyan, Wang Senhao, Han 
Zhubin, Xu Youfang, Tu Yourui, Wang Tao, Sheng Huaren, Zhu Yuli, 
and Zhang Junjiu.

<F P=106> [By Correspondent Lu Zhiyong (6629 2535 0516)] </F>
  [Text] On 7 March, Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang 
Provincial CPC Committee, attended the opening ceremony of the 
first term of the 1994 training class for provincial management 
cadres sponsored by the party school under the provincial party 
congress. He also exchanged views with those cadres on studying 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. 
Liang Pingbo, member of the provincial CPC committee and head 
of the provincial CPC committee's propaganda department, 
presided over the opening ceremony. Li Zemin stressed the need 
for all levels of leading cadres to conscientiously study Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the 
"Decisions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; to grasp well work of overall importance; to 
correctly understand and handle well the dialectical 
relationship between reform, development, and stability; and to 
ensure that the basic principle of the party work for this year 
will be implemented in our province. 
  Li Zemin said "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain stability" are the 
party's overriding task for this year. Reform is the motive, 
development is the target, and stability is the guarantee and 
prerequisite for China. The three conditions taken together are 
an integrated whole. A correct understanding of the guiding 
principle for this year's work will help continue and develop 
the excellent situation in our province. The key for handling 
well the relationship between the three conditions lies in 
comprehensively and scientifically understanding Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping thought on development, reform, and stability. He said 
the issue of development is a very important idea in Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Under the conditions of developing a socialist 
market economy and of reforming the financial, monetary, and 
investment structures and when seeking development, we should 
stop adopting the old, lax, and inefficient management style 
which was characterized by superficial expansion, unplanned 
investment, and single-minded pursuit of high output value; 
instead, we should seek development through deepening the 
reform, readjusting and optimizing the economic structure, 
improving the quality of the entire economy, and raising 
economic efficiency. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on reform 
and opening up is one of the important parts of the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the 
party's basic line. Now the ideological and theoretical basis 
for reform are in place. We should rely on reform measures to 
solve the deep-seated contradictions and problems in economic 
life. Reform entails risks. But we must not stop embarking on 
our reform goals just because there are risks ahead. We need to 
develop unified thinking and to make meticulous arrangements, in 
order to reduce risks and to implement various reform measures 
in a positive and steady manner. Li Zemin added that the most 
important element in implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's call 
for "stability as the overriding task" is to maintain economic, 
social and political stability, and properly handle various 
interests and relationships. At present, particular attention 
should be given to upholding the authority of the CPC Central 
Committee, to maintaining the unity and enforcement of the 
government laws and orders, and to ensuring that reform, opening 
up, society, and the economy develop in an orderly and healthy 
manner. 
  Li Zemin said all levels of leading comrades should take the 
lead in conscientiously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and raising 
their capability to solve complex contradictions and to cope 
with various situations. The provincial CPC committee has 
decided that cadres involved in management enroll in study 
classes in six batches at the party school. They will 
concentrate on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and the "Decisions" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Sponsoring the 
training classes for provincial management cadres is one of the 
important measures adopted by the provincial CPC committee to 
enhance leading cadres' ideological and theoretical levels. The 
purpose is to make them well-prepared for the introduction of 
new reform measures this year. As the provincial CPC committee 
attaches great importance to the training classes, it will 
assign a leading comrade to attend each of the training class so 
that the leading comrade will join discussions and exchange 
views with cadres attending the training class. He expressed 
the hope that cadres attending the training class would 
integrate the actual situation in our province's reform and 
opening up with their own ideas; know well the emancipation of 
mind and of seeking truth from facts which are the essence of 
Marxism; raise the problem-analysis and problem-solving 
capability by applying Marxist positions, viewpoints, and 
methods; and improve administrative and leadership levels in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
  Also attending the training-class opening ceremony were Yu 
Wenhua, deputy secretary general and director of the general 
office of the provincial CPC committee; Chen Sining, deputy head 
of the organization department under the provincial CPC 
committee; and Liu Guangyi and Tang Rongsheng, vice presidents 
of the party school under the provincial CPC committee.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A large mosque, more 
than 500 years old, has been rebuilt here in this northern China 
port city. 
  Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Chinese 
Communist Party's Politburo, wrote inscriptions for the mosque 
on a tablet. 
  The Islamic northern mosque (Qingzhen Beisi), called "No. 1 
Mosque in Northern China," can hold more than 1,500 people for 
Moslem gatherings. 
  First built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) but 
destroyed 
in later wars and turmoil, the new mosque is much bigger and 
complex than the original one, according to an executive from 
the Islamic Association of China. 
  Most of China's Muslims live in North-West China, but 
Tianjin 
also has several thousand.

  [Text] Harbin, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji today ended a six-day tour of north-east China's 
Heilongjiang Province, after visits to Daqing, Zhaodong, Harbin 
and other cities. 
  Accompanied by senior provincial officials, the vice-premier 
went to local oilfields, factories, grain depots, market places 
and state farms to explore people's lives. 
  He also held talks with local officials and entrepreneurs, 
exchanging views on how to develop the local economy. 
  The vice-premier said Heilongjiang's difficulties in 
developing its economy is temporary and can be overcome. "There 
are bright prospects for invigorating the local economy," Zhu 
said. 
  He said the province's resource-processing type of economy, 
its big heavy industry and large number of state-owned 
enterprises should not be a burden to its development. These 
could be turned to good advantage. 
  Zhu Rongji told local officials that the central government 
is taking steps to reduce the price gap between farm and 
industry products, which will certainly benefit Heilongjiang, a 
leading grain-producing province of China. 
  Zhu reminded the officials that the province's developed 
industry could provide a greater technical support in developing 
its rural industry, which helps increase farmers' cash incomes. 
  As it has one of the largest manufacturing industries in 
China, Zhu said, the province should take the establishment of a 
modern enterprises system as a major solution to the 
difficulties facing state-owned enterprises. 
  In doing so, the vice-premier noted, the most important 
point 
was to liberate enterprises from interference by governments. 
  To the province's many defence industry enterprises which 
are 
having a hard time, the vice-premier also offered a prescription. 
  It was: to rely more on technical rather than capital input 
for better performance; develop more labor-intensive industry to 
create more job opportunities for redundant workers; look for a 
bigger market share in the service industries. 
  Referring to debts between enterprises, the vice-premier 
warned that this time, the central coffers would not provide 
large amounts of money to help clear any debts arising from 
poorly-funded capital construction projects. 
  Not only this, the vice-premier said, the state bank would 
stop giving loans to poorly-funded local construction projects, 
unless the scale and contents of these projects were properly 
readjusted. 
  While urging the province to step up its effort to attract 
more overseas investment, the vice-premier also called for 
better administration and higher product quality in border 
trade, so that this would develop further and more healthily. 
  On his visit to Daqing, Zhu Rongji noted that the city's oil 
industry should employ more new technology to maintain its oil 
output at the present level by the year 2000. 
  Zhu Rongji was accompanied on his tour by Finance Minister 
Liu Zhongli, Railway Minister Han Shubin, Coal Industry Minister 
Wang Senhao and other officials from the State Council.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yuan Jianda (5913 1696 6671) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- DONG BIWU, a full-length 
pictorial on Dong Biwu's brilliant militant life, was published 
on the occasion of his 108th birthday. More than 200 people 
attended a discussion meeting in the Great Hall of the People 
this morning to mark the publication of the pictorial. They 
included personages of the judicial and jurisprudential circles 
and Dong's relatives and aides. 
  Wang Hanbin, Song Ping, Song Renqiong, Ren Jianxin, Sun 
Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Guangying, Zhang Siqing, Wang Ping, 
Wu Xiuquan, Jiang Hua, Chen Xilian, Lu Zhengcao, Zheng 
Tianxiang, and Wang Heshou attended a publishing ceremony and 
the discussion. 
  Comrade Dong Biwu was one of the founders of the CPC. He was 
an outstanding party and state leader, as well as the principal 
founder of the people's judiciary during the period of the new 
democratic revolution and socialist construction. He held 
concurrent posts as vice premier of the central people's 
government and chairman of the political and law committee. He 
also served successively as president of the Supreme People's 
Court and acting president of the People's Republic of China. 
  The pictorial, compiled by the China Revolutionary Museum, 
contains a large number of photographs showing Dong Biwu's 
activities during various periods from the bourgeois democratic 
revolution to the new democratic revolution and socialist 
construction. 
  Bo Yibo made a written speech to greet the publication of 
the 
pictorial. He said: Comrade Dong Biwu was a great 
revolutionary. He unselfishly dedicated his entire brilliant 
life to the liberation and prosperity of the Chinese nation and 
to the independence and prosperity of our country. We should 
learn from his great spirit and lofty character, work hard with 
one heart and one mind under the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and build well 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as Comrade Xiaoping has 
advocated. 
  Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, delivered 
a speech at the meeting. He highly praised Comrade Dong Biwu 
for having made outstanding contributions to China's revolution 
and construction and particularly to China's legal system during 
his several decades of revolutionary career. He said: Comrade 
Dong Biwu dedicated himself to the formulation of China's 
socialist legal system. He profoundly expounded Marxist views 
on state and law, summed up the historical experience of the 
building of the people's regime and the formulation of the legal 
system, and explained and proposed a series of policies and 
principles on strengthening the socialist legal system. His 
far-sighted views and propositions remain an important guidance 
for us to uphold the policy of "building both material and 
spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both" 
and to further strengthen democracy and the legal system.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- The Beijing Higher 
People's Court passed final judgment on Hong Kong reporter Xi 
Yang and rejected his appeal by upholding the 12-year jail 
sentence and deprivation of political rights for two years, 
handed down by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court on March 
28. The co-defendant Tian Ye, the deputy director of the office 
of the foreign affairs bureau of the People's Bank of China, had 
his original sentence of 15 years imprisonment and deprivation 
of political rights for three years confirmed. 
  Xi Yang, on assignment for the newspaper MING PAO, went to 
Beijing last June and July purportedly to cover the Sino-British 
talks and the establishment of the preliminary working committee 
to prepare for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The 
court papers said that he did not apply to the authorities for 
coverage as was required in accordance with state regulations. 
Instead, he sent Tian Ye to steal and pry out state financial 
and economic secrets. Tian Ye stole classified documents 
involving sample banknotes, information on the sale of gold by 
the central bank in the international market, and on the 
adjustment of the exchange rate as well as documents on raising 
the interest rate by the central bank. The court papers noted 
that he illegally offered Xi Yang the documents which were, in 
turn, included in articles published in MING PAO, an action 
causing great economic damage to the state. The court said that 
the crime committed by the two defendants was undeniable and 
there was solid evidence to justify the sentence.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO Short Commentary: "The Alarm Bell Is Set Off </F>
Again" -- date not given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- RENMIN RIBAO Short 
Commentary: "The Alarm Bell Is Set Off Again" 
  The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has 
already 
passed judgment in accordance with the law on the case of Tian 
Ye and Xi Yang, who are accused of stealing state secrets and 
spying. Tian and Xi were sentenced to 15 and 12 years, 
respectively, in jail. The judicial organs took facts as the 
basis and the law as their criterion in reaching the judgment. 
The sentencing standards used are proper and the two offenders 
received their due punishment. 
  Xi Yang is a reporter of MING PAO based in Hong Kong who was 
assigned by the newspaper to cover news in the inland [nei di 
0355 0966]. He is welcome if he does the things a reporter is 
supposed to do -- gathering news and writing news stories. He 
is, however, not a law-abiding person, and he chose to engage 
in illegal acts of stealing and spying on financial and economic 
state secrets, which caused catastrophic consequences. These 
kinds of illegal acts, if not punished according to the law, 
will severely sabotage reform, opening up, and economic 
construction and do great harm to the interest of the state. Xi 
Yang's is a criminal case, pure and simple. The punishment of 
criminals guilty of stealing secrets and the protection of 
correspondents' freedom to gather news in accordance with the 
law are two totally different things. There is a clear 
distinction between legitimate news gathering and illegal 
spying. Our government protects the freedom of news coverage 
but not the freedom of stealing state secrets. Whoever steals 
state secrets in violation of the law will be punished according 
to the law. 
  As everybody knows, in the past decade or so, China, which 
is 
implementing the policy of reform and opening to the outside 
world, has opened its door to and warmly welcomed correspondents 
from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan as well as from foreign 
countries to cover news in China, and offered, to the extent 
possible, services to make things easier for them in their 
legitimate reporting. This is the way we received the over 
1,000 Hong Kong correspondents who came to the inland for news 
coverage since last year. Most correspondents from overseas 
abide by Chinese law, and only one case, Xi Yang's case, of 
stealing state secrets and spying was discovered last year. The 
law is sacred and no one is allowed to break it. No sovereign 
country or responsible government will tolerate illegal acts of 
spying on secrets in the name of news coverage. 
  As for Tian Ye, he is "a thief in the family" who wormed his 
way into an important state department. As a deputy chief of 
the General Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the 
People's Bank of China, his acts of stealing, spying on, and 
illegally supplying state secrets to others -- acts that have 
caused great damage to the country and people -- are even more 
intolerable under the law. The end he has come to is 
educational to the people: under the new historical period, 
reform and opening up indeed pose a severe test to the loyalty 
of every cadre of the state. In the future, we must step up 
ideological education among the cadres. We must also strictly 
enforce law and discipline and implement effective measures to 
prevent similar violations from happening again. 
  This case of stealing secrets and spying has set off the 
alarm bell again. It reminds us to be alert in safeguarding 
state secrets and also serves as a warning to those who divulge 
or steal secrets. May the alarm bell ring forever!

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Overseas 
correspondents are free to report on China but will be punished 
if they violate Chinese law, the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] 
says in a short commentary to be published in tomorrow's edition. 
  The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper makes these remarks 
in commenting on today's rejection of the appeal by Xi Yang, a 
correspondent of the Hong Kong-based newspaper MING PAO, against 
a 12-year sentence for spying. 
  Xi was arrested last October and charged with espionage on 
state banking secrets. His accomplice, Tian Ye, an official of 
the People's Bank of China, was sentenced to 15 years behind 
bars. 
  The PEOPLE'S DAILY says: "The punishment of criminals and 
the 
protection of the freedom of news coverage are two totally 
different things," adding: "whoever steals state secrets will 
get punished." 
  "The Chinese Government protects the freedom of news 
coverage 
but not the freedom of stealing state secrets," the newspaper 
says. 
  If criminals in such cases are not punished severely 
according to the law, it says, China will suffer great damage in 
its reform and opening to the outside and in its economic 
construction. 
  In the past decade, China had always welcomed correspondents 
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as from foreign 
countries to do news coverage in China, and offered help for 
their legitimate reporting, it says. 
  Most correspondents from overseas abide by Chinese law, and 
only one case, i.e. Xi Yang's case, of spying on state secrets 
was discovered last year, it says. More than 1,000 Hong Kong 
reporters came to the mainland to do news reporting last year. 
  The paper labels Tian as "a thief in the family," saying 
that 
he cannot be tolerated as he revealed state secrets and caused 
great damage to the country and the Chinese people. 
  It warns other officials that China's reform and opening to 
the outside world poses a severe test to their loyalty.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tian Ye, deputy 
director of the General Office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of 
the People's Bank of China; and Xi Yang, a Hong Kong MING PAO 
reporter, were today respectively sentenced by the Beijing 
Municipal Higher People's Court to 15 years in prison and 
deprived of political rights for three years, and to 12 years in 
prison and deprived of political rights for two years, for 
stealing and illegally gathering state financial and economic 
secrets. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court reached 
the final ruling on maintaining the sentences decided on after 
the first trial of the two defendants. 
  Xi Yang, 38, went to Hong Kong from the mainland in June 
1992 
after inheriting property, and became a MING PAO reporter in 
August the same year. From June to July 1993, he was assigned 
by the person in charge of the newspaper to conduct activities 
in Beijing in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and 
inauguration of the Preliminary Work Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. During his stay in Beijing, he spent most of his time 
illegally gathering state financial and economic secrets. Under 
Xi's instructions, Tian Ye provided him with top-secret 
information concerning China's bank note printing pattern and 
the People's Bank of China's plans to sell gold on the 
international market; to readjust the foreign exchange rates; 
and to again raise bank deposit interest rates, which Tian Ye 
had stolen and illegally gathered. Tian Ye also illegally 
provided Xi Yang with documents on "An Explanation on the 
Provisional Regulations Governing the Dealing of Renminbi by 
Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions," which were marked 
"confidential." Xi Yang incorporated these state secrets into 
articles and sent them to MING PAO for publication, causing 
serious economic losses to the state. Tian Ye and Xi Yang were 
arrested separately according to the law in October 1993. 
  The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate instituted 
proceedings according to the law against Tian Ye and Xi Yang on 
14 December 1993. Because the case involved state secrets, the 
Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, according to 
article 111 of the "Criminal Procedural Law," conducted a 
nonpublic trial of the case. During the trial, because some 
evidence required further confirmation, the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court returned the case on 27 January 1994 
to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for evidence 
substantiation. On 15 February, the Beijing Municipal People's 
Procuratorate again referred the case to the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court. 
  Before the trial began, both Tian Ye and Xi Yang said they 
did not need an attorney and would defend themselves on their 
own. During the trial, both defendants admitted their crimes and 
repented what they had done, and asked the court to show 
leniency. 
  After the trial was completed, the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court ruled that, as a state worker Tian 
Ye violated the state's secrecy laws and regulations, and stole 
and illegally gathered and provided state secrets; that his act 
constituted the crime of stealing and illegally gathering and 
providing state secrets; and the case was especially serious. 
The court also ruled Xi Yang had ignored state law, stole and 
illegally gathered state financial and economic secrets, and 
published these secrets in a newspaper outside the country; that 
his act constituted the crime of stealing and illegally 
gathering state secrets; and the case was especially serious. 
The court ruled: The evidence of both defendants' crimes is 
well substantiated. According to the "Supplemental Regulations 
on the Punishment for the Crime of Revealing State Secrets" of 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee -- which 
states "Those who steal, illegally gather, buy, or provide state 
secrets to organs, organizations, or personnel outside the 
country are to be sentenced to 10 years or more in prison, to 
life imprisonment, or to death, and are to be deprived of 
political rights, if the case is especially serious" -- the 
Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, considering that 
both defendants had admitted their crimes and confessed, decided 
to appropriately reduce the punishment and reached a first-trial 
verdict on 28 March 1994, sentencing Tian Ye to 15 years in 
prison and depriving him of political rights for three years, 
and sentencing Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and depriving him 
of political rights for two years. Xi Yang refused to accept 
the verdict and lodged an appeal to the Beijing Municipal Higher 
People's Court. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court, 
after completing a second trial of the case, decided to reject 
Xi Yang's appeal and maintained the original verdict. The two 
criminals' prison terms begin from the date of detention.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- An appeal by Xi Yang, 
a reporter of the MING PAO newspaper based in Hong Kong, against 
a 12-year prison sentence on charges of stealing state secrets 
was turned down here today. 
  The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court rejected Xi 
Yang's appeal, upholding the sentence of the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court of 12 years' imprisonment, depriving 
him of political rights for two years. 
  Xi's abettor, Tian Ye, was sentenced by the original trial 
to 
15 years' imprisonment and deprived of political rights for 
three years. Tian, who was formerly deputy chief of the General 
Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the People's Bank of 
China (PBC), did not appeal. 
  Assigned by the MING PAO newspaper, Xi Yang stayed in 
Beijing 
during the period from June to July, 1993, under the pretext of 
covering the Sino-British talks and the establishment of the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress. 
  However, he did not send his applications for interviews to 
departments concerned as the state regulations demand, but 
incited Tian Ye to steal and spy out government financial and 
economic secrets. 
  Tian provided Xi with many top secrets including samples of 
Chinese bank notes, information about the PBC's selling gold in 
the international market, the PBC's plan about readjusting the 
exchange rates between Chinese renminbi and foreign currencies, 
and the PBC's decision about raising again the interest rates of 
the deposits as of July in the year. 
  Besides, Tian stole and illegally provided Xi Yang with a 
confidential document entitled "illustration on the provisional 
rules about overseas-funded financial institutions' engaging in 
business of renminbi." After receiving the secrets, Xi 
immediately wrote stories about them and sent the stories to the 
headquarters of the MING PAO newspaper for publication, thus 
causing the state to suffer heavy economical losses. 
  On December 14, 1993, the Beijing Municipal People's 
Procuratorate instituted proceedings against Xi Yang and Tian Ye 
according to the law. 
  Since the case involved state secrets, the Beijing Municipal 
People's Court held closed hearings on the case, according to 
the 111th provision of "the Law of Criminal Procedures of the 
People's Republic of China." 
  During the hearings, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court found that some of the evidence in the case 
should be further verified, thus sending back on January 27 this 
year the case to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate 
for further investigation. 
  On Feburary 15, the case was sent again by the Beijing 
Municipal People's Procuratorate to the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court for trial. 
  Both the defendants Xi Yang and Tian Ye said before the 
trials began that they would defend themselves and did not 
invite any lawyer to act for them. During the trial, both of 
them admitted their guilt, showed repentance and asked the court 
to be lenient. 
  The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court held that 
Xi Yang had ignored China's laws, gathered and spied out state 
financial and economic secrets, and published them in a 
newspaper overseas, thus committing the crime of stealing and 
spying state secrets, an exceptionally serious case. 
  The court held that as a staff member of a government body, 
Tian Ye had violated the state regulations on maintaining 
confidentiality and stolen, spied and illegally supplied state 
secrets, thus committing the crime of stealing, spying and 
illegally supplying state secrets, also an exceptionally serious 
case. 
  The criminal facts of Xi Yang and Tian Ye are clear and the 
evidences are conclusive and full, according to the court. 
  "The supplementary regulations on crime of leaking state 
secrets" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress stipulated that those whose case of stealing, 
spying, buying or illegally supplying state secrets for overseas 
institutions, organizations or persons is serious should be 
sentenced to penal servitude for a definite period longer than 
10 years, penal servitude for life, or sentenced to death and 
should be deprived of political rights for some time. 
  Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye admitted their guilt and showed 
repentance, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court 
decided to punish them leniently and on March 28, 1994, 
sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years' imprisonment, with the term 
starting from September 27, 1993, and depriving him of political 
rights for two years, and sentenced Tian Ye to 15 years' 
imprisonment with the term starting from September 24, 1993, and 
depriving him of political rights for three years. 
  Xi Yang appealed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's 
Court against the sentence. 
  After its appeal hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher 
People's Court rejected Xi Yang's appeal and upheld the original 
ruling of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses that the </F>
Higher People's Court Has Affirmed Original Judgment on Xi Yang 
Case According to Law"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, while reporters asked Zhang Junsheng, 
deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA News Agency, 
questions about the Beijing Higher People's Court rejection of 
Xi Yang's appeal and affirmation of the original judgment, he 
pointed out that the inland [nei di 0355 0966] judicial 
department independently handled and passed judgment on Xi Yang 
case according to the criminal facts on the basis of judicial 
procedures. This is completely a question of violating inland 
laws because of stealing state secrets. This does not concern 
freedom of the press, nor has it anything to do with normal news 
coverage. 
  Zhang Junsheng made the remarks while attending the 
inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong General Publication 
Association. He added that he learned from news reports that 
the Beijing Higher People has passed judgment of the second 
trial on Xi Yang case. According to inland laws, the second 
trial is a ruling of the final instance. Interpretation of the 
judgment in Xi Yang's case is a matter for the relevant judicial 
department. We can only answer some of your questions to help 
you clear up doubts according to our understanding of the laws. 
  Zhang Junsheng stated: Freedom of covering news is protected 
according to law in the interior. With regard to Hong Kong 
reporters who cover news in the interior, as long as they do not 
violate inland laws, it is very free for them to do news 
coverage. Enormous assistance has been provided for Hong Kong 
reporters who are covering news in the interior not only by 
relevant departments in the interior, but also by the Hong Kong 
Branch of XINHUA News Agency. You all know this very clearly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stealing Secrets Is Not Gathering News; Never </F>
Defy the Law"] 
  [Text] The hearing of Xi Yang's appeal has ended. 
Yesterday, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court 
announced its decision to reject Xi Yang's appeal and uphold the 
original verdict of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court at the first hearing, namely, a 12-year prison sentence 
with two-year deprivation of political rights. 
  The court charged Xi Yang with ignoring the law of the land, 
stealing and prying into state financial and economic secrets, 
and publishing the stolen information abroad in the press. His 
act constituted the crime of stealing and prying into state 
secrets and was an especially serious case at that. Tian Ye, in 
the capacity of a state functionary, violated the state security 
ordinance and stole, pried into, and illegally provided state 
secrets. His act constituted the crime of stealing, prying 
into, and illegally providing state secrets, and was an 
especially serious case also. The truth of the crime committed 
by Xi Yang and Tian Ye is clear and the evidence conclusive and 
sufficient. 
  What criteria were used to measure the penalty? Was the 
penalty too heavy or not? The "Supplementary Stipulations on 
Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" made by the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee contain the 
following clauses: "He who steals, pries into, buys, and 
illegally provides state secrets for institutions, 
organizations, and personnel outside Chinese borders," "in an 
extra serious case, shall receive a prison sentence of 10 years 
or above, life imprisonment, or the death penalty and 
deprivation of political rights." The lightest penalty is a 
10-year jail sentence and the heaviest is the death penalty. 
Because the two people adopted a positive attitude in pleading 
guilty and showed signs of repentance, they were handled 
leniently. Some people set the "Criminal Procedural Law of the 
People's Republic of China" against the "Supplementary 
Stipulations on Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" 
of the NPC Standing Committee, criticizing China for 
"inconsistency" in the choice of legal provisions for 
prosecuting Xi Yang. This is sheer nonsense. Quoting the 
"Supplementary Stipulations" was to establish a basis for the 
measurement of penalties and quoting the criminal procedural law 
was to classify the criminal prosecution as a case involving 
state security and theft of state secrets, which required a 
nonpublic hearing. Since it involved state secrets, the court 
was duty-bound to protect state secrets from being divulged in 
the course of the trial, so a nonpublic hearing was required. 
No country would, while taking legal action against theft of 
state secrets, exhibit the secrets to be protected, still less 
publish to the outside in great detail the confidential figures 
of the losses caused to the state after the defendant has denied 
any losses to the state. If China had done so, it is certain 
that foreign hostile forces would have been able to find out 
more about China's capabilities in meeting contingencies, 
various plans for handling crises, and resources and means that 
can be employed. The big slippage and fluctuation of renminbi 
last June and July was not good for the national economy, the 
people's livelihood, or the overall situation in the country. 
The Chinese Government treated it as a major matter and handled 
it accordingly. If all the operational measures for stabilizing 
renminbi were divulged, the contingency measures were bound to 
lose their effect, giving speculators something to take 
advantage of. It would cause further slippage of the renminbi 
rate and undermine the stability of China's political situation. 
  Xi Yang grew up in mainland China and once served in the 
army. He was at one time a reporter with a newspaper publisher 
in Beijing. Someone like him who received long periods of 
education in citizen ethics and the legal system naturally knows 
the state security law and the serious consequences of violating 
it. His obtaining secrets through Tian Ye by illegal means 
points to his awareness that he was stealing state secrets, 
which he candidly confessed afterward. 
  Some people believe that "one country, two systems" means 
using Hong Kong's legal standards to handle the issue of guilt 
and innocence in the mainland. If the executive personnel of a 
newspaper published in Hong Kong wish to obtain some 
confidential information, they can instruct reporters to "run 
the risk to overcome the obstacle" and get hold of it. Even if 
it is a state secret or confidential document, they can also 
take as they like without being restricted by the law of the 
mainland system. What is the "risk?" And what is the 
"obstacle?" They regard the criminal act banned by the mainland 
law as a "risk" and refer to the act of obtaining the secrets 
that the Chinese authorities have time and again requested 
functionaries at all levels not to divulge as "overcoming the 
obstacle." This means some people are openly despising and 
challenging the laws of the Chinese mainland. This dangerous 
argument finally led Xi Yang into a dangerous situation and 
landed him in the misfortune of imprisonment. 
  Xi Yang's case is in essence a criminal case of violation 
of the mainland China's law. It is a question of abiding by the 
law or violating the law, not an issue of freedom of press. Hong 
Kong has its own security laws. If, when the exchange rate of 
the Hong Kong dollar plummeted to the level of one U.S. dollar 
to 9.6 Hong Kong dollars in September 1983, someone had colluded 
with some official in the financial department and got hold of 
the relevant confidential documents, facts about the abortive 
effort to salvage the market by flight from the U.S. dollar and 
the proposal for pegging the exchange rate, both the official 
and the reporter who had pried out the secrets through the 
official would have violated the law and faced prosecution. 
  Each year, thousands of Hong Kong reporters go to the 
mainland to gather news. There are many reports that criticize 
China and cases of fabricating stories to vilify the Chinese 
Government have also happened. But no reporter involved has 
ever been subjected to criminal investigation by China. 
Therefore, the freedom of Hong Kong reporters in conducting 
journalistic reporting is protected. However, Xi Yang ventured 
into the forbidden zone of the criminal law and colluded with a 
civil servant to steal and pry into secrets. This act of 
violating the criminal code is naturally punished according to 
law. Therefore, it does not make sense to equate a criminal act 
with news gathering. The implication of Xi Yang's case is this: 
No matter who you are, you must not test the law in your own 
person, but must respect and observe the laws and regulations of 
the mainland. While in the mainland, one must abide by the 
mainland's law; while in Malaysia, one must abide by Malaysia's 
law; while in Taiwan, one must abide by Taiwan's law. This is 
an easy point to see for anyone with some common sense. 
  One aspect of "one country, two systems" is that the 
mainland 
should enforce mainland laws and Hong Kong should enforce Hong 
Kong laws. After 1997, even the People's Liberation Army forces 
stationed in Hong Kong must observe the law of the Special 
Administrative Region. Why do some people advocate that Hong 
Kong people do not have to observe mainland laws when they are 
in the mainland? This idea that one does not have to observe 
the law is detrimental to the implementation of "one country, 
two systems."

  [Text] Beijing, April 17 (AFP)--Chinese police briefly 
held two leading Shanghai dissidents for questioning less than 
one week after releasing them from detention, one of the 
activisits said Sunday. Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese 
Human Rights Association, said by telephone that he was taken 
from his home at 3:30 p.m. (0730 GMT) Saturday and released at 
about 10:30 p.m., adding that fellow activist Bao Ge had also 
been pulled in. The 50-year-old veteran dissident described his 
detention as a "warning," saying police had told him to stop his 
campaigning. Bao's father said his 31-year-old son was taken 
away by two policemen at 5:15 p.m. (0915 GMT) Saturday as he 
left his home, adding that he was released at about the same 
time as Yang. 
  Yang and Bao were last detained on April 9 in a sweep on 
dissidents as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur arrived in 
Shanghai. They were released the following day but kept 
incommunicado in their flats for several hours until the French 
delegation left the city. 
  Bao, an ardent campaigner for Japan to pay reparations for 
atrocities committed in the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese war, has 
said he wants to form a new human rights organisation dedicated 
to solving concrete social issues. "We absolutely must be closer 
to the people," he said recently. 
  Activists have begun reemerging from the shadows in recent 
months, forming groups again for the first time since Beijing's 
Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, and publicly 
demanding more democracy in China as discontent grows over 
soaring inflation, corruption and other social ills. The 
continuing detentions are part of tightened security as the 
government seeks to stamp out such activities in the run-up to 
the sensitive fifth anniversary on June 4th of the army's 
violent suppression of Beijing's democracy movement.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Customs Targets Internal </F>
Graft"] 
  [Text] Customs authorities are cracking down on corruption 
by its staff and agencies. 
  The General Administration of Customs (GAC) has investigated 
38 corruption cases involving customs officials and refunded 21 
unreasonable charges on customs services, customs sources said. 
  At least 10 officials from Nanjing Customs, Jiangsu 
Province, 
have been taken into custody or arrested for graft, embezzlement 
of public funds or seeking commissions, according to reliable 
sources. 
  Eight other customs officials working in the province's 
Zhangjiagang branch were found guilty of receiving bribes by 
local courts. 
  In addition, the head of Zhangzhou Customs in southeast 
China's Xiamen was arrested for smuggling. 
  The GAC has discovered that some customs officials have 
solicited bribes from importers and exporters, claiming the 
funds as support of customs work. 
  Some officials have demanded luxury receptions from host 
organi- zations or enterprises, exceeding government-stipulated 
standards for work. 
  Others have used import and export companies' cars or mobile 
telephones without paying for them. Still others have submitted 
private bills to import/export companies treasurers' offices. 
  According to reliable sources close to the GAC, the current 
crackdown "will focus on major misbehavior liable to draw strong 
complaints from the public." 
  By the end of May, the GAC plans to review existing 
standards 
and charges on customs services. Charges must be in accordance 
with State-regulated price standards. Random charges and 
overcharges on services, both illegal, will be eliminated. The 
GAC made it clear that customs agencies were not allowed to run 
any type of economic entity or invest in any kind of 
profit-oriented business. 
  In addition, companies are prohibited from attaching 
themselves to customs agencies to escape government supervision. 
  By the end of June, customs divisions must divest from any 
service industries which they currently hold. 
  The GAC has made major advances in cracking down on internal 
corruption since last June when the central government 
intensified its fight against graft. 
  To date, the GAC has also shuttered a total of 127 
customs-run companies that were engaged in service industries. 
  Thirty other firms were told their businesses had too close 
a 
relationship with the customs administration and they should 
move into another realm of trade.

  [Text] Beijing, April 16 (CNS)--Stability should be 
maintained in five sectors in a bid to ensure smooth reform set 
for this year, according to authoritative sources in economic 
circles. 
  First, commodity prices should be kept stable. Intensive 
restructuring of means of production is now underway while price 
reform for coal, electricity, oil, food and cotton covers a wide 
field which will surely have an impact on prices for consumer 
goods. The state plans to keep the price rise under ten percent 
this year in line with the actual situation. Other measures for 
the sake of steady prices will gradually come into force. 
  Second, economic growth should be kept under control. The 
central government has set the gain at nine percent which is 
better for China at this stage. Economic growth should not go 
beyond the financial and material strength nor should it exceed 
the capability of society to stand such a burden. Comparisions 
among departments or regions on the pace of economic development 
and the number of items to be exploited have to be avoided. 
  Third, agriculture should maintain steady development. 
Judging from a certain period in the past when economic 
austerity was seen, agricultural problems first of all surfaced 
and the central authorities paid much attention to this sector. 
Rural work meetings and agricultural work meetings and those on 
food and oil work have since last year been held. Important 
documents were issued on several occasions to call for relations 
of the heavy burden shouldered by peasants. Priority should be 
given to the interests of peasants and agriculture this year. 
  Fourth, the currency should be kept stable with the 
stabilizing of the currency value the main issue. The central 
bank has had a strong grip on the money supply and having 
control on the amount of currency in circulation, the central 
bank can regulate the general demand for currency. Whether the 
amount of currency in circulation and the value of currency are 
kept stable is directly related to the stability of prices, 
society and economic development. 
  Fifth, social stability is considered a must for reform as 
well as economic development.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jin: "Cable TV Off Limits to </F>
Overseas Firms"] 
  [Text] Overseas organizations and individuals will be 
barred from setting up and operating cable television stations 
in China, a government official said yesterday. 
  Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperatives in cable 
television are also barred, according to Zhou Caifu, director of 
the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television's cable TV division. 
  The ban has been stipulated in the ministry's new regulation 
on cable TV management. A copy of the ruling was obtained 
yesterday by China Daily. 
  Zhou said cable TV is an important part of the country's 
radio and TV programming and should serve as the Party's and 
government's propaganda tool while entertaining view. Some 
foreign organizations and individuals have shown keen interest 
in operating cable TV stations in the country. Their 
applications have been rejected, Zhou said. 
  The regulation also contains stipulations on the 
construction, management, technology, equipment, finance and 
programmes aired by cable TV stations. 
  According to the regulation, no TV programmes from Hong 
Kong, 
Macao or Taiwan may be relayed and no satellite programmes may 
be broadcast. Unauthorized overseas video tapes and movies are 
forbidden on cable TV. 
  No reactionary, pornographic, violent programmes or 
programmes harmful to the State security and social stability 
may be aired. 
  Violators of the ministry's new regulation will face 
warnings, stiff fines or punishment as stated by law.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Why Is </F>
the Fourth Plenary Session So Slow in Coming?"] 
  [Text] The Convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session 
Is Postponed 
  In this year's March issue, CHENG MING reported that "the 
Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee would 
be held in March." The situation has now changed and the 
session has been postponed and will not be opened in the near 
future. 
  On 8 March, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee 
held 
a joint meeting of secretaries of various central departments 
and commissions, and of party committees of various provinces, 
municipalities, and regions. The meeting was chaired by Ding 
Guangen and Hu Jintao, who, on behalf of the Political Bureau 
and the Secretariat, announced the decision to postpone the 
convocation of the fourth plenary session. 
  Hu Jintao discussed the reasons for postponing the 
convocation of the fourth plenary session and about the Central 
Committee's policy for work in future. Hu Jintao said that the 
convocation of the session had been postponed after taking the 
following six issues into consideration: 
<H5>  Hu Jintao on Six Major Issues Causing the Postponement of </H5>
the Session 
  1. The CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, various central 
departments, ministries, commissions, and offices, and various 
provinces, municipalities, and regions should have an identical 
appraisal of the current political, economic, and social 
situation. (This implies there is not yet any identical 
appraisal.) 
  2. The anticipated goal of anticorruption work, the central 
task put forward by the Central Committee, has not yet been 
attained and the situation is grim. 
  3. The pressure of inflation -- the focus of society -- is 
intensifying and the central authorities and various localities 
have published or are to publish controversial or different 
views on measures and policies for reform. 
  4. Some time is still needed for various central 
departments, ministries, commissions, offices, and localities to 
thoroughly understand the resolutions and guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
  5. There is a gap in the knowledge and understanding of the 
establishment and development of the socialist market economy 
between various central departments, ministries, commissions, 
offices, and localities. Subjective and objective obstacles 
still exist in the course of implementation and promotion. 
  6. There are no concrete measures for overcoming, 
correcting, and resolving the mountain-stronghold mentality, 
selfish departmentalism, and anarchy in localities and 
departments. As a result, central policies and measures cannot 
be comprehensively and correctly implemented in good time. 
  Hu Jintao said that the Central Committee holds that the 
fourth session of the party is to solve some practical problems, 
to discuss and adopt some necessary resolutions, policies, 
principles, and measures, and to sum up matters which the last 
plenary session of the Central Committee wanted to resolve or 
implement, and make those matters clear to the whole party and 
all the people of the whole country and that the session should 
not become a mere formality. 
<H5>  Ding Guangen: Central Policies and Principles Are Damaged </H5>
  Ding Guangen said at the meeting that a major question is 
how 
various central departments, ministries, commissions, offices, 
party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and 
regions, and leadership of governments should comprehensively 
and thoroughly understand and grasp central guidelines for work 
and how they should conscientiously maintain a high degree of 
unity with the central authorities. We must take a stand on 
party character, the state's cause, and the people's interests 
and conscientiously safeguard the authority of the Central 
Committee and the State Council. This is a reliable guarantee 
and foundation ensuring the victory of our cause and our advance 
toward the new era. It cannot be denied that because of the 
expansion of individualism, the mountain-stronghold mentality, 
and anarchy in the leadership of some localities, the 
implementation of central policies and principles has been 
damaged. This has resulted in mistakes in work, it has 
objectively brought instability into society, has interfered and 
affected to varying degrees the work of the central authorities 
with construction as the core and progress in reform and 
opening, and has given rise to perplexities and pressure in the 
formulation of policies by the central authorities. 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin: Localities Should Maintain a High Degree of </H5>
Unity With the Central Authorities 
  When the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference National Committee were in 
session, Jiang Zemin and other members of the Political Bureau 
and its Standing Committee separately talked with the number one 
and number two men of various provinces, municipalities, and 
regions and stressed that various localities should keep in 
closer touch with the central authorities, let the central 
authorities know better what they are doing, have a thorough 
understanding of the guidelines of the central authorities, and 
maintain a high degree of unity with the central authorities. 
Jiang Zemin and Wen Jiabao told leading party and government 
officials of Sichuan at a meeting on 10 March: The most 
important thing at present is for various localities to have a 
thorough understanding of the guidelines of the central 
authorities and by no means should each go his own way making 
the central authorities a mere figurehead. Jiang Zemin told 
leading party and government officials of Shanghai Municipality 
and Jiangsu Province: From now on, officials of the central 
authorities should meet officials of various localities more 
often, keep in closer touch with various localities, let various 
localities know what the central authorities are doing, and hold 
more small meetings with localities. We can go to various 
localities to meet local officials or ask them to come to 
Beijing for the meetings. This can solve problems faster and 
more effectively. 
  This shows that the CPC Central Committee is no longer able 
to command localities and localities simply do not listen to the 
central authorities. It is already difficult to implement and 
carry out central guidelines, principles, or policies, and there 
are numerous contradictions between the central authorities and 
localities. Things are like this even when the chief architect 
is still living. We can imagine how the relations between the 
CPC Central Committee and various dukes or princes will become 
once the chief architect has gone to join the premier.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- China's drive to build 
a socialist market economy has brought new opportunities and 
prospects for the people of minority nationalities and the 
economy in the areas where they live. 
  Ismail Amat, minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission, told a press conference today that the 
economic construction in the ethnic areas has achieved success 
since China adopted its reform and opening-up policy 15 years 
ago. 
  Ismail, who is also a state councillor, said that the gross 
domestic product in such areas in 1993 increased by 11.9 percent 
from the previous year -- the highest growth rate since 1985. 
  The volume of foreign trade in such areas last year was up 
41.8 percent from the previous year, to more than 5.7 billion 
U.S. dollars, he said. 
  Ismail said that China has further opened its border areas, 
where a large part of China's minority nationality population 
lives, resulting in a boom of border trade. He added that the 
regions have been utilizing an increasing amount of foreign 
investment. 
  He told reporters that the country has newly opened 43 
national-level inland outlets, and 34 of them are in the areas 
inhabited by people of minority nationalities, in addition to 
190 regional-level ones they already have. 
  He said that the living standards of the people in those 
areas have been significantly improved over the past years, with 
the per capita income for farmers and herdsmen rising from some 
70 yuan in 1978 to more than 600 yuan last year. 
  Against the backdrop of intensified ethnic and religious 
conflicts in some parts of the turbulent world, China has foiled 
sabotage attempts of hostile elements in the world and 
separatists both at home and abroad, the minister stressed. 
  He said that the towns and cities in the border areas 
inhabited by minority nationality people have become the 
frontier of China's opening-up drive, as the country offers more 
areas for foreign trade and business in a strategy called 
comprehensive openness. 
  The past 15 years of reform and opening-up has considerably 
strengthened the economic muscle in those areas and accumulated 
precious experience, which, in turn, has provided sound 
material, social and ideological conditions for further 
developing such areas, the official said. 
  He indicated that the establishment of a socialist market 
economic regime will help bring the advantages and vitality of 
the areas into better play. 
  As the overall national strength and macro-economic control 
capacity grow, the government will become more capable of 
assisting the underdeveloped areas so as to help them catch up 
with the rest of the country, Ismail said. 
  He said that the unity of the country's nationalities and 
their increased contacts and communications have combined to 
create a harmonious environment both for the developed east and 
the underdeveloped west to make up for each other's short points 
and accomplish common development. 
  He added that social stability, particularly in the minority 
nationality-inhabited areas, has formed a sound basis for 
economic progress and the expansion of reform in such areas. 
  Ismail said the government will commend those individuals 
and 
collectives contributing to the unity and progress of all 
nationalities in September at a national meeting. 
  Meanwhile, in-depth research will be carried out to study 
ways to promote the cause of national unity and progress in the 
process of building a socialist market economic system.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Bian Hongwei: "Market </F>
Takes State Firms on Roller Coaster Ride"] 
  [Text] Domestic enterprises are mushrooming throughout 
China, driven by double-digit economic growth during the past 
two years. 
  But many inefficient enterprises have been forced out of 
operation by the heat of market competition, according to the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). 
  By the end of 1993, the total number of domestic enterprises 
had reached 7.3 million, up by 25.2 per cent from the previous 
year. 
  It's purely the survival of the fittest. Some 341,000 firms 
went under last year, an increase of 32.2 percent over 1992, a 
SAIC report says. 
  Undoubtedly, the strong economy has formed the fundamental 
impetus for the growing number of new domestic enterprises. 
  The SAIC's drive to simplify startup procedures for new 
firms, launched at the end of 1990, has also contributed to the 
increase, said Liu Junchen, in charge of enterprise registration 
under the SAIC. 
  To date, all provincial-level local branches of the 
administration have been authorized to register local 
enterprises. 
  However, those involving the pillar industries or concerning 
the nation's long-term interests such as military, cigarette 
production and transportation, still must wait for green lights 
from SAIC to open their own businesses, Liu added. 
  The increase of new firms in 1993, whether State-owned or 
privately-funded, is also eye-catching. An astonishing 113.3 
per cent increase over the previous year created 552,000 new 
companies. 
  Economic reform in the past decade led to a flexible system 
for free flowing property rights. This is vital to break 
through the rigid criteria defining enterprises according to 
their ownership. That is to say, State-owned, collective-run, or 
privately-funded ones, Liu said. 
  The central government has started about 100 large and 
medium- sized State enterprises as pilots for their shareholding 
reforms. At the same time, local Governments selected pilot 
projects in their own areas. State, collective and individual 
businesses enjoy the same rights if they hold the same number of 
shares in the pilot firm. 
  In line with this trend, experts say it is better to use the 
term "State economy" rather than State-owned enterprises, 
leaving market forces to determine the fate of State or 
privately-funded businesses. 
  Recently, private businesses experienced marked growth. 
Furthermore, the recent National People's Congress session has 
also underlined the importance of a buoyant private sector. 
  Traditionally, the country carried out a pyramidal approval 
system for registering enterprises with the State Council and 
NPC at the top. 
  Under the rigid rubber-stamp system, it was very hard to 
open 
a new firm. And even when government finally approved a 
business, many found it difficult to survive, let alone make a 
profit, because they could not get their products to market 
quick enough. When this happened, it was the responsibility of 
the government to make up the economic losses. 
  Fortunately, it realized the problem and decentralized power 
for registering enterprises to local branches. 
  With the simplified procedure, it is much easier to access 
the market economy. This will lift the economy in the long run, 
said Liu. 
  Many firms are borrowing money when they apply for 
registration to look like "fat cat." 
  Ironically, once they finish registration, the enterprises 
immediately return the money they have borrowed, leaving a 
nearly empty bank account to run the business. 
  To reverse the situation, the SAIC decided to set up a 
nationwide supervision system to carry out random checks on 
firms' registered capital to guarantee the money is being used 
in the operation of the firms, the SAIC official said. 
  Liu said the market system had played an important role 
through wielding its "invisible hand," causing many firms to go 
belly up last year. 
  Since all enterprises are equal in market competition, only 
fit firms can survive. 
  Without financial support, many unprofitable State 
enterprises find it difficult to make ends meet. 
  And those who failed to transfer their management mechanism 
in time have to face the music--bankruptcy or be taken-over by a 
more efficient business. 
  Both the government and enterprises in red usually choose 
the 
latter, said Liu, as it is easier to continue using facilities 
of merged firms and to settle down employees of the once 
money-loosing industries. 
  As the central government took measures last year to 
safeguard sustained, healthy and speedy economic growth, many 
financial businesses with poor management were ordered to close. 
  With the intensified anti-corruption campaign, many 
enterprises run by the government were ferreted out and ordered 
to stop their operation. 
  To ensure a healthy real estate market, the central 
government checked businesses within the sector and closed those 
deemed to be substandard. 
  Futures markets are another important aspect that the 
central 
government decided to reign in. 
  To achieve its goal, the central government campaigned at 
the 
end of last year to get businesses involved in futures markets 
for reregistration. Those who failed to observe the rules were 
ordered to stop operation. 
  Recently, the government announced that no new businesses on 
the futures market would be registered this year, so as to focus 
their work on rectifying the order of the present futures market.

<F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- China's commodity 
markets are beginning to take shape. The nation now has over 
100,000 commodity markets of all descriptions, and the 
ubiquitous spot markets and specialized markets in urban and 
rural areas are playing an important role in the national 
economic development. 
  According to statistics, the nation has now 53 national 
commodity trade centers and large wholesale markets; over 76,000 
urban and rural trade markets, including 1,600 wholesale markets 
of agricultural and sideline products; and over 3,000 small 
industrial goods trade markets, including 400 wholesale markets. 
  These markets have created a primary network of all kinds of 
markets at all levels. While a main framework comprising 
primary, regional, and national markets has been formed for 
grain trade, a structure made up of large, medium, and small 
markets around wholesale markets has been created for vegetable 
and fruit distribution. Under this structure, markets in areas 
of production, transshipment, and consumption are coordinated. 
For industrial consumer goods, in addition to all kinds of 
wholesale markets, there are also meetings for trade 
negotiations, commodity trade fairs, and markets which also 
provide storage services and engage in wholesale and retail 
businesses. Chain stores have appeared in Beijing, Tianjin, 
Shanghai, and other large and medium cities. The traditional 
integrated and spot markets of capital goods are gradually 
developing into specialized markets engaging in intermediate and 
long-range contract trade, and they are gradually becoming major 
avenues of resource distribution. 
  As most of China's capital goods and means of livelihood are 
being distributed through nationwide networks of commodity 
markets, market regulation is gradually expanding both in scope 
and proportion. Currently 90 percent of industrial consumer 
goods and 85 percent of capital goods are sold at prices 
determined by market supply and demand. Meanwhile, collective 
and independent enterprises have joined supply and marketing 
organs and networks of state-owned distributors and producers in 
demonstrating their abilities in the sphere of distribution. 
This has created a distribution pattern characterized by the 
distribution of all types of commodities and services through 
all kinds of channels. While state-owned distributors are fully 
market-oriented, enterprises in charge of supplies have geared 
over 90 percent of their operations to market forces. Commodity 
markets' trading and management are beginning to be standardized 
and institutionalized. The management of the large trade 
centers and large wholesale markets by administrative 
committees, boards of directors, and boards of supervisors has 
expedited the commodity markets' healthy development.

Applications" submitted after the prescribed date. 
  C. Upon receiving the "Bid Applications," the Bids Inviting 
Office will immediately register them and seal them up for safe 
keeping. 
  D. The following documents should also be provided together 
with the "Bid Applications": 
  i. Membership certificate of the Chamber of Commerce for 
Importers and Exporters of Textiles; 
  ii. The actual export volume for the previous year; 
  iii. A copy of the certificate showing the amount of foreign

must also submit forms stating the actual production output in 
the previous year of commodities specified for export quotas. 
  Photocopies of the abovementioned documents will be 
acceptable. 
  4. Awarding bids: 
  In accordance with the valid "Bid Applications" from the 
enterprises, the Bids Committee will award the winning quota 
quantities and winning quota prices to the winning bidders 
Basis for awarding: 
  A. Bidders must meet the qualifications stipulated in 
Article 5. 
  B. Bidders will win when their bid prices are higher than 
the average bidding price of all the bidding enterprises. 
  Total bidding quota price X bidding 
quantity 
  Average bidding price = 
-------------------------------------------- 
  Total bidding quantities of all 
bidders 
  C. The bidder's foreign exhange settlement price for its 
exports will not be lower than the negotiated price set by the 
Chamber of Commerce for Importers and Exporters of Textiles. 
  D. The production enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises 
will export only products produced by themselves and not by 
other manufacturers. The bidding quantity of a production 
enterprise will be within its own actual production output. The 
maximum bidding quantity of a foreign-funded enterprise will not 
exceed the export scale ratified by MOFTEC. 
  If the bidding production enterprises and foreign-funded 
enterprises are found to export products other than their own 
manufactured products their bidding and transfer qualifications 
will be cancelled for 3 years. 
  E. The Bids Inviting Office will destroy those bids whose 
prices are out of line with the normal level of the "Bid 
Applications." 
5. Winning bids: 
  A. All bidders who have met every requirement for the awards 
will be bid winners. 
  B. The allocation of winning quantities will be calculated 
in accordance with the following formula: 
  C 
  A = B x - where: 
  D 
  A is the quantity awarded to each winning enterprise; 
  B is the total quatities of commodity quotas offered for 
current 
  bidding; 
  C is the bidding price X bidding quantity of the 
enterprises; 
and 
  D is the total bidding prices X bidding quantities of 
winning 
  enterprises. 
  When the winning quantity calculated according to the above 
formula is bigger than the actual bidding quantity of a bidder, 
the actual bidding quantity of that enterprise will be the 
quantity won by that enterprise. The remainder of the total 
bidding quantity under this formula will be allocated to those 
whose total bidding quantities have not been met in the order of 
the highest prices offered in their bidding. 
  C. The actual cost paid by the winners will be calculated in 
accordance with the following formula: 
  Total Cost = quantity awarded X bidding price. 
6. The opening of bids: 
  A. The Bids Committee will, within 10 working days after the 
deadline, complete the work of awarding and submit the results 
of the awards to MOFTEC for the record. 
  B. The Bids Committee will publish in GUOJI SHANGBAO the 
namelist of the winners and will also notify the winners direct. 
  C. Whenever any fraud or violations of these Regulations 
during the course of bidding are discovered, MOFTEC has the 
right to veto the results. 
7. Payment for winning bids: 
  A. Within 15 days of the date on which the Bids Committee 
publishes the namelist of winners, the winners will pay a 10 
percent advance of the winning quota costs to the bank account 
designated by the Bids Inviting Office as guaranty money for 
using the quotas. Upon receipt of the payment, the Bids Inviting 
Office will send certificates of successful bidding to the 
winners and issue receipts for the payment. When winners fail 
to make payment within the specified time, the Bids Inviting 
Office will regard the bids as null and void and cancel that 
enterprise's quota bidding and transfer qualifications for one 
year. 
  B. Before applying for an export license, winners will clear 
the payment of quota expenses for the licensed quantity with the 
Bids Inviting Office (i.e. quantity licensed X bid price X 90 
percent). With the "Quota Certificates for Textile Quota Bids 
Commodity Export Licenses (in lieu of receipts for quota 
application payments), the winners will obtain export licenses 
from the issuing organization, which will keep one copy for the 
record. 
  C. The guaranty money paid in advance will be cleared when a 
final license has been issued. 
  Article 10. Export licenses. 
  Basis for issuing export licenses: 
  1. Certificate for Export Textile Commodity Quota (in lieu 
of receipt for payment of quota application costs); 
  2. Export contract price (not lower than the negotiated 
price agreed by the Chamber of Commerce for Importers and 
Exporters of Textiles). 
Article 11. Transfer of Quota 
  1. When a winning enterprise is unable to use all the 
quantity it has been allocated for certain reasons, it will 
submit a written application five months before the end of the 
validity period of the quota to the Bids Inviting Office, 
stating its reasons and the transferable quota quantity. 
Transfer of quota is allowed upon approval by the Bids Inviting 
Office but quota transfer fees will be paid as transfer handling 
fees (i.e., transferable quota quantity X bid price X 5 percent). 
  2. Winning enterprises and those enterprises qualified to 
bid but have failed to win can submit written applications to 
the Bids Inviting Office should they wish to increase or receive 
quota quantities, stating reasons, quota price, and the required 
quota quantity. Upon the approval of the Bids Inviting Office, 
they will be eligible to accept quota transfers as transferees. 
  3. Transfer of quotas will be conducted by the Bids Inviting 
Office using a computer, giving preference to early applicants 
and the highest prices offered. Any transfer among enterprises 
at their own discretion is prohibited. 
  4. Upon the approval of transfer by the Bids Committee, the 
Bids Inviting Office will be responsible for completing 
procedures of transfer and will issue quota transfer 
certificates to both transferors and transferees. 
Article 12. Handing over quotas. 
  When winners are unable either to execute export contracts 
or 
transfer quotas for certain reasons, they may hand their quotas 
over to the Bids Inviting Office which will repay a portion of 
the guaranty money depending on the time of handing over the 
quotas. For quotas turned over five months or more in advance of 
the final quota validity date, 50 percent of the guaranty money 
for the quotas handed over will be repaid; 40 percent will be 
refunded for quotas handed over four months in advance; 30 
percent refunded for quotas handed over three months in advance; 
20 percent refunded for two months in advance; and no refund 
will be made for quotas handed over less than two months in 
advance of the validity date. 
  During the next bidding, the Bids Committee will reduce the 
winning quantity for that enterprise according to the proportion 
of that enterprise's quantities of quota won and handed over. 
Article 13. The Bids Inviting Office, with the approval of the 
Bids Committee will cancel the winning enterprise's right to bid 
and transfer for the following year if the enterprise fails to 
use its winning quotas within the specified time or does not 
transfer or hand over its quotas to the Bids Inviting Office. 
Article 14: If a winner is found to have transferred its 
quotas at its own discretion without the approval of the Bids 
Inviting Office, its right to bid and transfer will be canceled 
for two years. 
Article 15: When a winner's foreign exchange settlement price 
for its exports is discovered to be lower than the price 
negotiated by the Chamber of Commerce for Importers and 
Exporters of Textiles, that enterprise's right to bid and 
transfer will be canceled for three years. 
Article 16: Upon declaring to Customs the export of its 
winning quotas, the enterprise will, within one month, submit 
the export license stamped with the official Customs seal (one 
copy to be kept by the enterprise) to the Bids Inviting Office 
which will be responsible for verifying the statistics and 
reporting to the Bids Committee on the enterprise's execution of 
the contracts and quota applications, so that the Bids Committee 
can manage and supervise the export of textile quota commodities. 
Article 17: These regulations will be implemented upon the 
approval of MOFTEC. 
Article 18: The Bids Committee will be responsible for the 
interpretation of these regulations.

  [Text] Beijing, April 16 (CNS) -- A trial practice with 
public bidding for the allocation of quotas for certain export 
products will be included in some relevant regulations soon to 
be promulgated, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation. 
  Import and export companies having rights to foreign trade 
with the approval of the ministry and which are also members of 
commercial associations for import and export, production 
oriented enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises will be 
allowed to enter the bidding. 
  Enterprises making successful bids cannot make use of the 
quota to transfer the quota with payment to other enterprises 
within a stated period of time without prior consent from the 
authorities. A particular enterprise which makes such a 
transfer has to pay the charges for the transfer which must be 
carried out in a specific place designated by the authorities. 
Overcounter [as received] transfers will be strictly prohibited 
and the transferee enterprise has to meet the conditions 
required for the bidding of a particular commodity. No further 
transfer of the quota will be allowed. 
  Enterprises which find it difficult to meet the obligations 
required in foreign trade nor able to transfer the quota they 
won, have to submit the quota to the bidding office within a 
stated period of time. [sentence as received] The quota 
received will be included in the next bidding. Part of the 
expense of the bidding will be refunded to the enterprise 
returning the quota. 
  Enterprises will not be qualified for the next bidding if 
they fail to make use of the quota they won, did not make a 
proper transfer or submitted the unused quota to the bidding 
office within a specific period of time. They will also lose 
their qualification for bidding in the following two years if 
they make a transfer of quota which they won by bidding without 
prior consent from the bidding office.

<F P=106> [Daily News: "State Firm Files for Bankruptcy"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time a State factory in Shanghai has 
filed for bankruptcy, and 10 more enterprises, including a joint 
venture, are expected to follow suit. 
  Shanghai No 2 Webbing Factory recently filed for bankruptcy 
in a local court, marking the start of a readjustment of 
State-owned assets. This is a crucial step in the deepening of 
economic reform, designed to increase the value of State 
property. 
  The factory is the first State enterprise in the city to ask 
for bankruptcy. 
  In the 1980s, local courts heard the first case of 
bankruptcy 
involving a collective enterprise. From 1992 to 1993, more than 
50 township enterprises and service ventures filed for 
bankruptcy. 
  In the last few years, some State enterprises in the city 
have continued to lose money despite the thriving economy. 
  From January to November last year, according to the 
Municipal Economic Commission, the State-owned assets of local 
industrial enterprises totalled 118.8 billion yuan ($13.66 
billion) and their gross liabilities totalled 87.8 billion yuan 
($10.1 billion). 
  This liabilities ratio of 73.9 per cent is much higher than 
the world level for industrial enterprises of 50 per cent. 
  Local economic analysts believe the time is ripe for the 
bankruptcy law to be applied to industrial money losers. This 
will guarantee the real value of national assets by accelerating 
property transfers and exchanges, they say.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling:"A Better Credit-Rating System is Deemed </F>
Essential"] 
  [Text] Credit evaluation, a young industry that emerged in 
China only several years ago, is set to play an ever important 
role in the country's accelerating drive toward a market economy. 
  According to a recent seminar in Hainan Province on the 
development of China's credit rating industry, demand for 
authoritative credit assessments and a reliable rating system is 
becoming increasingly urgent. 
  However, officials and experts attending the seminar said 
many factors hinder the development of the budding industry. 
  Among the obstacles to development are that: 
  -- Many of the rating companies were launched by the 
People's 
Bank of China or other specialized banks, which makes it 
difficult for these companies to be independent when issuing 
ratings; 
  -- Although the major business of rating companies is 
grading 
the credit of corporate bonds, the issuance of such bonds still 
remains a small trade and development of the bond market lags 
behind that of the stock market; 
  -- Interest rates on corporate bonds have little relation to 
companies' credit worthiness because interest rates in China are 
set by the government, not the market. This reduces the value 
of a credit rating; 
  -- The business of credit evaluation is essentially limited 
to bonds, stunting its development; 
  -- A reliable management system and standard rating indices 
have not been established. China has no special organization to 
monitor the qualifications of rating companies; 
  -- Asset evaluation is stealing the limelight while credit 
rating is neglected by both investors and the government; 
  -- Some of the rating companies sprouting up across the 
country are unqualified. What China needs is not many new 
rating companies but national, even international, companies 
that are experienced and authoritative. 
  Experts are calling for tightened management to ensure that 
the industry develops properly. 
  The People's Bank of China should supervise the industry 
while an association of rating companies should be established, 
according to Shen Lizhong, a member of the Nanjin Credit Rating 
Committee. 
  Shen also urged authorities to strictly examine the 
qualifications of companies. 
  Meanwhile, experts say the rating companies must be 
independent of government, financial organizations, and 
enterprises and institutions that plan to issue bonds. 
  And experts say interest rates of corporate bonds should be 
set according to credit grades. 
  In addition, standard credit rating indices suitable for 
China should be established, according to You Liansheng, an 
expert from Shenyang. 
  You also said the rating business should be expanded from 
appraising bond credit to evaluating the credit of enterprises. 
financial institutions, stocks and various capital projects.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Kan: "Moratorium on New Investment Funds"] </F>
  [Text] The massive development of investment funds will be 
suspended this year to ensure the country's financial situation 
continues to improve. 
  The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, will 
not give the green light for new funds at least in the first 
half of this year, said an official with the bank. 
  He said the bank would probably approve one or two funds 
after July if financial conditions improve. 
  But it is impossible to see a lot of new funds emerging this 
year," he said. 
  The central bank has informed all provinces that no fund can 
be issued or listed without approval from the bank's head office. 
  At present, about 200 funds involving 30 billion yuan ($3.45 
billion) are applying for final approval from the central bank, 
which supervises and regulates the country's investment funds. 
  The official said the funds were suspended to prevent too 
much capital being drained away from treasury bonds and savings 
deposits. 
  China plans to issue 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) worth 
of bonds this year. 
  Starting this year, bonds will be the government's sole 
method for paying off the national budget deficit--estimated at 
60 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year. 
  The country last year had planned to allot 3 billion yuan 
($345 million) to investment funds. However, the shortage of 
capital forced authorities to postpone the quota plan to ensure 
enough financing for the country's key construction projects. 
  But the suspension this year will not include 
foreign-related 
funds since they don't attract domestic capital, the official 
said. 
  Many domestic institutions have co-operated with partners 
abroad to set up overseas-based funds to invest in energy, power 
and high-tech industries. 
  The official said China this year will concentrate on 
standardizing existing investment funds to lay a firm foundation 
for future development. 
  China's first investment fund was born in 1991. The country 
now has 50 funds involving 4.5 billion yuan ($517 million), but 
only four have been approved by the People's Bank of China. 
  Many of the funds have violated the State's policy of 
strictly controlling investment in fixed assets, he said. In 
addition, some capital raised by the funds are used in 
filter-bank lending and speculation in real estate. 
  The official said the central bank will try to steer these 
funds toward investing in treasury bonds. 
  The official said the central bank is drafting regulations 
on 
the management of funds and expects to issue them in the first 
half of this year. 
  Chinese scholars have been urging the State to develop 
investment funds as an important tool in stabilizing the stock 
market, since most engage in long-term investment instead of 
short-term speculation. 
  The funds also offer punters a new form of investment and 
allow them to play the stock market more safely.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Powerful Priority"] </F>
  [Text] China is to target financial transnationals for 
capital to beef up its overburdened power sector to break the 
economic "bottleneck" hindering development. 
  The country, which has suffered shortages of electricity for 
two decades, expects at least $25 billion to be invested in the 
sector in the next seven years. 
  Delegations will be sent to Western nations this year with 
proposals for co-operation, said an official with the Ministry 
of Power Industry. 
  Power production has become a key attraction for foreign 
investors over the past two years and several overseas-financed 
power plants have been announced. 
  "Big breakthroughs in foreign investment are expected," the 
official, who declined to be identified, said in an interview 
with Business Weekly last week. 
  China can produce up to 181 million kilowatts. Experts 
estimate that 25 percent more capacity is needed to satisfy the 
booming demand. 
  Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen last week began a 17-day 
trip to France, Spain and Israel to bring in investment. 
  China expects 9 per cent economic growth for the next seven 
years. To achieve that goal, additional generating capacity of 
at least 120 million kilowatts must be installed by the year 
2000. 
  That means an average 17 million kilowatts of generators 
should be installed each year. 
  The government plans 12 million kilowatts for this year, but 
financing has not been fully-arranged. Some 10 billion yuan 
($1.15 billion) of the 66 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) needed is 
not available. 
  Ministry officials said the capital shortage will probably 
be 
eased later this year as the central government gives the sector 
top priority and the new State Development Bank begins 
supporting construction of infrastructure. 
  But they pointed out that bigger problems lie ahead. Fewer 
projects were kicked off last year than were expected and no 
projects have been approved so far this year. Big power plants 
that are planned may not be completed, they said. 
  This scaled-down construction, they caution, would 
jeopardize 
long-term economic growth. 
  The government does not want to let big capital construction 
projects drive up inflation, which in the first two months of 
the year stood at 20 percent. Building a large power plant 
requires billions of yuan. 
  Plants with total capacity of 53 million kilowatts are under 
construction, but that is at least 7 million kilowatts less than 
expected. 
  At the same time last year, 54 million kilowatts were under 
construction. 
  Officials warn that if enough investment is not found, 
construction would further shrink. 
  In France, Shi is expected to sign an agreement with the 
French power sector to extend a 10-year power co-operation 
treaty that expires this year. 
  The minister, leading five key officials from the ministry, 
is to explain China's energy policies to the French Government 
and business community, discuss possibilities for further 
co-operation, and learn about French corporate management. 
  Coming on the heels of French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur's visit to China, the mission is expected to be 
fruitful, trade analysts said. 
  Balladur's visit was described as a turning point, following 
about four years of relatively cool relations between the two 
countries. 
  Shi's visits to Spain and Israel are also considered 
important. A Western European power union is based in Spain, and 
Israel has ties with financial organizations worldwide. 
  China is also to rely on foreign power groups for know-how 
to 
improve its efficiency. 
  The Ministry of Power Industry said late last year that 
China 
would need $25 billion in foreign investment by the year 2000 to 
generate enough electricity to support its economy.
