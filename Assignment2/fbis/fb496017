  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A training course for 
60 operators from Pakistan's Cashma Nuclear Power Plant opened 
today at the post-graduate school under the China National 
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). 
  The 300,000 kilowatt Cashma is modeled after the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant in coastal Zhejiang Province, which was 
designed and built entirely by China itself. It is the first 
nuclear power plant China has ever exported to a foreign country. 
  The contract obliged CNNC to provide training in basic 
theories to Pakistani engineers and technicians to ensure 
Cashma's safe operation and maintenance. The trainees are to 
receive on-job training at Qinshan at the end of the course. 
  According to CNNC officials, some 62 Chinese scientists were 
organized to prepare a set of 17 textbooks in 14 subjects for 
the training course, which were examined and approved by the 
China Institute of Atomic Energy, the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration and the prestigious Qinghua University. 
  The textbooks were accepted by the Pakistani side, the 
officials said.

  [Text] London, April 20 (XINHUA) -- British Prime Minister 
John Major had reacted cautiously to the United Nations' demand 
that NATo authorize air strikes to protect the six 
U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia from Serb attack, THE 
TIMES newspaper reported today. 
  With NATO ambassadors' meeting today in Brussels to consider 
the request by the U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington 
wanted to broaden the threat of NATO air strikes to prevent 
another Gorazde, a Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia. 
  U.N. protection force in Bosnia had called in two NATO air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb forces last week but failed to stop the 
serbs shelling the Muslim "safe haven." 
  However, there is considerable doubt in the British 
Government over the wisdom of extending air strikes beyond the 
original limit of protecting U.N. troops. 
  Although U.N. Security Council Resolution 836 of June last 
year mandated NATO air strikes to protect the safe areas, the 
Western alliance agreed to permit close air support only to 
protect U.N. personnel in Bosnia. 
  NATO had threatened to use air power to remove Serb heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo in February but there is no NATO 
authorization to protect by air cover the other five safe areas 
of Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac. 
  There is now serious doubt over whether NATO air power can 
deter Serb offensive on Gorazde, where limited air strikes were 
ignored. 
  The risk is that deterrence would not work and NATO would be 
forced to carry out bombing raids to protect Muslim civilians in 
the safe areas, leading to a dramatic escalation in NATO's 
involvement in the civil war making the U.N.'s mission in Bosnia 
more untenable, the report said. 
  More over, Serbs' old ally Russia, which was angry at being 
not consulted by NATO before launching air raids, is opposed to 
the use of force to solve the conflict.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A recent visit to 
South China by a British business delegation has concluded not 
only with the group purchasing supplies from China, but also 
with plans to sell British products to the vast mainland market. 
  Co-hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) 
and British Airways, the business mission representing six major 
U.K. consumer goods retailers and manufacturers visited Hong 
Kong and factories and retailers in the Pearl River Delta last 
week to explore business opportunities. 
  "We increased our buying during this visit but have also 
received an unexpected bonus by ending up with actively selling 
our products," said David Oxham, director of Automated Security 
(Holdings) Plc, the largest security system company in Britain. 
  The boom in China's retail market has resulted in the need 
for complementary services such as shop surveillance systems, he 
said. 
  Marketing director of Britain's largest eyewear retailers, 
Dollond Aitchison Group Plc, Ian Johnson, said "it is 
encouraging to see a consumer market on the mainland and not 
just infrastructure opportunities." 
  "This visit has encouraged me to consider returning to 
attend 
trade fairs in this region rather than only visiting those in 
Europe. The Hong Kong optical fair in November could provide 
fresh opportunities," Johnson said. 
  Other areas in which the group saw business potential was in 
service development and management training for Chinese 
enterprises. 
  Hong Kong would have an enormous role both directly and as 
middle-man for foreign partners in these sectors, the British 
delegation members commented. 
  The delegation also expressed interest in the potential for 
establishing joint ventures in China, but considered it 
necessary to have the involvement of a Hong Kong partner. 
  "Hong Kong is necessary for our business to facilitate areas 
such as banking, quality control and communications - this 
assistance outweighs its costs," said the merchandise director 
of a major mail order house, Empire Stores Plc, James Skelsey. 
"Most of what we buy in China is sourced through Hong Kong," he 
added.

"Mistakenly Hitting `Another Target'"] 
  [Text] When NATO aircraft attacked the Bosnian Serb 
positions in Gorazde on 10 and 11 April, they were wide of the 
mark. When flying over the target on the first occasion, the 
aircraft lost touch with the ground and had to drop their bombs 
and return in a hurry; on the second occasion, a 500-lb bomb was 
again mistakenly dropped into the city center of Gorazde, 
causing casualties among the civilians. 
  The Pentagon assessed the results of the air raids as "very 
unsatisfactory" and cited "foul weather" as the cause. Having a 
firm belief in the operational functions of its aircraft, the 
Pentagon could only "blame the weather" and not the "aircraft." 
  People might as well associate this with the political 
climate in the Bosnian situation, which is at least equally 
"foul": The ethnic relations are intricate and the historical 
resentments are entangled. In the face of such a situation, is 
not taking such military action as an air raid equally 
"irrelevant to the subject" and an act of mistakenly hitting 
"another target"? 
  Viewed from the Bosnian situation after the air raids, this 
is not a groundless worry. Ground fighting in Gorazde has not 
stopped so far and shots are again being heard in Sarajevo, 
which has had a cease-fire for quite some time. The Serbs claim 
that, in future, they will hit back at NATO aircraft conducting 
the air raids and they have also detained UN peacekeeping 
personnel as "hostages." 
  Apparently, the air raids conducted by NATO aircraft have 
failed to achieve the original intention of "attaining the 
greatest political objective with limited military action."

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by staff reporter Hu Xijin (5170 6932 6651): </F>
"Visiting Pale After Air Strikes"] 
  [Text] Pale, 12 Apr (RENMIN RIBAO)--This reporter left 
Belgrade at midnight and arrived at the border at dawn (0600 
local summertime). A rainbow could be seen in the gray sky 
above Bosnia-Herzegovina in the west but disappeared shortly 
afterward, then it was raining... 
  Pale, the center of the Serb-controlled areas, is only some 
dozens of kilometers away from Gorazde, an area bombed by NATO 
planes. At around 0800 there were few people on the street, and 
it seemed that the atmosphere was not particularly tense. 
Guards at the presidential palace were not on high alert. This 
reporter drove straight to the entrance to the presidential 
palace and went in to arrange an interview with their leaders, 
but the answer was: Our leaders are fully engaged today and 
have no time to spare before tomorrow at the earliest. 
  Nor was it easy to cover the news in Gorazde. Mr. (Doholy) 
(duo huo li 1122 7202 6849], the Serbs' information minister, 
explained that the Serbian authorities had decided to black out 
and censor news about the situation on the battlefield in 
Gorazde and foreign journalists were barred from going to the 
area to cover the news. It was alleged that the authorities were 
worried that these reporters might "be in danger" in 
Serb-controlled areas. 
  NATO forces have launched two air strikes against Serb 
positions around Gorazde since 10 April, and Serb leader 
Karadzic has only delivered a brief speech on Serbian radio, 
thus presenting a sharp contrast to the period of "intensive 
news" releases in February when NATO issued an ultimatum to the 
Serbs. (Doholy) said that there were two reasons why the Serbs 
were "silent": First, the Serbs did not want to say too much 
because following the air strikes, the U.S. press "began to hold 
that the Serbs were a victim of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina;" 
and second, since NATO had crossed the "Rubicon" and launched 
the air strikes without any warning, the Serbs did not want to 
whip up public opinion before making any "self-defensive" moves. 
  The Serbian Supreme Command has issued a statement 
"reserving 
the right to self-defense" following the NATO air strikes. At 
what time and in what form the Serbs will make the 
"self-defense" moves is definitely an important factor in the 
future development of the situation. Some Serbian officers whom 
this reporter met were not willing to talk too much because they 
were "instructed by superiors" not to answer questions in a 
casual way. Serbian Defense Minister Kovacevic mentioned three 
points in an interview with this reporter: First, if NATO bombs 
Serbian positions again, the Serbs will "be forced to down NATO 
planes." Also, the Serbs have not used antiaircraft weapons. 
Second, at present the Serbs are not yet preparing to attack UN 
forces, but if "there is such a need," the Serbs do not rule out 
such a possibility. Third, the Serbs have the means to attack 
the NATO air base in Italy. In short, he stressed that as a 
great risk of escalation of the war did exist, the Serbs would 
"employ every means to defend themselves." 
  Although the General Command of the Bosnian Serb armed 
forces 
is near Pale, no general could be found there today. An 
official of the Information Ministry said that all those 
generals were at the frontline or at the side of Serbian 
leaders. Karadzic would also go to areas near the frontline. 
Moreover, sources said that following the air strikes, a new 
round of fighting had broken out in Sarajevo, and that the 
"Bridge of Unity and Friendship," located in a gray area 
controlled neither by the Serbs nor by the Muslims, was closed 
on 11 April. 
  At noon, Pale started to bustle. Students finished their 
classes, shops were open for business, and, taking up their 
umbrellas, people walked on the rainy streets. When this 
reporter went into a clothes shop, the shopkeeper was listening 
to a news broadcast, which was all about the war, meetings, and 
talks. When asked about whether or not he worried about 
escalation of the war, the shopkeeper shrugged his shoulders and 
said: "Worry cannot make things work, I am used to it."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb 
Presidential Office today announced a unilateral peace in 
Gorazde to allow U.N. peacekeepers into the city. 
  The announcement came after yesterday's peace agreement 
between Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. peacekeeping force allowing 
the latter to enter Bosnia's eastern city of Gorazde Wednesday 
[19 April] to enable humanitarian organizations to pursue their 
work. 
  This act was in response to statements Tuesday from the 
Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. 
  The Bosnian Serbs also called for the international 
community 
to press the Muslims to accept the cease-fire agreement and hold 
peaceful negotiations to solve the crisis. 
  Foreign press reports said that by the noon Bosnian Serb 
forces continued to shell the besieged Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde, despite their "unilateral peace" announcement. 
  The three-week Serb offensive has killed at least 345 people 
and wounded more than 1,000, the reports added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China has established 
a ground-based test system for space flights, paving the way for 
the further development of the country's aerospace industry. 
  The various kinds of ground test facilities and devices that 
have gone into operation make it possible to carry out any 
conventional or routine test on satellites and rockets on the 
ground. 
  Wind tunnels provide test results at different stages of 
rocket launching while large-sized heat-testing devices ranging 
from one m to seven m in diameter allow simulations for 
satellite flights in outer space and in different temperatures. 
  China has also built a gigantic rocket testing launch pad 
which is 59 m high, 41 m long and about 22 m in width, providing 
a large amount of test data for rocket engine system designs. 
  In addition, it has also built a huge centrifugal machine 
and 
vibration test tower, both controlled by modern computers.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Qinshan nuclear 
power plant, the first designed and built by China itself, has 
started commercial operation. 
  According to local officials, the power plant in coastal 
Zhejiang Province, has so far generated 2.93 billion kWh of 
electricity, and the waste gas, waste water and trash produced 
are far below the limits set by the central government. 
  The officials attributed the achievement to the effective 
measures adopted by the Qinshan nuclear power corporation. 
  For instance, the company has used TV, radio and exhibitions 
to enhance consciousness of safety in production among workers 
in a bid to ensure that the nuclear power plant operates safely 
on a long-term basis. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant started full-load trial 
operation in July 1992. Its construction began in 1985 and took 
six years to complete.

  [Text] Changchun, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A mobile neutron 
radiography system that can be applied to national defense, 
aerospace, oil prospecting, medicine and other fields has been 
developed in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province. 
  Experts on the appraisal committee said the system marks a 
major breakthrough in China's neutron radiography technology, 
and that its critical part -- the scintillation augmentation 
screen -- is up to the top international standard. 
  China's neutron radiography applications used to be 
restricted to nuclear reactors, as its expense and inconvenience 
prevented the technology being used more widely. 
  A research group at the Northeast China Teachers' University 
took over the development work from the State Commission for 
Science and Technology six years ago. 
  The experts said the new system can take pictures with a 
sealed neutron tube as the neutron source or in a weak neutron 
current environment. The picture can be a film or a microphoto 
image processed by computer technology.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China is considering 
setting up a high-tech investment foundation in cooperation with 
foreign financial bodies. 
  The total sum will be 120 million U.S. dollars, the State 
Science and Technology Commission revealed today. 
  "China develops high technologies mainly on its own 
strength, 
but it also welcomes assistance from abroad," said Huang Qitao, 
deputy director of the commission. 
  The country started building its high-tech industry in 1988, 
under the "torch plan". Last year there were more than 10,000 
high-tech firms nationwide, with 700,000 workers. 
  Among them, 4,000 are overseas-funded companies. 
  Domestic sales and exports of high-tech products will make 
up 
25 percent of China's gross national product and export volume 
by the year 2000, according to the government blueprint. 
  The new materials, energy, biological technology, 
electronics 
and information industries, and environmental protection are 
highlights on China's high-tech plan.

  [Text] Beijing, April 17 (XINHUA) -- China has made 
significant progress in commercializing, industrializing and 
internationalizing the country's high and new technologies since 
the country started the "Torch Plan" five years ago. 
  The "Torch Plan", which was approved by the State Council in 
1988, is now being implemented in the country's 120 high and new 
technology development zones, which have been set up either by 
local governments or the central government. 
  According to officials from the State Commission of Science 
and Technology, the major technologies being developed in the 
high-tech development zones are new materials, biotechnology, 
electronics and information, integration of machinery and 
electricity, high- efficient new energies and energy-saving 
technology and environmental protection technology. 
  Last year the country's high and new technology development 
zones had a total income of 57.3 billion yuan from their 
technology, industries and trade, while their exports reached 
0.73 billion us dollars. 
  Of the 10,000 high-tech enterprises, which employ 700,000 
people in the development zones, 106 have an annual output value 
of more than 100 million yuan. 
  In addition, foreign businesses and joint ventures in the 
high- tech development zones now number more than 4,000. 
  For example, Beijing New Technology Industry Development and 
Experimental Zone, which was established six years ago, now has 
112 high-tech firms each of whose total income from technology, 
industry and trade has reached 10 million yuan. 
  In 1993, the total income of the development zone's 
technology, industry, and trade exceeded 10 billion yuan. Over 
200 products from the zone were exported to more than 20 
countries and regions, earning 70 million U.S. dollars. 
  At the moment, a number of new enterprises with advanced 
technologies, scale-production, good potential market, and 
qualified employees are emerging and growing rapidly in China's 
high-tech development zones. 
  Some high technologies, such as optical fibre communications 
and electronic information, have grown into major industries, 
the first in Wuhan and the latter in Beijing development zone. 
  "To develop China's high-technology industry, we must 
chiefly 
rely on our own efforts and technology advantages while bringing 
the country's new and high technology products to the 
international market," said Huang Qitao, vice-minister of the 
State Commission of Science and Technology. 
  Recently, the State Commission of Science and Technology, in 
cooperation with overseas financial organizations, set up "China 
torch plan new high technology industry investment foundation," 
which is expected to provide a fund of at least 120 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  According to Huang, by the year 2000 the sales and exports 
of 
new and high technologies of China will account for about 15 
percent of the country's GNP and its total exports respectively.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese geologists 
believe that the bulging movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 
affects the the global climate along with the formation of 
plateau monsoons. 
  Extensive investigations beginning last year on this highest 
plateau in the world by a team of Chinese scientists have shown 
that plateau monsoons have a strong influence on sand storm and 
precipitation distribution worldwide. 
  Before the formation of plateaus the global climate was mild 
and humid with little variation in different places, according 
to scientists at the Lanzhou Institute of Plateau Atmospheric 
Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in northwest 
China's Gansu Province. 
  In the tertiary period, the scientists said, the 
Qinghai-Tibet plateau began to rise. Consequently the global 
environment and climate started to change. 
  In other words, the swelling of the plateau led to the 
formation of hot low pressure in summer and cold high pressure 
in winter around the plateau, and plateau monsoons began to 
emerge. 
  The scientists estimated that the monsoon formation could be 
traced back as early as 37 million years ago, and it took its 
present form about one million years ago. 
  Such changes in atmospheric circulation in turn caused sharp 
temperature drops along the earth's medium and high latitudes, 
and the geological distribution of precipitation also began to 
take on monsoon traits. In summer, the land to the east of the 
plateau was humid while the land to the west was dry. 
  About 2.4 million years ago the plateau rose to 1,500 m 
above 
sea level on the average. Now the average elevation is 4,500 m. 
  The scientists said the intensification of circulating 
currents made the climate along the medium and high latitudes of 
the northern hemisphere turn cold, and glacial periods emerged. 
  Monsoons also strengthened the high-altitude subsidence 
airstream in the southwest of the plateau, which resulted in 
drought in northern Africa, with the original forest climate 
turning into a semi-arid climate. Man appeared at this time. 
  On the other hand, due to a strong wind belt two km over the 
land surface caused by the plateau monsoon, the yellow sand 
north of the plateau was stirred up and descended onto the 
northeast of the plateau to form a loess plateau covering 
600,000 sq km over the years. 
  In addition, intensified sunlight reflected on the plateau 
surface after the swelling movement led to abnormal air 
circulation in the entire northern hemisphere. In turn, the 
middle and eastern part of the American continent became humid 
and its western part turned warm and dry. 
  With the aid of satellite data, scientists at the Lanzhou 
Institute of Desert Research found that widespread snowfall and 
glaciers due to the swelling affected the global climate, too. 
  They also discovered that the plateau monsoon accelerated 
the 
speed of wind in spring in the central Asian region, and 
large-scale sand storms emerged in desert areas and places short 
of vegetation, between February and May in particular. 
  Sand particles can be carried as far as the waters of the 
Northern Pacific Ocean and Northwest Indian Ocean.

  [Text] Jinan, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- In a letter to a national 
conference on the work of resettling military cadres transferred 
to civilian sectors, which was still in progress here, Jiang 
Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, president 
of the state, and chairman of the Central Military Commission; 
and Li Peng, premier of the State Council, expressed their 
greetings to the conference and extended cordial regards to the 
nation's vast number of former military cadres working in all 
walks of life and to comrades who made contributions to their 
resettlement. 
  The letter says: Former military cadres now working in 
civilian sectors are the country's valuable wealth and important 
force in socialist modernization. The People's Liberation Army 
is a great melting pot which has tempered and cultivated groups 
upon groups of outstanding cadres who have superior political 
standards, strong organizational and leadership ability, higher 
educational backgrounds, considerable professional skills and 
knowledge, fine workstyle, and selfless dedication. The group 
of cadres who are in the process of being transferred to 
civilian work this year will bring new vitality to economic 
construction and to other endeavors in various localities. 
  The letter says: The year 1994 is extremely crucial to the 
process of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. 
Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability are the general 
tasks of the party and the state. Successfully resettling 
military cadres in the civilian sectors is a matter of vital 
importance to this general task and of great significance for 
promoting army building and economic construction, ensuring 
military and social stability, and promoting the smooth 
development of reform and opening up. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should take the resettlement work as 
an important political task and earnestly carry it out 
accordingly. They should do everything possible to overcome 
difficulties and successfully resettle and place every military 
cadre transferred to civilian sectors so that each has a role to 
play and each can display his talent. Comrades in the military 
should show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties of 
the localities and actively consult and closely coordinate with 
them to successfully carry out the work together.

<F P=106> [Article by Yue Shan (1471 1472): "The Liberation Army's </F>
Communications Center Gets Into Trouble"] 
  [Text] The Communications Center Suddenly Stopped 
Operating At a few minutes to 1800 on the afternoon of 8 
February, the military communications of the General Staff and 
Logistics Departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army 
suddenly stopped operating, and this lasted for more than 20 
minutes. At 1815 on the same day, the Central Military 
Commission ordered the Beijing Military Region and the Beijing 
Garrison to take precautions; Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, hurried to the Central Military 
Commission Office to call a meeting and wait for a report on the 
incident. 
  The communications center of the General Staff and Logistics 
Departments, located in Beijing's Nanyuan, is responsible for 
carrying out regular contacts with the headquarters of the major 
military regions throughout the country, group armies, and all 
of the arms and services, as well as military bases. In 
emergencies, this center issues orders and instructions. Here, 
the General Staff Department has 92 special communications lines 
and the General Logistics Department has more than 70 special 
communications lines. These communications lines link directly 
to the headquarters of major military regions and the arms and 
services, as well as military bases. The military power supply 
system is solely responsible for supplying electricity to the 
communications center and is governed by rules and regulations, 
with weekly checks and maintenance provided as well as a general 
check at the beginning of each month and during holidays. It is 
said that equipment for the center was imported from northern 
Europe in 1990 and is the most advanced in the world. 
<H5>  Six Military Personnel Sent to Military Court for </H5>
Dereliction of Duty The first outage occurred at 1755 on 8 
February, just before a shift change, during which more than 20 
communications lines went down in the fourth zone, which 
includes the Shenyang Military Region, the Lanzhou Military 
Region, the group armies stationed in North China, the North Sea 
Fleet, all the Air Force bases in North China, and the No. 801 
missile base under the 2d Artillery Corps. Communications 
returned to normal at 1820. When the outage occurred, Zhang 
Zhen, Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian, and Fu Quanyou hurried to 
Nanyuan, where they ordered an investigation. Liu Huaqing, who 
was on an inspection tour of Fujian, also sent an emergency 
telegram to find out about the situation and was at one point 
ready to return to Beijing to handle the matter. It was 
verified that the accident occurred in this way: Four of the 
six personnel in charge of the communications with the fourth 
zone went out to buy wine when it was almost time for shift 
change, with only two staying at their post. In violation of 
discipline, the two turned off some of the equipment, left the 
room, and locked it. When the four returned, they could not open 
the door and communications were down for 20 minutes. After the 
accident, the six military personnel (including a major, who was 
the group leader) were sent to a military court for questioning. 
It is said that if convicted of this dereliction of duty, the 
main offender could be sentenced to death or at least 15 years' 
imprisonment. 
<H5>  The Communications Center Went Down Twice </H5>
  A communications outage occurred again at the center on 19 
February, which lasted for almost eight minutes. This was 
caused by a fire in the office of the communications center's 
duty officer. At about 2200, the duty officer and a security 
guard were drinking wine in the office and were soon drunk. 
Their lighted cigarettes set some newspapers ablaze and a fire 
broke out. Fortunately, a patrolling guard saw it and sounded 
the alarm. Some soldiers stationed in the center put out the 
fire and gave the order to turn off the equipment. They also 
reported the incident to the General Staff Department and the 
Central Military Commission. Subsequently, Zhang Wannian and Li 
Jijun went to the scene for an inspection. The duty officer and 
the security guard were arrested immediately. 
<H5>  All Communications Personnel of the General Staff and </H5>
Logistics Departments Were Transferred 
  After these two fires, all of the working personnel at the 
communications center of the General Staff and Logistics 
Departments were transferred in March and replaced by personnel 
from Air Force Headquarters and a department directly under the 
Central Military Commission. Subsequently, the Central Military 
Commission gave the following orders: These two communications 
outages should be explained internally as routine equipment 
checks; no meetings will be held, nor circulars issued. 
  Now, high-level CPC leaders are facing many knotty problems 
and have taken a high degree of precautions. If these 
"accidents," which are neither too big nor too small, happen 
again, their already taut nerves will become even more keyed up.

in vogue. Many people are ready to buy pirated compact discs, 
which have become the new favorite of people going to the 
mainland for shopping. Statistics show that more than 200 
million pirated CDs were sold in the mainland in 1993. 
<H5>  As Many as 50 Factories Produce Pirated CDs </H5>
  The main reason pirated CDs are in vogue in the mainland is 
that some unscrupulous businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 
taking advantage of the weak sense of copyright and loose law 
enforcement in some localities in the mainland, have bribed 
concerned local officials or solicited business for persons in 
charge of CD manufacturing plants so as to seek the latter's 
tacit approval in producing pirated CDs in an almost open way. 
As a result, the mainland, particularly the Zhu Jiang Delta 
region, has become a center for pirated CDs. 
  Some retailers running pirated CD businesses in the mainland 
say that in their estimation, there are 50 illegal factories 
around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region engaged in producing pirated 
CDs. These are mainly located in Jiangmen, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, 
Foshan, and Maoming. In addition, some pirated CDs are smuggled 
into the mainland from Taiwan or Southeast Asia, whereas 
recently, some unscrupulous businessmen have set up pirate CD 
manufacturing plants in the hinterland to avoid an official 
clampdown. Moreover, most of these factories cover up their 
activities by manufacturing other kinds of industrial products. 
<H5>  Fair Quality, Attractive Prices </H5>
  The production cost for pirated CDs is very low, but the 
investment in the production line is not that low because, 
generally speaking, $2 million is required. Hence, most of 
these unlawful factories in the mainland are funded by investors 
from Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Southeast Asia. In the earliest 
stages, as the market was not large, the retail price of every 
pirated CD was over HK$20, but as the market is increasing, and 
as the owners of unlawful factories are overtly and covertly 
competing with each other for better sales, the retail prices of 
pirated CDs have dropped drastically. For example, one can buy 
a large number of pirated CDs at HK$11 to HK$12 each. The 
retail prices of pirated CDs around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region 
now range from 12 to 18 yuan, whereas in Hong Kong, three 
pirated CDs are sold for HK$100. People can find such illegal 
stalls in some commercial districts from time to time, and 
business at these stalls is brisk. 
  These pirated CDs are not poor-quality and can meet ordinary 
consumers' needs. Each of them picks 17 to 18 selected songs by 
noted singers, while only 10 songs or so are included in 
original CDs and not all of them are good songs. Under such 
circumstances, it is natural that pirated CDs are well-received 
by consumers. Although Hong Kong Customs already have put up 
warning posters in open spaces at every port of entry and exit, 
noting that "no one is allowed to carry pirated CDs; once 
convicted, one faces a maximum penalty of two years' 
imprisonment and a HK$1,000 fine for each disc." However, when 
returning to the mainland, many Hong Kong residents cannot but 
buy some pirated CDs. Even in open spaces at the Shenzhen Joint 
Inspection Building, we can see several stalls that are selling 
pirated CDs quite openly, and business is brisk owing to the 
great demand. 
<H5>  Zhongshan, Guangzhou Become Distribution Centers </H5>
  Apart from higher prices than those sold in the mainland, in 
Hong Kong we cannot test the sound of a CD we want to buy. 
Owing to fiercer competition, however, sellers in the mainland 
generally offer good services, and customers can test the sound 
of discs as they please. Therefore, a lot of people would 
rather buy pirated compact discs in the mainland. A friend of 
mine said that he bought as many as 100 pirated CDs and that 
most of them are of fair quality. 
  According to some industry insiders, some of the molds used 
to produce pirated CDs are used and discarded molds purchased 
directly, and illegally, from factories producing original CDs, 
while others are reproduced from songs recorded from radio 
broadcasts. Normally, these molds should be replaced after 
producing a certain number of CDs, but in order to reduce costs, 
pirate businessmen do not replace them. Therefore, some of the 
pirated CDs skip over certain parts or have a strong hum. 
  In addition, the insiders pointed out: Some of the pirated 
CDs produced in the mainland are smuggled to Southeast Asian, 
European, or American regions, whereas at present, the largest 
wholesale market around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region is mainly in 
Zhongshan and Guangzhou. The average wholesale price of each 
pirated CD ranges from HK$8 to HK$10 (this is the net price of 
the disc; that of the plastic pack is not included). Many 
purchasers from interior provinces also go there. 
<H5>  Following the Law To Stop Piracy </H5>
  As a matter of fact, it is believed that pirated CDs will 
continue to exist for a long time, until there is a perfect 
system of legal control in the mainland. Owing to their cheap 
prices and fair quality (with only a certain amount of hum), it 
is very difficult for consumers to resist them. Many consumers 
hold that unless the prices of original compact discs are marked 
down drastically, they will not find these discs more 
attractive. Hence, it is believed that to put an end to pirated 
CDs, the ultimate method is for businessmen producing original 
CDs to play down their motive of making huge profits and let the 
market decide prices. Only in this way can the problem be solved.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's central bank 
will not relax its control of the money supply in view of the 
slower rate of growth of some state-owned enterprises, a senior 
bank official said here today. 
  Dai Xianglong, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, 
noted that in the first quarter of this year, state-owned 
enterprises recorded a production growth of only two percent, in 
contrast to 50 percent for township enterprises and 90 percent 
for foreign-funded ones. 
  According to the State Statistical Bureau, the country's 
overall economic growth was 12.6 percent for the January-March 
period. 
  Factors contributing to the slow growth of state-owned 
enterprises include tightened investment in fixed assets and 
reduced supply of materials, said Dai, now attending a national 
conference here in China's largest city. 
  Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have 
been transformed into stockholding or joint venture companies 
ceased to have their production included in the state sector's 
statistics. 
  The state increased loans for working capital to 
enterprises. 
From now on, said Dai, banks will act on a case-to-case basis in 
extending loans to state-owned enterprises. 
  Priority will be given to those with good economic 
performance, followed by those in a position to turn red into 
black in a short time. 
  Enterprises up to the neck in debt and with no hope of 
recovery will be declared bankrupt, in line with the "bankruptcy 
law," Dai added.

  [Text] China's central bank will retain strict control 
over credit this year as it battles to slow inflation, running 
at more than 20 per cent, says a senior bank official. 
Inflation was showing no sign of improvement and urgent action 
was needed to combat soaring prices, the People's Bank of China 
Vice Governor Dai Xianglong said at a national financial 
conference in Shanghai. Investment in fixed assets, seen as a 
primary cause of China's continuing high inflation rate, was 
still too large, Mr Dai said. He said the bank would tighten its 
control over credit in this area. 
  However, the vice-governor emphasised that the bank would 
continue to provide loss-making, state-run enterprises with 
operating funds to ensure they would survive the credit crunch. 
"As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing 
financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational 
funds on a case-by-case basis," Mr Dai was quoted by Xinhua (the 
New China News Agency) as saying. 
  Figures released by the State Statistical Bureau this week 
showed that 49.6 per cent of all state-run enterprises are 
losing money, with losses in the first quarter totalling 15.7 
billion yuan (about HK$13.89 billion). Factors contributing to 
the struggles of the state-owned enterprises include tightened 
investment and reduced supply of materials, Mr Dai said. 
Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have been 
transformed into stock-holding or joint venture companies ceased 
to have their production included in state-sector statistics. 
"We must remain cool-headed," he was quoted as saying, adding 
that the bank would continue to focus on currency stabilisation 
to ensure an appropriate rate of economic growth. 
  Western financial analysts said the People's Bank would face 
a difficult balancing act if it was to restrict credit but still 
provide enough money to bail out state enterprises. "I think 
they have adopted the right approach in clamping down on loans 
to fixed-asset investment projects but still an awful lot of new 
credit will be needed to keep these loss-making enterprises 
afloat," said the manager of a Western bank in Shanghai. "There 
is also the risk that loans made for operational funds will get 
diverted into risky investment projects," the banker said. "The 
central bank unfortunately still has very little control of 
where loans eventually end up," he said. 
  Analysts pointed out that even though the economic 
austerity, 
or rectification programme, had been in place for nearly a year, 
economic growth was still in double figures and inflation had 
continued to rise, almost on a monthly basis. Inflation in some 
key cities is already at more than 30 per cent and the 
government is clearly concerned that if prices continue to rise 
it could be faced with a renewed bout of social unrest. 
  Control of prices has been made the top priority and 
municipal officials have been ordered to regularly check the 
prices of food, services and other daily necessities to ensure 
inflation does not get any worse. However, analysts consider 
the actions so far by the government could be too little, too 
late.

  [Text] Xiamen, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has decided to introduce a market-oriented macro-economic 
control system nationwide, according to a senior government 
official. 
  Addressing a national conference on market circulation that 
closed in this city of Fujian Province yesterday, Wang Yiping, 
secretary-general of the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
said that the government will also try to effectively regulate 
supplies of and demand for commodities vital to the national 
economy and the people's livelihood. 
  These commodities include grain, cotton, cooking oil, sugar, 
meat, vegetables, chemical fertilizers, rolled steel and refined 
oil, he told the delegates from all over the country. 
  He described market regulation as "essential" to China's 
steady economic growth and the success of various reforms. 
  "We should control market prices by economic means and 
through monetary policies, guide market demand and achieve a 
balance between total supply and demand," he said. 
  To this end, it is necessary to institute a material reserve 
system at the central and local levels, he noted. 
  The system at the central level is intended to regulate the 
relationship between total supply and demand. 
  The system at the local level is designed to regulate the 
supply-demand relationship in local markets in order to keep 
prices stable. 
  Furthermore, it is imperative to introduce a risk-related 
fund system for important commodities, Wang said. 
  The Chinese Government plans to institute a grain 
risk-related fund system and plans to establish risk-related 
funds for meat, vegetables and other non-staple foodstuffs, he 
said. 
  "Only by establishing such funds, will we be able to promote 
protection of production after price decontrol, effectively 
regulate the market and prevent steep ups and downs in 
production and markets," he said. 
  Wang Yiping also urged efforts to use both domestic and 
foreign markets for macro-economic controls in China, with the 
emphasis on coordinating the country's export policies. 
  He said that imports and exports are playing an increasingly 
significant role in regulating the market, as a result of the 
introduction of a market-oriented foreign exchange system, the 
reform of the foreign trade system and the gearing of the 
Chinese market to the global market. 
  It is, therefore, necessary to coordinate the country's 
policies regarding the import and export of major consumer goods 
and capital goods, and use taxation and tariffs to regulate the 
amount of import and export goods, he said. 
  The Chinese Government has also decided to introduce a 
market 
monitoring system, he said. 
  Specifically, a nationwide information network will be set 
up 
to forecast and oversee production, marketing, storage and 
changes in the prices of major consumer goods and capital goods 
in order to make market regulation more effective, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin inspected the Beijing International 
Telecommunications Center here today, urging concerted efforts 
to make telecommunications work better serve the country's 
economic development. 
  Jiang, general secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party (CPC), said that the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council are pleased at the rapid 
development of China's telecommunications services in recent 
years. 
  Situated on the southern side of Beijing Sanyuan fly-over, 
the Beijing international telecommunications center is an 
important link in China's national telecommunications network 
which transmits international telephones, telegraph, and data 
business into or out of China. 
  Jiang arrived at the center this morning, accompanied by 
Chen 
Xitong, party secretary of Beijing, and Wu Jichuan, minister of 
posts and telecommunications. 
  At a TV conference room, he talked by video telephone with 
the head of Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau -- about supplies 
of vegetables, traffic conditions and development of 
telecommunications in Shanghai. 
  Jiang urged Shanghai and Beijing telecommunications bureaux 
to learn from and compete with each other. 
  At the international telephone control room, he urged the 
operators to devote efforts to their study of foreign languages. 
  In a meeting room, Jiang listened to a report from Beijing 
telecommunications bureau and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. 
  He said that the establishment of a socialist market 
economic 
structure demands a highly developed telecommunications network. 
  He called on various departments within telecommunications 
and posts services to enhance cooperation and use state 
investment to its best advantage.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- Young economic expert 
and chief economist of the State Statistical Bureau, Mr. Qiu 
Xiaohua, said in an interview with this agency that China should 
stabilize prices by maintaining appropriate economic growth in 
the country. 
  Mr. Qiu said that judging from the operation of the national 
economy in the first quarter this year in China, the 
macro-economic situation in the country showed a "combination of 
euphoria and worry". Economic growth had nearly dropped to the 
goal set for macro-control; the economy was operating within an 
appropriate range; the investment environment had improved to a 
certain extent; fiscal revenue and spending, credit and foreign 
exchange income and expenditure had all struck a balance or even 
showed a surplus; the "bottleneck problem" of energy, raw and 
finished materials and transportation had been somewhat 
alleviated; the main consumer goods except for some agricultural 
products were supplied in an adequate way; the actual income of 
both urban and rural residents was rising; bank savings deposits 
were greatly increasing and reform measures of various kinds 
were being carried out in a comparatively smooth way. 
  According to the economist, outstanding contradictions 
appearing in the economic operations could not be overlooked. 
First, prices were continuously growing on the basis of last 
year's inflation with the highest growth of prices seen in 
grain, meat, aquatic products, vegetables, clothing and service 
items, posing an adverse affect on the living of some residents. 
Second, the difficulties facing the operation of state-owned 
enterprises have been deteriorating, production growth was 
dropping sharply with enterprises suffering from the stockpiling 
of their products, delays in each other's debts and an obvious 
decline of their economic efficiency. 
  Mr. Qiu held that China was now facing two big problems. If 
prices are controlled within ten percent and the money supply is 
still kept tight, this will lead to a gloomy market which will 
in return result in an overly big drop in economic growth, 
greater difficulties to state-owned enterprises and the further 
deterioration of financial difficulties and employment problems. 
If the money supply is conducted in a more relaxed way, 
inflation will further worsen. 
  Mr. Qiu believed that at present, on the one hand, control 
of 
the overly fast growth of prices cannot be realized through 
strict control of the money demand, while on the other hand, 
help to state-owned enterprises cannot be made through putting 
too much money into them. The central government's 
macro-control policies should pay much attention to both price 
stability and economic growth and sustaining appropriate 
economic growth to sustain the stability of prices in the 
country. 
  He further pointed out that the country should control 
inflation by legal and necessary administrative means as well as 
through tackling market transaction disorder which cultivates 
the rampant rise of prices and illegal profit-making activities. 
At the same time, risk funds and reserve system for key 
materials and commodities and the protection system for low 
income earners must be established as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Qiu held that provided macro-control and regulation are 
handled well, the growth of the GDP value in the country will be 
about ten percent, that of investment in fixed assets by 35 
percent to 40 percent and that of retail prices by 16 percent to 
18 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- Sixty mayors and 
vice-mayors from medium- and large-sized cities in some 27 
provinces and autonomous regions as well as district heads and 
deputy heads from municipalities gathered together today in 
Beijing for a 50-day training course on socialist market economy 
theory. 
  The 18th study course for mayors, the first of which was 
held 
in October, 1983, is being jointly held by the Organizational 
Department of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of 
Construction and the China Association for Science and 
Technology. So far more than 1,000 mayors, vice-mayors and other 
officials have received such training. 
  At the opening ceremony for the class, the head of the 
leading team for the training of the mayors and Minister of 
Construction Mr. Hou Jie said that the current class would see 
dramatic adjustments with the emphasis on particular basic 
theories of the market economy based on increasing market 
economy knowledge and on the level of knowledge shown by the 
student mayors. 
  The main theme for this study involves the building of 
socialist theory with Chinese characteristics, the principle of 
market economy operation, the modern enterprise system, the 
situation of foreign economic relations and trade and its 
policies, reform of taxation, the restructuring of the financial 
system, monetary policies, the legal system for the market 
economy, the futures market, the securities market, the 
employment and labour market situation and relevant policies, 
the social security system, management discipline and leadership 
discipline, urban planning and construction, as well as 
comprehensive administration. During the current course, a 
three-way seminar attended by representatives from enterprise 
circles, government and theorists will be held in order to 
discuss important issues in the country's economic life at 
present. 
  Mayors of different cities have in recent years held 
exchanges with one another, making progress in their study of 
current economic knowledge. Following the establishment of the 
association of mayors in August, 1991, exchanges of this kind 
have tended to grow. The association of mayors will prepare for 
the convening of meetings on new rising cities, seminars on 
large cities attended by their mayors and social functions 
attended by female mayors for friendly exchanges. Exploratory 
visits to Germany by some mayors will also be organized this 
year.

Finland, Norway, and Austria. China's new regulations were 
under discussion last week in Guangzhou at the fourth national 
conference on quelling illegal trade activities in textiles. 
Although the laws have yet to emerge publicly, a top official 
with the foreign trade ministry said they demand stricter 
penalties for violators. Zhou Keren is the director for the 
trade administration department. 
  [Zhou speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] 
Zhou Keren says punishments range from issuing warnings to 
confiscation, and from fines to the suspension of the violator's 
export right. He says businesses should be brought to court if 
they have incurred serious losses for the country. Meanwhile 
the government is calling for assistance from all sides to check 
transshipments. The ministry official Zhou Keren says the 
government will award the larger export quota for enterprises 
which inform on illegal transshipments. In fact, four 
enterprises in coastal Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong provinces 
have already faced the tougher new penalties. Liaoning's 
(Shankou) company signed a contract last August with Hong Kong 
to export shorts and pajamas to Singapore. The products were 
made by three Chinese factories. However, they were labelled 
made in Fiji and sent to the United States late last year. The 
foreign trade ministry confiscated all the company's earnings 
from the trade deal, cut off all its export quotas of export 
textile, and deprived of its right to apply for such quotas in 
1994. The ministry official Zhou Keren says no cases of illegal 
transshipments occur occasionally in China [sentence as heard]. 
The problem in general is not as bad as the U.S. made out 
earlier this year. Back then, the transshipment issue sparked 
the dispute between China and the United States and forced both 
countries to compromise to insure continued trade. Finally Zhou 
Keren says exposure of malpractices will serve as a signal to 
potential violators that China is more resolved than ever to 
fight future illegal transshipments. [end recording]

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (CNS) -- In order to take joint 
action with the international community in controlling chemical 
pollution and minimizing losses resulting from such pollution, 
the National Environmental Protection Agency, the General 
Administration of Customs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation recently jointly issued regulations on 
environmental administration over the importing for the first 
time of chemicals and the importing and exporting of toxic 
chemicals. According to the regulations, from May 1 of this 
year, chemicals without registration for importation will not be 
allowed to be imported into China. 
  It is reported that over 38,000 varieties of chemicals are 
now produced in China and a great amount of chemicals are 
imported into the country and since there has been a lack of a 
complete set of regulations and necessary technological measures 
on their administration, some problems have been appearing in 
their production, use, transportation, storage and waste deposal 
[as received]. 
  According to the regulations, the National Environmental 
Protection Agency will be in charge of unified environmental 
supervision and administration over the import of chemicals and 
the import and export of toxic chemicals in line with the 
"London Standards" stated in an international pact. The agency 
will issue a list of toxic chemicals subject to prohibition or 
strict restriction by the country. Chemicals to be imported 
into the country and those chemicals included in the list of 
toxic chemicals will be subject to registration and approval 
procedures for a permit to be given for their importation and 
exportation. 
  The General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will be respectively in 
charge of the inspection of such chemicals and the examination 
and the making public to the outside world of the list.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts of the Work Report of the Jiangsu Provincial </F>
People's Higher People's Court Delivered by President Li Peiyou 
to the Second Session of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial People's 
Congress on 27 February 1994"] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  In 1993, under the leadership of their party committee and 
the supervision of the people's congress, and overseen and 
guided by the Supreme People's Court, courts at all levels in 
the province persistently used Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress as their guide, 
implemented the party's basic line, centered their work on 
economic construction, and played their adjudication role. As a 
result, major progress was achieved in various fields of work. 
A total of 222,080 cases were tried and concluded in the year, 
an increase of 11.01 percent over the previous year; of which, 
1,932 cases were concluded by the provincial higher people's 
court, up 10.34 percent. They played their due role in 
safeguarding social stability, promoting the struggle against 
corruption, and serving the interests of reform, opening up, and 
the establishment of a socialist market economy. The following 
is a report on major aspects of their work for your examination 
and deliberation: 
<H5>  1. Firmly Implementing the Policy of Dealing Heavy Blows to </H5>
Serious Crimes, Safeguarding Social Stability, and Cracking Down 
on Corruption To Create a Fine Environment for Reform, Opening 
up, and Economic Construction 
  For the past year, Jiangsu's situation in public order was 
stable. However, there were still factors threatening social 
stability and affecting economic development. Serious criminal 
offenses rose, major serious cases became more prominent, and 
social evils spread despite repeated bans. In light of this, 
courts at all levels consistently regarded the struggle against 
serious crimes as their primary task, made full use of their 
functions of dictatorship [zhuan zheng 1413 2398], and promptly 
launched intensive efforts to deal heavy blows to serious crimes 
and special drives to improve public order. A total of 23,331 
criminal cases of first instance was received during the year, 
22,066 cases were concluded, and 26,807 criminals were 
sentenced, roughly the same as the previous year. Of the 
convicted, 2,647 were sentenced to prison terms of more than 10 
years, life imprisonment, or death (including death with 
reprieve), up 3.64 percent over the previous year. This 
satisfied the demand to impose stricter sentences in accordance 
with the law. Courts also stepped up their efforts to target 
their campaign against prominent problems in public order. 
Particularly beginning last June, they swiftly implemented the 
guidelines of the third meeting of the Central Commission on 
Politics and Law and the provincial conference on judicial and 
public security work and launched a concentrated attack on 
serious crimes from June to September. A total of 7,045 
criminal cases endangering public order were tried and concluded 
in accordance with the law, and 8,666 criminals were convicted. 
Of the convicts, 499 were given sentences heavier than life 
imprisonment. Special efforts were made to crack down on major 
targets. During the four months, 4,409 culprits of serious 
crimes were punished, including gangsters and thugs in the 
transportation sector, key elements of criminal gangs, 
murderers, robbers, rapists, major ruffians, kidnappers who 
killed hostages, and major burglars. This effectively deflated 
the swollen arrogance of criminal elements and curbed the 
momentum of the outbreak of heinous crimes. 
  We decided to take investigating and handling major cases 
as the breakthrough point in dealing heavy blows to serious 
economic crimes and in promoting the deep-going development of 
the anticorruption struggle. During the first half of the year, 
the number of cases of economic crimes handled by people's 
courts declined by 51.14 percent compared with the same period 
in the previous year. Following the major arrangements made by 
the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee 
on launching struggles against corruption, people's courts at 
various levels stressed cracking down on economic crimes in the 
struggle against corruption. Taking the trial of major cases as 
the breakthrough point, people's courts strengthened efforts to 
crack down on crimes. In the second half of last year, the 
number of cases concluded increased significantly, increasing by 
206 percent as compared with that of the first half of the year. 
Various people's courts handled 1,753 cases of economic crimes 
of various kinds; concluded the trial of 1,595 cases; and passed 
sentence on 1,390 people, of which 21 were sentenced to life 
imprisonment and death (including suspension of execution). 
Various people's courts gave prominence to the trial of major 
and serious cases of crimes in enforcing macrocontrol and 
launching the anticorruption struggle, including cases of 
bribery, embezzlement, and smuggling. In the whole year, 
various people's courts handled 647 cases of serious economic 
crimes, involving more than 10,000 yuan in each case, and 
punished 672 people who received more than 10,000 yuan of 
illegal income per person. 
  While punishing criminals, people's courts at various levels 
also carried out the task of comprehensive management of social 
order. They vigorously strengthened the trial of civil cases, 
and concluded 98,684 cases of civil disputes in first instance, 
of which marriage and family disputes accounted for 53.17 
percent. They also made efforts to prevent aggravation of 
contradictions, and handled 1,719 cases to transform 
contradictions. They also strengthened the trial of 
administrative cases to maintain social security and state 
administrative order and to protect the lawful rights and 
benefits of citizens and legal persons. People's courts 
concluded the trial of 747 administative cases in the first 
instance. They improved procedures to facilitate the people's 
lodging complaints, seriously handled a large number of people's 
letters and visits, and promptly handled 3,976 cases of 
complaints lodged by the people. They actively handled cases of 
mitigation of punishment and parole, including 8,957 cases of 
mitigation of punishment and 892 cases of parole. Concerning 
crimes committed by juveniles, they attached importance to 
educating juveniles and handled 2,009 cases of crimes committed 
by 2,787 juveniles. They invited 613 people from educational, 
trade union, youth, and women's organizations to take part in 
adjudication. They further strengthened the establishment of 
juvenile courts. Thirteen peole's courts set up juvenile courts 
to provide all-out judicial protection for juveniles. 
<H5>  2. Employ the Function of Trial To Adjust Economic Relations </H5>
and Serve Macrocontrol and the Establishment of a Socialsit 
Market Economic Structure 
  Last year was a year of relatively fast economic development 
in this province and also a year of change from the old to new 
economic system. Using the function of adjudication to 
strengthen the adjustment of economic relations was a prominent 
task of the people's courts. Judging from the handling of 
various economic cases in the whole province, there were three 
special features: First, the number of cases related to the 
market economy increased. Various people's courts handled 85,926 
cases of economic disputes in the first instance, increasing by 
27.53 percent as compared with the previous year. Of this, the 
number of cases of disputes in procurement and marketing, loans 
and rentals, contract operation of enterprises, leasing 
operation of enterprises and compensatory trade contracts all 
rose by more than 50 percent. Second, the amount of money 
involved in those cases rose by a great extent. Various 
people's courts concluded the trial of 75,672 cases of economic 
disputes in the first instance, involving a total amount of 
5.025 billion yuan or 156.12 percent more than the total amount 
of money involved in those cases in the previous year. Third, 
new types of cases emerged constantly. Those special features 
and changes reflected the deepening of the reform of the 
economic structure and the development of the socialist market 
economy in this province. 
  Correct and prompt handling of cases closely related to 
strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control ensured the 
implementation of the policy of exercising macroeconomic 
regulation and control. After the Central Committee issued its 
Document No. 6 and after the provincial party committee held its 
economic conference in mid-July, people's courts in Jiangsu 
intensified their efforts in handling cases about macroeconomic 
regulation and control. From July to the end of the year, they 
finished examining 61,124 cases of this nature, including 21,074 
cases of economic disputes involving 2.319 billion yuan. 
People's courts especially intensified their efforts in 
handling disputes over securities, stocks, fund raising, bills, 
and loans -- problems occurring while putting banking operations 
in order -- and particularly cases concerning loan liquidation 
and collection, creditor's rights, and debts. People's courts 
also assisted enterprises to liquidate debts and helped 
enterprises, banks, and other units retrieve 1.033 billion yuan. 
  People's courts' efforts in regulating the market's economic 
relations promoted the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. People's courts stopped illegitimate 
competition through handling cases and protecting legitimate 
competition. We also strictly dealt with cases of producing and 
marketing counterfeit and inferior goods; censured infringement 
of patent rights, registered trademarks, and copyright as well 
as defamation of enterprises' reputation and names. We handled 
a total of 363 cases of this nature. People's courts in Jiangsu 
also intensified handling new cases occurring during the 
formation and development of various forms of markets. Our 
accomplishment in handling 5,078 cases concerning credit, 
securities, bills, interbanking loans, technology-related 
contracts, labor disputes, real estate, and other problems 
occurring in the financial, labor, technology, information, and 
real estate markets in 1993 expedited Jiangsu's market 
development. We also intensified our efforts in handling cases 
relevant to the replacement of state enterprises' operating 
mechanisms and our accomplishment in handling 9,546 cases 
concerning disputes over enterprises' contractual operations, 
stock system, partnership, merger, lease, and sales pushed these 
enterprises to the market. People's courts in Jiangsu also kept 
pace with rural reforms and served rural economic development. 
Our efforts in handling 34,303 cases on rural contracts, 
disputes between village and town enterprises, and socialized 
services in rural areas ensured the revitalization of all 
economic sectors in rural areas. Earnestly implementing the 
central policy of reducing peasants' burdens, we tried 9,736 
cases about peasants' excessive burdens. Our efforts in handling 
economic cases involving foreign nationals or countrymen in Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan facilitated the development of Jiangsu's 
export-oriented economy. We accepted a total of 44 of these new 
cases in 1994, or 38 more than those accepted in 1992. We fully 
exercised our judicial jurisdiction and our impartial 
arbitration protected the legitimate rights and interests of 
both sides. Attaching great importance to handling disputes 
among foreign-funded enterprises, we finished handling 444 cases 
of this nature, which involved 106 million yuan. By doing this 
we created a good judicial environment for foreign businessmen. 
We also prompted the government to change its administrative 
functions by actively proceeding with the handling of 
administrative cases closely related to the market economy. We 
finished handling 461 administrative cases regarding business 
management, tax collection, banking management, urban 
construction, foreign exchange control, and environmental 
protection; and we supported administrative organs in 
controlling and stopping unwarranted fee levies, prorations, and 
fines as well as infringement of enterprises' operating autonomy. 
  We intensified law enforcement and made continual efforts in 
enforcing verdicts that had been pronounced. In 1993, people's 
courts at all levels enforced verdicts on 79,398 cases, or 86.32 
percent of all verdicts. Not only was this 12.84 percentage 
points higher than that a year ago as well as the highest in 
recent years, but it also exceeded the 80 percent target. The 
provincial higher people's court also intensified its efforts in 
providing people's courts in Jiangsu with macroscopic guidance 
and in coordinating the handling of major, complex, and 
difficult cases. Thanks to support from local party committees, 
people's congresses, and governments, people's courts in various 
parts of Jiangsu launched joint or special campaigns of varying 
sizes between regions, provinces, or cities to enforce verdicts; 
and we also made constant efforts in exploring and improving 
enforcement methods to improve enforcement efficiency. 
  3. Vigorously Explore Ways To Reform the Work of Law 
Courts, Persist in Strict Law Enforcement, and Comprehensively 
Raise Judicial Levels 
  In the face of conspicuous contradictions -- increasingly 
heavy tasks, progressively increasing number of various cases 
year after year, and a serious shortage of judicial personnel -- 
law courts at all levels vigorously explored ways to reform 
methods of hearing civil and economic cases and to improve work 
efficiency. Focusing attention on reforming court trials, they 
further stressed a litigant's responsibility to produce 
evidence, thereby shifting the focus of judicial activities from 
a venue outside the court to the court and from conducting 
investigations outside the court for verification of evidence to 
producing and questioning evidence during trial. Many law 
courts experimented with the method of directly opening a court 
session after a case was placed on file in accordance with the 
law; their experiment enabled our reform of judicial methods to 
take a step forward. 
  The economic disputes mediation center enjoyed new 
development of its work. Giving convenience to its clients by 
doing a quick and highly efficient job, it solved 9,694 cases of 
economic disputes involving a total amount of 1,237 million yuan 
through mediation. The figures posted an increase of 209 and 363 
percent, respectively, over the previous year. The mediation 
center further improved its standardization. 
  Law courts at all levels further enhanced their 
consciousness 
of law enforcement, cultivated the mentality of "giving top 
priority to quality," and strived to make every case they 
handled pass the examination of history. In particular, they 
made sure that all big, important cases they handled become 
"iron [incontestable] cases." Sixty defendants in criminal cases 
were pronounced not guilty in accordance with the law. They 
insisted on conducting public trials; public trials of 97.94 
percent of various cases were conducted by law courts across the 
province. They further improved their internal mechanism for 
law enforcement; established and improved various systems for 
handling cases; and paid close attention to their 
implementation. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court 
drew up "Interim Provisions on Investigating and Determining the 
Responsibility for Cases Which Have Been Given Wrong Verdicts." 
The provisions played an important role in ensuring strict law 
enforcement after they went into effect in the whole province. 
A total of nine cases and nine persons were investigated for 
handling cases in violation of the law in the whole year. 
  We strengthened supervision over court trials and improved 
guidance for judicial work. When law courts at the higher level 
discovered mistakes in the court decisions pronouced by those at 
the lower level, they resolutely corrected them in accordance 
with the law. In the whole year, law courts at the higher level 
wound up a total of 11,086 various cases in the second instance; 
they changed court decisions pronounced on 1,938 cases by those 
at the lower level or requested that a trial be conducted again 
for some of them. We conscientiously handled cases lodged by 
procuratorial organs in protest of verdicts rendered, and 
corrected verdicts which were indeed wrong in accordance with 
the law. We wound up a total of 60 cases protesting verdicts 
given, and changed the verdicts for 32 cases or requested that a 
trial be conducted again for some of them. The Jiangsu 
Provincial Higher People's Court persisted in conducting survey 
and study of the new situations and new problems confronting 
judicial work under the conditions of a market economy, and 
improved job-related guidance for courts at the lower level. It 
drew up a total of 13 various standardized documents suitable 
for legal guidance. 
  4. Vigorously Strengthen the Building of the 
Contingents of Personnel of Law Courts and Lay a Sound 
Foundation in the Grass-Roots Units To Guarantee That Judicial 
Work Is Carried Out Effectively 
  In compliance with the new requirements on the contingents 
of 
cadres raised by our reform and opening up and by the new 
situation under a socialist market economy, people's courts at 
all levels persisted in attaching equal importance to judicial 
work and the building of their contingents of working personnel; 
comprehensively enhanced the political integrity of cadres and 
police and improved their professional quality; and achieved 
marked successes in building their contingents of working 
personnel. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court 
commended 19 advanced collectives and 47 advanced individuals 
throughout the year. Among them, 13 units earned a collective 
award of merit, second class, and four individuals award of 
merit, first class. 
  We improved ideological and political work by making 
education in the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics our central task. In particular, after the 
publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher 
People's Court issued a special circular on plans for study. 
Law courts in the whole province looked upon the task as an 
important one for building ideology and for theoretical 
education and handled it accordingly; they implemented Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's basic thinking as well as the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in 
various court tasks by closely integrating their implementation 
with the actual conditions of judicial work. They aggressively 
launched the anticorruption drive to promote the building of a 
clean and honest government. Law courts across the province 
conscientiously carried out the plans adopted by the Second 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the 
Seventh Plenary Session of the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline 
Inspection Commission, and the Supreme People's Court on 
launching the anticorruption drive; conducted intensive study; 
and checked up on efforts to put banking operations in order, to 
help enterprises liquidate debts, to make corrections, and so 
forth. In the second half of the year, we organized law courts 
across the province to conduct a general inspection of law 
enforcement and promotion of a clean and honest government with 
the anticorruption drive playing the dominant role. While 
urging law courts at all levels to conduct self-inspection and 
to correct themselves, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's 
Court and all intermediate people's courts assigned a total of 
110 persons to form inspection teams to check up on law courts 
at two levels in 11 cities. The implementation of the "five 
prohibitions" ruled by the central authorities and the "three 
requirements" raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee 
was made possible through the anticorruption drive and through 
the general inspection of law enforcement and promotion of a 
clean and honest government. The 61 enterprises run by law 
courts in all areas already either had their business operating 
licenses revoked or terminated their connection with law courts; 
all 37 personnel who had bought and sold stocks completed the 
procedures for the transfer of their stocks; the two persons who 
had accepted money and negotiable securities worth a total of 
1,600 yuan offered to them as a present returned what they had 
taken; and money accepted from convicts as a pledge for their 
probation and as fees for their exemption from re-education were 
all returned. Law courts investigated and punished 34 cadres 
and police who had violated the law and discipline. 
  We persisted in strict management of the court and 
conscientiously changed our work style. After the first session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress, the Provincial 
People's Higher Court, based on the views and proposals put 
forward by the people's deputies, promptly issued the "Circular 
on Earnestly Drawing People's Deputies' Views To Further Improve 
Judicial Work" to courts across the province, putting forward 
solutions. In the light of views voiced during the re-election 
of the people's congresses on judicial work, courts at all 
levels unfolded widespread activities to strengthen and reform 
their work as well as to rectify their work style to bring about 
marked improvements in law enforcement and work style. Courts 
in such cities as Yancheng, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and Lianyungang 
took the initiative to support and cooperate with people's 
deputies in their appraisal activities, earnestly examining and 
rectifying themselves and implementing rectification and reform 
measures one-by-one in accordance with the deputies' views. 
  We persisted in integrating academic education with 
on-the-job training, strengthening the upbringing of qualified 
judicial personnel proficient in the four areas of law, 
economics, market, and foreign language. Over the past year, 36 
more cadres obtained graduate or post-graduate degrees, 290 
judicial personnel were awarded the legal profession certificate 
of the part-time Law University under the court, raising the 
provincial ratio of court cadres and policemen with 
qualifications in higher education to 52 percent. We conducted 
eight provincial on-the-job professional training courses, 
training 748 key personnel from the judicial profession. 
  We paid serious attention to the basic building of the grass 
roots to further strengthen the work of the people's court. In 
line with the principle of replenishing the grass roots, we set 
up 12 more people's courts to bring the total number of people's 
courts in the province to 566. We further improved the work of 
the leading group for people's court work to strengthen 
leadership; conducted regular investigations and study to sum up 
and exchange the people's courts' work and development 
experiences and promptly resolve existing difficulties and 
problems; strengthened professional guidance and upgraded the 
professional skill of people's court cadres by setting up 
contact stations and organizing joint handling of cases and 
court sessions for the purpose of professional discussion and 
study, rotational professional training, etc.; unfolded 
activities for standardization in the people's courts and 
established and improved various work and management systems; 
and vigorously conducted activities to produce advanced and 
excellent work performance. The provincial people's higher 
court organized a provincial appraisal of advanced people's 
courts, commending 42 people's courts and awarding the 
collective merit citation, second class, to three people's 
courts. During the year, people's courts across the province 
handled all kinds of cases -- 100,051 in all, accouting for 
50.74 percent of all court cases in the province, and mediated 
and dealt with 10,464 simple disputes. 
  The major problems and difficulties in judicial work in 1993 
were: A small number of courts lacked initiative in giving full 
play to the judicial function of serving the establishment and 
development of the socialist market economic system; loose law 
enforcement continued to exist, with quite a number of local 
courts emphasizing entities over procedures, poorly handling 
some cases, taking excessively long periods to settle some 
cases, and impairing the social effect of case handling; under 
pronounced local as well as departmental protectionism, the 
difficult situation in enforcing court decisions and rulings on 
financial and civil cases was not fundamentally changed; 
unhealthy social practices interfered with judicial work rather 
seriously, with a handful of cadres and policemen failing to 
withstand the challeges of reform, opening up to the outside 
world, and the market economy and violating the law and 
discipline more frequently and seriously than in past years; 
quite a number of courts, especially those in northern Jiangsu, 
faced a shortage of case handling funds and continued to be 
weighed down by the heavy task of building courts at two local 
levels which restrained judicial work to a certain degree. 
  Fellow deputies! In 1994, courts at all levels in the 
province will persistently follow the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and will stress the proper 
trial of serious and major cases and the improvement of the way 
of trial, in further, comprehensively strengthening various 
judicial work, strictly enforcing the law, upgrading the 
administration of justice, and serving to safeguard social 
stability, promoting clean administration, and accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system. We will 
continue to carry out the struggle of "dealing heavy blows to 
serious crimes" to sternly crack down on serious criminal acts 
and economic crimes; give further play to the judicial function, 
and vigorously regulate economic relationships to better serve 
the socialist market economy; deepen and improve court reform 
and persist in strict law enforcement; and conscientiously 
strengthen efforts to beef up the ranks to upgrade the caliber 
and standard of law enforcement. In this new year, we will 
strive to make a mark in dealing heavy blows to serious crimes, 
produce results in dealing with serious and major cases, make 
great progress in regulating economic relationships, and 
comprehensively upgrade the administration of justice. I 
believe people's courts at all levels across the province will 
certainly be able to accomplish the various judicial tasks the 
new period has entrusted to them, by working under the 
leadership of the party committees and the supervision of the 
people's congresses and their standing committees and by relying 
on the support of the vast number of people across the province 
and the unity and struggle of all their cadres and policemen.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report on the implementation of Jiangsu's </F>
1993 budget and the draft 1994 budget by Shi Xuedao, director of 
the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department] 
  [Text] 1. Implementation of the Budget for 1993 
  In 1993, people throughout Jiangsu, under the direct 
leadership of the provincial party committee, studied in depth 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his southern 
inspection tour along with the 14th CPC National Congress 
guidelines on seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
up wider, strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation 
and control, readjusting economic structure, accelerating 
scientific and technological progress, and raising economic 
efficiency, thereby promoting rapid and sound development of the 
economy. Finance and taxation departments at all levels in 
Jiangsu earnestly consolidated financial and taxation order, 
reinforced financial and economic discipline, improved the 
collection and management of tax revenue, promoted financial and 
tax reform, and made energetic efforts to ensure revenue, 
thereby overfulfilling the task of revenue. They also actively 
allocated funds for various financial expenditures and basically 
ensured funds needed for economic construction and development 
of social undertakings in Jiangsu. 
  The revenue budget deliberated and approved by the first 
session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 16.435 
billion yuan. According to preliminary statistics, total revenue 
came to 22.13 billion yuan, or 134.65 percent of the budgeted 
figure. The state's decision to raise the business tax rate by 
two percentage points added 192 million yuan to Jiangsu's 
revenue budget. In the second half of the year, the state 
tasked the province to strive to overfulfill the budgeted 
revenue by 1.8 billion yuan. As a result of these adjustments, 
the budgeted revenue was 18.427 billion yuan. Thus, 1993 revenue 
amounted to 120.1 percent of the adjusted budgeted figure, up 
6.899 billion yuan or 45.3 percent from the previous year. The 
big growth in Jiangsu's revenue in 1993 can be attributed 
primarily to the following factors: First, rapid economic 
growth and thriving markets brought about increased revenue. 
Second, we earnestly implemented the central authorities' No. 6 
document and the guidelines of the national financial work 
conference and resolutely curbed tax reductions and exemptions 
for taxpayers in temporary difficulty and the contracting of 
turnover tax, thereby conspicuously reducing revenue losses. 
Third, we strengthened tax collection and management of 
individual industrial and commercial units by launching a 
general taxation and accounting inspection, thereby increasing 
revenue. Fourth, implementation of the state policy to hike the 
business tax rate also resulted in increased revenue. Moreover, 
because of natural disasters in 1991, base figures for Jiangsu's 
revenue for 1992 were low, resulting in a relatively big rise in 
the 1993 revenue. 
  Of the total revenue, tax receipts came to 22.005 billion 
yuan, 122.67 percent of the adjusted budgeted amount, and 7.456 
billion yuan or 51.25 percent more than the previous year. Of 
these, receipts from industrial and commercial taxes totaled 
21.273 billion yuan, 123.63 percent of the adjusted budgeted 
amount, and 7.497 billion yuan or 54.42 percent more than the 
previous year. Receipts from enterprises were minus 840 million 
yuan, as compared to minus 289 million yuan of the previous 
year. Revenue from other sources came to 220 million yuan, 
116.4 percent of the budgeted amount, and 50 million yuan or 
28.96 percent more than the previous year. Revenue from special 
projects amounted to 563 million yuan, 116.63 percent of the 
budgeted figure, and 57 million yuan or 11.2 percent increase 
from the previous year. The portion of the fund for key energy 
and communications construction projects retained by the local 
government came to 71 million yuan, 50.71 percent of the 
budgeted figure, and a decrease of 52 million yuan or 42.38 
percent from the previous year. The portion of state budget 
regulating fund retained by the local government was 111 million 
yuan, 61.67 percent of the budgeted amount, and a decrease of 60 
million yuan or 34.87 percent from the previous year. 
  Budget expenditures for 1993 approved at the first session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress amounted to 9.787 
billion yuan. After adjustment -- adding funds transferred from 
the previous year, special funds appropriated from the central 
treasury, funds allocated by local authorities from 
overfulfilled budget revenues, and funds transferred from other 
sources earmarked for expenditure -- the total budgeted 
expenditures came to 18.794 billion yuan. Based on initial 
figures, actual expenditures for the year totaled 16.258 billion 
yuan, an increase of 3.673 billion yuan, or 29.18 percent, over 
the previous year. The relatively large increase in 
expenditures was largely due to implementation of the contracted 
financial responsibility system, which stipulates that 
localities, after fulfilling their contracted financial 
responsibilities, may spend more if they get more revenue. 
Thus, large increases in local revenue inevitably brought with 
them corresponding increases in expenditures. Major 
expenditures that registered increases were: investment in 
technological transformation of state-owned enterprises and 
village and town enterprises; investment in agriculture, 
education, science and technology, urban infrastructure, and 
social welfare; and subsidies to workers through the increase of 
subsidies standards. The major categories of expenditure were 
implemented as follows: 1) Expenditure for capital construction 
amounted to 955 million yuan, an increase of 234 million yuan or 
32.53 percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of 
enterprises and for technological transformation amounted to 
1.360 billion yuan, an increase of 1.101 billion yuan or 4.25 
times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and 
technology amounted to 240 million yuan, an increase of 96 
million yuan or 67.07 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of 
agriculture and for water conservancy projects related to 
agriculture and forestry amounted to 1.798 billion yuan, an 
increase of 709 million yuan or 65.11 percent. 5) Expenditure 
for urban maintenance and construction amounted to 1.233 billion 
yuan, an increase of 540 million yuan or 77.97 percent. 6) 
Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health 
amounted to 4.984 billion yuan, an increase of 1.156 billion 
yuan or 30.19 percent, of which 3.069 billion yuan were spent on 
education, an increase of 738 million yuan or 31.65 percent. 7) 
Expenditure for administration, procuratorial, public security, 
and judicial undertakings amounted to 2.255 billion yuan, an 
increase of 580 million yuan or 34.62 percent. 8) Expenditure 
for pensions for the disabled and for families of diseased and 
for social welfare and relief amounted to 478 million yuan, 
about the same as the previous year. This was largely because 
some of the relief funds for 1991 disasters were established in 
1992, making the base figures higher for 1993. 9) Expenditure 
for price subsidies amounted to 597 million yuan, a decrease of 
1.694 billion yuan or 73.95 percent. This was mainly because 
the state reduced subsidies to workers for increased grain and 
edible oil purchase prices and for price differentials in the 
purchase of special grain reserves. In 1993, following the 
lifting of controls on grain, edible oil, and coal prices, the 
state gave workers appropriate amounts of subsidies. Some of 
the subsidies were borne by enterprises, while others were 
allocated from the budget. 
  Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented quite 
successfully. It is expected that revenues not only will be 
able to cover the year's expenditures, they will also be able to 
make up for some of the past deficits, thereby reversing the 
perennial deficits registered since 1989. 
  The 1993 provincial level budget was implemented as follows: 
  Provincial-level expenditures approved at the first session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress totalled 2.047 
billion yuan. After adding additional funds transferred from the 
previous year's balance and special funds appropriated from the 
central treasury and deducting special funds allocated to cities 
and counties, the adjusted expenditures totalled 3.040 billion 
yuan. According to initial figures, provincial expenditures for 
the year were 2.528 billion yuan, a decrease of 1.144 billion 
yuan, or 31.16 percent over the previous year. This was largely 
because of the reduced subsidies to workers to cover grain and 
edible oil price increases and to cover price differentials in 
the purchase of special grain reserves. The major categories of 
expenditures were as follows: 1) Capital construction totaled 
602 million yuan, an increase of 68 million yuan or 12.81 
percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of 
enterprises and technological transformation amounted to 82 
million yuan spent, a decrease of 19 million yuan or 18.53 
percent. The decrease was largely the result of one-time loan 
discounts for the technological transformation of large and 
medium- sized enterprises made in 1992. If this factor is 
excluded from consideration, the budget would have shown an 
increase of 6 million yuan or 11.76 percent. 3) Expenditure for 
three categories of science and technology amounted to 91 
million yuan, an increase of 16 million yuan or 22.01 percent. 
4) Expenditure spent in support of agriculture and on water 
conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry 
amounted to 217 million yuan, an increase of 49 million yuan or 
28.95 percent. 5) Expenditure for culture, education, science, 
and public health totaled 673 million yuan, an increase of 128 
million yuan or 23.48. 6) Expenditure spent on pensions for the 
disabled and families of the diseased and on social welfare and 
relief amounted to 15 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 million 
yuan or 9.57 percent. 7) Expenditure on administration, 
procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings 
amounted to 159 million yuan, an increase of 24 million yuan or 
17.57 percent. 8) price subsidies totaled 324 million yuan, a 
decrease of 1.513 billion yuan or 82.35 percent. 
  The provincial level budget was basically balanced with 
some surplus. 
  To better implement the 1993 budget, we put emphasis on the 
following aspects: 
  (1) Conscientiously carrying out the CPC Central Committee's 
policy of strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and 
strictly observing the "three rules." 
  Last year's Central Document No. 6 put forward the policy of 
strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and set 
precise demands for financial work. Last July, leading cadres 
of the State Council put forward three rules: tightening finance 
and taxation order, strictly placing tax exemptions and 
reductions under control, and strictly controlling financial 
deficits. Various localities in Jiangsu vigorously carried out 
the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council, effectively managed financial matters and tax revenues 
according to law, and improved the provincial financial 
situation. First, they persisted in managing tax revenues 
according to law. In accordance with the CPC Central 
Committee's guidelines, governments at all levels and taxation 
departments earnestly checked various regulations governing tax 
exemptions and reductions and governing the budget regulatory 
fund and energy and communications construction funds formulated 
by localities themselves. All regulations established without 
proper authorization were suspended. Examinations and approvals 
of temporary and contingency tax exemptions and reductions were 
halted. Second, they continued the general inspection of tax 
revenues and financial matters. By the end of last year, the 
amount of money found and seized under tax evasion and other 
illegal acts reached 626 million yuan. Out of 441 million yuan 
to be turned over to the treasury, 417 million yuan, or 94.6 
percent, was actually turned over to the treasury. Third, they 
intensified their efforts in collecting, managing, and 
inspecting tax revenues from individual businessmen. In 1993, 
tax revenues from individual businessmen totalled 2.708 billion 
yuan, up 973 million yuan or 56.01 percent. 
  (2) Vigorously raising and allocating funds to support 
economic development. 
  Over the past year, under the leadership of party committees 
and governments at the corresponding levels, finance and 
taxation departments at all levels tried every possible means to 
raise and allocate funds and made vigorous efforts to promote 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the provincial 
economy. 
  To develop industrial production, finance and taxation 
departments at all levels, first, vigorously transformed their 
functions and created conditions to help enterprises change 
their operating mechanisms. Having trained a large number of 
qualified personnel and made sufficient preparations, on 1 July, 
finance and taxation departments smoothly implemented the 
"Enterprise Accounting Norms," the "General Rules for Enterprise 
Financial Affairs," and the accounting systems for different 
professions. This granted more decision-making power to 
enterprises and enabled enterprises to develop on their own. 
Second, they promoted technical transformation. The provincial 
government allocated 13.9 million yuan to 19 small enterprises 
that produce nitrogenous fertilizer and encouraged them to 
conduct technological transformation to conserve energy by 
changing coal consumption methods. The provincial government 
also provided loan discounts worth 25 million yuan to 83 key 
technological transformation projects. Third, province 
financial institutions continued to increase investment in 
production that is in line with the state industrial policy and 
structure and in enterprises that produce high technology 
products, products with high added-value, exchange-earning 
export products, and products in great demand on the market. 
Province financial institutions granted these enterprises small 
loans worth 155 million yuan. Better economic efficiency was 
realized. 
  In developing agricultural production, governments at all 
levels conscientiously carried out various measures promoting 
agriculture that were launched by the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council and made efforts to increase agricultural 
investment. First, they earnestly implemented the "Agricultural 
Law of the PRC" and the "PRC's Law Governing Agrotechnology 
Popularization," and increased investment in agriculture. 
Second, they rationally adjusted the utilization structure of 
funds supporting agriculture and ensured the smooth progress of 
key agricultural projects. In the past three years, they 
invested 173 million yuan of construction funds through various 
channels to quicken the construction of unified seed supply 
projects at township level across the province. To promote 
infrastructure construction of irrigation, financial 
institutions at all levels vigorously collected 400 million yuan 
for the flood prevention security fund. Of this, 82 million 
yuan was collected by province financial departments. Third, to 
continue efforts to develop the economy in poverty-stricken 
areas and change their outlook, province financial departments 
allocated special aid-to-the-poor funds worth 22.93 million 
yuan, supporting a total of 130 economic development projects to 
help 61 poor towns, townships, and old revolutionary bases such 
as Maoshan and Huangqiao develop their economies. 
  (3) Increasing input into social undertakings to promote 
their development. 
  In 1993, finance departments at all levels across Jiangsu 
energetically raised and allocated funds and made overall and 
rational arrangements to promote the development of various 
social undertakings. While ensuring regular expenditures, 
finance departments allocated funds to help institutions and 
units solve a number of outstanding problems. For example, the 
provincial government allocated a portion of the fund to poor 
counties in northern Jiangsu to pay teachers' salaries; it 
allocated 17.6 million yuan to support the construction of 
laboratories, specialized departments, and teachers' living 
quarters in a number of institutes of higher learning as well as 
key research institutes affiliated with the provincial 
government; it allocated 11 million yuan and, together with 
funds raised by localities through various sources, repaired and 
built health clinics for 100 towns and townships in poor areas; 
it continued to allocate funds totaling 2.5 million yuan to 
improve drinking water in rural areas and, by raising funds in 
different sectors, improved drinking water for 2 million rural 
residents; it allocated a 6.59 million yuan special fund to 
support 25 key projects to fight snail fever in Yangzhong, 
Haian, Yixing, and other areas, and completely eliminated snail 
fever in three pilot areas of Dantu, Jiangpu, and Hanjiang. 
Finance departments at various levels also allocated necessary 
funds for housing construction for intellectuals and for sports, 
culture, and radio and television facilities. 
  (4) Launching the anticorruption drive and earnestly 
screening wanton collection of fees. 
  In line with the provincial party committee's plans to fight 
corruption, a campaign to screen the wanton collection of fees 
was launched throughout the province and achieved interim 
results in 1993. According to statistics, 2,266 of the 2,409 
fees charged in Jiangsu were abolished through the campaign, 
thereby lightening the burdens on enterprises and people in 
general and reassuring the public. 
  Despite achievements in financial work in 1993, quite a few 
problems remain. They are reflected largely in the following: 
Regulatory capability at the provincial level was relatively 
weak; even though expenditures and revenues were balanced for 
the fiscal year, a handful of counties (cities) in northern 
Jiangsu continued to suffer deficits and were unable to pay 
teachers and administrators from time to time; failure to 
improve the economic efficiency of some enterprises resulted in 
aggravating deficits; and while conducting financial management, 
we failed to exercise effective supervision over waste and 
extravagance in enterprises. 
<H5>  2. The Draft Budget for 1994 </H5>
  Financial revenues and expenditures in 1994 will be 
affected, 
to a certain extent, by the largest number of reform programs 
ever to be launched in China this year. As the economy and work 
in other fields of endeavor develop, more input from the budget 
will be needed for expenditures. Newly increased revenues will 
be difficult to satisfy the needs of newly increased 
expenditures, and localities will continue to face extremely 
tight budgets. In accordance with the guidelines of the 14th 
CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, the guiding principle for the 1994 budget 
is: To subordinate to and serve the overall interests -- put 
forth by the central authorities -- of "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
ensuring stability;" to actively implement fiscal and tax reform 
to ensure the smooth progress of reform measures; to concentrate 
efforts on raising funds and strictly collecting and managing 
tax payments; and to strive to strike a balance between revenues 
and expenditures by persisting in doing things within the limit 
of financial capabilities, improving the management of 
expenditures, readjusting their pattern, ensuring key 
expenditures, and reducing routine expenditures. 
  In accordance with the above principles, the objective of 
national economic and social development for 1994, as well as 
the program for fiscal restructuring toward establishing a tax 
assignment system, the 1994 provincial budget is drafted as 
follows: 
  (1) Fiscal revenue budget 
  Based on the circumstances of economic development in the 
province, provincial revenue is projected to grow by 7 percent, 
reaching 23.527 billion yuan in 1994, if calculated according to 
the parameters before implementation of the tax assignment 
system. Calculated according to the parameters after the tax 
assignment system is implemented -- i.e. after deducting all the 
consumption tax revenue and 75 percent of the value-added tax 
revenue to be turned in to central authorities and after 
allowing for other adjustment factors -- the 1994 provincial 
revenue is budgeted at 0.638 billion yuan, up 9.53 percent over 
the corresponding amount calculated the previous year. Various 
itemized revenues are budgeted as follows: (I) Tax revenues are 
to total 11.476 billion yuan, an increase of 1.165 billion yuan 
or 11.3 percent over the previous year. These include 
industrial and commercial tax revenues totaling 9.126 billion 
yuan, up 924 million yuan or 11.27 percent. (II) Loss subsidies 
[bu tie fu shu 5943 6317 6298 2422] to state-owned enterprises 
are to total 1.728 billion yuan, up 165 million yuan over the 
previous year largely due to a rise in policy-related subsidies 
for enterprises' losses. (III) Other incomes are to total 250 
million yuan, up 13 million yuan or 5.33 percent from the 
previous year. (IV) Income derived from contributions to 
special funds is to be 290 million yuan, an increase of 6 
million yuan or 1.95 percent over the previous year. (V) Income 
derived from contributions to development funds for key energy 
and communications projects is to be 30 million yuan, down 41 
million yuan or 57.63 percent from the previous year. Income 
derived from contributions to the budget regulatory fund is to 
be 40 million yuan, down 71 million yuan or 64.1 percent. The 
decrease in contributions to these two funds is a result of the 
abolition of mandatory contributions by state-owned enterprises 
beginning this year. (VI) Income derived from additional fees 
for education is to be 280 million yuan, up 19 million yuan or 
7.37 percent over the previous year. 
  (2) Fiscal expenditure budget 
  After adding to the budgeted fiscal revenue for 1994 the 
consumption and value-added taxes to be returned by the central 
authorities based on the 1993 base figures and deducting from it 
the revenues turned in, according to the original procedures, to 
the central authorities in the form of special-fund 
contributions or progressive contributions based on the 
contracted financial responsibility system, the province's 
expendable fund for 1994 comes to 14.6 billion yuan -- an 
increase of 4.813 billion yuan or 49.18 percent over the 
previous year -- all of which will be allocated to budgeted 
expenditures. The 1994 expenditure budget is much larger than 
that of 1993 mainly because extra revenue for 1993 was not 
included in the fiscal revenue budget formulated at the 
beginning of that year, coupled with a certain growth in fiscal 
revenue for 1994 itself. 
  Major expenditures are budgeted as follows: 
  1) Expenditure for capital construction accounts for 556 
million yuan, an increase of 151 million yuan or 37.33 percent 
from the previous year's budget. 2) Expenditure for tapping the 
potential of enterprises and technological transformation 
accounts for 705 million yuan, an increase of 519 million yuan 
or 2.79 times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science

  3. Deepen Financial and Taxation Reform, Promote 
Economic Development, and Strive To Successfully Accomplish the 
1994 Budget 
  1994 is a crucial year for reform and development. To 
accomplish and overfulfill the task in implementing this year's 
budget, we will work effectively in the following main areas: 
  (1) Earnestly implement the plan for financial and tax 
system reform. Ensuring smooth implementation and achieving the 
expected results in financial and tax reform measures is this 
year's central task. Therefore, we must do a realistically good 
job in the following three aspects. First, we must actively and 
firmly promote tax system reform, study and formulate specific 
implementation details, as well as establish a tax system and 
operating mechanism that corresponds with the demand of 
development of the socialist market economy. We must strictly 
enforce the new tax law and strengthen tax collection management 
to reduce revenue losses for a steady growth in revenue. 
Second, we must effectively implement the financial system of 
separate tax collections for the province and localities. We 
must arouse the enthusiasm of localities and gradually regulate 
financial distribution as well as ensure that the province 
financial authorities retain certain financial regulation 
capabilities at the same time. Further, we will give 
appropriate assistance to a small number of localities with 
actual difficulties so as to promote coordinated economic 
development in various localities. Third, we must do a good job 
in reforming the enterprise profit distribution system. 
Beginning this year, income tax collected will be based on the 
specified uniform tax rates without exceptions, and the contract 
method of submitting enterprise profits is abolished. Finance 
and taxation departments at all levels must earnestly publicize 
and explain this year's three major financial and tax reform 
measures, as well as forge a uniform understanding and work for 
the overall task to ensure smooth implementation of these 
measures. 
  (2) Impose strict control in tax collection and management 
to ensure that the task is accomplished and overfulfilled. As 
this is the first year for implementing the new financial and 
tax system, there is significant meaning in accomplishing and 
overfulfilling this year's task in financial and tax collection. 
This is because, first, this is a crucial year for promoting 
and achieving key breakthroughs in the reform of China's 
economic system. The financial and tax system reform will prove 
decisive in various reforms. Financial and tax reform as well 
as economic development and social stability must be successful 
to accomplish and overfulfill this year's task in revenue 
collection. Second, localities must increase their incomes 
while maintaining the financial capability that they have 
already achieved. Third, because expenditures for this year 
have increased, increased revenues are necessary to meet 
essential expenditures. Therefore, we must do our utmost to 
build up income sources, uphold law enforcement in tax control, 
improve the collection and management of taxes, and undertake 
vigorous efforts to increase revenues. All localities must 
fulfill the task in revenue collection, and those with good 
income sources must strive to overfulfill their collections. 
  (3) Promote economic development. In accordance with the 
demand of the provincial economic development plan, we must 
uphold the strategic principle of upholding the role of the 
foundation of the national economy, stressing industrial 
development, and vigorously developing tertiary industry in this 
year's task of promoting economic development with financial 
capability. First, we must do an active good job in supporting 
agricultural undertakings with financial resources. Jiangsu 
will increase an investment of 10 million yuan in water 
conservancy construction and appropriate spending for other 
agricultural undertakings. The entire province must strive to 
collect for the agricultural development fund, food risk fund, 
anti-flood and security fund, as well as the newly introduced 
land value appreciation tax. It is necessary to raise funds by 
all means to increase investment in agriculture. The funds 
should be invested and utilized in key areas, primarily in 
constructing agricultural infrastructures, supporting commodity 
grain production, building high-yield cotton growing bases, 
implementing comprehensive agricultural development projects, 
and developing comprehensive trade, industry, and agricultural 
enterprises, as well as constructing agricultural service 
systems. It is necessary to effectively develop the "shopping 
basket" project to increase non-staple food supply in market and 
bring market prices under control. 
  Second, we must actively experiment in the modern 
enterprise system and reform the state-owned enterprise 
shareholding system. We must promptly study and handle 
financial issues that crop up during the reform process. Third, 
we must appropriately increase investment in science and 
technology, improve the financial subsidy method, quicken 
scientific and technological progress, promote enterprise 
product mix and industrial restructuring, assist enterprises in 
turning losses into profits, and strive to raise economic 
efficiency. Fourth, we must support governments at all levels, 
departments, and enterprise units in every possible way in 
making full use of their conditions and advantages to vigorously 
initiate and develop tertiary industry and in building up local 
financial resources. Fifth, we must continue to ensure sound 
financial foundations for enterprises and assist enterprises in 
developing sound internal financial control systems, as well as 
further implement the general financial rules, accounting 
principles, and branch accounting system for enterprises. 
  (4) Implement rational plans for various expenditures and 
realistically strengthen spending control. In this year's 
budget, it is necessary to implement wage reform for enterprise 
units and ensure the funds needed for key spending in 
agriculture, science, and education, as well as for the 26 
practical projects the Jiangsu government will undertake this 
year, apart from imposing strict control over other routine 
expenditures. Financial departments at all levels must bring 
into play the spirit of arduous struggle and thrift, oppose 
extravagance and waste, strive to increase income while reducing 
spending, and not draw up budget deficits. We must regulate 
funds by ways and means to ensure prompt wage payments for 
teachers and grass-roots cadres. In line with the party's basic 
policy on organizational reform, we must strive to reduce 
staffing, vehicle purchase, and meeting expenses. Enterprise 
units should continue to strengthen and perfect various budget 
control systems. We should encourage and support these units in 
rationally increasing their income within the limit allowed by 
policies and laws. Units with capabilities that receive their 
entire budgets from the province should gradually transform into 
units that receive differential budgets. Units receiving 
differential budgets should gradually transform into units that 
generate their own income for expenditures. We must further 
perfect the multiple forms of budget contract system as well as 
strengthen quota control and efficiency evaluation. 
  (5) Strengthen the management of state assets. This year, 
we must continue to formulate effective policies and laws to 
strengthen the management of property rights (shareholding 
rights) income and prevent the loss of state assets, as well as 
ensure that the costs and appreciated value of state assets are 
preserved. We must implement plans for gradual inspection and 
evaluation of the assets of 800 large and medium-sized state 
enterprises as well as regulate the relations between owners of 
state assets and enterprise corporations in property ownership. 
We must effectively reorganize state assets and the management 
of property rights as well as vigorously cultivate and develop 
the property rights market. Through effective methods such as 
joint-venture, joint operations, auctions, mergers, transfers, 
leasing, sales, and bankruptcy, we will promote the rational 
circulation of state assets and optimize their distribution and 
restructuring to further bring into play their economic 
efficiency.

  [Text] Suzhou, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Suzhou State 
High-Tech Development Zone in east China's Jiangsu Province has 
achieved good success, attracting increasing numbers of 
investors from at home and abroad. 
  It now has over 170 foreign-funded projects, with a total 
investment of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars. The firms are mainly 
engaged in electronics, biology, pharmaceuticals and other 
technology-intensive industries. 
  China now has a total of 52 such state-level high-tech 
zones, 
which serve as major implementation bases of the "Torch 
Program", a national high- and new-technology development 
blueprint. 
  According to the State Science and Technology Commission, 
fixed assets investment in these zones was 13 billion yuan 
(about 140 million U.S. dollars) in 1993. 
  Their development areas total over 60 sq km and nearly six 
million sq m [square meters] of floor space of buildings have 
been completed and over 12 million sq m of buildings are under 
construction. 
  The gross industrial and commercial income of the zones is 
now 57 billion yuan (about 630 million U.S. dollars), six times 
that of 1991. 
  Their export volume was over 700 million U.S. dollars last 
year. 
  By the end of last year more than 10,700 high-tech 
enterprises had been set up in the zones. Industries such as in 
optical-fiber communications and electronic information have 
become pillars of the zones. 
  Some zones have expanded from sole industrial development to 
comprehensive communities, where a service system covering 
finance, information, insurance, accounting, law, education, 
transportation, commerce and trade has emerged.

meeting of the eighth provincial people's congress, government 
organs throughout the province have achieved remarkable results 
in opposing corruption since last September. In 1993, 
educational undertakings developed even more throughout the 
province, and new results were achieved in reducing peasants' 
burdens. 
  At the plenary session held on the morning of 20 April,

The leading body of the Qingdao City Government has taken the 
lead in maintaining administrative honesty and self-discipline. 
At a democratic life meeting, Yu Zhengsheng, mayor of Qingdao 
city, took the lead in self-examination and self-correction of 
mistakes, and made public, on television, his income, his 
possessions including his house and car, and gifts he accepted 
while supervising the masses. According to statistics, from

and supervision organs throughout the province placed a total of 
6,999 cases concerning violation of laws and discipline on file 
for investigation and prosecution, and a total of 3,624 
party-members cadres were punished. 
  The report on educational work, made by Cui Weilin, chairman 
of the provincial educational commission, points out: Since the 
beginning of last year, educational undertakings have further 
developed throughout the province, the principle of invigorating 
Shandong through science and education has taken root in the 
hearts of the people, the strategic position of education has 
been strengthened, and the quality of education has improved 
gradually. In 1993, the student body of ordinary institutions of 
higher learning throughout the province was 150,000 persons, an 
increase of 15.38 percent over the previous year. The 
enrollment rate of school-age children reached 98.65 percent, 
and 1,509 townships and towns in the province carried out the 
nine-year compulsory education system, covering a population of 
55.8 million.

peasants' burdens in 1993, (Jin Yuyan), deputy director of the 
provincial agricultural department, pointed out: Over the past 
year, the State Council's regulations on charges borne by 
peasants and on management of labor service and Shandong's

implemented in the province. The provincial-level organs have 
canceled 33 documents involving peasants' burdens and have 
canceled some charge collection articles of the documents 
involving peasants burdens. Meanwhile, various cities, 
prefectures, and counties have abolished 1,993 documents 
involving peasants' burdens. The amount of village retention 
and township unified levies directly borne by the peasants in

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff correspondent Lin Yu-tung (2651 </F>
5940 2767): "Centralized Operations by 20 Guangdong Cities in 
Sweep Against Pirated Compact and Laser Discs"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 19 Apr -- To protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of audio-visual publishers, the Guangdong 
provincial authorities today planned a centralized operation in 
which 20 cities were to act in coordination to rectify the 
compact and laser disc markets, with the focus on a sweep 
against illegal copying and selling of compact and laser discs. 
  Acting on the centralized plan, the Shenzhen City Culture 
Bureau, Administration for Industry and Commerce, Public 
Security Bureau, and news units deployed a large number of 
personnel for a massive sweep. 
  At 1300, inspection teams made up of personnel from 
cultural, 
industry and commerce, public security, and news units were 
divided into three contingents, one heading toward Renmin Road 
South; one toward Tongjian Building; and one toward the railway 
station. A small detachment which this correspondent followed 
swooped down on the railway station and the Lianjian [Joint 
Inspection] Building nearby. Within 100 steps of the exit of 
the building were three kiosks selling illegal audio-visual 
publications. The sudden raid by the law-enforcement agents 
took the sellers completely by surprise; all illegal goods, 
numbering at least some 6,000 boxes, were either seized or 
confiscated. 
  Then the same detachment turned back to head toward the 
railway station and ran up to the second floor. Around the 
train waiting room on the second floor were five to six shops 
selling illegal audio-visual publications, some of which, having 
been tipped off, had moved part of the illegal goods somewhere 
else. But for most of the shops, before they realized what was 
happening, the law- enforcement agents had impounded or seized 
all of their illegal goods. One small shop, called "Shop B2 of 
the Commercial City on the second floor of the railway station," 
about three to four square meters in size, contained all kinds 
of discs of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland movie stars and 
other items such as "Swimsuit Best," "Women and Their Bodies" 
and "Sex and Happiness." There were all kinds of weird and 
dazzling items. A rough estimation put the goods at over 10,000 
boxes. It is understood that illegal audio-visual publications 
seized by the other contingents numbered 10,000 to 20,000 boxes. 
  Wang Zengliang, Shenzhen City Culture Bureau Inspection 
commander, who was present at the scene, told this correspondent 
that there were about 1,000 shops which were issued licenses by 
the city culture bureau and district authorities to sell 
cultural items; and that most of the sales were legal. But 
there were a considerable number of cultural item shops, 
especially vendors without operating permits, which sold illegal 
audio-visual publications. This situation became increasingly 
worse and created a very bad influence. To crack down harshly 
on this practice, the city had established an inspection command 
center and staffed it with personnel drawn from the city 
government, cultural, industry and commerce, and public security 
departments. The city culture bureau has also set up full-time 
and part-time inspection teams and planned to adopt methods such 
as strengthening education, regular enforcement of laws and 
inspections, and rewarding people reporting illegal selling to 
ensure the healthy development of the cultural market.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i (5170 2556 </F>
0308): "Guangdong Province Seizes 140,000 Pirated Compact Discs 
by Shock Tactics"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Beginning 
yesterday at noon, in a concerted effort, more than 20 relevant 
departments at the prefecture and city levels in the province 
went out to take emergency action on an unprecedented scale to 
crack down on illegal compact disc (CD) and audio-visual 
products, achieving certain results. 
  As of noon today, the province has mobilized over 3,200 
personnel to inspect more than 1,650 shops. They have seized 
more than 141,000 pirated CD's, 1,300 laser discs, and 85,000 
audio (video) tapes [as published]. A total of 10 stalls 
without licenses were closed. In Guangzhou alone, approximately 
60,000 pirated CD's and 2,700 pirated audio (video) tapes were 
seized. 
  According to the person in charge of the Guangdong Province 
Copyright Bureau, CD and laser discs rapidly developed and 
became easily available only in the past two or three years. 
Due to poor management, the low quality of those in the trade 
-- who lack a clear understanding of copyrights -- and the 
arrival of some manufacturers and individual operators who want 
to reap huge profits from the audio-visual products market, the 
phenomenon of pirating and theft in the audio-visual products 
market in Guangdong and even the whole country is serious. In 
order to safeguard the normal publication order, guarantee a 
healthy cultural market, and strengthen propaganda for 
protecting intellectual property rights in the province, this 
concerted effort is only the beginning of a thorough inspection 
of the audio-visual products market, and regular inspections 
will henceforth be carried out. 
  The person also said that the China Press and Publications 
Administration will promulgate the "Regulations on Inspection, 
Registration, and Management of Compact Disk Copyrights" 
shortly. The Guangdong Province Copyright Bureau will 
incorporate the current 23 CD production lines in the province's 
16 factories into the domain of management of press and 
publications. In light of the relatively acute situation of 
laser disc smuggling, the relevant department will coordinate 
with the customs department in cracking down on smuggling and 
blocking the sources. Stalls selling audio- visual products 
must first apply for permits from the copyright bureau, which 
will issue the business licenses, so as to strengthen the sense 
of copyright law and understanding of the legal system among 
stall owners.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou Free 
Trade Zone is prospering since it went into operation last May, 
according to officials in charge of the zone's management. 
  By the end of March this year 263 projects set up by 
domestic 
and foreign businessmen had settled down in the zone, involving 
a total investment of 430 million U.S. dollars, 122 million 
U.S. dollars of which came from foreign investors. 
  The 1.4-sq-km zone near this capital of south China's 
Guangdong Province is one of the 13 free trade zones approved by 
the State Council to be set up across the country. 
  So far, almost all the land in the zone for financial and 
trade activities, warehouses and processing of export products 
has been sold. 
  The officials said that the zone is the first in the country 
to permit solely foreign-funded enterprises to take overall 
charge of land development and introducing projects. 
  By the end of last year the zone had put large sums of money 
into improving the zone's basic facilities, and this year, ten 
infrastructure projects will be completed or start construction 
with regard to commodity show places, quays, goods examination 
sites, electric power projects and office buildings.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Xingbo: "Shenzhen's First Quarter Output Is $1.4 </F>
Billion"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen -- Industrial output hit a record 11.6 
billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in the first quarter of this year in 
China's first special economic zone. 
  And profits grew faster than sales, according to the city's 
Economic Development Bureau. 
  "This indicates that enterprises are operating efficiently," 
the bureau said. It is the first time for Shenzhen's industrial 
output value to exceed 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion). 
  And foreign-funded enterprises had a good start to the year. 
  Their output rose by 43 per cent over the same period last 
year to reach 9.1 billion yuan ($1.1 billion). 
  But the city's first-quarter growth rate of 33.9 per cent 
was 
down on previous years. And it was 5.7 per cent below that of 
the province as a whole during January and February. 
  The city had previously led the province's economic boom. 
  Insufficient funds and the rising cost of bank loans have 
dampened growth, city economists said. 
  Raw materials, price hikes, and exchange rate fluctuations 
have also led to higher production costs. 
  The city urged effective handling of these problems in a bid 
to maintain swift economic development. 
  Foreign-funded firm exports reached more than 5.8 billion 
yuan ($682 million), going up by 14.2 per cent over the same 
period last year. 
  First-quarter growth rate in the past four years has fallen 
from 49.2 per cent to 43.1 per cent to 37.9 per cent to 34.7 per 
cent.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 19 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- To 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of audiovisual 
publishers and maintain order in audiovisual markets, Guangdong 
Province launched this afternoon a unified operation to rectify 
audiovisual markets across the province, focusing on halting the 
illegal copying and selling of compact and laser discs. 
  Shenzhen, acting on the operation plan of the provincial 
authorities, formed inspection teams consisting of personnel 
from Shenzhen City Cultural Inspection Contingents, the Shenzhen 
City Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Shenzhen 
City Public Security Bureau. Such teams were deployed to all 
the city's five districts at 1300 this afternoon and 
simultaneously launched massive searches for the illegal copying 
and selling of compact and laser discs. The inspection teams 
concentrated on sites notorious for the copying and selling of 
compact and laser discs, such as the Shenzhen Railway Station 
shopping mall, the Luohu Port shopping mall, and Renmin Road, 
South. At the Shenzhen Railway Station and Luohu Port shopping 
malls, this reporter found that most of the compact and laser 
discs sold by all the vendors were pirated copies, poor in 
quality and printing. The management at the railway station 
shopping mall was particularly confusing. Many album sellers 
did not have licenses to sell cultural items, or even the 
necessary business licenses. Of the pirated compact discs, the 
largest number were of Hong Kong and Taiwan singers, but some 
were overseas classical music, recent famous mainland songs, and 
songs by mainland singers. The inspection teams seized, in one 
fell swoop, thousands of pirated compact disc copies at a shop 
called "B2" in the Shenzhen Railway Station shopping mall. A 
large red banner hung in front of the shop, on which was written 
"Original Polygram Compact Discs." 
  A Shenzhen City Cultural Bureau official said that the 
operations were meant to protect intellectual property rights, 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of copyright 
holders, and protect the interests of lawful operators, while 
cracking down on the illegal practices of illegal operators and 
cleaning up the Shenzhen audiovisual market. This official 
stressed that they would insist on carrying out such operations 
in order to genuinely protect the legal rights of copyright 
holders.

  [Text] Yesterday, in order to crack down on pirated 
compact discs [CD's], various quarters of Guangdong province 
carried out a major sweep against shops selling pirated CD's. 
In Shenzhen alone, nearly 50,000 pirated CD's were seized. 
Despite the operation, however, many shops are still open for 
business. Ng Kit-man reports from Shenzhen: 
  [Begin recording] [Ng] Although it is illegal for people to 
bring pirated CD's from Shenzhen into Hong Kong, for the past 
six months at least, it has been possible to buy a CD for a 
little less than 20 yuan, only one-tenth the price of a genuine 
CD, and many Hong Kong residents have purchased pirated CD's 
here a few times. In view of the serious situation in CD piracy, 
Guangdong launched a large-scale crackdown yesterday in various 
parts of the province, including Shenzhen. Over 200 people from 
Shenzhen's Culture Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and 
Public Security Bureau raided CD shops and seized approximately 
24,000 pirated CD's and nearly 30,000 laser disks, audio tapes, 
and video tapes. 
  Today, we have visited a shop known to sell pirated CD's and 
have found that many shops are open and are still selling 
pirated CD's. At the Shenzhen Railway Building, where pirated 
CD's have always been available for purchase and which was an 
important target in yesterday's crackdown, many shops are still 
open and are stilling selling pirated CD's following the 
crackdown. 
  [Ng] How much do your CD's sell for? 
  [First unidentified shopkeeper] 15 to 20 yuan per CD. 
  [Ng] Are they genuine or pirated? 
  [First shopkeeper] They are homemade and genuine. 
  [Ng] Some shops are finding it difficult to continue their 
business and say that they will close when they have sold all 
their stock. 
  [Second unidentified shopkeeper] Many shops have closed, and 
nobody is placing new CD orders. This is all that I have 
available for sale, and I have decided to close the business 
when the stock is all sold. 
  [Ng] Ng Kit-man from Shenzhen, ATV. [end recording]

  [Text] Various quarters in Guangdong have launched a major 
joint operation to crack down on pirated compact discs [CD] in 
several big cities in the province and have seized over 100,000 
pirated CD's. Au Ka-lun reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Au] This is the largest-ever crackdown on 
pirated CD's in Guangdong. Various quarters at the provincial 
and city levels have launched joint operations and raids in 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In six shops in 
Guangzhou alone, they seized more than 70 boxes containing over 
10,000 pirated CD's. In Zhuhai, the operations involved over 500 
people, who raided shops in the vicinity of Gongbei and seized 
30,000 pirated audio-visual products. In Shenzhen, the 
operations are still continuing today. Inspection personnel 
inspected the shops near the railway station and seized nearly 
30,000 pirated CD's and nearly 20,000 video tapes. What 
deterrent effect are the large-scale operations having? We find 
that, despite the inspections which have just ended, some shops 
are still selling their stuff. 
  [Au] It is still possible to buy these two pirated CD's 
featuring Hong Kong singers for 15 yuan a piece in Shenzhen 
today. The shopkeeper admits that the CD's are pirated. 
  [First unidentified shopkeeper] I don't think I am going to 
sell this stuff any more after all the CD's have been sold. 
  [Au] Why? 
  [First shopkeeper] If the pirated stuff is banned, I am not 
going to sell it. 
  [Au] Near the railway station, we find the racks at some 
shops frequented by Hong Kong customers almost empty. But a 
shopkeeper is placing pirated CD's on them and says he will 
continue to sell all that he has in stock. 
  [Second unidentified shopkeeper] No, I am not going to start 
selling again. Almost all the CD's have been seized. How can 
anyone sell them? 
  [Au] With the recent operations on pirated CD's, some shops 
have switched to selling genuine CD's, which cost 100 yuan or 
more each. Shenzhen Vice Mayor (Li Ronggen) has said that 
Shenzhen will continue to crack down on pirated audio-visual 
products and will protect the interests of legitimate 
businessmen. Au Ka-lun, TVB. [end recording]

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 21 (CNS) -- The Shenzhen municipal 
public security authorities have ordered 37 people of U.S., 
Canadian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan, Nigerian and Pakistani 
nationalities to leave China within three days. 
  The 37 persons are so-called "three-no" people, namely 
without legal certificate, a proper job and lawful residence, 
being found in lent accommodation and an "underground guest 
house" in the Luohu District of the city yesterday when the 
police conducted a sudden raid in the area. 
  These 37 people had entered the city as tourists and had not 
returned to their own countries when their tourist documents 
expired. They were instead illegally living, working, doing 
business and taking part in activities in the city, posing 
troubles to social order and the management of foreign affairs 
there. The municipal public security department imposed a fine 
on them according to foreign affairs management regulations and 
ordered them to leave the country within three days.

  [Text] Provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen yesterday attended 
a provincial propaganda and ideological work conference at which 
he delivered an important speech devoted to such issues as 
reform, economic development, and so on. 
  In his speech, Governor Ma Zhongchen stated that the 
province's propaganda and ideological work should consciously 
submit to and serve such overall interests as grasping 
opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability; correctly create and 
guide public opinion; and give unreserved support to reform. Ma 
Zhongchen said: This year, we will unfold faster-paced reform 
and institute a multitude of reform measures. The propaganda 
and ideological workers across the province should therefore 
become good at analyzing contradictions and tackling problems; 
further improve propaganda work; work for reform, development, 
and stability; strengthen propaganda work as well as meticulous 
ideological and political work; help the broad masses of people 
solve all sorts of ideological problems that have emerged in the 
course of reform and development and adopt a more rational 
attitude toward reform and development; properly resolve all 
types of contradictions; pay more attention to issues that are 
of great concern to the broad masses of people; reflect the 
views of the broad masses of people in a timely fashion; and 
resolutely tackle each and every hot-spot problem. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen expressed the hope that propaganda 
departments at all levels across the province will make 
unreserved efforts to study the current economic situation, 
progress in reform, as well as new developments and problems in 
the course of reform; correctly publicize in a timely fashion 
the province's achievements and progress in reform, opening up, 
and economic construction; concentrate on publicizing the 
overall situation; energetically publicize agriculture as the 
province's national economic foundation; conduct more propaganda 
on rapid rural economic development and increasing peasant 
incomes; give more publicity to experiments on enterprise 
incorporation and to efforts toward establishing a modern 
enterprise system and increasing economic efficiency; and 
vigorously promote the province's financial, taxation, 
financial, planning, investment, foreign trade, scientific, 
technological, and education systems reforms and the province's 
economic achievements. 
  In his speech, Governor Ma Zhongchen emphatically called for 
conducting positive propaganda in the main; improving Henan's 
image; reflecting reality; speaking the truth; mobilizing 
enthusiasm among the broad masses of people; developing a 
down-to-earth work style; writing truthful and objective 
reports; publicizing no superficial achievements; filing no 
one-sided achievements reports; preventing overall achievements 
from being negated by incidental errors; and avoiding the 
pursuit of hollow news results. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen called on government departments at 
all 
levels across the province to attach great importance to and 
show concern and support for propaganda and ideological work 
departments; provide propaganda and ideological work departments 
with necessary conditions; inform propaganda and ideological 
work departments of the latest developments and policy changes 
in a timely fashion; actively help propaganda and ideological 
work departments resolve realistic problems; further perfect and 
implement cultural economic policies; improve propaganda and 
ideological work conditions; and carry out more fruitful 
propaganda and ideological work. 
  Yesterday's conference was presided over by Song Zhaosu, 
provincial party committee deputy secretary, and attended by a 
number of provincial party and government leaders, including 
Song Guochen, Fan Qinchen, Zhang Wenbin, Zhang Shiying, and 
others.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] Danzim, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional CPC Committee, pointed out at the ongoing autonomous 
regional propaganda and ideological work meeting: News media in 
Tibet should actively adapt themselves to meeting the needs of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure and do a good 
job in news propaganda and guiding public opinion. It is 
necessary to adhere to the principle of promoting unity, 
stability, vigor, and positive publicity; put the stress of news 
propaganda on economic construction, reform, and opening up; 
serve the central task--economic construction--in a more 
conscientious and effective way; and take a clear-cut stand in 
supporting and publicizing reforms. 
  Comrade Danzim said: All news media should devote their 
major energy to reporting Tibet's great undertakings of reform 
and opening up, the people's pioneering spirit during the course 
of creating a new life, and the political stability, economic 
prosperity, social progress, and happiness enjoyed by the 
people. News articles, pictures, and photographs should be 
aimed at reporting the cadres, workers, peasants, herdsmen, and 
commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, public 
security police, and armed police force who are working hard on 
the forefront of economic construction, maintaining stability, 
and building the two civilizations. 
  Comrade Danzim pointed out: News propaganda should be 
designed to guide, protect, and bring into play the initiative 
of the people and of all quarters; and to make people's thinking 
and deeds conform to the party's basic line, and the general 
guidelines and tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and 
autonomous regional party committee. News media should serve as 
a center of public opinion for promoting reform, opening up, 
economic development, and social stability in Tibet. 
  Comrade Danzim emphasized: Strengthening leadership over 
news media is of extreme importance in providing correct 
guidance for public opinion. The party committees and 
propaganda departments at all levels in Tibet should establish 
and improve the system of meeting the press. News media should 
step up contacts with economic departments. Economic 
departments should constantly keep the news media informed of 
economic work so they can promptly and accurately know the 
economic situation and report it accordingly.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region in north China has trained a large number of 
experts, indicating the formation of a multi-disciplined 
scientific and technological system. 
  In the late 1940s Inner Mongolia had not even the capability 
to produce nails or matches. 
  But since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 
1949 the central government has sent experts to help the region 
set up universities, and natural and social sciences institutes 
there. 
  By the end of last year the total number of scientists and 
experts of various disciplines was 455,000. 
  The number of experts from minority nationalities is 96,000, 
some 61 percent of the region's cadres from ethnic 
nationalities. They have achieved remarkable successes in the 
fields of veterinary science, medicine, forestry, and new 
building materials. 
  Li Donggen, a professor of the Korean nationality, has 
applied remote-sensing technology to forestry resources. 
  Xu Gorigan, a scholar of the Mongolian nationality, is now 
president of Inner Mongolia University. He produced the world's 
first test-tube goat and has made new progress in animal 
fertilization tests. He received a doctorate in Japan for 
research on techniques of external fertilization of sheep. 
  Female scientists account for almost half of the total. They 
are engaged in research into medicine, mechanics, wool spinning 
and steel making. 
  Zhang Jiahua, a professor at the Inner Mongolia Institute of 
Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, won a scientific progress 
prize for her new polyploidy beet breed.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 21 (XINHUA) -- An expanding radio and 
TV network has brought a more colorful and better informed life 
to herdsmen in Alxa League in the remote western part of the 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to local officials. 
  The officials said radio broadcasts now reach 80 percent of 
the league's population, and TV programs 75 percent. 
  With an area of 270,000 sq km, mostly desert, the league's 
major transportation means used to be camels and horses. So the 
herdsmen lived an isolated life until the early 1980s. 
  Since then, the league authorities have invested 50 million 
yuan building 38 relay stations and 49 satellite ground 
stations, bringing 14 TV channels to the local people. 
  According to the officials, some small towns and villages 
have even set up their own cable TV networks.

  [Text] During his inspection of Tianjin, Comrade Wan Li 
pointed out that reform and opening up are the motivation to 
ceaselessly push our undertakings forward and we are allowed to 
boldly have a try to and give free reins to implement the ideas 
suiting the "three-conducive" standards as put forward by 
Comrade Xiaoping. The policies on reform and opening up will 
not be shaken for 100 years. 
  Accompanied by Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin 
Municipal 
party committee; Zhang Lichang, mayor of the municipality; Zheng 
Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general of the 
municipal party committee; and Ye Disheng, vice mayor of the 
municipality, Comrade Wan Li inspected the bonded area of 
Tianjin harbor, the Tianjin economic and technological 
development zone, and the Tianjin steel tube company, from 9 to 
10 April. Comrade Wan Li, at the age of 78 years, zestfully 
visited some enterprises, including the Aojin electric cable 
corporation and the Motorola electronics corporation; and heard 
the work reports of the bonded area, the development zone, and 
the steel tube company. 
  After hearing the reports, Comrade Wan Li pointed out: I am 
very glad to see Tianjin's vigorous progress in reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. Your such great achievements 
made through the efforts to develop the development zone in the 
past 10 years and the bonded area in the past three years fully 
prove the gigantic power of reform and opening up. At present, 
so long as we unswervingly work in accordance with the party 
Central Committee's 20-character policy on "grasping favorable 
opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening 
up, promoting development, and maintaining stability," will we 
be able to make greater achievements. 
  During the inspection, Comrade Wan Li especially stressed 
the 
importance of science and technology and skilled persons. He 
said: Things should be done by the people. In conducting reform 
and opening to the outside world, we need a large number of 
specialized talents with the knowledge of technologies, 
management, and foreign languages. Open cities must open 
themselves to the outside world. We should learn foreign 
languages since childhood. Capable of foreign languages, our 
younger generation will better assimilate the advanced and 
scientific things in the world and spread the excellent culture 
of our Chinese nation to the outside world. At the Motorola 
corporation, Comrade Wan Li saw that the world advanced 
production line was operating at a highly-clean, sealed 
workshop. He was very glad to know that last year, this 
corporation generated 820 million yuan in output value and 130 
million yuan of profits and taxes. He said: Science and 
technology are the primary productive forces. This is the truth. 
Advanced sciences and techniques can produce gigantic 
productive forces. Our aim to conduct joint investment and 
bring in techniques, capital, and skilled persons is to bring in 
the most advanced techniques and managerial skills. We cannot 
bring in the things that have been eliminated by others.

  [Text] The ninth standing committee meeting of the eighth 
provincial people's congress held its second plenary session 
this afternoon to hear the work reports of the provincial 
government, the provincial people's court, and the provincial 
people's procuratorate. Gu Changchun, vice chairman of the 
provincial people's congress standing committee, chaired the 
session. 
  Cheng Wengui, deputy director of the provincial planning 
commission, said in his report on Jilin's commodity prices: 
Regarding Jilin's 1993 price work, aiming at establishing the 
socialist market economy system, a goal put forward at the 14th 
party congress, we gave better play to the regulatory role of 
the lever of prices in economic operation and achieved fairly 
good results. Major problems in Jilin's 1993 price work were 
that prices rose by a rather large margin, with the retail price 
index increasing by 11.3 percent in the province; and that 
collection of unwarranted fees, fines, and donations still 
occurred frequently, making the task to check this practice very 
arduous. In carrying out the price work in 1994, Jilin should 
focus on the priorities, achieve a good command of the extent, 
promote the price reform in an active and prudent manner in line 
with the capacity of the state, enterprises, and the people to 
bear the strains, gradually establish and improve the means of 
price regulation and control, and adopt resolute measures to 
strictly control price rises and stabilize the general price 
level. 
  In his report on the trial of major and serious cases by the 
courts in the process of the anticorruption struggle, Yang 
Qingxiang, president of the provincial higher people's court, 
said: From January 1993 to February 1994, the province 
registered 220 major and serious economic cases involving 235 
persons and concluded 202 cases of them, which involved 212 
persons. Of the concluded cases, 196 involved over 10,000 yuan 
each; and of the 212 criminals punished, five were cadres at and 
above the county or section level. Public trial and 
pronouncement of sentences effectively frightened economic 
criminals and enhanced the people's determination to oppose 
corruption and advocate honesty. 
  In his report on the endeavor of Jilin procuratorial organs 
to investigate and handle major and serious cases in the process 
of the anticorruption struggle, Li Xiangwu, chief procurator of 
the provincial people's procuratorate, said: From January 1993 
to the first quarter of 1994, procuratorial organs throughout 
Jilin Province accepted 3,375 economic cases on embezzlement and 
bribery and placed 2,333 on file for investigation, of which 766 
were major and serious cases, and concluded 1,654 cases. By 
handling these cases, they recovered 113.8 million yuan in 
economic losses for the state and the collective.

anticorruption struggle for the present stage. The provincial 
procuratorate today held a news briefing to make public the 
previous work to investigate and handle major and serious cases. 
  According to statistics, Jilin placed 2,100 economic 
offenses 
and law breaches on file for investigation from August 1993 to 
March 1994. Of the total, 537 were cases on embezzlement, 193 
were cases on bribery, and 412 were cases on misuse of public

involving cadres at and above the county or section level 
totaled 51. After investigation and handling of these cases, 
more than 43 million yuan of economic losses were recovered, and 
a number of major and serious cases that had created bad 
influence and repercussions were rapidly cracked. 
  When handling the cases, procuratorial organs throughout the 
province handled a number of cases committed by functionaries of 
party and government organs, especially leading cadres. One 
hundred and forty-five functionaries of party and government 
organs were implicated in the cases cracked by the procuratorial 
organs across the province from August 1993 to March 1994. (Li 
Cai), former deputy director of the Meihekou city public 
security bureau, (Chi Haijiang), director of Taonan city tax 
bureau, and other lawless persons who had violated laws while 
enforcing laws were dealt with. The procuratorial organs also 
investigated and handled 189 cases on embezzlement, bribery, and 
misuse of public funds committed by banks and other economic 
management departments, captured a number of escaping economic 
criminals, verified cheated state tax refund on exported goods 
totaling 6.84 million yuan, and recovered 3.3 million yuan of it.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The expressway from 
Shenyang to Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province is 
playing an important role in the economic progress of the 
Liaodong Peninsula. 
  Occupying 36.1 percent of the total area of Liaoning 
Province, the peninsula has achieved an average economic growth 
rate of over 20 percent in recent years. 
  In 1993 the total industrial and agricultural output of the 
peninsula was over 60 percent of the total for the province. 
  The area has become a major attraction for overseas 
investors 
in the province, having become the most concentrated area of 
Sino- foreign joint ventures. 
  Three state economic and technological development zones 
have 
been set up along the expressway. They now have over 2,000 
foreign- funded firms. 
  Along the expressway are located five major industrial 
cities 
of Shenyang, Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou and Dalian. 
  Taking advantage of convenient transportation, 31 counties 
in 
the locality have attained an average economic growth of 30 
percent, and township enterprises export nearly 220 million U.S. 
dollars-worth of goods annually. 
  The Shenyang-Dalian expressway has also promoted the 
circulation of commodities and the market economy. The annual 
volume of business in the hundreds of markets along the route is 
almost two billion yuan (about 250 million U.S. dollars), 
accounting for more than 60 percent of the provincial total. 
  In addition, the tourism industry has been growing. The 
number of overseas tourists visiting the Liaodong Peninsula has 
increased from 100,000 a year in the past to 200,000 a year now.

and its Draft Budget for 1994" delivered by Gong Jinniu, 
director of Regional Finance Department, to the Second Session 
of the Eighth Xinjiang Regional People's Congress on 24 February 
1994"] 
  [Text] Deputies: 
  Being entrusted by the people's government of the autonomous 
region, I now submit the report on the implementation of the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's budget for 1993 and its draft 
budget for 1994 for your examination and approval. 
<H5>  1. Implementation of the Autonomous Region's Budget for 1993 </H5>
  In 1993, guided by the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the autonomous region earnestly implemented the 
series of important measures of the party central committee and 
the State Council for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control, earnestly carried out the resolutions of the first 
session of the eighth regional people's congress, and deepened 
reform in various areas, and further opened to the outside 
world, thus achieving new progress in developing the economy and 
other undertakings. On this basis, the budget was implemented 
well, and revenue income was considerably more than that 
received in 1992. Basically, expenditures were able to meet the 
needs for economic and social development. 
  The 1993 budget, approved at the first session of the eighth 
regional people's congress, is as follows: revenue 2.772 
billion yuan; expenditure 4.554 billion yuan. In the course of 
implementing the budget, it was partially readjusted with the 
approval of the fourth meeting of the standing committee of the 
eighth regional people's congress last September. After this, 
the central authority readjusted the revenue and expenditure 
figures in the region's budget. The readjusted budget is as 
follows: revenue 2.83 billion yuan and expenditure 6.634 
billion yuan. 
  The autonomous region's 1993 revenues and expenditures are 
expected to be as follows: revenue is expected to reach 3.47 
billion yuan, or 122.61 percent of the fiscal budget (the 
readjusted budget, same below) of 2.83 billion yuan, 
representing 640 million yuan more than the budgeted figure or 
an increase of 863 million yuan or 33.08 percent over 1992; 
expenditure is expected to amount to 6.446 billion yuan 
(including 229 million for workers' pay raises readjusted in the 
fourth quarter of 1993; this amount was listed under other 
categories of expenditures), or 97.17 percent of the fiscal 
budget of 6.634 billion yuan, representing an increase of 837 
million or 14.92 percent over 1992 (an increase of 608 million 
or 10.84 percent after deducting the amount to pay for workers' 
wage increases). 
  The main revenue figures are expected to be as follows: 
Industrial and business tax revenues are expected to total 3.146 
billion yuan, which is 123.37 percent of the budgeted figure, 
surpassing the budgeted figure by 596 million yuan and 
representing an increase of 819 million yuan or 35.19 percent 
over 1992; taxes from agriculture, animal husbandry, special 
agricultural and forestry products, the using of arable land, 
and contracts will be 136 million yuan, up 3.86 percent over the 
previous year; after profits are set against losses, 
enterprises' income will be 54 million yuan from canceled 
stocks, which is 52 million yuan short of the budgeted figure 
and represents 18 million yuan of fewer stocks canceled compared 
with 1992. Actual revenue from grain will be 42 million yuan 
less than the budgeted figure after deducting 59 million of 
losses in 1993 (used as grain price subsidies for workers of 
enterprises and institutions). In 1993, the autonomous region's 
revenues rose by a large margin, surpassing the previous year's 
figure by 863 million yuan. The main reasons are: first, the 
region earnestly implemented the CPC Central Committee's 
Document No. 6 and strengthened overall regulation and control 
over its economy. Production expanded, the market was brisk, 
and revenue sources increased. Business tax increased by 260 
million yuan (not including the income from raised tax rates) 
due to the expansion of commodity circulation and the increase 
in retail sales; second, the region strengthened tax collection 
and management, resolutely put a stop to new tax exemptions and 
reductions, and recovered back taxes; and third, the central 
authorities raised the tax rate for Xinjiang's petroleum 
products, started levying a crude oil tax, changed the rules for 
collecting taxes from processed crude oil products, and raised 
the tax rate for retail businesses. These policies will result 
in a tax income increase of 280 million yuan. 
  The main expenditures are expected to break down as 
follows: Capital construction expenditures, 650 million yuan, 
an increase of 26 million yuan or 4.1 percent over 1992; 
expenditures for tapping the potential of and transforming 
enterprises, 158 million yuan, up 37.01 percent over the 
previous year; expenses for three scientific and technological 
projects, 41 million yuan, up 23.23 percent over 1992; expenses 
for support of rural production, 304 million yuan, up 3.89 
percent over 1992; expenses for agricultural, animal husbandry, 
forestry, water conservation, and weather departments, 370 
million yuan, up 7.07 percent over the previous year; expenses 
for education, culture, and public health, 1.775 billion yuan, 
an increase of 15.92 percent over 1992, of which education 
expenditure, 1.70 billion yuan, up 14.26 percent over 1992; 
expenses for science and technology, 63 million yuan, up 13.62 
percent over 1992; administrative expenses, 1.1 billion yuan, an 
increase of 20.46 percent over the previous year; expenditures 
for public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs, 337 
million yuan, up 25.21 percent over 1992. The above expenses do 
not include the expenditure for pay raises effective since the 
fourth quarter of last year. The expenditure was listed under 
another category. 
  In 1993, expenses for various undertakings, especially 
administrative expenditures, in the autonomous region rose 
considerably, and expenses for production and construction 
projects also rose to varying degrees. The increase in the 
administrative expenses and expenses for other undertakings was 
caused by the increase in pay for personnel. Price rises also 
contributed to the increase in the expenses for various 
undertakings. Last year, despite serious financial 
difficulties, we basically ensured wage payments for workers of 
administrative departments and institutions and also ensured the 
funds for the development of the economy and other undertakings 
as set in the budget. This is the result of the joint efforts 
of various localities and departments and is also the result of 
assistance from the central authorities. Last year, the central 
authorities loaned our region 200 million yuan to help alleviate 
our shortage of funds. 
  Next I would like to report on the execution of the 1993 
budget at the autonomous regional level. Total revenues are 
expected to be [as published] 365 million yuan, 168 million yuan 
more than budgetary target and 135 million yuan or 58.61 percent 
more than 1992 revenues. Of the total revenues, industrial and 
commercial taxes amounted to 347 million yuan, 157 million yuan 
more than the budgetary target and 167 million yuan more than 
the 1992 figure. The net revenues from state-owned enterprises 
of the autonomous regional level amounted to 69 million yuan, 
which included income tax, regulatory tax, and profit delivery 
after deduction of subsidies to those enterprises which suffered 
business losses; and the figure was 30 million yuan less than 
the budgetary target. The total expenditures are expected to be 
1.825 billion yuan (including 45 billion yuan for wage increases 
for regional- level organizations in three months of 1993), 
fulfilling 77.27 percent of the fiscal budget and up 167 million 
yuan or 10.05 percent from 1992 figure (the slow progress of the 
expenditure was because there were more carry-overs of special 
central fundings and they were used in wage payments in various 
localities). 
  The above is the situation of the budget's execution. After 
the final accounts are completed, there will be some changes in 
figures and another report will be delivered then. 
  To fulfill the 1993 budget targets, all localities and 
departments continued to strengthen their leadership over fiscal 
work, made great efforts to increase revenues and reduce 
expenditures, and concentrated on the following aspects of work: 
  (1) Great efforts were made to support the development of 
production and cultivate financial resources. In the second 
half of 1993, finance departments at all levels made rational 
distribution of funds, basically ensured funds for productive 
undertakings, increased investment in agriculture and animal 
husbandry through various channels, and ensured timely 
availability of funds for the purchase of agricultural products. 
They used circulation funds in supporting the technological 
transformation of enterprises and thus helped enterprises to 
promote production. They took a further step to support the 
development of border towns and the county-level economy. They 
serviced the World Bank's loans on time, and all projects 
undertaken with the loans are proceeding smoothly, gradually 
yielding economic and social benefits. 
  (2) Efforts were made to improve the collection and 
management of revenues. All local authorities screened tax 
reductions and exemptions they had previously approved, as well 
as local provisions on the two funds [construction funds for key 
energy and communications projects and budgetary regulatory 
funds]. They abolished some improper policies and stopped 
approving requests for tax reduction or exemption on grounds of 
temporary difficulties. So, the situation of approving 
unwarranted tax reductions and tax exemptions at will were by 
and large brought under control. They also corrected the 
practice of some enterprises paying a fixed amount of turnover 
tax by contract and thus upheld the dignity of the tax law. At 
the same time, they improved the collection and management of 
agricultural and animal husbandry taxes and overfulfilled their 
treasury bond sales task. 
  (3) Funds were distributed in a rational way to ensure 
funding for key expenditures. They adhered to the principle of 
ensuring funding for wages, basic administrative expenses, and 
winter needs, and gave first priority to funding the wages and 
operating expenses of administrative organizations and 
institutions. They also ensured funds for maintaining social 
stability, combating natural disasters and providing relief, and 
preventing and controlling diseases. At the same time, they 
attached importance to saving administrative operating expenses, 
and in the second half of the year stopped approving most 
requests of administrative institutions for buying controlled 
commodities. 
  (4) They did a good preparatory work for the reform of the 
fiscal and taxation systems in support of economic 
restructuring. Following the unified arrangements made by the 
Party Central Committee and the State Council, they seriously 
prepared for the implementation of the revenue-sharing system -- 
an objective of the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. 
The fiscal departments at various levels earnestly implemented 
"Regulations on Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," helped enterprises exercise 
their autonomy, and seriously did a good job in signing the 
third round of contracts with enterprises. They achieved very 
good results in deepening the reform of the commodity 
distribution system and in reforming the grain management 
system, and did a great deal of work in improving the 
reappraisal of the assets of administrative institutions. They 
made positive efforts to appraise assets, define property 
rights, and register property rights. They began, as scheduled, 
the implementation of "general principles of financial affairs 
of enterprises," "rules for enterprise accounting," and the 
accounting systems for various professions and trades on 1 July 
1993. As a result, those major reforms were carried out 
smoothly. 
  (5) Efforts were made to rectify fiscal and taxation order 
and enforce financial and economic discipline. They seriously 
conducted a general inspection of taxation and financial work 
and achieved certain success. They generally screened the 
circulation funds and improved their management. They adopted 
effective measures and basically stopped unwarranted pooling of 
funds, arbitrary imposition of fines and exaction of fees, and 
unauthorized requisition of donations. Those measures have 
played an important role in reducing the unreasonable burdens of 
enterprises and the people. 
  While achievements were the main feature of the autonomous 
region's fiscal work in 1993, it also had many difficulties and 
problems. The major problems were as follows: The problem of 
low growth and low efficiency among enterprises was not 
fundamentally solved. The losses suffered by industrial 
enterprises covered by the budget continued to increase and most 
enterprises lacked the basis for further development, impeding 
revenue increases. The net increase of income of most 
prefectures and counties was far from being sufficient for 
defraying the increase of expenditures, because the revenue base 
was small, the expenditure base was large, and the increase of 
revenues was uneven among various localities. Moreover, it is 
difficult to reduce present expenditures because a large portion 
is wages; and so, the financial situation is becoming worse. 
With increasing debts and financial deficits, the financial 
difficulties are becoming greater and greater at all levels. 
Because of deficits, more special-purpose funds have been 
diverted to other-than-intended purposes, causing difficulties 
in fund distribution and frequent delay in wage payments. While 
these are financial problems, they are also a comprehensive 
reflection of social and economic problems. 
<H5>  2. Draft budget of the autonomous region for 1994 </H5>
  The autonomous region's budget for 1994 is projected in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Sixth (enlarged) Plenary 
Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, as well 
as the guidelines of the national economic work conference and 
financial work conference. The guiding principles for budget 
projection are to actively and properly promote the 
revenue-sharing system during the reform of the fiscal system 
and other relevant reforms and continue to strengthen and 
improve overall fiscal regulation and control; by promoting 
production and enhancing economic efficiency, to vigorously 
cultivate financial resources, continue to manage taxation 
according to law, step up tax collection, and strive to achieve 
a steady revenue growth; and in accordance with the principle of 
"feeding the people and building the region simultaneously," to 
give first priority to paying wages while making overall 
arrangements for other expenditures, so as to ensure a social 
and political stability, ensure a smooth proceeding of reform 
and opening up, and bring about a rapid and highly effective 
economic development in the autonomous region. 
  Following the central authorities' unified plan and the 
State 
Council's "decision on implementation of the revenue-sharing 
fiscal system," Xinjiang began the revenue-sharing fiscal system 
on 1 January 1994. The revenue-sharing system is implemented on 
the basis of the reform of the taxation system. The reform of 
the taxation system mainly involved the reform of the turnover 
tax. The new turnover tax system is mainly based on the 
value-added tax, supplemented by the consumption tax and the 
business tax. Under the new revenue-sharing system, the central 
government receives all revenues from the consumption tax and 75 
percent of the revenues from the value-added tax; while the 
local government receives 25 percent of the revenues from the 
value-added tax and all the revenues from the business tax. 
Other tax revenues are shared roughly according to old 
proportions. The tax revenues delivered to the central 
government will be based on the 1993 figure. If more revenues 
are delivered than in the previous year, the central government 
will keep a larger share of the increased portion while 
returning the rest to the local government. 
  Our 1994 budget is projected in accordance with the 
aforesaid 
guiding principles, the quotas set for Xinjiang by the national 
financial work conference, the autonomous regional economic and 
social development plan for 1994, and the requirements of the 
revenue-sharing system. Our targets are: revenues, 2.448 
billion yuan, up 9.86 percent or 220 million yuan from the 
comparable, readjusted 1993 revenues of 2.227 billion yuan; 
expenditures, 6.615 billion yuan, an increase of 27.21 percent 
or 1.415 billion yuan over the 1993 base figure (excluding the 
spendings defrayed by special central fundings and the spendings 
on wage increase in the fourth quarter) if calculated in terms 
of comparable items. 
  (1) The autonomous region's major revenue targets in 1994 
are: industrial and commercial taxes, 2.064 billion yuan; five 
agricultural taxes, 212 million yuan; enterprise income tax, 408 
million yuan; subsidies [source not further clarified] for 
state- owned enterprises which suffer losses, 394 million yuan; 
and other incomes, 60 million yuan. 
  In arranging the above revenue targets, we have taken into 
consideration such favorable factors as increased production and 
commodity circulation. At the same time, we have also 
considered some policies which will decrease the revenues. 
According to our estimate, we expect to increase the business 
tax revenue by approximately 100 million yuan this year. We 
also expect to increase the resource tax by approximately 100 
million yuan due to increased crude oil output, and collect some 
30 million yuan more in agricultural tax due to higher prices of 
agricultural products. This shows that the 1994 budget is 
properly projected. 
  (2) Major expenditure targets are: capital construction, 400 
million yuan; enterprise transformation, 93 million yuan; 
support for agricultural production, 217 million yuan; operating 
expenses of agricultural, animal husbandry, forestry, water, and 
gas departments, 442 million yuan; operating expenses for 
cultural, education and public health departments, 2.456 billion 
yuan -- of which the education department will receive 1.534 
billion yuan; operation expenses for science undertakings, 80 
million yuan; administrative expenses, 1.345 billion yuan; and 
expenses for the work of public security, the procuratorate and 
the judiciary, 451 million yuan. 
  The additional expenditures for 1994 include the additional 
budget of 915 million yuan for wage reform (assessed on the 
basis of wage increases for 12 months) -- which has been 
incorporated with allotments for various administrative projects 
-- and 500 million yuan for hiring additional personnel. This 
year's allotments for various administrative projects have grown 
by a fairly large percentage, primarily because of higher wages. 
  (3) Views about arrangements for the regional treasury's 
receipts and payments in 1994: 
  1. The regional treasury's receipts in 1994 will be 1.7 
million yuan in the red. Among the receipts will be 115 million 
yuan from business taxes, 130 million yuan from state 
enterprises' income taxes, and 290 million yuan for subsidizing 
state enterprises' losses, which are permitted by policy. 
  2. The regional treasury's budgetary payments in 1993 will 
be 
1.631 billion yuan (certain budgets will be allotted to local 
authorities). This includes 1.437 billion yuan of basic 
expenditures -- same as those in 1993 -- 154 million yuan for 
wage increase, 20 million yuan for law enforcement, and 20 
million yuan for enterprises' technological upgrading. 
  3. The amount of money available for the region's use in 
1994 
will be 1.524 billion yuan after the subsidies for lower 
authorities have been deducted from the region's revenues, which 
also include the central government's regular subsidies and tax 
refunds; but because of the 1.631 billion yuan of budgetary 
expenses, there will be a deficit of 107 million yuan. 
  It must be pointed out here that the region's expenditures 
for 1994 are based on the basic budgets in early 1993, plus 154 
million yuan for wage increase and an additional 40 million yuan 
for law enforcement and technological upgrading, and not on the 
basis of budgetary expenditures in 1993. Budgets for certain 
essential expenses in 1994 are not arranged. 
<H5>  3. Strive To Accomplish the Autonomous Region's 1994 </H5>
Budgetary Plans by Implementing Measures for Increasing Revenues 
and Conserving Expenditures 
  To accomplish the region's budgetary plans for 1994, 
safeguard the region's social and political stability, and 
expedite the region's economic growth and development of other 
causes, we must follow through with the guidelines laid down by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
the Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fourth Xinjiang 
Regional Party Committee. Surrounding the general requirement -- 
"seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to 
the outside world, expediting development, and maintaining 
stability" -- we must give priority to accomplishing the 
following projects: 
  (1) We must speed up the pace of reform. This is the first 
year for carrying out the reform of establishing separated 
central and local taxation systems, we must positively and 
reliably carry out this and other relevant fiscal and tax reform 
projects according to the central authorities' consolidated 
plan. We must positively and reliably reform state enterprises' 
profit-sharing system, properly distribute their profits, and 
see to it that they change their operating mechanisms. We must 
manage state-owned assets more efficiently, continue to 
reappraise enterprises' stocks and assets, and determine their 
property rights, and make sure that the state's assets and 
interests are not violated. 
  (2) We must broaden the sources of financial incomes through 
supporting the development of production. All localities and 
departments must continue to attach great importance to 
supporting agricultural production and animal husbandry. They 
should do their best to increase investments in agriculture and 
animal husbandry as well as in the development of agricultural 
projects which yield a high output of quality products, and 
actively support the development of secondary and tertiary 
industries in rural areas, especially the development of village 
and town enterprises. We must continue to attach importance to 
enterprises' technological upgrading and assist them to improve 
their production technology, operations, and management so that 
they can become more competitive in the market. We must 
energetically support the development of local trade and border 
trade. All localities should give full scope to their resources 
so that their rich resources can be turned into economic 
strength and financial resources. 
  (3) We must ensure a sustained and steady increase of taxes 
through tightening tax collection and management. All 
localities and departments must earnestly implement the "Tax 
Collection and Management Law," we must do our work strictly in 
accordance with regulations, and collect taxes according to the 
established tax rates. While exercising strict control over tax 
deductions and exemptions, we must make great efforts in 
screening delinquent tax payments. In accordance with the tax 
law, we must strictly handle individuals and units which have 
evaded or contested tax payments, and we must make sure that all 
small tax loopholes are plugged and all taxes are delivered to 
the treasury in full. 
  (4) We must intensify control over our budgets and spend 
money rationally. To uphold the solemnity of budgets, all 
localities and departments must carry out their projects 
according to budget availability, and uphold the principle that 
receipts and payments are uniformly controlled, and that large 
receipts and payments must be collectively decided. Considering 
the current financial difficulties and financial capabilities, 
and in accordance with the principle of making overall plans and 
taking all factors into consideration, all localities and 
departments must rationally spend their funds according to 
urgency and priority. Payment of workers' wages must have 
precedence over various other expenditures, and expenses for 
combating disasters, relief services, and medical services must 
be ensured. We must tighten the management of nonappropriated 
funds, continue to audit the receipt and payment of all units' 
nonappropriated funds, and encourage all units to make up 
insufficient budgets with their nonappropriated funds. 
  (5) We must adopt strict measures for increasing revenues 
and conserving expenditures and count on society to tide over 
financial difficulties with concerted efforts. We must heighten 
our sense of reform, properly solve our needs this year with 
unconventional methods, and firmly stop unwarranted projects 
that increase spending and reduce income. To ensure a sustained 
growth of revenues, all localities and departments must 
energetically develop production, and make positive efforts to 
achieve higher economic returns and explore financial resources. 
Meanwhile, we must strictly control expenditures. We must 
strictly control the size of capital construction projects, stop 
authorizing new construction projects and all types of office 
buildings, auditoriums, guesthouses, and activity centers. We 
must adopt specific measures to curtail expenses for meetings, 
strictly control establishment of additional organs and 
expansion of authorized staff sizes, and correct the impropriety 
of giving out unwarranted cash awards and allowances. We must 
tighten management of budgets for public-funded medical services 
to stop waste while making sure that sick people will receive 
medical attention. Administrative units and institutions 
throughout Xinjiang must have special bank accounts to ensure 
the availability of money for wages. Effective measures must be 
taken to stop certain wasteful practices to which the masses 
have responded strongly. We must firmly stop the improper 
tendency of purchasing luxury cars, and firmly stop the use of 
public funds for housing renovations that exceed established 
standards. 
  We are confronted with a very grim financial situation this 
year. To tide over the difficulties, we must adopt some strict 
measures for increasing revenues and conserving expenditures, 
but this certainly will affect the interests of some departments 
and units. So that the measures for increasing revenues and 
conserving expenditures can be effectively carried out, we need 
the understanding and support of all social quarters. Leading 
cadres at all levels, in particular, must set personal examples 
in this regard. 
  Fellow deputies, Xinjiang's financial problems have become 
even worse this year. To alleviate the problems, society as a 
whole must continue to support financial retrenchment projects; 
have a clear view on the financial situation; understand the 
need to lead a plain life, work diligently and thriftily, 
consider the overall needs, help one another, and tighten our 
belts; and give financial departments the support they need in 
attaining their goals. Under the correct guidance of the 
regional party committee, and with the supervision and support 
of people's congresses in Xinjiang, we must count on people of 
all nationalities in our region, earnestly follow the guidelines 
laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and those by the Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of 
the Fourth Xinjiang Regional Party Committee, stop empty talk, 
and work earnestly and practically to accomplish all budgetary 
assignments of our autonomous region this year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- The Mainland-based 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) today 
sent a letter to the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF) reporting on the findings on the extraordinarily big case 
of robbery, murder and arson on Qiandao Lake and informing the 
SEF that the mainland's public security authorities are still 
investigating the case in order to gather further information 
about it following which ARATS will report to its Taiwan 
counterpart. 
  The letter said that according to early findings, Wu Lihong, 
male, aged 22 and Hu Zhihan, male, aged 24, both from Chunan 
County in Zhejiang Province together with Yu Aijun, male, aged 
23, from Jiande City in Zhejiang Province, conspired last year 
to plan robberies on pleasure boats. The three criminals 
carried out observations in Anhui Province and on Qiandao Lake 
in Zhejiang Province selecting their target boats and making 
ready a motorized boat, hunting guns, explosives and gasoline to 
carry out a robbery. 
  The public security authorities seized their booty such as 
video cameras and cameras. The details of the crime confessed 
to by the three criminals basically matched the findings of the 
official investigation and analysis. 
  ARATS had sent an earlier letter to the SEF on April 18.

  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Eight to ten people, 
including several soldiers, were involved in the murders of 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainlanders at Lake Qiandao, 
Director-General Yin Tsung-wen of the National Security Bureau 
was quoted as saying Wednesday [20 April]. 
  At a closed-door Legislative Yuan session, Yin said Beijing 
was still trying to cover up the incident, Legislators Ting 
Shou-chung and Chen Shui-pien said after the meeting. 
  Beijing originally claimed the tourists were killed in an 
accident, but on Sunday admitted that it had arrested three 
suspects in what it said was a "heinous robbery, arson and 
murder case," although it fell short of details. 
  "The three detained by Beijing are just scapegoats," Yin was 
quoted by ting and shen as saying. "There are others connected 
with the incident who are not ordinary citizens." 
  Yin said his bureau from the start believed the victims were 
robbed and murdered, based on information gathered by informants 
in Mainland China. He said the informants reported that 
mainland President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin had set a two-week deadline for mainland police to 
complete an inquiry into the incident. The report was confirmed 
by the WEN WEI PAO, a Beijing-supported newspaper in Hong Kong, 
on Tuesday. 
  Yin said his bureau will publish the information it has 
obtained before Beijing begins its trial of the three suspects 
as a way of pressing Beijing to be more forthcoming. 
  The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
(ARATS), Mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, in a 
letter to its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Wednesday reconfirmed the detention of the 
three. 
  ARATS said the three had been planning a tour-boat robbery 
on 
the lake since last year. It said the robbers used explosives, 
hunting rifles, and gasoline in their attack on the boat, using 
jetskis to make their getaway. 
  Belongings of the victims, including money, watches, and 
cameras, were later found at the homes of relatives of the three 
robbers, ARATS said. 
  Meanwhile, in related news, President Li Teng-hui, while 
receiving SEF President Ku Chen-fu on Wednesday morning, said 
that Beijing "is moving in the right direction on the case."

<F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan interest in 
visiting Mainland China substantially cooled in February and is 
expected to remain low in the wake of the March 31 robbery and 
murder of 24 Taiwan tourists while on a pleasure cruise of 
Qiandao Lake, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) 
said Thursday [21 April]. 
  Council statistics show that the number of Taiwan residents 
who applied for a "Taiwan Compatriot Certificate" to enter the 
mainland totaled 80,000 in February, down 31.62 percent from the 
year-earlier level. 
  MAC officials said that Taiwan residents have made more than 
6.12 million visits to the mainland since a Taiwan Government 
ban was lifted in November 1987. 
  People here were prohibited from visiting the mainland since 
the Kuomintang Government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to the Chinese Communists. 
  Currently, Taiwan residents must apply to mainland 
authorities in Hong Kong for the certificate to enter the 
mainland. 
  The officials noted that mainland travel is expected to 
remain lackluster as Taiwan residents have been enraged by 
Beijing's callous handling of the Qiandao Lake murders and the 
local tourist industry has launched a drive to boycott tours to 
the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will meet the four 
requirements set by a United Nations wildlife protection 
organization by the end of September, a Council of Agriculture 
(COA) official said Thursday [21 April]. 
  The UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) has asked Taiwan to make an inventory of all 
rhino horns, consolidate all rhino horn and tiger bone 
stockpiles, pass legislation to mete out harsher penalties for 
those involved in illicit wildlife product trade and effectively 
enforce all related wildlife conservation laws and regulations. 
  "We are determined to meet CITES requirements by the end of 
September," COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said. 
  CITES will decide whether to sanction Taiwan for its alleged 
failure to eliminate illicit rhino horn and tiger bone trade in 
November. 
  "We hope our effort will spare Taiwan from CITES trade 
sanctions," Lin noted. 
  The COA will push the Legislative Yuan to pass a package of 
amendments to the country's wildlife conservation law, which 
propose stricter penalties for offenders, by the end of June. 
  "If the revised law can be passed soon, the United States 
may 
also lessen its trade sanctions against Taiwan," Lin said. 
  The Clinton administration decided to sanction Taiwan over 
wildlife conservation issues early this month. The decision 
will take effect within a month. 
  The COA has proposed a three-year plan for wildlife 
conservation, which will be implemented after being approved by 
the cabinet. 
  Under the plan, the government will spend NT [new Taiwan]$1 
billion (US$37.74 million) over the next three years to enforce 
the consolidation of rhino horn and tiger bone stockpiles, 
intensify the crackdown on smuggling of endangered species, 
increase conservation education and international conservation 
cooperation, establish an identification system for wildlife and 
wildlife products and a wildlife data bank, and train 
conservation specialists.

  [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] has ordered its 
representative office in Indonesia to help protect the safety of 
Taiwan businessmen there in the wake of a labor riot in the 
northern Sumatran city of Medan, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
spokesman had said. Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the 
Ministry's Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, said 
the ROC has expressed its concern about the Medan labor rioting 
to the Indonesian government and has ordered the ROC 
representative office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for 
Taiwan businessmen there. 
  According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest 
at 
a Medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last 
Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the 
economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops, and cars in 
Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one 
person was reportedly killed. 
  Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office 
in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and 
life there has begun to return to normal.

  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will continue to 
promote agricultural cooperation with Indonesia despite recent 
violent labor protests in Medan which later turned into a 
highly- charged race riot against the economically dominant 
ethnic Chinese, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday 
[21 April]. 
  "Agricultural cooperation will help boost economic 
development in rural Indonesia, so it should not be affected by 
the anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment in some Indonesian cities or 
areas," said Chiu Yung-chung, director of the COA's Secretariat. 
  "As Taiwan has a wealth of experience in agricultural 
development, Indonesia can benefit from cooperation with 
Taiwan," he noted. 
  The cabinet-level council held a meeting to discuss the 
promotion of agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian 
countries under the government's "southern strategy" which 
encourages Taiwan businessmen to increase investment in 
Southeast Asia instead of Mainland China. 
  The meeting decided that the council will organize a 
delegation of agricultural experts and business executives to 
visit Indonesia in June to seek possible cooperative projects 
there. 
  Chiu said most COA officials agreed that Taiwan should 
continue deep-sea fishing cooperation with Indonesia and that 
shrimp raising has great market potential in that country. 
  The COA will also encourage Taiwan manufacturers to invest 
in 
fruit juice and sweetmeats production in Indonesia, Chiu noted. 
  Meanwhile, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official urged 
local businessmen to carefully choose suitable locations before 
they invest in Indonesia. 
  "Taiwan investors should choose regions where racism is less 
serious and study local customs and culture in order to avoid 
unnecessary troubles," the official said. 
  He pointed out although Indonesia has several advantages to 
attract foreign investors, such as abundant natural resources 
and labor force, foreign entrepreneurs face a host of problems 
there, including persistent racism in some regions, a widening 
gap between the rich and the poor, growing sentiment for labor 
rights, red tape and factional squabbling within its government 
agencies. 
  The official suggested that prospective Taiwan investors 
choose suitable Indonesian or Overseas Chinese joint-venture 
partners and seek to develop good relations with relevant 
Indonesian officials. 
  Taiwan companies there should also promote as many 
Indonesians as possible to factory management positions in order 
to better understand the mentality of Indonesian workers, he 
added. 
  Ethnic Chinese account for only 4 percent of the total 
Indonesian population, but control 70 percent of the country's 
economy. Ethnic Chinese, however, have little voice in the 
Indonesian political arenas because of legal restrictions. 
  "It will be worthwhile to see how ethnic Chinese will 
increase their clout in Indonesia's policy-making process," the 
official said.

  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Egypt has expressed a 
strong desire to strengthen bilateral trade and economic 
relations with Taiwan, P.K. Chiang, minister of economics 
affairs said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Chiang made the comment after returning to Taiwan from a 
three- day visit to Egypt April 17-19. Chiang said he told his 
Egyptian hosts that resuming direct Taiwan-Egypt airlinks and 
setting up liaison offices in both countries would effectively 
strengthen bilateral ties. 
  During an April 18 meeting with Chiang, the Egyptian 
Industrial and Business Federation said it hoped to attract more 
Taiwan tourists to the north African country, the minister said. 
  The federation also accepted Chiang's invitation to take 
part 
in the Fourth Republic of China [ROC] import fair scheduled to 
open in Taipei in October, Chiang said. 
  Chiang noted that the Egyptian Government is working to 
prevent further decline in its large tourism industry by 
improving the commercial and investment climate, liberalizing 
currency exchange and cutting inflation. 
  Before visiting Egypt, Chiang attended a General Agreement 
on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ministerial meeting in Morocco.

  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work together 
with a European bank to strengthen ties with East European 
countries, the International Economic Cooperation Development 
Fund under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Wednesday 
[20 April]. 
  A spokesman for the fund said that a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) between Taiwan and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was signed in St. 
Petersburg, Russia Tuesday [19 April] during the bank's third 
annual meeting. 
  Taiwan Representative in Belgium Lu Chao-chung and Bank 
President Jacques de Larosiere inked the MOU, under which the 
fund pledges to earmark U.S.$20 million to help finance economic 
reform projects in East European countries, he noted. 
  Both sides agreed to the cooperative ties in February when 
Governor Samuel Shieh of the Central Bank of China met with de 
Laros in Paris, he added. 
  The first loan project will go to an airport navigation 
system in Riga, Latvia, he pointed out. 
  The spokesman pledged that the fund will provide more 
financial assistance to East European countries in line with the 
government's strategy to promote cooperation with that part of 
the world. 
  Established in 1988, the fund plays a key role in supplying 
financial and technical assistance to developing countries 
friendly to Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The International 
Economic Cooperation Development Fund will extend more than 
U.S.$30 million in Taiwan loans and assistance to Nicaragua, 
Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland as part of President Li 
Teng-hui's planned visit to the four nations next month, a fund 
spokesman said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Li's tour will take him to Managua, Nicaragua May 4; San 
Jose, Costa Rica May 6; Pretoria, South Africa May 8; and 
Mbabane, Swaziland May 12. Li, who will attend presidential 
inauguration ceremonies in Costa Rica and South Africa, is 
scheduled to return to Taipei May 15. 
  Nicaragua will receive U.S.$1 million in financial support 
from the fund for development of its small and medium 
businesses, while food processing, wood furniture, shoemaking, 
and garment experts will be sent to the country to offer their 
expertise, the spokesman said. 
  The fund will also grant a soft loan of U.S.$15 million to 
Costa Rican banks for financing that country's export-oriented 
small and medium enterprises, he pointed out, adding that the 
loan ceiling for each company is set at U.S.$100,000. 
  For South Africa, he said, a low-interest loan of U.S.$15 
million will be extended to help finance small farms, while 
Swaziland will be given assistance with an airport expansion 
project and the purchase of new airliners. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the fund decided to grant a U.S.$20 
million soft loan to El Salvador to finance its power 
distribution system in line with Premier Lien Chan's expected 
visit to that country in early June. Lien's visit has yet to be 
officially announced. 
  The fund, established in 1988 under the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, plays a key role in supplying financial and technical 
assistance to developing countries friendly to Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan's heavy industry 
production value accounted for 61.8 percent of total 
manufacturing value in 1993, up 11.4 percent from six years ago, 
according to government statistics released Tuesday [19 April]. 
  In [word indistinct] heavy industry production value totaled 
NT$3.1 trillion (US$117.5 billion), up from NT$1.9 trillion 
(US$72 billion) in 1987, a Directorate General of Budget, 
Accounting and Statistics (DGOAS) official said. 
  The average 7.9 percent annual industrial growth recorded 
during the six-year period was due to increased productivity and 
competitiveness fueled by a move to raise value-added 
production, the official added. 
  The statistics also revealed that Taiwan's economy, after 
many years of fast growth, has moved from a labor-intensive to a 
technology-intensive one, the official eaid. 
  He attributed the transformation to a recent mass relocation 
of labor-intensive industries overseas. 
  As the low-cost labor-intensive industries shifted to newly- 
emerging economies such as Mainland China and Southeast Asian 
countries, Taiwan's dependence on such industries also 
decreased, the DGOAS official said.

  [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- Both foreign investments 
in Taiwan and Taiwan investments abroad saw significant 
increases in the first quarter of this year, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs reported Tuesday [19 April]. 
  Foreign investments in Taiwan, which included investments 
made by foreign nationals and overseas Chinese, soared 49 
percent to top US$273.22 million in the first three months of 
1994, officials from the ministry's Investment Commission said. 
  Of incoming foreign investments, capital from Hong Kong 
increased two times to top the list. It was followed by 
investments from the United States, Japan and Europe, commission 
officials said. 
  In terms of industries, investments in chemical processing 
jumped 1.4 times to lead the pack. Service industries and 
international trade followed with strong rises of 100 percent. 
  Meanwhile, investments made by Taiwan businesses overseas 
rose 66 percent in the first quarter of this year. 
  The commission's statistics showed that officially approved 
Taiwan investments abroad totaled US$530 million in the first 
quarter with investments in the United States taking the lion's 
share of the total outbound investments. 
  Taiwan investments in Singapore grew 327-fold during the 
three-month period while those to Thailand advanced 66 percent. 
  Taiwan investments in Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and 
Indonesia all dropped during the period by percentages ranging 
from 77 to 43 percent, the commission said. They noted that the 
drop in investment in Southeast Asia came before the 
government's "southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan 
investment in the region, went into full force. 
  Taiwan investments in the United States also plunged in the 
first quarter, dropping 92 percent or US$240 million to total a 
mere US$260 million, the commission reported. 
  During the first three months, the ROC Government approved 
$246 million of indirect investments in Mainland China by Taiwan 
investors. The commission reported that the approved amounts 
were for 314 investment project. It should be noted that much 
of Taiwan investment on the mainland is not registered or 
approved by the ROC Government. 
  Shanghai was favored by Taiwan investors, who put US$35.65 
million into the biggest city in Eastern China in the first 
three months this year. Other cities which absorbed Taiwan 
investments were Tungguan, Shenzhen and Xiamen in Southern China 
and Tianjin in Northern China. 
  By industries, basic metal processing and metalware 
manufacturing industries led the list and followed by food 
processing, beverage, electronics and electrical appliances, and 
precision instrument industries.

  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan's strategy to 
promote strategic alliances with world-renowned multinational 
companies has begun to pay off as domestic computer products are 
making inroads into the Japanese market. 
  Shu Liang, president of Mitac Inc., said Thursday [21 April] 
that his company will soon deliver 1,000 industrial computers to 
Tokyo's Narita International Airport. Mitac is a leading 
computer manufacturer in Taiwan. 
  The computer deal is part of an international procurement 
contract won by the US-based Westinghouse Co., which entered 
into a strategic alliance with Mitac last August, Shu said. 
  The computers, which will boost Narita's information control 
equipment, are designed and produced by Mitac with technical 
assistance from Westinghouse, he elaborated. 
  Previously, he added, such computers were wholly 
manufactured 
by Westinghouse. 
  The business executive saw bright prospects in the 
cooperative ties, saying aggregate orders from Japan for similar 
computers are expected to top 5,000 computers, or NT [new 
Taiwan]$200 million (US$7.54 million). 
  Moreover, he pointed out, the deal certainly will have a 
positive impact on Mitac's computer quality and expertise. "We 
are happy to become Westinghouse' partner in the Asia-Pacific 
region," he said. 
  Mitac and Westinghouse hosted a seminar on information 
technology in Taipei last month to explore the great market 
potential here, he noted.

  [Text] Two more countries are imposing travel restrictions 
on people who use the British National Overseas (BNO) passport. 
Latest figures from the government show that the number of 
countries allowing visa-free access for short stays has dropped 
from 72 to 70, as Austria and Spain join the ranks. The league 
table of visa-free travel for Asian passport-holders now shows 
Hong Kong slipping even further behind developed countries in 
the region. 
  South Korean passport holders can travel without a visa to 
82 
countries worldwide, Malaysians to 86 destinations, and people 
with Singaporean documents can go visa-free to 94 nations. UK 
British passport holders can visit 128 countries without visas. 
  But Simon Vickers, principal assistant secretary for 
security, said the situation was still "encouraging" and would 
improve further once agreement with China was reached -- over 
passport and right of abode -- due to Hong Kong travellers' good 
reputations. The concern many countries had was over 
"returnability" -- what happens if something goes wrong and a 
traveller has to be sent back which could feasibly involve three 
governments, Britain, Hong Kong and China, he told the 
Legislative Council's subcommittee on nationality. "There is no 
precedent for this in international law: Two sovereign states, 
one responsible for right of abode, the other responsible for 
the travel document," he said. 
  The Immigration Department was continuing efforts to gain 
visa- free travel for BNO passport holders and wanted to make 
the same representation on the proposed special administrative 
region [SAR] passports which would be issued after 1997. 
"Unfortunately, as you know, there has been little progress on 
the talks on the proposed SAR passport through the Joint Liaison 
Group on this," Vickers said. "We are behind time but we can 
catch up," he said. 
  Legislators said the government should aim at countries 
which 
allowed visa-free travel to the territory's neighbours and 
encourage those nations to lift restrictions on people 
travelling from Hong Kong. A legislator, Howard Young, said: 
"We should watch this like a hawk." 
  The Government is being inundated with applications from 
people seeking the BNO document. A higher-than-expected number 
of requests -- 298,815 -- came from the latest age group, those 
born November 1962 and 1966, in the latest phase which closed on 
March 31. About 84 per cent of those eligible had applied.

  [Text] Beijing would not have any access to information on 
applicants for the British Nationality Selection Scheme (BNSS) 
after its resumption of sovereignty, the head of security said 
yesterday. Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey said 
information provided by BNSS applicants would be transferred to 
London and kept confidential after 1997. Neither Beijing nor 
the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government would have 
access to the information, Mr Asprey said. 
  The comment is expected to annoy Beijing as deputy director 
of the Xinhua News Agency, Zhang Junsheng, has warned the 
British Government that it had no right to take away any 
information from the territory after 1997. 
  Mr Asprey said information on successful applicants would be 
sent to the British Government for record purposes, while that 
of rejected applicants would be destroyed. 
  Legislators also urged the government to clarify whether 
passports issued to successful BNSS applicants could be 
differentiated from those of other British nationals. 
Independent legislator Jimmy McGregor was worried that public 
confidence could be undermined if there were ways for China to 
distinguish the identity of a successful applicant from his 
passport number. But Mr Asprey reiterated that there would not 
be any distinction on the passports issued. 
  The Security Branch is discussing the definition of Chinese 
nationals and the issue of right of abode after 1997 with the 
Chinese authorities. It will also seek to clarify what Chinese 
laws will be applicable to Hong Kong citizens after China's 
resumption of sovereignty.

  [Text] The Government will not favour journalists when it 
allocates the 3,600 unfilled places in the final phase of the 
British Nationality Selection Scheme. 
  Legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing, a former journalist, asked at 
a Legislative Council nationality committee meeting yesterday 
whether the government would consider granting more British 
passports to journalists to allay fears triggered by the recent 
trial of reporter Xi Yang. Xi was sentenced to 12 years' jail 
by mainland authorities for "stealing state secrets," prompting 
vehement local protests. 
  News editors and journalists are among one of the more 
competitive occupational groups in the final phase of the scheme. 
  There have been 244 applications for the 45 places on offer 
in this category, which means fewer than one in five applicants 
can succeed. 
  Government statistics show that only 194 applications were 
received for the 3,811 "sensitive service class" places, leaving 
more than 3,600 places to be reallocated. Deputy Secretary for 
Security Keith Kwok Kakeung said the remaining allocations would 
be considered on a case-by-case basis. Mr Kwok said legislation 
stipulated that priority be given to those whose work was 
considered in the interests of the Hong Kong Government. He 
said it would be difficult for the Government to favour all 
journalists who applied. 
  The Government would have a clearer picture of the final 
allocations by the end of the year. Applications for the second 
phase closed on March 31, drawing 41,567 applicants for a total 
of 13,156 places. The first phase of the scheme began in 
December 1990 and ended on January 1, 1994. 
  Meanwhile, eight China-appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers 
have made a plea for the immediate release of Xi. They said the 
secret trial of Xi had infringed his lawful rights, dealt a 
heavy blow to public confidence in China's judiciary and 
deepened public worries and fears over press freedom. The eight 
are Anthony Cheung Bing- leung, Lee Kai-ming, Yuk Tak-fun, Lau 
Kong-wah, Hui Yin-fat, Chang Ka-mun, Frederick Fung Kin-kee and 
Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen. 
  They have appealed in a letter to the director of the Hong 
Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Lu Ping, and Xinhua (New China 
News Agency) boss Zhou Nan.

  [Text] About 100 Hong Kong China-beat journalists have 
joined the boycott of official mainland press tours to show 
their anger over the jailing of Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing yesterday rejected Britain's request for 
clemency for Xi, saying the incident was China's "internal 
affair" and that Xi's 12-year sentence for "spying" and stealing 
state secrets was "appropriate". 
  The protesting China-beat journalists will submit a 
statement 
to the Hong Kong branch of the official XINHUA News Agency, 
China's de facto embassy here, tomorrow. 
  The statement said the journalists were shocked by Xi's 
imprisonment because Xi's reporting style, which was described 
by China as "spying", was similar to theirs. They said they 
were also in danger of being detained. 
  The Chinese government subsidises the press tours. 
  The boycott would last until the end of May, the journalists 
said. 
  The statement also urged the Hong Kong and British 
governments to continue following Xi's case and the Chinese 
authorities to clarify the definition of "state secrets". 
  In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, replying to 
British 
Ambassador to China Robin MacLaren's appeal for clemency for Xi, 
said: "The Chinese judicial departments' trial of Xi Yang 
according to law is China's internal affair." 
  The United States has also voiced its concern over Xi's 
jailing.

  [Text] Legislators have rejected a call to offer China 
additional funds for the new airport as a last-ditch bid to 
break the Sino-British impasse over airport financing. The 
Legislative Council [Legco] last night voted 23-18 against the 
Liberal Party's proposal calling on the government to consider 
further funding on top of the $60.3 billion it has already 
offered China for the $158 billion project. 
  Legislators also failed to reach consensus on calls for the 
government to submit its fourth airport financing package to 
Legco for approval. But there was cross-party support for an 
early resolution of the airport funding row, which could delay 
completion of Chek Lap Kok Airport until after 1997. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said it was too early 
to preempt China's decision by offering more funds. "Would the 
taxpayer think it is in his best interest?" he said. "We need 
to strike a sensible balance. The need now is to get on with 
talks on the fourth financing proposal." 
  British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials have been meeting 
to discuss the funding package. But Sir Hamish said they did 
not expect the long-awaited meeting of the Sino-British airport 
committee to take place for some time. He said China was still 
seeking details of the financing package before making a final 
decision. 
  Sources say the government is willing to inject more equity 
into the airport in order to reach agreement with China. 
  Liberal Party legislator Steven Poon said an early agreement 
was vital for Hong Kong's future and the government should not 
delay by arguing over equity injection. 
  Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said Hong Kong was 
losing billions of dollars because flights were being turned 
away from the overcrowded Kai Tak airport. 
  With the government estimating that Hong Kong's reserves 
will 
reach $120 billion by March 1997, Mr Poon said it could easily 
afford more money for the airport. 
  But the United Democrats opposed the move and called on 
legislators to condemn both the British and Chinese Governments 
for turning the airport into a political issue. 
  Meeting Point legislator Fred Li said both Britain and China 
were embroiled in political wrangling, ignoring the views of 
Hong Kong people. His motion, which called on the government to 
submit its funding plan for public debate through Legco, was 
defeated by a narrow margin when council president John Swaine 
had to cast the deciding vote.

<F P=106> ["Manifesto" announcing the establishment of the Democratic </F>
Party issued by the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting 
Point in Hong Kong on 18 April] 
  [Text] After serious deliberations, the central committees 
of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point have 
agreed in principle to jointly initiate a new political party -- 
the Democratic Party. 
  The major aim of the Democratic Party is to further unite 
the 
democratic forces in Hong Kong to shoulder the responsibility 
for the future of Hong Kong. 
  At this crucial moment, we sincerely appeal to the citizens 
of Hong Kong to unite together and support the Democratic Party 
in its pursuit of a high degree of autonomy and an open and 
democratic government for Hong Kong. 
  The Democratic Party believes that: 
  -- Hong Kong is an indivisible part of China. We support 
the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China. 
  -- The practice of "one country, two systems," a high degree 
of autonomy, and the establishment of a democratic government in 
Hong Kong are the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. This will 
help to contribute to the stability of Hong Kong, and foster the 
development of China. 
  -- We care for China and, as part of the Chinese citizenry, 
we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment 
on the affairs of China. 
  -- We will seek to represent and articulate the views of the 
people of Hong Kong about Chinese government policies related to 
or having an impact on Hong Kong. 
  -- Democracy is the prerequisite for Hong Kong to establish 
a high degree of autonomy and is a natural consequence of the 
termination of the British colonial rule. 
  -- Democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law are 
the foundations for progress and prosperity in a modern society. 
In Hong Kong, it is necessary to speed up the development of a 
democratic system of government, to strengthen the protection of 
freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. 
  -- That to maintain free and fair competition in our market 
economy, it is necessary for Hong Kong to develop and maintain 
appropriate monitoring systems, a reasonable and stable tax 
system, a sound legal system, and a corruption-free and 
accountable government. 
  -- Economic prosperity depends on the concerted efforts of 
investors, labour, professionals, government, and all members of 
society. The creation of wealth is the prerequisite for social 
development, and the ultimate objective of the creation of 
wealth is that all members of society may share the fruit of 
their economic success. 
  -- That to foster the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, 
to promote social justice, and to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination, Hong Kong needs to develop strong and healthy 
education, medical, housing, labour, social welfare and social 
security systems, and the assurance of equal opportunities of 
participation and development of personal talents. 
  -- That to ensure continuous supply of natural resources, 
long- term social development and the protection of the 
livelihood of our future generations, we should protect and 
develop our living environment. 
  The Democratic Party is a local political party which is 
devoted to the affairs of Hong Kong and cares about China. Hong 
Kong is our home. 
  We are willing to serve Hong Kong and China, and wish 
democracy, progress, and prosperity for Hong Kong and China. 
  We firmly believe that public support is the foundation of 
the Democratic Party and the public's will is our will. We 
truly believe that to realise the basic principles of the 
Democratic Party we must unite all citizens of Hong Kong, and 
join with others who share this common goal to face future 
challenges. 
  The Democratic Party welcomes all who share the same beliefs 
to join with us in building a better future for Hong Kong.

  [Text] The senior echelons of the civil service are 
facing a serious lack of experience in the run-up to 1997 as the 
Government prepares for a new set of leaders to bring it in line 
with Basic Law requirements. At least 20 of the 56 most senior 
officers, ranging from policy secretaries to heads of 
department, are expected to leave the service before 1997. 
Either they are due to retire or their nationality does not 
meet the requirement of the Basic Law, barring them from taking 
principal official positions. 
  The rapid thinning-out of experience in the next two years 
is 
understood to be a key concern for the Secretary for the Civil 
Service, Michael Sze Cho-cheung, as he plans future leadership. 
  Senior expatriate officers, whose prospects have been 
blocked 
by locals, are said to be ready to opt for the Government's 
special compensation scheme and leave the service before 1997. 
The Civil Service Branch is understood to have given top 
priority to making the necessary changes now to minimise the 
impact later. Vacancies will be filled by accelerated promotion 
for many junior officers, even though such promotion might not 
normally be considered desirable. 
  Although only policy secretaries with foreign nationalities 
are required by the Basic Law to step down, it is understood the 
administration is fully aware also of the possibility of an 
exodus of lower-level expatriate staff as their promotion 
prospects are affected. 
  At least three senior expatriate staff have been told their 
contracts will not be renewed when they expire late next year or 
early in 1996. They include Deputy Secretary for Recreation and 
Culture Rachel Cartland, Deputy Secretary for Economic Services 
Elizabeth Bosher, and Deputy Secretary for Security Ken 
Woodhouse. 
  The Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, Principal Assistant 
Secretary for Security Barbara Ellington who specialises in 
defence matters, and senior research officer at the Political 
Adviser's Office, Ken Walker, are also expected to return to the 
British civil service before 1997. 
  Others at the level immediately below policy secretary whose 
promotion will be blocked include Director of Administration 
Richard Hoare, Director-General of Trade Tony Miller, Director 
of Social Welfare Ian Strachan, and Postmaster-General Mike 
Pagliari. They are expected to leave to make room for locals to 
move up the hierarchy.

  [Text] Hong Kong's various liberal groups are considering 
whether to join the new Democratic Party, which will be formed 
in October. 
  Only one day after the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) 
and Meeting Point announced their merger to form a new 
prodemocracy flagship, several parties have shown interest in at 
least cooperating with the new party. 
  The vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and 
People's Livelihood (ADPL), Leung Kwong-cheung, said his group 
informed Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung 
yesterday that they would be interested in taking part in the 
preparation for the Democratic Party. Mr Leung quoted Mr Cheung 
as saying he would consider the ADPL's proposal but did not say 
when he would give a reply. He said the ADPL had started 
consulting its members about a possible move to join the new 
party. 
  The Hong Kong Democratic Foundation (HKDF) chairman Patrick 
Shiu Kin-ying said he had also started consulting members about 
joining the new party. He said the idea of merging with other 
democratic parties had been been raised a few months ago but was 
shelved because there had been divergent voices within the 
group. 
  Admitting that some members preferred to join the pro-China 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, rather than 
the "subversive" UDHK, Mr Shiu expected that their worries in 
cooperating with the new party would be eased. "The composition 
of the new party will successfully break Chinese isolation to 
the pro- democracy bloc. I am very optimistic that members will 
receive it with great interest," he said. However, he said the 
HKDF would have to decide in what form it would join the 
Democratic Party. 
  He said it was possible that the HKDF would remain as a 
separate entity and take the role of a think tank and a support 
group for the new party. The newly formed 123 Democratic 
Alliance has not decided whether to join the Democratic Party, 
but will continue to look at the development of the local 
political scene. 
  Vice-chairman Willy Ng Wai-cho said the alliance however, 
did 
not rule out the possibility of joining the Democratic Party. 
  The Hong Kong Affairs Society chairman Gerry Wai Ka-cheung 
said he would support its members joining the Democratic Party.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A new political 
organization - the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance - came into 
being here today. 
  Five convenors of the Alliance Yu Sun Say, Ambrose Lau Hon 
Chuen, Fanny Lai Ip Po Ping, Carson Wen and Au Yeung Sing Shiu 
jointly made the announcement at a press conference here this 
afternoon. 
  The organizing committee of the Alliance, comprising 52 Hong 
Kong businessmen and professionals, is ready to admit founding 
members and plans to take part in the 1994 and 1995 elections at 
all levels in the territory. 
  Ambrose Lau Hon Chuen said after 1997, China will implement 
the policy of "one country, two systems" in the Hong Kong 
Special Adminstrative Region which will then be governed by the 
Hong Kong people with a high degree of autonomy. 
  "The committee believes that those who wish to stay in Hong 
Kong and take part in the building of the territory's future 
should organize themselves to participate in political 
activities to ensure the effective implementation of the 
said-policies and a smooth transition, and to maintain the 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong," Lau said. 
  He noted that the Alliance advocates the importance of 
building a good relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese 
Mainland and to create a stable environment for businessmen to 
invest in Hong Kong. 
  Lau stated that his organization promotes communication with 
the mainland, and intends to adopt an open and positive attitude 
in giving constructive views to the Chinese leaders on matters 
relating to Hong Kong. 
  The alliance supports the development of a democratic 
government, but takes a pragmatic approach and gives due 
consideration to the historical situation, lau said, adding it 
believes that democratic development should follow the 
principles of even participation and orderly progress, so as not 
to unduly disrupt the harmony and stability of the society. 
  In another development, two other organizations - the United 
Democrats of Hong Kong and meeting point - announced on Monday 
[18 April] that they would merge to form a single party - the 
Democratic Party in Hong Kong in October.

  [Text] Prominent territory businessmen and professionals 
closely affiliated with Beijing announced their own political 
party yesterday - the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. The new 
party is expected to add weight to Hong Kong's pro-China camp 
and complement the role of the Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which has a stronger grass-roots 
flavour. 
  The Progessive Alliance vowed to participate fully in 
district board, municipal councils and Legislative Council 
elections. Its founders stressed its political stance was 
neutral. 
  Topping the list on the founding committee of 52 are 
Beijing- 
appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers, Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates, and prominent 
businessmen who enjoy a good relationship with China. They 
include Henry Cheng Kar-shun, managing director of New World 
Development Company and a CPPCC delegate; Henry Wu King-cheong, 
a Hong Kong affairs adviser and the vice chairman of the Hong 
Kong Gold Exchange; Wong Seesum, managing director of Hong Tai 
Travel; and Yu Kwok-chun, owner of the Yue Hwa Chinese Products 
department store and a Hong Kong affairs adviser. 
  Other Beijing advisers among the organisers are: Ambrose Lau 
Hon-chuen, chairman of the Central and Western District Board; 
Carson Wen, a local delegate of the People's Congress of 
Guangdong Province; and Jose Yu Sun-say and Sze Chi-ching, both 
CPPCC delegates. 
  The list of organising members also includes delegates of 
the 
Chinese National People's Congress and two district affairs 
advisers. However, party convenor Mr Lau rejected the pro-China 
label for the party and said it would stand up for the interests 
of Hong Kong. "It's better to judge from what we do to see 
whether we are a pro-China or pro-Hong Kong group," he said. 
  He denied reports that the party had been groomed by 
officials of Xinhua (the New China News Agency) but admitted 
Xinhua had been told informally of the intention to form the 
party. 
  Yesterday's announcement of the launch was attended by 
mainland media including the Chinese Central Television, Xinhua, 
and the semi-official China News Agency. 
  Mr Lau said that on controversial issues such as the Xi Yang 
case, the new party would seek to convey the concerns of Hong 
Kong people to China through private discussion. "We understand 
why the Hong Kong people are so (concerned about) the case and 
we will reflect this concern to the Chinese Government through 
our contacts with them." he said.

  [Text] Beijing has lent its support to Hong Kong 
manufacturers who are concerned about quota restrictions imposed 
by the European Union on toys made in China, according to 
officials of local trade organisations. A delegation led by 
Dennis Ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Toy Council and the Trade 
Development Council's toy committee, received positive feedback 
from the Chinese government during a recent visit, according to 
sources in the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. 
  "The delegation has been talking to senior Chinese officials 
including Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of the Ministry of 
Economic and Foreign Trade," the source said. "They have been 
guaranteed by Mr Gu that support will be given by Beijing."

  [Text] Less than a tenth of Hong Kong toy makers have 
obtained export licences from China despite a new regulation 
which requires them to do so by July 1. Chinese officials have 
indicated that companies which fail to produce the required 
licence will not be allowed to export toys from China. The 
majority of the 3,000-odd toy factories in Guangdong, where most 
of the country's toys are made, are owned by Hong Kong 
businessmen. 
  Dennis Woo of Hong Kong's Merchandise Testing Laboratories 
(China) said when he met with a Chinese official in charge of 
enforcing the regulation last week, that he was told only 200 
companies had obtained licences. 
  Wen Hongsheng, the deputy chief of the Guangdong 
Import-Export Commodity Inspection Bureau in Guangzhou, told Woo 
the government was serious about enforcing the regulation, which 
required toy factories to have their products and management 
system screened before an Export Toy Quality Licence was issued. 
The regulation was issued by the State Import and Export 
Commodity Inspection Bureau in mid-1992 to take effect this July. 
  Wen reportedly said the government would initially be 
"flexible" in enforcing the regulation. This was taken to mean 
that customs officers were likely to allow companies which had 
made credible efforts to obtain a licence to export their goods 
even if they had not met the deadline to get a permit. Those 
which have not made an application will almost certainly have 
their goods held back. 
  Warren Kwok, the secretary-general of the Hong Kong Toys 
Council, said yesterday he was aware many companies had not 
applied although the council issued circulars briefing its 200 
members. Kwok said the requirement was cumbersome, unnecessary, 
and could hurt the toy export business. "The toys for export to 
Europe and the United States are subject to very stringent 
requirements in those countries. There have been very few 
complaints from the importers so we don't see why the exporting 
country should start imposing restrictions on their own 
products." 
  To obtain a licence, a company needs to have its toys tested 
for safety and quality. It will also have to pass a management 
system audit conducted by Chinese officials

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 21 (AFP)--British and Chinese 
officials agreed Thursday [21 April] to release 117 hectares 
(289 acres) more of land this financial year to help contain the 
colony's property prices. This was disclosed at the end of the 
Sino-British Land Commission meeting here on Hong Kong's 1994-95 
land disposal program and comes as the government is attempting 
to contain real estate values which, property experts say, now 
rival those in Tokyo. Britain and China will release 117 
hectares (289 acres) of land for private commercial development 
and public housing -- 10 hectares (24.7 acres) less that the 
127.8 hectares (315.8 acres) released in the last fiscal year. 
  Tony Eason, head of the British team, said the team had 
"positive and cooperative" discussions on the need to ease the 
land shortage that is in part a cause of the territory's soaring 
property prices. Property prices have rise nearly 200 percent 
over the past three years, with home ownership now out of the 
reach of at least 50 percent of households. "We expect the 
market to see it as a positive step towards injecting additional 
supply into the market," Eason said. 
  Governor Chris Patten's recent pledge to act on property 
prices has triggered a 10-to-15 percent drop in asking rents 
since the Easter holiday and a 60 percent decline in recorded 
property transactions, property analysts said. Several factors 
have been cited for the rising prices, including negative 
interest rates, growing demand from young families, an influx of 
foreign companies doing business with China, and speculation by 
Chinese state firms.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee Propaganda Department, the Press and Publications 
Administration, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General 
Administration of Customs, the State Administration for Industry 
and Commerce, and the State Copyright Administration recently 
issued a joint circular urging strengthened control over the 
duplication of audio and video laser discs, as well as strict 
investigation into and severe punishment for copyright piracies. 
  In light of the current rather chaotic situation in China's 
audio [compact disc] and video laser disc production and market, 
which see copyright infringement to a certain extent, the CPC 
Central Committee Propaganda Department and the six other 
departments demand that the audio and video laser disc 
duplication business be put under the jurisdiction of 
departments directly related to the industry. All audio and 
video laser disc duplication businesses must go through the 
Press and Publications Administration's examination and obtain 
its approval and be put under day-to-day administration by the 
Press and Publications Administration as well as local 
administrative departments charged with the overseeing of the 
audio and video industry. Audio laser disc production lines 
already set up without the Press and Publications 
Administration's examination and approval are subject to a 
full-scale check conducted jointly by the relevant departments 
and the provincial, regional, and municipal administrative 
departments in charge of the audio and video industry which are 
supposed to simultaneously submit their inspection comments to 
the Press and Publications Administration and those specifically 
on foreign-invested enterprises to the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation by the end of May 1994. Those which 
are found to be operating without the necessary conditions or 
seriously violating laws and regulations will be given a 
deadline for rectifying their mistakes, and those failing to 
meet the requirements by the deadline will be ordered to stop 
production in accordance with the law. The seven departments 
demand strict investigation into and severe punishment for 
piracies; the conscientious protection of the legitimate rights 
and interests of copyright holders, publishers, and consumers; 
and the immediate organization of a force to seriously clean up 
the audio and video market. After copyright piracy or illegal 
duplication is exposed, joint efforts should be made along with 
local copyright departments and administrations for industry and 
commerce to immediately rectify or investigate and punish the 
wrongdoing in accordance with the law. Various customs 
departments should strengthen the examination of imported 
modules for audio and video laser discs and of their finished 
products exported in bulk.

<F P=106> ["Communique Issued by the Anhui Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau on the Statistics of 1993 Economic and Social 
Development"; date not given] 
  [Text] While establishing a socialist market economy in 
1993, we further emancipated our minds, deepened reforms, and 
opened the province wider to the outside world. We 
conscientiously implemented the state principle for "sustained, 
rapid, and healthy" economic development and achieved positive 
results in strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation 
and control. As a result, Anhui's economy grew rapidly. Since 
the start of reform and opening up, 1993 was the province's best 
year as far as the growth rate, vitality, and development of its 
economy are concerned. The people's living standards noticeably 
improved, and social undertakings further developed. According 
to preliminary estimates, the province's gross domestic product 
[GDP] for 1993 amounted to 94 billion yuan, up 22 percent from 
1992. Of this, the added value of tertiary industrial output 
was 20.3 billion yuan, up 25 percent. The main problems in 
economic operations were that economic performance was not 
basically improved and that there was a fairly sharp rise in 
prices. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993 the central authorities paid close attention to 
agriculture and adopted a series of measures to strengthen 
agricultural production and develop the rural economy. This 
aroused peasants' enthusiasm for production and promoted steady 
agricultural development. Under macroeconomic regulation and 
control since last June, our province tried in every possible 
way to ensure the funds for purchasing farm and sideline 
products and put an end to writing "IOU's" to peasants, thus 
protecting their interests. A good harvest was reaped, and the 
output of most farm products approached or exceeded the highest 
records in the past. The annual added value of agricultural 
output was 25.4 billion yuan, up 10 percent from 1992; and the 
added value of agricultural output accounted for 27 percent of 
the province's GDP. 
  Progress was made in developing high-efficient, 
high-quality, 
and high-yield agriculture. In agriculture, livestock and 
aquatic production developed rapidly. Continuous efforts were 
made to readjust the structure of grain-crop cultivation. The 
acreage sown to quality rice continued to expand, and more cash 
crops were planted. The output of grain and oil-bearing crops 
and silkworm cocoons set a record, and the cotton output 
approached the all-time high in the past. Urban and rural 
markets were brisk as a result of a good harvest, which provided 
a sound foundation for economic development.

  New progress was made in forestry, especially in tree 
planting. In 1993, trees were planted on 1.695 million mu of 
land in the province, overfulfilling the task in this regard. 
So the percentage of forest cover continued to increase. 
  An across-the-board increase was achieved in animal 
husbandry production.

  Good results were again achieved in fishery production; 
aquatic products totalled 364,000 tonnes in 1993, an increase of 
18.8 percent over the previous year. 
  The conditions for agricultural production continued to 
improve. At the end of 1993, the power of the province's farming 
machinery totalled 15.522 million kw, up 6.9 percent from the 
end of the year before. The number of small and walking 
tractors was 711,000 at the end of 1993, an increase of 8.7 
percent from the end of the previous year; the number of 
heavy-duty trucks was 29,000, an increase of 3.6 percent; the 
power of water draining and irrigation machinery added up to 
3.421 million kw, an increase of 4.7 percent. The total amount 
of chemical fertilizers used in 1993 (calculated in terms of 100 
percent active ingredients) amounted to 1.781 million tonnes, up 
14.2 percent from 1992. Water conservancy work was stepped up 
and the effective irrigated areas continued to increase. 
  In 1993, Anhui's rural economy continued to develop in an 
all- round manner; the output value of village and town 
enterprises reached a new level; the weight of rural industry, 
construction business, transportation industry, commercial 
activities, restaurant business, and other non-agricultural 
businesses further increased as a part of the rural economy. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction Business </H5>
  In 1993, Anhui took positive measures to conduct experiments 
on transforming state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, 
on reforming the enterprise system of property rights, and on 
building a modern enterprise system, and fruitful results were 
achieved. In the industrial sector, good development was made 
in letting state-owned enterprises and enterprises of public 
ownership be privately managed, in forming enterprise groups, in 
promoting the joint stock system on a trial basis, and in taking 
various measures to reform the enterprise system of property 
rights and the enterprise management system. Meiling Company, 
Maanshan Steel Corporation, and Wanneng Company had their shares 
successfully listed on the stock market, thereby gaining some 
experiences, further paving the way for reforming enterprise 
operating and management mechanisms, and increasing their 
vitality. The province's entire industrial economy developed 
rapidly -- the added industrial value totalled 42.9 billion yuan 
in 1993, an increase of 37 percent over the previous year and 
the highest annual growth since the policy of reform and opening 
up was implemented, accounting for 45.6 percent of the 
province's GDP. The light and heavy industry developed 
simultaneously; and the collective industry, the three kinds of 
partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and other 
non-state- owned enterprises developed rapidly. 
  Production of most major industrial products increased to 
varying degrees.

  Economic efficiency improved markedly along with the 
development of industrial production. The composite efficiency 
index for the provincial industry was 95.33 in 1993. 
Constituting the index were the industrial product sales rate 
of 95.47 percent, the 11.97-percent rate of profit and tax 
generation by capital, the 5.14-percent profit rate on cost, the 
turnover rate of 1.76 times for current assets, and the overall 
labor productivity (calculated on added value) of 10,455 yuan 
per person. Nevertheless, some enterprises still suffered 
rather heavy losses, posing a need for further improvement in 
overall economic efficiency. 
  Production developed rapidly in the construction industry. 
Enterprises undertaking construction work obviously accelerated 
production along with rapid growth of investment in fixed assets 
and continual deepening of reform in the construction industry 
in 1993, turning out 5.4 billion yuan worth of value-added 
construction output, an increase of 20 percent over the previous 
year. State- owned enterprises undertaking construction work 
completed 2.199 million square meters of housing floor area with 
improved quality of work. 
  Progress was made in geological survey and prospecting. In 
1993, geological and mineral resources departments completed 
drilling and prospecting work measuring 42,000 meters in 
mechanical corer length, located two new mining sites, and 
discovered additional reserves of three minerals. They 
completed work worth 260 million yuan in monetary terms, an 
increase of 57 percent over the previous year. 
<H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  In 1993, Anhui showed a comparatively strong momentum of 
increase in investment and rationally restructured its 
investment. Total investment in fixed assets for the year came 
to 28.993 billion yuan, an increase of 34.9 percent over the 
previous year. Within this figure, investment by state-owned 
institutions and enterprises grew by 17,166 billion yuan, an 
increase of 42.6 percent; investment by institutions and 
enterprises under collective ownership 3.13 billion yuan, an 
increase of 23.3 percent; investment by individual residents 
6.666 billion yuan, an increase of 7.8 percent; and investment 
in marketable housing units of 2.031 billion yuan. Among the 
investment by state-owned institutions and enterprises, 10.026 
billion yuan were invested in capital construction, an increase 
of 40.3 percent over the previous year; 6.262 billion yuan were 
invested in renovation projects, an increase of 42.6 percent; 
and 688 million yuan were committed to other investments, an 
increase of 95.9 percent. Our investment structure was 
comparatively rational. Among the investment committed by 
state-owned institutions and enterprises in capital construction 
[as published], 11.062 billion yuan [as published] were invested 
in the secondary industry, an increase of 37.6 percent over the 
previous year. The ratio of investment in the secondary 
industry decreased from the previous year's 67.6 percent to 65.2 
percent. Among state-owned institutions' and enterprises' 
investment in capital construction [as published], 5.453 billion 
yuan were committed to the tertiary industry, an increase of 
69.6 percent. The ratio of investment in the tertiary industry 
rose from the previous year's 27 percent to 32.1 percent. 
  Investments for key construction projects were ensured. In 
1993, the state and the province invested 5.422 billion yuan -- 
or 106.2 percent of the annual plan -- in 32 key capital 
construction projects which were launched according to plan. A 
large number of technological upgrading projects and 
infrastructural projects were completed and put to use. These 
projects included the 2,500 cubic meter-blast furnace of the 
Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, the Hefei-Anqing section of the 
Hefei-Jiujiang railroad, the Hefei-Tongling highway roadbed, and 
the infrastructure of the Tongling bridge at the Chang Jiang, as 
well as the installation of the 200,000 kilowatt-generator of 
the Huaibei Power Plant and the two 125,000 kilowatt-generators 
of the Wuhu Power Plant; the operations of the Xinji, the No. 2 
Liuqiao, and the Xinzhuangzi coal mines; and the completion of 
the main structure of the Yuan Building. Progress was made in 
building the main flood control and irrigation projects along 
the Chang Jiang and the Huai He, in strengthening environmental 
protection and land management, and in improving the investment 
environment. 
<H5>  4. Communications, Postal and Telecommunications Services </H5>
  The productivity in the communications and transportation 
sector continued to grow, and a breakthrough was achieved in the 
development of postal and telecommunications services. The 
added value in this sector in 1993 was 4 billion yuan, or 23.3 
percent higher than the year before.

  All county seats and larger areas in the province could be 
reached by telephone. The total postal and telecommunications 
business in 1993 reached 1.03 billion yuan, a growth of 66.6 
percent over 1992. Of this volume, business operated by the 
central government increased 66.9 percent, reaching 960 million 
yuan; business operated by local governments increased 62.8 
percent, reaching 70 million yuan; international and Hong 
Kong/Macao business increased 70.9 percent, reaching 63.499 
million yuan; and express, special, radio paging, and cellular 
phone business increased more than 70 percent. The development 
of long-distance and urban telephone services accelerated 
noticeably. By the end of 1993, the number of urban households 
with telephones had reached 409,000 and the number of rural 
households with telephones had reached 64,000, a growth of 62.9 
and 36.8 percent respectively over the year before. 
<H5>  5. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993, the supply of consumer goods was ample in Anhui, 
and 
retail sales were steadily growing. The total commodity retail 
sales in the year increased 15.9 percent over the year before, 
reaching 39.17 billion yuan. Retails of consumer goods 
increased 17.8 percent, reaching 33.57 billion yuan; and retails 
of agricultural capital goods increased 5.8 percent, reaching 
5.6 billion yuan. Of all the consumer goods sold through retail 
markets, 16.14 billion yuan of goods were sold in cities, 
registering an increase of 26.9 percent over the year before; 
and 7.6 billion and 9.83 billion yuan of goods were sold in 
counties and subcounty areas, registering an increase of 18.8 
and 4.7 percent respectively over the year before. 
  Retail sales of commodities produced by all types of 
business 
registered growth. Retails by state-owned business grew 8.7 
percent, retails by collectively owned units grew 10.9 percent, 
retails by independent operators grew 32.6 percent; and 
peasants' retails among nonagricultural residents grew by 23 
percent. Sales of various types of consumers goods showed that, 
among edible commodities, sales of grain declined 9.4 percent, 
sales of cooking oil increased 26.6 percent, and sales of eggs 
and aquatic goods respectively increased 190 and 74.4 percent. 
Of clothing, sales of garments increased 11.9 percent; and of 
durable goods, sales of color television sets declined 8 
percent, sales of electric fans declined 13.5 percent, sales of 
washing machines increased 12.1 percent, sales of refrigerators 
increased 16.1 percent, and sales of air conditioners and 
kitchen ventilators increased by a great margin. 
  We have made considerable progress in price reform. In 
1993, the government strengthened price reform, decontrolled 
producer's prices for most steel products and for coal subject 
to the state's unified distribution, raised prices of 
electricity and railway freight transportation, and further 
freed purchasing and selling prices of grains. These policies 
played an important role in changing the relatively low prices 
of basic products and infrastructure facilities and in promoting 
the establishment of market mechanisms.

<H5>  6. Foreign Economic Exchange </H5>
  In 1993, Anhui's scope of opening to the outside world 
further expanded, and a comprehensive pattern of foreign 
economic exchanges and foreign trade initially took shape. As a 
result, economic exchanges with foreign countries were 
unprecedentedly active. Statistics show that in 1993, the value 
of exports reached $964 million, up 16 percent over 1992, and 
the value of imports hit $324 million, an increase of 18 
percent. The structure of exports was further improved. The 
share of manufactured goods among exports rose from 67.9 percent 
in 1992 to 72.2 percent. Propelled by the torrent of a market 
economy, exports by foreign-funded enterprises continued to grow 
by a large margin, with the value of their exports amounting to 
$96 million, up 91.1 percent over 1992, and their share of 
Anhui's total export value rose from 6.1 percent in 1992 to 10 
percent. 
  High growth was achieved in the utilization of foreign 
capital. In 1993, the province actually utilized $370 million of 
foreign capital, up 1.6 times. Of this total, $260 million was 
in the form of contracted direct foreign investment, up 4.2 
times. The number of foreign-funded enterprises rose by a large 
margin. In 1993, a total of 1,040 new foreign-funded 
enterprises were approved, the largest number approved since the 
introduction of reform and opening to the outside world. 
  Tourism continued to grow. In 1993, Anhui received 153,000 
foreigners who came to the province for sightseeing, visits, or 
other activities, 1.2 percent more than the previous year. 
Foreign exchange income from tourism amounted to $17.798 
million, up 25.5 percent. Construction projects and labor 
service projects contracted by Anhui Province with foreign 
countries in 1993 totaled $6.07 million, and the accomplished 
operations revenue reached $3.91 million. 
<H5>  7. Finance and Insurance Industry </H5>
  In 1993, Anhui's financial institutions earnestly 
implemented 
central guidelines for strengthening and improving macroeconomic 
regulation and control to rectify the financial order; halted 
illegal fund transfers; readjusted credit structure; as well as 
ensured funds needed for key constructions, industrial and 
agricultural production, and purchases of agricultural and 
sideline products. In addition, the institutions alleviated the 
shortage of circulatory funds in some key enterprises, 
effectively bringing about sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development for Anhui's national economy. 
  As of the end of 1993, Anhui's banks' various deposits 
totalled 49.439 billion yuan, up 10.08 billion yuan over that of 
the previous year. Of this, urban residents' savings deposits 
amounted to 25.237 billion yuan, up 6.296 billion yuan over that 
of the previous year; and rural residents' savings deposits 
totalled 8.944 billion yuan, up 2.222 billion yuan. The balance 
of various bank loans totalled 71.206 billion yuan, an increase 
of 12.667 billion yuan. Of this, the balance of circulatory 
fund loans totalled 50.681 billion yuan, up 8.119 billion yuan 
over that of the previous year; and fixed asset loans totalled 
14.259 billion yuan, up 3.418 billion yuan. The people's finance 
and investment sense was further enhanced as the purchase of 
shares, bonds, and various valued securities notably increased. 
  Insurance business enjoyed fairly rapid development. In 
1993, the total volume of various domestic property insurance 
Anhui underwrote totalled 108.93 billion yuan. In Anhui, over 
18,000 enterprise units bought property insurance, 6.7 million 
urban and rural households participated in family property 
insurance, and 11.183 million people were covered with various 
kinds of personal insurance. The total premium income of 
domestic and foreign insurance business as well as the 
endowment-type insurance reached 1.51 billion yuan, up 18.4 
percent over that of the previous year. The amount overfulfilled 
the income target. Income in domestic insurance business topped 
1.47 billion yuan, up 18.3 percent. Incomes in property 
insurance, various kinds of personal insurance, and 
foreign-related business all grew by fairly wide margins. 
Domestic and foreign insurance compensations and payments 
totalled 890 million yuan for the whole year, thereby 
contributing to healthy national economic development and social 
stability. 
<H5>  8. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  In 1993, Anhui's scientific and technological undertakings 
thrived and played an active role in promoting high economic 
growth rate and upgrading the quality of operations. In the 
year, Anhui's 298 scientific and technological achievements won 
awards at provincial and ministerial levels and four projects 
won state awards, one of which was a state invention prize and 
three of which were state spark prizes. The patent business 
enjoyed further development. In 1993, the province received 
1,041 patent applications, up 11 percent over that of the 
previous year. Total accumulated patent rights authorized in 
the province numbered 4,555. In the year, major scientific and 
technological achievements in the province included study in 
factors of early pregnancy; diagnosis of Anhui's soil nutrition; 
and study in equilibrium in fertilization. 
  New progress was made in various educational undertakings. 
In 1993, Anhui enrolled 784 new graduate students, up 137 over 
that of the previous year. The number of graduate students 
totalled 1,949, an increase of 164. Institutes of higher 
learning in general studies enrolled 32,300 students for general 
and special courses, an increase of 35.6 percent; and the number 
of school students totalled 81,000, up 15,000 people. Secondary 
vocational and technical education continued to develop. There 
were 389,000 students (including 79,000 technical school 
students) studying in various types of secondary vocational 
schools; and 248,000 secondary and high school students studying 
in general secondary schools. The coverage of compulsory 
education program steadily developed. There were 2.0624 million 
students in junior secondary schools and 6.011 million pupils in 
primary schools in Anhui. The enrollment rate of school-age 
children between 7 and 11 was 98.3 percent; and 77.3 percent of 
primary school graduates continued their study in secondary 
schools, 5.0 percent higher than the previous year. The rates 
of drop-outs for junior secondary school and primary school 
students were 6.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. 
  Adult education at various levels continued to develop and 
training classes in various job skills were conducted. In 1993, 
institutions of adult higher education had an enrollment of 
50,000 students, with 24,000 new students enrolled for general 
and special courses. In the entire year, 20,000 students 
graduated from adult secondary schools; 935,000 students studied 
in adult secondary and primary schools; 863,000 students 
underwent training in adult technical training schools; and 
677,000 illiterate people became literate. 
  Cultural undertakings prospered with each passing day. By 
the end of 1993, the province had 2,981 film projection units, 
94 artistic groups, 102 cultural centers, 83 public libraries, 
26 museums, and 3,959,000 volumes of reference materials in 
archives, covering an area of 121,000 square meters. It also 
had 56 radio stations, 80 radio transmitters and relay stations, 
32 television stations, 27,058,000 copies of magazines and 
242,440,000 copies of books. 
  Public health undertakings continued to grow. By the end of 
1993, there were 105,000 beds, up 2.6 percent over the previous 
year. There were 145,000 full-time health and technological 
workers, up 1.7 percent; of these, 62,000 were doctors, up 3.9 
percent, and 34,100 were technicians and nurses, up 1.4 percent. 
  New achievements were made in sports. In 1993, Anhui's 
athletes won 36 gold medals and 53.5 silver and bronze medals at 
major world and domestic competitions. There were 24 top-grade 
athletes and 162 top-grade referees. 
  Progress was made in topography. Some 3,155,000 yuan worth 
of topographic works was produced during the year, including 687 
maps drawn from field operations under controlled circumstances 
[wai ye kong zhi 1120 2814 2235 0455], 288.7 maps drawn from 
field operations under coordinated circumstances [wai ye tiao 
hui 1120 2814 6148 4940], 875 maps drawn from field surveys [wai 
ye ce tu 1120 2814 3261 0956], 490.7 maps drawn from infield 
operations, and 27 annotated maps [di tu bian zhi 0966 0956 4882 
0455]. These maps provided strong topographic support to 
various endeavors of economic construction. 
<H5>  9. Population and People's Livelihood </H5>
  Population growth was controlled to some extent. According 
to a sampling survey, Anhui's population birth rate stood at 
17.18 per thousand, down 1.58 per thousand from the previous 
year; the death rate stood at 6.51 per thousand, up 0.37 per 
thousand; and the natural growth rate stood at 10.67 per 
thousand, down 1.95 per thousand. Calculated by the percentage 
mentioned above, the total resident population at year-end stood 
at 58,970,000. 
  The income of urban and rural residents increased by a large 
margin. Data from sample surveys showed that the per capita 
income of urban residents for living expenses in 1993 was 
2,025.7 yuan, up 24.8 percent over the previous year, or a real 
growth of 9.1 percent if increases in commodity prices were 
excluded. The per capita net income of rural residents was 
724.5 yuan, an increase of 151 yuan or 26.3 percent, the largest 
increase since the beginning of reform and opening up. The real 
growth was 9.4 percent -- also a fairly large increase in the 
last decade and more -- if fluctuations in prices were excluded. 
  New progress was made in various labor reforms, and a labor 
service and employment system had taken shape gradually. In 
1993, the number of employment agencies at all levels in the 
province reached 504; some 146,000 people in urban and rural 
areas were provided jobs. The urban unemployment rate at the 
end of the year was 2.8 percent. Fairly rapid progress was made 
in the use of labor contract system. Contract workers in 
state-owned units reached 486,000, accounting for 9.6 percent of 
the total number of urban workers. Society took an increasingly 
larger role in insurance for the aged. Some 1.834 million 
workers and 356,000 retirees were covered by social insurance, 
which has been expanded to entire society. The number of 
workers at the end of 1993 stood at 5,077,000, 510,000 of whom 
were urban private enterprise employees and self-employed 
workers. 
  The wage levels of workers rose further in 1993. Aggregate 
payroll for the year reached 13.65 billion yuan, up 21.7 percent 
over 1992; per capita wages reached 2,650 yuan, an increase of 
385 yuan or 17 percent -- an increase of 2.3 percent in real 
terms if price factors were excluded. 
  Housing conditions in both urban and rural areas continued 
to 
improve. In 1993, new housing units with a total area of 
46,400,000 square meters were built in urban and rural areas. 
Of the total, 8,010,000 square meters were built in urban 
areas, while 38,390,000 square meters were built in rural areas. 
  Social welfare undertakings continued to develop. In 1993, 
there were 52,000 beds in all sorts of social welfare facilities 
across the province, accommodating 44,000 people. A total of 
1,187,000 people in both urban and rural areas were served by 
various forms of social welfare. A rural social security 
network was established in 17.2 percent of the townships and 
towns in the province. Major progress was also made in the 
urban social service network. A total of 2,531 community 
service facilities and 5,395 service points were established. 
  Environmental protection undertakings developed at a faster 
pace. At the end of 1993, there were 2,234 workers at various 
environmental protection departments. There were 88 environment 
monitoring stations and 10 nature preserves in various parts of 
the province. A total of 122 environmental pollution control 
projects with an investment of 58,920,000 yuan were completed 
within the prescribed time in 1993. By the end of the year, 72 
smoke and dust control zones covering an area of 2,698,000 
square kilometers were established in 16 cities, and 49 noise 
pollution controlled zones covering an area of 79.8 kilometers 
were established in 11 cities.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Five years ago, Cao 
Yongxian, a farmer in Caozhuang village in suburban Jieshou 
city, Anhui Province, tried hard to persuade eight villagers to 
contribute 15,000 yuan each for building a paper mill. 
  Then most villagers did not support cooperative companies 
because they feared that the establishment of these companies 
meant returning to egalitarianism, known in China as "sharing 
porridge out of the same big pot." 
  However, the mill, called Yingnan Paper Mill, turned out to 
be a complete success, as it has scored an annual increase of 
400 percent in terms of output value and profits. 
  To date, the first eight partners have assets worth 250,000 
yuan each. 
  The mill has introduced a standard managerial system under 
which its funds are raised by villagers, and shareholders are 
responsible for its operation, draw dividends on schedule and 
cover its risks. 
  As a result, the joint stock cooperative system has been 
mushrooming in Caozhuang village and has become the biggest 
source of income for villagers. 
  A village head said that Caozhuang now has 51 cooperative 
businesses, with shares totalling 40 million yuan. In 1993 the 
net income of each villager was 1,500 yuan, 70 percent of which 
came from dividends, he added. 
  An Anhui Provincial Government official said that Anhui 
currently has 23,000 such businesses, 6,000 of which were set up 
in 1993. 
  Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party, has asked local party and government 
officials to speed up the spread of such system, in a move to 
invigorate the rural economy and increase farmers' incomes. 
  The official said that Fuyang Prefecture, which used to be 
the least developed area in Anhui, is both a pioneer and a 
pacesetter in instituting the system. 
  Prefectural authorities have chosen a number of township-run 
factories to try out the system by standardizing their operation 
and clearly defining their property rights. 
  The prefecture currently has 14,000 cooperative enterprises 
owned by 100,000 shareholders, the official said. These 
enterprises manufactured 1.5 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993. 
  Hu Yingchen, a farmer in Mengcheng county, administered by 
Fuyang Prefecture, turned his private building materials factory 
on the verge of bankruptcy into a cooperative company owned by 
230 shareholders. The company has become a "superstar" 
enterprise with an annual output exceeding 10 million yuan. 
  The official said that farmers can now also contribute their 
skills, land and raw materials as shares in rural enterprises, 
which have also attracted investors from urban areas. 
  Anhui provincial authorities are helping most township-run 
businesses introduce the cooperative system to meet the needs of 
a market economy, he said, adding that most newly-founded 
enterprises are joint stock cooperative companies. 
  Various government departments are taking measures to help 
introduce and standardize the system, he said.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [13 April], Jia Qinglin, 
secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, with 
Huang Wenlin, Standing Committee member and secretary general of 
the provincial party committee, attended the discussion sessions 
of the Nanping and Longyan delegations in order to solicit the 
deputies' opinions and suggestions on the government work report. 
  The Nanping Prefecture deputies made many constructive 
suggestions on such issues as solving the price scissors between 
manufactured goods and farm produce, the high prices of 
agricultural means of productions, the further lightening of 
peasants' burdens, and the development of undertakings in grain 
production and greening. 
  After listening to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang 
Wenlin fully affirmed the achievements the prefect had scored, 
saying: The agriculture problem is an old one, but we must have 
a new approach to it. The party Central Committee and the State 
Council now have elevated to a new height the problem of 
agriculture and grain. Among reform, development, and stability, 
stability is of overriding importance. To maintain social 
stability, it is important to solve the price problem. The key 
to stabilizing prices is to vigorously develop agriculture, 
grain production, and the Shopping Basket Project. While 
guiding agricultural production in accordance with the laws 
governing the socialist market economy, we should continue to 
support agriculture, and to encourage villages, collectives, and 
peasants to invest more in agriculture. Jia Qinglin stressed: 
As for grain-producing areas, they should be encouraged even 
more to develop a diversified economy, town and township 
enterprises, and agricultural processing industries so as to 
boost peasants' income, and to promote their grain production by 
using industrial profits and the profits gained from developing 
economic undertakings to support the further development of 
agriculture. Nanping is the province's pilot city for 
establishing modern enterprise systems. He hoped that Nanping 
Prefecture would do a good job in this experiment and would 
create experience in changing the way state- owned enterprises 
operate and in enabling them to gradually become modern 
enterprises. He pointed out: Forestry, which is also a strong 
point of the prefecture, should be fully developed. On the 
basis of what was achieved last year, greater efforts should 
made in this regard this year. 
  The Longyan Prefecture deputies aired their views on further 
supporting the construction of old revolutionary base areas, 
especially the construction of infrastructure. After listening 
to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang Wenlin fully affirmed 
the gratifying successes achieved by the old revolutionary base 
areas in western Fujian, which had a poor foundation for 
economic development and were beset with difficulties. They 
said: To the prefecture, development is the last word. We 
should increase total quantity, augment strength, continue to 
implement the preferential policy of opening and developing 
mountain areas. At the same time, we should concentrate the use 
of limited funds on construction of selected projects, do a 
solid job in work to help the poor, and -- given the existence 
of poverty-stricken areas -- carry out the help-the-poor policy 
from generation to generation. Jia Qinglin hoped Longyan 
Prefecture would continue to carry on the old revolutionary base 
areas' glorious revolutionary tradition and would work hard so 
that the people of the old revolutionary base areas in western 
Fujian would shake off poverty and gain prosperity as soon as 
possible.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Ye Jundong (0673 0193 2639)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Centralized, 
province-wide operations to find and halt the production and 
sales of pirated audiovisual products launched by Guangdong 
authorities have yielded initial results. The Guangzhou City 
Copyright Administration today destroyed publicly more than 
63,000 pirated compact and laser discs and audio and video tapes. 
  As revealed by the person-in-charge of the Guangdong 
Provincial Copyright Administration, the province-wide 
centralized operations against compact and laser discs started 
at 1300 on the 19th. Well-thought out plans and joint raids by 
the city's copyright administrations, public security personnel, 
administrations for industry and commerce, news and radio and 
television broadcasting units scored good results. 
  Judging by incomplete figures, as of 0400 GMT on 20 April, 
province-wide, 1,657 vendors had been searched, and 140,000 
compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, and 85,000 audio and visual 
tapes had been seized. Operations in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and some other places were especially large. Guangzhou, 
for example, on 19 April launched a citywide "Action Week on 
Enforcing Copyright Laws and Protecting Intellectual Property 
Rights" activity in conjunction with inspections and raids. 
  The person-in-charge said that since China became a 
signatory 
to the "Bern Convention," "Universal Copyright Convention," and 
the "Convention on Sound-Recording Products," copyright 
protection in China has been incorporated into the international 
copyright system. Guangdong provincial departments attached 
great importance to protecting intellectual property rights, and 
last year launched six operations against illegal publishing 
activities, and another operation devoted to cracking down on 
illegal audiovisual products was launched at the end of the year. 
  At present, local authorities are continuing such raids on 
the basis of local practical conditions. Provincial departments 
are formulating a range of measures to strengthen standard 
management on the processing, dubbing, wholesaling, and selling 
of audiovisual products. It has been learned that the Guangdong 
authorities will place all the province's 16 compact 
disc-producing factories under the charge of the press and 
publications departments when the current rectification is over. 
The provincial copyright administration has drawn up methods 
for registering, scrutinizing, and verifying copyrights for 
compact disc production. From now on, authorities will pursue a 
"permit-first-and-license-later" procedure on wholesaling and 
selling audiovisual products; that is, operators must obtain 
operating permits from concerned departments before getting 
their operating licenses. Customs will also be stepping up 
operations against the smuggling of audiovisual products to stop 
the influx of illegal overseas publications.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 21 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
Hebei Province has earmarked more money for major projects this 
year, according to a local official. 
  Gong Huanwen, director of the provincial planning 
commission, 
said that a large proportion of the province's budget has gone 
to basic industries and infrastructure, including the spheres of 
agriculture, water-control, energy, transportation, 
telecommunications and key raw materials. 
  He said that most of the 158 major projects planned for this 
year are ones that have already been started, and 42 of them are 
expected to be completed and go into operation within the year. 
  As a result, he said, the province's generating capacity 
will 
increase by 840,000 kw, coal production will rise by 900,000 
tons, and the output of cement is expected to reach 820,000 tons. 
  In addition, the province will add over 900,000 tons of port 
handling capacity and 450,000 computer-programmed telephone 
lines. The output of refined oil and gas will hit 800,000 tons 
and 1.03 million cu m daily, respectively. 
  Gong said the province would keep its economic focus on 
optimizing the investment climate. 
  The construction of five new highways leading to other 
provinces and cities will start this year, he noted, and the 
pace of port expansion in Qinghuangdao on Bohai Bay will be 
accelerated. 
  To ensure sufficient funds for building major projects, the 
official said, the province will also introduce the stock system. 
  It has been decided to use more overseas funds to upgrade 
some 14 old industrial enterprises and to develop more than 150 
new products this year, Gong said.

<F P=106> [By Soifa Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) faxed a message to its mainland Chinese 
counterpart Wednesday [20 April] suggesting that a special round 
of talks be held in Hong Kong April 27-29 on issues related to 
the March 31 Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan 
tourists died. 
  "We hope Beijing's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will give US a definite answer soon," SEF 
Secretary- General Chiao Jen-ho said. 
  It was the second time in less than half a month SEF 
expressed its intention to talk with ARATS about the Qiandao 
Lake incident. ARATS failed to reply to a similar request made 
last week. 
  Chiao reaffirmed that the talks will focus on possible 
compensation for the bereaved families of the incident's victims 
as well as the protection of Taiwan tourists and businessmen in 
Mainland China. 
  He again urged Beijing authorities to thoroughly investigate 
the incident, to make public the results of the investigation, 
and to respond to 10 unanswered questions of the families, 
including why autopsies were performed on the victims' bodies 
without the prior approval of their relatives. 
  "Although ARATS has informed US that mainland authorities 
have already arrested three suspects involved in the incident, 
the message was too simple to settle our doubts and 
apprehensions," Chiao noted. 
  Beijing's handling of the incident angered not only the 
bereaved families but also the general public and government 
authorities here. Local travel agencies have decided to stop 
organizing tour groups to the mainland from May 1. 
Government-sponsored cultural exchanges with the mainland have 
also been suspended. 
  Chiao said that unless Beijing opens up about the matter in 
detail and handles all related issues properly, cross-Strait 
relations would be adversely affected. 
  SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by 
their respective governments to handle cross-Strait exchanges in 
the absence of official ties.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP)--China said Thursday [21 
April] it would "draw a lesson" from the murder of 24 Taiwanese 
visitors during a pleasure boat trip last month, pledging to 
take steps to ensure the safety of foreign tourists. 
  The foreign ministry spokeswoman nevertheless defended the 
Chinese authorities' handling of the incident on Qiandao lake in 
the eastern city of Hangzhou, amid accusations from Taiwan of an 
official coverup. "Chinese government always attaches great 
importance to the personal and property safety of overseas 
tourists. The Qiandao lake incident was an unexpected one," a 
foreign ministry spokeswoman said. 
  Relevant officials, including "leaders of the State 
Council," 
took the matter seriously and "dealt with the aftermath in a 
swift and proper manner and concentrated their efforts to find 
out what really happened in the incident within quite a short 
period," she said. 
  The burned bodies of 30 people -- including six Chinese 
cabin 
crew and the two mainland guides of the Taiwanese tourists -- 
were found in a small cabin on the bottom deck of a pleasure 
boat on March 31. China initially maintained it was an 
accident, but said later it was a case of "robbery, murder and 
arson" and arrested three civilians. 
  "Our judicial organs will severely punish the criminals 
concerned according to law through judicial procedure," the 
spokeswoman said, adding that steps would be taken to prevent a 
recurrence. "The departments concerned and the local 
governments of China will draw a lesson from the incident and 
further improve their work so as to guarantee better protection 
of the safety of overseas tourists," she said. 
  China's semi-official body for dealing with Taiwan on 
Wednesday invited its counterpart from the Nationalist island to 
Hangzhou to discuss the incident, which has caused a major 
setback in the gradual thaw in ties between the longtime rivals 
in Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan has launched a series of 
boycotts, including suspending cultural and educational 
exchanges, halting sightseeing trips in China and reviewing 
economic policies to press Beijing to reveal the truth.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xu Yang: "Foreign Ministry Blasts HK </F>
Report"] 
  [Text] A foreign ministry spokesman yesterday attacked a 
recent report on Hong Kong by Britain's House of Commons Foreign 
Affairs Committee. 
  The conclusion of the committee's lengthy report runs 
totally 
counter to Britain's professed desire to improve relations with 
China Wu Jianmin told a weekly news briefing in Beijing. 
  The report persists in supporting the "erroneous" policy of 
the British Government on the Hong Kong election issue and its 
"continued" confrontations with China, Wu said. 
  The report had fully revealed Britain's intention to 
"prolong 
its colonial influence in Hong Kong." 
  However China has the resolve and capacity to maintain 
stability and prosperity in Hong Kong long after it returns to 
China in 1997 he said. 
  Wu also discussed the Qiandao Lake accident in which 32 
people, including 24 Taiwanese tourists, died on a blazing 
cruise boat on March 31. 
  He said the mainland side hoped the tragedy would not hinder 
the further development of exchanges across the Taiwan Straits. 
  The case has been confirmed as murder and three men in their 
twenties have been arrested. 
  Wu said representatives from the mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) are expected to meet next month to 
discuss ways to protect people and property on both sides. But 
he did not say where the meeting will be convened. 
  Top figures from ARATS and SEF will also do their utmost to 
ease the effects of this unfortunate accident, Wu said. 
  He went on to back China's oil deployment efforts in the 
Nansha Islands and their waters, saying it was entirely within 
China's sovereignty.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a news conference 
this afternoon, Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin 
answered reporters' questions on the report issued by the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons about 
Sino-British relations, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's forthcoming 
trip to the United States, and Premier Li Peng's current trip to 
four Central Asian countries. 
  A reporter asked: What is your comment on the report which 
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons 
has published on Sino-British relations? 
  The spokesman replied: On 13 April the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the British House of Commons published a lengthy 
report about Sino-British relations. The conclusion of this 
report runs totally counter to its professed desire to develop 
Sino-British relations. 
  Disregarding the facts, this report confuses right and wrong 
and insists on supporting the erroneous policy of the British 
Government on the Hong Kong issue and supporting its continual 
confrontation with China, thus fully revealing the British 
side's real intention of prolonging its colonial influence in 
Hong Kong through creating chaos [zhi zao hun luan 0455 6644 
3236 0052] there. 
  No forces whatsoever can stop the return of Hong Kong to the 
motherland. The Chinese Government has the confidence and the 
ability to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong as 
scheduled, carry out the policy for "one country, two systems," 
implement the basic law, and maintain Hong Kong's long-term 
stability and prosperity. 
  While the report recognizes China's economic success and the 
importance of its international role, it makes indiscreet 
remarks about China's internal affairs and even attempted to 
meddle in them. We would like to remind the authors of this 
report that they should have some sense of history and reality. 
Today's China is no longer the old China which could be bullied 
at will. People will never forget the role Britain played on 
the Tibet issue, and we can only hope it will draw lessons from 
history and adopt a prudent attitude. Any attempt to create "two 
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" runs counter to the 
principles governing the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between China and Britain and therefore will meet our firm 
opposition. 
  A reporter asked: What is the purpose of Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua's forthcoming visit to the United States. When will he 
make the trip? What will be the main issues to be discussed? 
Is China ready to concede on the most-favored-nation status 
issue? 
  The spokesman answered: Vice Premier Zou Jiahua will pay an 
official to the United States from 27 April to 8 May at the 
invitation of the U.S. Government 
  Ever since the official meeting between Presidents Jiang 
Zemin and Clinton in Seattle last November, bilateral exchanges 
and contacts have been increasing at all levels and in all 
fields. The main purpose of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit is 
to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges between the two 
countries, to enhance understanding, and develop cooperation. 
During Vice Premier Zou's visit to the United States, he will 
have extensive contacts with U.S. leaders, government officials, 
and business personages. He will exchange views with them on 
Sino-U.S. ties, Sino-U.S. economic cooperation and trade, and 
other issues of common concern, in order to promote the 
improvement and development of the two countries' relations [tui 
dong liang guo guan xi de jin yi bu gai shan he fa zhan 2236 
0520 0357 0948 7070 4762 4104 6651 0001 2975 2395 0810 0735 4099 
1455]. 
  A reporter asked: A report says that Premier Li Peng's 
current trip to four Central Asian countries aims at contending 
with Russia for influence in the countries of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States. What is your comment on this? 
  Wu Jianmin replied: Premier Li Peng's current trip to four 
Central Asian countries is to reciprocate the visits paid by 
their leaders to China, and the purpose is to enhance mutual 
understanding with these countries, promote good neighborliness, 
and develop mutually beneficial cooperation. The trip is by no 
means directed against [zhen dui 6859 1417] any third country. 
The friendly cooperation between China and Russia is developing 
steadily in all fields. We want to see that the friendly 
relations between Russia and the Central Asian countries, which 
are our neighbors and Russia's, will continue to develop.

  [By reporter Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450]) 
  [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Ambassador to the UN Disarmament Commission Hou Zhitong pointed 
out in his speech on 19 April that the time is quite ripe for 
China, the United States, Britain, France, and Russia to sign a 
treaty undertaking not to threaten the use of, or to use, 
nuclear arms against non-nuclear-weapon states and not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against each other under any 
circumstances. 
  Hou Zhitong said: This treaty, when reached among the five 
countries during their negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear 
test-ban treaty, will greatly reduce the risk of a nuclear war, 
enhance their security, and create a favorable condition for 
achieving comprehensive nuclear test ban and advance the nuclear 
disarmament process. 
  He said: China's proposal has received Russia's support. 
China hopes that the United States, Britain, and France will 
also respond to it in a positive way so that negotiations can 
begin at an early date to conclude this treaty. 
  Hou Zhitong also explained China's position and views "on 
the 
role of science and technology in international security, 
disarmament, and other relevant fields" as well as on 
"international arms transfer." He said: Currently, a number of 
countries have indicated that they would liberalize export 
control of relevant semi-finished materials and technologies. 
At the same time, there are countries considering the 
establishment of new export control regime. Nuclear 
nonproliferation should not hinder international scientific and 
technological cooperation, much less be used by a few countries 
as an excuse for blocking a large number of developing countries 
from obtaining and developing science and technology for 
peaceful purpose. 
  He also pointed out: China has always opposed unrestricted 
international arms transfers. As is known to all, the key to 
solving the problem of unrestricted arms transfers lay in the 
political will of a few countries which have the most advanced 
industries and most arms exports.

  [Text] Brussels, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The European 
Community (EC) today declared that it "always supports" the 
resumption of China's status in the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  The statement was made in a press release issued after a 
meeting between Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner for 
tariff affairs, and Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of the Chinese 
foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  During their meeting on Wednesday, Scrivener and Gu mainly 
exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT. 
  China, one of the founding parties of the world trade body, 
withdrew from it in 1949 and applied for re-entry in 1986. 
  Scrivener told Gu that Chinese membership in GATT is "the 
way 
China must take toward a greater participation in the world 
trade wave." 
  Therefore, the EC commissioner said, EC will support, as it 
always does, China's application for membership. 
  However, she stressed that China needs to make "very clear 
commitments" to meet some "specific conditions" put forth by 
GATT before the re-entry.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic today proposed a complete cease-fire and 
disengagement of forces in Bosnia to make the entire Bosnia a 
UN- designated safe area and thus create conditions for peace 
talks. 
  A complete halt to hostility is the only way out for the 
Bosnia crisis, as only cease-fire can lead to a political 
settlement and end the Bosnia war, Karadzic said in letters to 
the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
  He pointed out that the Serb proposal is aimed at securing 
peace in the former Yugoslav republic, adding that it is now the 
best time for resolving the Bosnia crisis once and for all. 
  Serbs have announced unilateral cease-fire, but Muslims do 
not intend to do the same, the Serb leader noted. 
  Karadzic stressed that the attempt of the international 
community to realize a military balance on the Bosnian 
battlefield could reach nowhere but to prolong the war, and so 
would the new plan proposed by the United States, which he 
described as "completely wrong." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday three 
steps which he said would help reach a negotiated settlement in 
Bosnia. The steps include extending NATO air strike threats 
against Serbs to UN-declared safe areas to halt Serb attacks, 
tightening economic sanctions on Serbia and supporting UN 
humanitarian aid to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde and more UN 
peacekeepers in Bosnia.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin announced here today that the Russian, 
U.S. presidents and representatives from United Nations and 
European Union will probably meet within a month over the 
Bosnian crisis. 
  Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the 
announcement at a press conference in the Kremlin today. 
  According to Kostikov, President Yeltsin talked with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton for 40 minutes over telephone late last 
night. 
  He said President Yeltsin firmly opposes NATO air strikes at 
the Bosnian Serb Forces without consulting with Russia. 
  Kostikov added that President Clinton had promised to act 
with caution in dealing with such matters in the future. 
  Yeltsin on Tuesday [19 April] called on the Serbs to 
withdraw 
from around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, Eastern Bosnia, to 
allow the deployment of U.N. Peacekeepers.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (XINHUA) -- South Korea and the 
United States will conduct this year's "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercise in November if Pyongyang continues to reject 
additional nuclear inspection and the resumption of inter-Korean 
dialogue. 
  This was announced after a meeting between visiting U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Perry and his South Korean counterpart 
Yi Pyong-tae here Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Perry, who delayed his visit to Seoul due to last week's 
downing of U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire in Iraq, 
arrived here late Tuesday night. 
  The two defense ministers focused on the nuclear issue in 
the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They decided to 
hold the "Team Spirit" exercise if no progress is made on the 
issue by the end of October. 
  They believe that the deployment of Patriot missiles at 
American military bases in South Korea will contribute to 
deterring war. 
  They agreed, however, that there are no particular signs of 
military confrontation at present. 
  The "Team Spirit" joint military exercise had been held 
annually since 1976, but was cancelled for the first time in 
1992 when the DPRK signed the nuclear safeguards accord with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The exercise was revived last year after a stalemate in 
inter- Korean talks over nuclear inspections. 
  The first shipment of Patriot missiles and their launchers 
arrived in South Korea Monday aboard two U.S. military transport 
ships. 
  South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are 
purely 
defensive missiles designed to counter air strikes and SCUD 
missiles. 
  But the DPRK said that the missiles are designed for 
offensive purposes, while describing the "Team Spirit" as a 
"rehearsal for invading the DPRK."

  [Text] Washington, April 20 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton announced today U.S. support for extending the so-called 
"Sarajevo model" to other Muslim "safe areas" in Bosnia and 
tougher sanctions against the Serbian republic. 
  Describing the Bosnian Serbs as "complete aggressors in the 
case of Gorazde," one of the six "safe areas" designated by the 
U.N. for the Bosnian Muslims, Clinton said the Serbs should pay 
a higher price for continued violence. 
  In addition, Clinton also called for stepped-up diplomatic 
efforts for a negotiated settlement to the two-year Balkan war. 
  He welcomed the reported release of all U.N. personnel held 
by the Bosnian Serbs as hostages. 
  Clinton, who telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
French leader Francois Mitterrand earlier in the day, refrained 
from disclosing details of what he called the "major diplomatic 
initiatives." 
  He said he felt good about his conversations with Yeltsin 
but 
ducked the question of whether Yeltsin raised any objections to 
the wider use of threatened NATO air power, saying only he 
thought Yeltsin was "sympathetic to the idea." 
  The U.S. suggestion for extending "Sarajevo Model" has yet 
to 
be approved by the 16-member NATO alliance.

<F P=106> [By Wang Qisi (3769 4874 1835): "Clinton's Diplomatic Gains </F>
and Losses"] 
  [Text] In order to appraise Clinton's diplomatic 
achievements in his first year of government, let us first look 
at his group of diplomats. To begin with, as the president of 
the world's "sole superpower," Clinton did not have enough 
international knowledge and had limited diplomatic knowledge 
when he took charge of the White House. Then let us look at his 
supreme policymaking circle. It does not have seasoned 
statesmen like former Secretaries of State Baker and Schultz, 
nor veteran advisers like former National Security Advisers 
Kissinger and Brzezinski. However, precisely because this group 
of diplomats is lacking strong men, many notable readjustments 
have been made in diplomatic strategy over the past year. When 
Clinton put his group of diplomats in place, some U.S. papers 
and magazines commented that Clinton used competent personnel 
rather than strong men in order to hold the decisionmaking power 
for foreign policy firmly in his own hands. 
<H5>  "Home and Foreign Policies Are Inseparably Close" </H5>
  Clinton holds the foreign policy decisionmaking power in his 
own hands to prevent the policy from deviating from the fixed 
principle touted during his election campaign, namely, the main 
course of "putting domestic affairs first." Prior to his 
inauguration, he said clearly at one time that he would 
"concentrate on economic issues like a laser beam." He 
unequivocally said: "In today's world, foreign policy and 
domestic policy are inseparably close." He criticized former 
President Bush for putting too much energy into foreign affairs, 
while neglecting the serious economic and social problems at 
home. Clinton's idea is this: In order to reverse the trend of 
a weakening United States so that it can play a role in the 
diplomatic arena, it is necessary to begin by reviving the 
economy and upgrading scientific and technological 
competitiveness and education. Not long after he assumed power, 
he put forward a basket of economic revitalization plans with 
the stimulation of economic growth as the short-term objective 
and the reduction of the deficit as the long-term objective. 
  Economists are still disputing what achievements Clinton's 
economic plans have made over the past year. However, the U.S. 
economy enjoyed growth exceeding 2.7 percent in 1993, higher 
than the average level of developed Western countries, improving 
the Clinton administration's image. U.S. economic growth is 
expected to continue to exceed that of Japan and Germany this 
year. The United States has always been a world leader in 
aeronautic, astronautical, and computer technology. In 
traditional industrial sectors such as the auto industry, it is 
also enhancing its competitiveness. At the end of last year, 
Vice President Gore announced that the nationwide information 
network called the "information highway" will be completed in 10 
to 15 years, which is a sign that the United States will lead 
the world in the information revolution. 
  As for domestic policy, the Democratic president is enjoying 
a Democratic-majority Congress, so he is getting along much 
better than the previous administration. The proposal Clinton 
put forward to Congress last year received 88 percent approval. 
Compared with the first-year administration records of 
preceding U.S. presidents before and after the World War II, 
this percentage was just lower than Eisenhower's. Although 
Clinton does not have a high popularity rating, he is better off 
with his domestic situation than the leaders of other major 
Western countries. 
  All this, of course, does not affect Clinton's diplomatic 
achievements. However, his modest successes in the economic, 
science and technology, and domestic areas have added to the 
United States' bargaining chips in dealing with other Western 
countries. 
<H5>  The Three Big Moves in the Economic Field </H5>
  Although some people at home have repeatedly criticized 
Clinton, saying that he has not had a clear foreign policy and 
that he always wavers in handling foreign affairs, this 
"inexperienced" president from Arkansas has made the biggest 
readjustment in U.S. foreign policy since World War II -- 
putting economic security as the center of foreign policy for 
the first time. The United States' major diplomatic activities 
last year were generally centered on economic relations and 
trade. Whether at the Group of Seven Summit in Tokyo, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Seattle, or at the 
U.S.-EC trade talks on agricultural products or the GATT Uruguay 
Round talks, Clinton and his high-ranking officials have strived 
to better the U.S. economy. After the arduous multilateral 
talks, agreements were ultimately reached in these diplomatic 
rounds which can be viewed as the limited success of the Clinton 
administration. 
  The process of global economic integration is, in the final 
analysis, a drive for the U.S. economy, although the United 
States will have to pay a considerable price. Explaining the 
significance of the Uruguay Round, Clinton said: "The 
successful signing of the GATT agreements will create 1.4 
million employment opportunities (for the United States) and 
increase the U.S. average annual household income by $1,700, 
thus ending the two-decade long stagnation of the middle class." 
  As the U.S. Congress debated the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which was proposed during the Bush era, Clinton also 
used similar, moving words. He even mobilized almost all living 
former presidents to boost the approval of the agreement. He 
also charged Vice President Gore to hold a televised debate with 
H. Ross Perot (who ran in the presidential election as an 
independent candidate against Bush and Clinton). In a hot 
debate with the trade protectionist forces represented by Perot, 
Clinton had a close shave. Congress approved the North American 
Free Trade Agreement by a weak majority. This was another point 
for Clinton. 
  The Seattle forum was the Clinton administration's important 
move in the Asia-Pacific region. The economic boom in the 
Asia-Pacific region has attracted Clinton's interest. His 
meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle has made an obvious 
improvement in the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations. The 
successful convening of the Seattle forum has added another 
great success to Clinton's economic and diplomatic activities. 
  Using "fair trade" as the banner, Clinton has been taking a 
much tougher stance at international economic and trade talks 
than in the past. "Fair trade" means in fields where U.S. 
products have an edge, the United States compels other countries 
to open their markets by threatening to set up trade barriers 
for their products in the United States. For instance, now that 
the United States is the world's largest exporter of 
agricultural products and its agriculture has a relative edge 
over the EC, it compelled EC countries to lower export subsidies 
for their agricultural products. Moreover, the United States 
exerted great pressure on Japan and South Korea, forcing them to 
open up their rice markets. Although this practice works at 
times, it has led to the strong dislike of its trading partners 
and to their retaliatory measures. 
<H5>  Military Interventions Win No Support </H5>
  If one says Clinton's diplomatic achievements last year were 
mainly reflected in the economic field, then the incessant 
overseas military interventions were his greatest failure. It 
was Bush who decided to send troops to Somalia under the banner 
of UN peacekeeping forces, but it is Clinton who should be held 
responsible for sending additional troops to Somalia and then 
putting warlord Aidid on the wanted list. The consequences of 
this were large-scale armed disputes, U.S. officers and men 
getting wounded and killed, and high casualties among the 
peacekeeping forces. In the face of acute criticism at home and 
abroad, Secretary of State Christopher was compelled to publicly 
admit last October that the United States made mistakes in 
Somalia. Moreover, the United States sent personnel to hold 
secret talks with Aidid to seek a political solution and fixed 
31 March as the deadline for the pullout of U.S. troops from 
Somalia. 
  The setbacks in Somalia made the Clinton administration 
think 
twice on the question of overseas military intervention. The 
example was that when U.S. military personnel were about to land 
in Haiti in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution 
last October, they were barred from entry by Haiti's military 
and the Clinton administration suppressed its anger and did not 
hastily send ground forces to intervene. Similarly, after 
repeated hesitation, Clinton never used force against Serbian 
troops in Bosnia. One of the reasons for this is that he has 
drawn a lesson from Somalia. 
  The kind of prudence shown by the United States in overseas 
military interventions reflects the readjustment of its defense 
policy. The emphasis of the Clinton administration's defense 
plan is to build up quality armed forces; appropriately cut 
military expenditure, the size of the armed forces, and overseas 
military bases; and enhance quick mobility and combat 
effectiveness. Its objective is to win two regional wars 
simultaneously if this is necessary. It is out of keeping with 
the diplomatic thinking of "putting the economy first" if the 
United States gets involved in a military dispute which is not 
vital to its own strategic interests. Moreover, it will find its 
ability limited, it will be criticized by public opinion, and 
will find the loss outweighs the gain. If the Clinton 
administration can learn something from its past setbacks, does 
more things like bringing about the signing of the Palestinian- 
Israeli peace accord, and carries out less unnecessary military 
interventions, it should be able to improve its prestige at home 
and abroad. 
  However, it remains to be seen whether or not the United 
States will take new military risks abroad in an attempt to 
"revive its military prowess." Clinton has one problem, namely, 
that as the president and the general commander of the Armed 
Forces, his relations with the U.S. military have never been 
straightened out. During the Vietnam War, he refused to serve in 
the Armed Forces. No sooner had he become the president than he 
legalized homosexuality in the Armed Forces and continued to cut 
military expenditures, thus offending many high-ranking military 
personalities. Recently, U.S. leaders had an internal argument 
as to how to use limited foreign aid. Clinton and Gore were on 
one side, favoring using more foreign aid to promote 
environmental protection and "democratization" of other 
countries, and not on traditional items related to national 
security, and this was another issue with the military. At the 
end of last year, compelled by pressure from the military, 
Clinton could not but agree to lower the military spending cuts. 
In the future, faced with frequent regional military conflicts, 
nationality confrontations, religious disputes, and the 
proliferation of sophisticated weapons about which the United 
States is most worried, it is doubtful whether or not the 
Clinton administration can really place its foreign policy 
emphasis on the economy. 
<H5>  Values Are Challenged </H5>
  The Clinton administration considers the safeguarding of 
economic security, maintaining powerful Armed Forces, and 
promoting global democracy as the "three pillars" of its foreign 
policy. In promoting the values of American-style "democracy" 
and "human rights," Clinton really has nothing to brag about. 
At international forums such as the World Human Rights 
Conference held last June, Western human rights concepts sharply 
contradicted the views of many developing countries. In the 
face of the speedy economy development of East Asia, many 
Americans admit that it is not merely Western political and 
social development patterns that can lead to economic 
prosperity. In an article entitled "the Clash of 
Civilizations," Harvard University Professor Samuel P. 
Huntington predicts that conflict between civilizations will 
supplant ideological conflict, and Confucian civilization and 
Islamic civilization may join hands to pose a strong challenge 
to Western interests, values, and power. Some commentators hold 
that Huntington's argument shows a pessimism of being incapable 
of making the world accept American values. Various facts show 
that in promoting "democratization" in the world today, the 
United States meets no less resistance than it did during the 
Cold War. 
  The Clinton administration has set aside $1 billion to 
strive 
to support Russia economically so as to expand the "democratic 
family." But President Yeltsin's American-supported radical 
political and economic reforms have not produced obvious 
results. The bloody disputes in Moscow last October ended with 
the "democratic faction's" temporary victory. But no sooner had 
Americans had a breathing spell than the worrying "Zhirinovsky 
phenomenon" appeared in Russia's year-end parliament elections. 
The question of how the United States should cope once the 
extreme nationalist forces get the upper hand in Russia will be 
a big test for Clinton. 
  Generally speaking, in his first year of governing, Clinton 
has had diplomatic achievements and failures. Economically, in 
handling relations with other major powers, he seems to have 
made some positive readjustments. But he has met some obvious 
setbacks in overseas military interventions and has had numerous 
obstacles in pursuing "democratization." The Clinton 
administration does not have any immediate diplomatic issues at 
the present time, and it is a rare opportunity for him to make a 
review and readjustments. Can he prudently and pragmatically 
conform to the trends of the times? People are waiting to see.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Baijia (4545 4102 1367): "A Shift to the South in </F>
Focus and Fulcrum--a Noteworthy Change in Sino-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] Chairman Jiang Zemin and President Clinton had a 
formal meeting in the second half of last November in Seattle. 
The two leaders agreed that Sino-U.S. relations were very 
important. The relations concerned more than bilateral ties; 
they should be looked at in a global context, with the focus on 
the 21st century. Details of the talks were not revealed, but 
the choice of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference 
as the venue for the meeting for the two state leaders after an 
almost five-year break was itself profoundly significant. 
<H5>  Security Considerations Replaced by Economic Factors </H5>
  When China and the United States normalized their relations 
22 years ago, leaders of the two countries were looking at the 
north of Asia. Despite the then ongoing Vietnam war, the two 
countries, mainly motivated by a desire to ward off the 
hegemonism of the former Soviet Union, improved their relations. 
Twenty-two years later, when leaders of the two countries are 
thinking of and discussing their relations, they are looking at 
the dynamic region of Southeast Asia (including China). The 
truth is, the shift of their focus was prompted by the shift of 
the overlapping interests (mutual or conflicting) between the 
two countries. The shift was reflected not only in geographical 
changes, but also in the changed proportions of various key 
factors in overall Sino-U.S. relations. Twenty-two years ago, 
security was almost the sole factor in Sino- U.S. relations. 
Today, the new economic factor is becoming increasingly bigger. 
The shift toward the south in Sino-U.S. relations has just 
started, but its impact on bilateral relations, multilateral 
relations in the Asia-Pacific region, and the future multipolar 
world cannot be ignored. 
<H5>  The Three Causes Behind the Shift Toward the South </H5>
  Why have Sino-U.S. relations shifted toward the south? 
Stated simply, there are three causes: First, it was a result 
of recent changes and developments in the global political and 
economic situation. I do not intend to repeat the arguments as 
the movement of the post-Cold War global political world toward 
multipolarity and the lone brilliant performance of the 
Southeast Asian economy amid the yet-to-recover global economy 
have been covered by many articles. 
  Second, for four years, China stood up to pressures from the 
West, increased the pace of reform and opening up, actively 
developed relations with countries sharing common borders and 
its Asian neighbors, and scored a series of significant results. 
As the understanding and trust between China and these 
countries grew, an "Asian" political and economic cooperation 
distinguished by political independence, economic 
interdependence, a fading of ideological differences, mutual 
tolerance, and an Asian concept of human rights different from 
the West's is taking shape. The entry of China into the East 
Asian economy and the considerable growth of its trade ties with 
Japan, ROK, and ASEAN countries, injecting new vitality into the 
region, made Western countries look at China with a new eye. 
  Third, the shift toward the south in Sino-U.S relations was 
also a result of the new approach toward China adopted by 
Clinton since he came to power. In the last few months, the 
United States has made relatively important adjustments in its 
policy toward China, the most important of which was Clinton's 
realization that the Asia-Pacific is a region with great hopes, 
a great future and great vitality, one having a vital bearing on 
U.S. interests. To solve its domestic economic problems, the 
United States needs to strengthen further its ties with the 
Asia-Pacific region. To do that, it has to value China's role. 
In Clinton's own words: "You cannot isolate a country as big 
and important to the world's future as China." 
  Such a change in U.S. policy should be welcomed. The 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the rapid victory in the 
Gulf War created a feeling of invincibility among some Americans 
and Westerners and an illusion that with the passing of the Cold 
War, it was no longer necessary to maintain strategic 
cooperation with China, which explained why they applied 
sanctions to China under numerous pretexts. They were 
imprisoned in their Cold War mentality. However, to their 
surprise, China remained stable politically and more open 
economically, and developed just as rapidly. And the problems 
confronting the world were not as simple as they thought. U.S. 
foreign policy suffered a series of setbacks on the problems of 
Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti, showing that the 
United States could no longer do what it wanted, and that it 
needed to cooperate with China and other countries in dealing 
with various thorny world issues. In particular, when they 
looked at the southern part of East Asia and found the 
prosperity there, the United States and other Western countries 
realized that they could no longer afford to neglect the role of 
China in the Asia-Pacific region and to pass up the economic 
opportunities in China. This can be reasonably described as a 
realistic attitude. 
  The Need To Consider Seriously Two Problems [subhead] 
  Whether or not Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly, 
the 
shift to the south in the political and economic relations of 
the two countries may already signify the beginning of a new 
stage demanding that we scrutinize Sino-U.S. relations with a 
new eye and perspective. 
  In this new stage, both sides will encounter some old 
problems; for example, whether or not the United States can 
abide by the various principles in the three Sino-U.S. joint 
communiques; whether or not their differences on problems of 
trade, human rights, and arms sales can be properly bridged; 
whether or not frictions can be kept at a low level so that they 
will not jeopardize overall bilateral ties; and so on. The 
general belief is that in the near future, there will be 
improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, though not at any fast rate; 
and there may also be some complications. 
  One problem that we should be thinking about, however, is 
under the new situation, what kind of new elements may emerge 
from, and what kind of new problems we may have to face in 
future Sino-U.S. relations. In my view, the following two 
points are important: 
  First, cooperation between the two countries is absolutely 
necessary, though competition will run alongside it. In the 
early days of improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, the security 
interests were clear, easily seen, and mutual. And given the 
then limited economic ties, there were no trade frictions. 
Cooperation then was relatively smooth. But the situation 
began to change in the early 1980's and looked quite different 
by the 1990's. When the center of bilateral relations shifted 
to the southeastern part of Asia, China and the United States 
still shared a common interest in maintaining the security and 
stability of the Asia-Pacific region, but on specific issues 
their interests began to diverge and even clashed. The Western 
media hype about "threats from China" on the Taiwan issue was a 
case in point. Another key factor was the increasing 
proportions of economic and trade and technological 
considerations in Sino-U.S. relations. In economic relations, 
what is inevitable is competition. Although China, the United 
States, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries strongly 
complement each other economically, it is plain to see that in 
many areas there is competition, and that it is increasingly 
fierce. Apart from the economic factor, the Clinton 
administration's adjustment of its Asia policy, and its great 
concern for it, was also prompted by political considerations. 
How to face this cooperation-competition situation in future 
Sino- U.S. relations is an important subject we must think 
through. 
  Second, multilateral ties between China, the United States, 
and the Asia-Pacific region mean that there will be more 
international factors acting as constraints on Sino-U.S. 
relations. The "macrotriangular relations" between the United 
States, China, and the Soviet Union in the Cold War era were 
relatively simple. With the end of the Cold War, the center of 
Sino-U.S. relations moved south and exercised far greater 
influence on the stability and development of the entire 
Asia-Pacific region and made all kinds of relations much more 
complicated. On the one hand, the ups and downs of Sino-U.S. 
relations will impact on their respective relations with other 
Asia-Pacific countries; and on the other hand, developments and 
changes in any of their respective relations with Asia-Pacific 
countries will bounce back on Sino-U.S. relations. The 
prospects for Sino-U.S. relations is a great concern for Asia- 
Pacific countries. Lee Kuan-yew recently suggested to the 
United States that it take China as its "strategic partner." A 
noted Australian personage also criticized the U.S. Government's 
attempt to impose its own human rights concepts on Asian 
countries. All these illustrate the problem well. Therefore, 
how to make use of channels arising from bilateral and 
multilateral relations to foster positive development in 
Sino-U.S. relations and multilateral relations with the 
Asia-Pacific region is another key subject we should think about 
and pursue in action. 
  Of course, describing the shift of the center of Sino-U.S. 
relations toward the south does not mean that there are no 
common concerns and significant common interests for China and 
the United States in Northeast Asia. It is still true to say 
that situations in Northeast Asia still stir and sway Sino-U.S. 
relations. 
  I have not intended to conduct a full review of Sino-U.S. 
relations in this short article. What I wanted to stress was 
the ongoing change of a background factor in Sino-U.S. 
relations. The argument that the center of Sino-U.S. relations 
has shifted to the south calls for another look. However, I 
hope that by offering this argument I can provide a new 
perspective in observing and making forecasts on Sino-U.S. 
relations.

  [Text] Washington, April 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense 
Department investigators have found that the IFF (identification 
friend or foe) systems of the two U.S. Army helicopters shot 
down by U.S. fighter planes were turned off when the incident 
took place, it was reported here today. 
  The two U.S. UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters mistakenly 
identified as Iraqi Hind helicopters by the two U.S. Air force 
F-15C fighters were shot down in northern Iraq on April 14. 
  The WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Pentagon officials as saying 
that 
the switches on the Black Hawks' IFF units were found in the 
"off" position when investigators sifted through the wreckage in 
the crash sites. 
  But one official described the findings as preliminary, 
saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from 
"on" to "off." 
  The newspaper said if the helicopters had been flying 
through 
the no-fly zone with the IFF transponder shut off, it would 
explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system] aircraft 
got no response when it electronically queried them shortly 
before the F- 15C planes fired the missiles.

  [Text] New York, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's trade and 
investment fair in New York closed here today, and organizers 
and participants described it as "a complete success." 
  The fair, which started Tuesday [19 April] afternoon, 
attracted more than 700 business people from about 300 U.S. 
firms. The Chinese and U.S. businessmen have signed 62 
contracts and agreements valued at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars, 
according to the spokesman of the fair. 
  The spokesman said these deals include six contracts on U.S. 
investment in China and agreements on China's purchasing of 600 
million dollar U.S. commodities. 
  The 200-member strong Chinese trade and investment mission 
came to the United States two weeks ago with the Chinese 
economic and trade delegation, headed by Wu Yi, Chinese minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  While the minister and her delegation was in Washington to 
attend the eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on 
Commerce and Trade last week, the Chinese entrepreneurs also 
held a trade and investment fair in Los Angeles. 
  In Los Angeles fair, the two sides have signed 11 contracts 
worth 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134 agreements valued at 4.4 
billion dollars. 
  Shen Yonglie, one of the chiefs of the Chinese mission, told 
the press that he had found that U.S. business people are 
extremely active in trying to understand China and in finding 
ways to do business with China and to invest in China. 
  "A number of senior U.S. business leaders had proposed," 
Shen 
said, "that Chinese fairs of this kind should be held in the 
United States once a year." 
  Chinese entrepreneurs, he added, were also very much 
interested in establishing closer business ties with their 
American counterparts. 
  "In this regard, we have already achieved our goals," Shen 
said. "we have set up a lot of contacts with U.S. firms, far 
more than we had expected." 
  The Chinese official expressed his belief that these 
contacts 
would result in much closer business relations between the two 
countries.

  [Text] New York, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- A large-scale economic 
and trade fair between China and the United States opened at 2 
P.M. today at the Roosevelt Hotel in the business district of 
New York City. More than 500 Chinese entrepreneurs and American 
investors and traders took part in enthusiastic, friendly, and 
excited talks on trade between the two countries and making 
investments in China. 
  After just one hour, six agreements on large-scale 
investment 
and trade were concluded. Entrepreneurs of the two countries 
were all smiles when they signed the agreements. The agreements 
include the construction of a power station and a steel mill in 
China, and the sale of computers, oil prospecting equipment, 
meters, and instruments to China. The value of the agreements 
exceeded $1 billion. 
  Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
who came to the United States to attend the eighth session of 
the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade, attended 
the signing ceremony for the agreements. 
  Wu Yi delivered a speech at the signing ceremony. She said: 
China's society is stable with fast economic growth and the 
people's standard of living has been rising quickly, providing 
favorable conditions for making investments in China by foreign 
businessmen. She said: "From now to the year 2000, China will 
import commodities with a total value of $1,000 billion. The 
huge Chinese market is the best place for investments by all 
farsighted entrepreneurs. 
  Taking part in the economic and trade fair were Chinese 
entrepreneurs from 26 provinces and municipalities, and staff 
members of eight ministries and commissions, and corporations 
with branch offices in three [as received] foreign countries, 
totaling more than 200 representatives. Earlier, they took part 
in similar activities at a trade fair in Los Angeles from 11 to 
16 April. The two sides signed 11 contracts worth $1.3 billion, 
and several agreements. 
  Today's trade fair had the same enthusiastic atmosphere and 
tendencies as the Los Angeles fair. Many U.S. businessmen flew 
several thousand kilometers from as far away as Washington, 
California, Texas, and Florida. (Carl Morgenthau), an investor 
from Washington State, was especially interested in the Chinese 
market. He said the purpose of his participation in the fair was 
to better study China's market and investment environment, and 
do his best to invest more American capital in China. (John 
Flagg) of a manufacturing company in Ohio signed an agreement at 
the fair with China's Qinghai Province today on cooperation in 
producing tires. He said: "I am optimistic about the Chinese 
market and I am 200 percent confident in the future of 
cooperation with China."

  [Text] Chengdu, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chengdu Aero 
Instrument and Meter Corporation (CAIMC) will deliver 1,306 
MD-90 Central Air Data Computers (CADC) to the Honeywell 
Corporation of the United States by 2006. 
  Lin Yunfeng, general manager of the company based in the 
capital of Sichuan Province, said that these computers will be 
installed in MD-90 aircraft to be built by the McDonnell Douglas 
Company. 
  He said the computers were designed jointly by the Chengdu 
company and the Honeywell Corporation, one of the largest aero 
electronics enterprises in the U.S., and built by the former. 
  The Chinese partner has installed the first computer 
assembly 
line, which produced five samples in 1993. 
  Over the past two years, the American partner has sent 
experts here to inspect product quality, he said. 
  The MD-90 is one of McDonnell Douglas's newest types of 
aircraft, Lin Yunfeng said, adding that its use of Chinese-built 
parts shows that Sino-U.S. cooperation has paid off. 
  He said that his company and the Honeywell Corporation have 
begun negotiation on other cooperative projects. 
  A Japanese electronics corporation initially wanted to sell 
its products to the Chengdu company. But after visiting the 
MD-90 CADC assembly line, executives of the Japanese company 
decided to buy computers from the latter. "Negotiations for the 
deal are now under way," said Lin. 
  He said that his company is rated as a key enterprise for 
producing China's aeronautics equipment, with engineers and 
technicians accounting for 30 percent of its workforce.

  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], April 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng and President S. A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan 
pledged in their formal talks today to expand the scope of 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The two leaders, in two rounds of talks held at the 
presidential palace, had an in-depth exchange of views on ways 
of furthering bilateral relations as well as on regional and 
international issues of common concern, in what a Chinese 
spokesman called "a cordial and friendly atmosphere." 
  Li Peng and Niyazov were satisfied with the "steady and 
smooth" expansion of bilateral ties since the two countries 
forged diplomatic relations in early 1992, according to the 
source. 
  Li Peng said President Niyazov's successful visit to China 
in 
1992 "opened a new chapter in the annals of friendship between 
China and Turkmenistan." 
  The two countries enjoy a good political relationship, and 
their economic ties are expanding, showing vast potentials for 
development, Li noted. 
  He added that "with mutual understanding and trust, we have 
reason to believe in further growth of such ties." 
  Niyazov said that Li's visit is long-awaited, "but this does 
not mean we have any differences or urgent problems to be 
addressed. Instead, it shows Turkmenistan's sincerity for 
developing relations with China." 
  "We admire China's long history, brilliant culture and 
industrious people, as well as its leadership's wisdom," the 
spokesman quoted Niyazov as saying. 
  The president said he learned a lot during his visit to 
China 
in 1992, which he said is useful reference. However, he added, 
as conditions in Turkmenistan are different, "we would not 
simply copy China's experience." 
  Li agreed with that, saying that a country knows best its 
own 
history, tradition and characteristics, and instead of copying a 
foreign mode, should go along a path of development compatible 
with its own national conditions. 
  "The government of Turkmenistan is doing just that," he 
said. 
"China fully understands and respects Turkmenistan's domestic 
and foreign policy." 
  Li, referring to bilateral economic cooperation, which is 
only at its initial stage with a modest trade volume, noted that 
both countries are sincere to expand trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  Relevant departments of the two countries are discussing 
ways 
of expanding the scope and tapping the potentials of such 
cooperation, he said. 
  With political stability and abundant reserves of oil and 
gas, Turkmenistan is in a good position to revitalize the 
economy, Li said, calling the country's on-going economic 
readjustment "a wise move," which will serve to boost economic 
development. 
  Touching on potential cooperation in building a gas 
pipeline, 
Li said that would be a project extending into the next century, 
which requires a thorough feasibility study. 
  "If it is indeed feasible, such a project will benefit all 
parties concerned," he said. "China is willing to explore the 
possibilities in this regard, together with relevant countries, 
including Turkmenistan." 
  China and Turkmenistan can cooperate in other fields as 
well, he said, adding he expected the top Chinese entrepreneurs 
traveling with him to have close contact with their local 
counterparts and strive for "concrete results." 
  Niyazov briefed Li on Turkmenistan's relations with other 
nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the 
neighboring countries, saying his country maintains good, normal 
nation-to- nation ties with them. 
  During the talks, Li gave an account of the minority 
nationalities in China. 
  Owing to China's correct policy on nationalities, the 
Xinjiang Autonomous Region and other areas inhabited by 
minority ethnic groups, just like other parts of the country, 
enjoy political stability, economic development and 
considerable improvement in people's livelihood, he said. 
  Niyazov said Turkmenistan respects China's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, appreciates its policy on nationalities, 
and opposes national splittism, according to the source.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin told local leaders here today that the political 
situation in the country is stabilizing, according to the 
ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY. 
  Opening a meeting with the heads of local republics and 
regions in Moscow, the Russian president also stressed that the 
balance between the executive and legislative branches of power 
is taking shape. 
  "Much has changed in the country in the past few months, 
political stabilization is gaining strength, the disastrous 
state of dual-power has been overcome," Yeltsin pointed out. 
  "The system of meetings with the republic heads is being 
renewed," the president said, adding that approximately five to 
seven such meetings should be held a year. 
  Today's meeting is the first of its kind since the adoption 
of a new constitution and the elections for the federal 
parliament. 
  On the recent local elections in the country, Yeltsin said: 
"The elections are valid in 61 federal regions. In only 17 is 
voter turnout too low." He expressed the hope that all the 
local elections would be concluded by the end of this year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Yeltsin Tunes Moscow's Voice Over Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has stressed that Russia's position on the Bosnian crisis 
remained unchanged, in an clear effort to tune up different 
voices from his key ministers over the issue. 
  In an interview with the Russian daily "SEVODNYA" (TODAY) 
issued on Thursday, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that "I 
do not completely agree to Vitaliy Churkin," Yeltsin's special 
envoy in former Yugoslavia, who reportedly accused the Bosnian 
Serbs earlier this week of "duplicity" and of "abusing" Russian 
goodwill. 
  Grachev stressed that the Bosnian Serbs had not launched any 
attacks on the Moslem-held town of Gorazde in the past "two 
days." 
  He described it as "tactless" simply to charge them with 
violating ceasefire and launching attacks. 
  The defense minister held both the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims 
responsible for the latest outburst of fighting and said air 
strikes were not the way to end the conflict. 
  Regarding air strikes as highly dangerous, Grachev said 
60,000 to 70,000 UN troops would have to be sent to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the conflict by force, an option he 
said was out of the question since it would spark a large-scale 
war. 
  According to the local press, both the Bosnian Serbs and 
Moslems forces renewed fighting in Gorazde on Wednesday only 
hours after the Serbs signed a truce with the UN to end their 
assault. 
  After meeting with international mediators David Owen and 
Thovald Stoltenberg in Moscow on Wednesday evening, Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev told reporters that "Serbian attacks on civil 
cities, hospitals, Red Cross cites and UN observers in Gorazde 
cannot be justified." 
  "They (Bosnian Serbs) violate the interests of Serbs 
themselves and Russia alike," the Russian foreign minister 
stated. 
  He also stressed that Bosnian Serbs should understand that 
each step toward all-round halting of warfare will entail 
appropriate decisions on lifting sanctions. 
  Both his and Churkin's remarks were seen as that Moscow had 
finally lost patience with the Bosnian Serbs, its traditional 
allies in the Balkans, over their continued attacks on Gorazde. 
  However, Kozyrev stressed, Russia cannot agree with mounting 
air strikes by NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) 
forces, since this may only escalate tension in the region. 
  Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the Coordination 
Committee of the International Conference on Yugoslavia, arrived 
in Moscow on Wednesday for talks on Bosnian settlement. 
  At a meeting of Russia's Security Council Wednesday, Yeltsin 
pointed out that force would not solve the conflict, noting: 
"Use of military force -- moreover delivering such strong air 
strikes -- without coordination in the UN Security Council is 
impermissible."

  [Text] Vienna, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has invited UN nuclear inspectors to be 
present at the refueling of its main nuclear reactor, an IAEA 
spokesman said here today. 
  David Kyd, a spokesman of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), said the inspection this time would be "very 
important" for the UN agency to clear up allegations that the 
DPRK was developing nuclear weapons. 
  The IAEA has accepted DPRK's invitation, he added. 
  Kyd had said earlier today that the IAEA responded 
positively 
to DPRK's new offer and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA 
inspection could be agreed upon, a new expert mission would 
leave for DPRK "before the end of this month." 
  It was reported that the fresh inspection would focus on 
DPRK's Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China's and Egypt's 
presidents voiced the hope here today that their countries' 
bilateral contacts and friendly relations will be further 
intensified and promoted. 
  President Jiang Zemin and visiting Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak expressed this hope in talks here this afternoon, which 
proceeded in a "cordial and friendly" atmosphere, according to 
Chinese officials. 
  Mubarak flew in here at noon today for a three-day state 
visit as Jiang's guest. 
  China and Egypt, separated by mountains and rivers, maintain 
close ties, Jiang said in the talks. 
  Calling him an old friend, Jiang expressed appreciation of 
Mubarak's positive efforts in promoting the development of 
Sino-Egyptian ties. 
  The friendship between China and Egypt, two ancient 
civilizations, has a long history, he said. 
  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 38 years ago, 
bilateral ties have been developing steadily and exchanges and 
cooperation in politics, economy, trade and other fields 
proceeding smoothly. 
  The two sides share identical or similar views on major 
international issues and have good co-ordination and cooperation 
on global issues, Jiang said. 
  At present, both countries are faced with tasks of deepening 
reforms, developing their economy and raising people's living 
standards. They can learn from each other and share experience 
in many respects, he noted. 
  The Chinese Government and people greatly cherish the 
Sino-Egyptian friendship. "We feel satisfied with the 
development of the bilateral relations," he told Mubarak. 
  Mubarak expressed his satisfaction with the deep traditional 
friendship between the two countries. 
  Egypt attached importance to the development of friendly 
ties 
of cooperation with China and their cooperation in politics, 
economy, science and technology has been developing in a 
sustained and steady manner, Mubarak said. 
  He gave Jiang a brief account of the peace talks between the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel as well as the 
Middle East peace process. 
  The talks have achieved a breakthrough and the two sides 
have 
signed an agreement on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank town of Jericho, he said. 
  However, a lot of problems remain to be tackled and call for 
the joint efforts of all parties concerned, Mubarak said. 
  China welcomes the progress of the talks, Jiang said. 
History has shown that conflicts between different countries 
can only be solved through peaceful negotiations. 
  Yet, the Middle East issue is very complicated and it is 
only 
too natural to encounter some difficulties and obstacles in the 
process, he said. 
  "We hope all the parties concerned continue their flexible 
and practical attitude, overcome obstacles and make strenuous 
efforts to make the talks a complete success at an early date," 
Jiang said. 
  China will continue to do its part in pushing forward the 
peace process and in the realization of a complete peace in the 
region, he said. 
  China highly values the role Egypt plays in the Middle East, 
he said, adding that it appreciates Egypt's efforts in 
maintaining the interests of the Arab people and the just rights 
of the Palestine people, and in propelling the peace process 
forward. 
  On the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, Jiang said 
that 
China maintains that the issue be settled properly through 
consultations and negotiations between the four parties 
concerned. 
  "We don't favor imposing pressure or sanctions on the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea," he said. "We believe 
that imposing pressure or sanctions can only make things more 
complicated." 
  Egypt holds identical views on this matter, Mubarak told 
Jiang. 
  The two leaders also exchanged views on Somalia and South 
Africa, and briefed each other on their respective countries' 
situations. 
  Mubarak invited Jiang to visit Egypt. Jiang accepted the 
invitation. 
  After the talks, Jiang and Mubarak attended the signing of 
an 
agreement on the encouragement and reciprocal protection of 
investments and an agreement on assistance in civil, commercial 
and criminal matters. 
  In the evening, Jiang hosted a banquet for Mubarak and his 
entourage. 
  Chinese vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and 
Xiao Yang, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception 
Committee and minister of justice, took part in the talks and 
banquet. 
  This afternoon, Jiang held a welcoming ceremony in Mubarak's 
honor.

  [Text] China will maintain its role in the Middle East 
peace process, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday in Beijing. 
  And he called on the parties concerned to remove obstacles 
to 
achieving further results in their on-going talks. 
  He told Egyptian President Husni Mubarak that China values 
the positive role Egypt has been playing in the peace process. 
  Mubarak, who flew in for a three day visit yesterday, 
briefed 
Jiang on the Israeli-PLO negotiations and the developments in 
the Middle East peace process. 
  Meanwhile, the two countries signed an agreement to 
encourage 
and protect reciprocal investments and a pact on judicial 
assistance. 
  On the Middle East situation, Mubarak said Israel and the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had made a 
breakthrough in signing the Gaza-Jericho self-rule pact. 
  However, they face many problems at present and the parties 
had to make concerted efforts to push forward the Middle East 
peace process, he said. 
  Jiang said China welcomes the ground-breaking progress in 
the 
Israeli-PLO peace talks. 
  "It is a fact already proven by history that state-to-state 
conflicts have to be settled through peaceful negotiations," he 
said. 
  Jiang said the Middle East question is very complicated and 
difficulties and obstacles are inevitable during the talks. 
  Therefore, the relevant parties must never give up their 
efforts. They must continue to adopt flexible and pragmatic 
attitudes and remove the obstacles to achieving results. 
  "China has already made, and will continue to make efforts 
to 
promote the Middle East peace process and work for an early 
realization of allround peace in the region," Jiang said. 
  He added that China appreciates the efforts of President 
Mubarak and the Egyptian Government in safeguarding the 
interests of the Arab nation and the lawful rights of the 
Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by unidentified </F>
correspondents on "The World on the Air" program in Beijing on 
21 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] After the [signing] of the 
agreement, we meet now with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. This is 
a happy occasion. Everyone is so upbeat. What will the 
Egyptian people gain from the Egyptian-Chinese friendship? 
  [Musa] The talks were held in an excellent atmosphere of 
cooperation, friendship, and trust. Egypt and China are going 
through the same phase of economic development. In addition, 
the two countries share a common view of a number of 
international developments and problems. 
  We discussed international problems of common concern. We 
went into detail on various problems in the Arab world, Asia, 
Africa, and other parts of the world. We also discussed GATT 
and the current international economic situation. 
  We then discussed the issue of economic development and 
talked about the difficulties and successes experienced by the 
two countries. We reviewed ways of bolstering bilateral 
economic ties. We discussed investment opportunities in Egypt 
and the advantages of using the Egyptian tax-free zones. We 
talked about industrial and technical cooperation. We then 
signed two agreements concerning investment guarantees and 
judicial cooperation, all of which will propel Egyptian-Chinese 
relations into wider horizons, particularly considering the 
feelings of trust and friendship shared by the leaderships of 
both countries. 
  President Mubarak, at the end of the talks, invited the 
Chinese president to visit Egypt in the near future. This visit 
will take place soon. 
  Egyptian-Chinese relations should take a high profile, one 
that befits their promise. The Egyptian and Chinese 
civilizations are very ancient, as old as history itself. 
Cooperation between our countries will be fruitful in the 
cultural, political, economic, and popular sense of the word. 
  [Correspondent] Did the leaders hold private talks before 
the 
delegations met, Your Excellency? 
  [Musa] The talks began with a private meeting between the 
two 
leaders followed by a session in which both delegations took 
part. Tomorrow I will meet the Chinese foreign minister to 
discuss with him a number of matters concerning bilateral 
cooperation and political and economic ties. 
  [Correspondent] Have you discussed [words indistinct] as 
Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Musa] Of course, we discussed all of these matters. 
President Husni Mubarak, who is the current OAU chairman, 
broached a number of African problems, including Somalia and the 
situation in South Africa, in view of the progress recently made 
in the latter country. We also reviewed the situation in the 
Arab world, the peace process, the situation in a number of Arab 
countries, the general Arab situation, and several international 
problems including Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any specific topics that President 
Mubarak plans to discuss tomorrow with Chinese officials? 
  [Musa] Yes, the talks will focus on bilateral relations and 
economic cooperation. Trade between Egypt and China amounts to 
$200 million. We import $140 million worth of goods from China 
and export $60 million. Of course, this situation cannot 
continue. The private sector should assume its role in this 
matter. China is opening up its economy, so are we. Trade and 
economy can no longer be shoved under the carpet. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Acting Premier Zhu 
Rongji and visiting Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
agreed here today that the two sides will work to find new ways 
and means for cooperation and push Sino-Egyptian relations 
forward to a new period of development on the basis of mutual 
respect, equality and mutual benefit. 
  In a 30-minute meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, 
where Mubarak is staying, Zhu conveyed greetings from Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, who is on a tour of five Asian countries. 
  Zhu praised Egypt for its successes in pressing forward with 
economic reform and improving the people's living conditions 
under the guiding principle of peace, stability and development. 
  "We admire President Mubarak and the Egyptian Government for 
following a policy of independence and non-alignment and 
actively seeking a political solution to the Middle East issue," 
said the Chinese leader. 
  He continued that under the care of President Mubarak and 
Chinese leaders, China-Egypt relations have enjoyed sustained 
and steady development. The two countries have had very good 
coordination and cooperation in bilateral political and economic 
relations as well as in handling international issues. 
  Zhu expressed the conviction that Mubarak's current visit 
will add a new page to Sino-Egyptian relations. 
  He also expressed the hope that China and Egypt will have 
more effective collaboration, open up new channels for economic 
cooperation, supply each with what the other needs and seek 
common development. 
  Stronger Sino-Egyptian ties are in accord with the two 
people's interests and beneficial to world peace and stability, 
he added. 
  Zhu also briefed the president on China's economic situation 
and its progress in building a socialist market economy. 
  Mubarak noted that Egypt and China are faced with the same 
tasks of developing the national economy and improving the 
people's living conditions. 
  With regard to each other's reform programs, Mubarak said 
that both countries have the problem in properly handling the 
relationship between development and stability. 
  He also expressed satisfaction with the sustained growth of 
Egypt-China relations and with ever-deepening political and 
economic cooperation. 
  Noting that all his five previous visits to China have 
helped 
push forward bilateral ties, Mubarak expressed the hope that in 
the years to come, top leaders of Egypt and China will 
frequently meet to exchange views, coordinate the two countries' 
positions and push Sino-Egyptian cooperation to new depth and 
width. 
  After the meeting, Zhu hosted a luncheon in honor of Mubarak 
and visiting Egyptian officials.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--PRC President Jiang Zemin has 
stressed that the PRC has not changed its principled stance on 
the Middle East peace process after establishing ties with 
Israel. In a statement in Friday's edition of AL-AHRAM, Jiang 
says experience has shown that the existing conflict in the 
region can only be resolved through negotiations. He welcomed 
the peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel, and 
called on all parties to show flexibility so that through 
negotiations results can be reached as quickly as possible. 
  Jiang stressed that his country, which is a Security Council 
permanent member, is ready to work with the international 
community and with Egypt to continue efforts toward a quick 
comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. He noted 
that his country is linked to the Arab countries through 
traditional friendship and that it has consistently supported 
the fair cause of the Arab and Palestinian people. He stressed 
that his country will continue its positive role in advancing 
the peace process in the Middle East, and continue supporting 
and developing the region. 
  Discussing the PRC's experience in the field of economic 
reform, Jiang said that the reform process is proceeding 
gradually so as to maintain social stability, fairness, and 
economic viability simultaneously. He pointed out that the 
transformations in the PRC's economy are not too drastic and 
that the drastic trend in certain sectors has been checked, 
noting that the PRC government is trying to control inflation.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Tan Hongkai: "Problems Remain in Reform </F>
of Government"] 
  [Text] China still has to solve problems on the way to 
reforming government structures, senior officials told a 
conference in Beijing yesterday. 
  Reforms had made initial progress, personnel vice-minister 
Zhang Zhijian told the first day of the International Symposium 
on Administrative Reform. 
  But he called for serious attention to "such outstanding 
problems as strategies for administrative reforms, relations 
between central and local governments and reform of 
administrative legislation." 
  Qian Qizhi, a bureau chief with the Central Organization and 
Establishment Committee (COAEC), said there was a "pressing 
need" for a solution to three problems. They were: 
  -- How to make the transfer of government functions 
acceptable to everyone they affected. 
  "Besides some fetters in people's minds, an important factor 
is some government departments' reluctance to relinquish their 
powers," he said. 
  -- How to coordinate structural reforms with reforms in 
other 
fields. 
  Structural reforms must advance in harmony with economic, 
political and personnel reforms, he said. 
  -- And how to properly and effectively accommodate redundant 
officials who are removed from government offices. 
  "The ultimate results of government reforms, in a certain 
sense, rest on a solution to this problem," he said. 
  Gu Jiaqi, deputy director of the General Office of the 
COAEC, 
proposed a step-by-step approach to the country's administrative 
reforms and placed major emphasis on practical strategies. 
  "Strategic plans will be of no avail in the absence of 
powerful executive bodies," he warned. 
  The number of agencies directly under the State Council has 
already been cut from 86 to 59, and the staff of 37,000 reduced 
by 7,500 or 20 percent. 
  With the first stage of reforms at ministry level coming to 
a 
conclusion, similar changes are spreading nationwide at local 
level. 
  Streamlining of redundant personnel will remain an important 
part of administrative reforms in China, said Gu. And more than 
2 million officials would leave government offices in this round 
of reforms. 
  The three-day symposium is sponsored by United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) as part of its role in 
restructuring China's State agencies. 
  It has attracted experts from UNDP, Australia, Britain, 
France, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, the United States as well as 
Chinese officials and researchers.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese campaign 
to help orphans and if possible adopt them has aroused wide 
attention among people of all walks of life since it was 
initiated late last year. 
  The Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Radio, Film 
and Television and the Ministry of Culture will jointly hold a 
large show and a charity auction in a bid to raise more funds 
for orphans. 
  A group of well-known cultural and artistic workers, and 
business people have volunteered to join "Songs for Orphans", a 
fund-raising program launched by the Beijing Music Radio Station. 
  More and more people are taking part in the publicity 
campaign, which has also won great support from many overseas 
Chinese. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Chairman 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Qiao 
Shi have recently each sent personal messages of support to the 
campaign. 
  China is believed to have about 100,000 orphans. But living 
standards of orphans are below the national per capita average. 
  Orphans now living in various welfare organizations across 
the country only have an average monthly living expense of 50 
yuan. 
  The helping-the-orphan program was initiated by the China 
Society for the Promotion of Social Services, under the guidance 
of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
  The program is aimed at pooling more funds and other 
resources to help orphans live a better life, resume study, to 
help upgrade endangered buildings in welfare centers and to buy 
more medical equipment for welfare facilities.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] After being beaten up by a policeman in Beijing 
last year, Yan Zhengxue, a well-known deputy from the People's 
Congress of Zhejiang province, has been sentenced to two years 
in a labour-education camp for allegedly stealing a bicycle. 
  The sentence came just two weeks after the police officer 
who 
beat up Yan was given just a one-year suspended sentence. Yan's 
detention has been cited by Beijing's dissident community as yet 
another effort by the authorities to muzzle pro-democracy 
activists, who had championed the legislator. 
  The Beijing Municipal Labour-Education Administrative 
Committee handed down Yan's sentence on Tuesday after he had 
been found guilty of stealing a new Forever-brand bicycle, worth 
about 400 yuan (HK$355), from outside a Beijing University 
canteen on September 17 last year. The committee did not say 
why Yan had been given such a severe penalty for a relatively 
trivial offence but yesterday's BEIJING DAILY described the 
legislator as an "inveterate evil-doer" who basically deserved 
everything he got. The newspaper said that the outrage 
expressed by many people at the lenient treatment of the police 
officer who beat up Yan reflected an inadequate understanding of 
the law. 
  The officer acted strictly within the law in forcibly 
detaining an "unreasonable and argumentative" Yan after he 
"caused chaos" on a public bus by demanding to be let off in 
between designated stops, the paper said. Yan, a painter 
associated with the artistic community at Beijing's Old Summer 
Palace, had become something of a cause celebre in the capital 
after he took the police officer to court last year. Analysts 
said the sentencing of Yan and lenient treatment of the police 
officer was probably designed to act as a warning to the people 
of Beijing not to challenge the authority of the police and the 
Government. 
  In January, more than 300 of the nation's leading 
intellectuals put their names to a petition addressed to 
National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi demanding an 
investigation into the abuse of police power as evidenced in the 
Yan case. 
  Leaders of the petition included Beijing University law 
lecturer Yuan Hongbing and law graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who 
were arrested in early March for masterminding another petition 
demanding improvements in labour rights. 
  "The authorities are taking it out on Yan because the 
Yan-related petition is seen as the one that galvanised the 
pro-democracy movement this Year," a source said.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429) in Beijing 20 April 1994: "Chinese Authorities Are 
Seriously Worried About Stability"] 
  [Text] There were three noticeable slogans in the 
resolution on developing the national economy adopted by the 
Eighth National People's Congress at its second session last 
March: first, to maintain "sustained, rapid, and healthy" 
development of the national economy; second, to "grasp the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open wider, promote development, and 
maintain stability," this being the overall guideline for this 
year's work in the whole party and country; third, to correctly 
handle the relationship between "reform, development, and 
stability." The first slogan is the strategy, and the last two 
slogans are the tactics. The general spirit is to take economic 
construction as the central link. The sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy is the foundation 
for social stability and will also provide a favorable economic 
and social environment for the smooth advancement of reform. 
Stability is the precondition for reform and development, and 
without a stable social environment, nothing can be 
accomplished. Only by persisting in reform and opening and by 
developing the economy can China maintain fundamental stability. 
  However, according to sources in Beijing, the strategy and 
tactics for economic development laid down by the authorities 
were not completely understood by local leaders at various 
levels, therefore, they were not properly put into practice. In 
view of this situation, the CPC authorities held a special 
enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in early April to 
reiterate that leaders at the central, ministerial-provincial, 
and prefectural-city levels must unify their thinking and should 
fully understand and earnestly implement the principle of 
ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy, and the meeting also stressed that in the next 
few years, the whole party should give top priority to stability 
and take it as the overwhelming task above everything else. 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin also spoke at the meeting, and he 
particularly mentioned the importance of stability. 
  Jiang Zemin said: How to properly handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability is a key factor 
concerning whether there is sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. "The central leadership holds that 
development is the objective, reform is the driving force, and 
stability is the guarantee. Stability is the precondition for 
development and reform. Without a stable political and social 
environment, development and reform are impossible. In this 
sense, stability is of primary importance, and stability 
overrides everything [wending yadao yiqie di 4489 1353 1090 0227 
0001 0434 4104]. Without stability, nothing can be 
accomplished. In fact, Western capitalist countries, developing 
countries, and socialist countries as well, all give top 
priority to the work of maintaining social stability. During the 
period of the "two sessions" (referring to the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress and the session of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Comrade 
Xiaoping once again pointed out that we had paid our tuition 
fees in this regard and should now become clever. Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union were still paying their 
tuition fees." 
  Jiang Zemin added: "The Central Political Bureau unanimously 
understands the importance of stability overriding everything. 
Therefore, it explicitly pointed out that all reform policies 
and development measures which have a major impact on the 
stability of the situation and social stability, and which may 
cause major shocks to society, must be suspended immediately. 
This is an attitude of being faithful to the people's 
interests, to the state interests, and to the party's cause, and 
is a realistic attitude. At the same time, this is also a major 
criterion for judging whether leaders at various levels are 
keeping in line with the central leadership [yu zhong yang bao 
chi chi yi zhi 5280 0022 1135 0202 2170 0001 5268]." 
  People in political and economic circles in Beijing also 
said 
that since the beginning of this year, the Beijing authorities 
have been continuously stressing the importance of stability. 
Now, Jiang Zemin has further set forth the slogan that 
"stability is the overwhelming priority [wending yadao yiqie 
4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434]." This indicates that the 
authorities's deep concern about instability outweighs their 
considerations of reform and development. This is related to 
the heavy tasks of reform this year. On the part of the CPC, 
this year is a key year for implementing the "50 points" adopted 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
for turning the planned economy into a market economy structure, 
and is thus a year in which reforms will be carried out most 
intensively. Reforms will at least be carried out in three 
major fields. First, major reform measures will be adopted in 
the fiscal and taxation, banking, and investment systems for the 
purpose of establishing and improving the macroeconomic control 
system; second, a modern enterprise system will be introduced in 
state-owned enterprises; and third, price reform will be further 
advanced in order to develop and improve the market structure. 
All of these reforms must be carried out; otherwise, reform 
will get nowhere. Although the reforms mentioned above cannot 
be completed in one year, the main steps must be taken within 
this year through careful arrangements so that significant 
breakthroughs can be made in some key points. As reform has to 
deal with tough issues and has to be carried out in many fields 
at the same time, it could go beyond the people's endurance. If 
the situation goes beyond the people's endurance, turmoil could 
occur. Therefore, the central authorities also explicitly 
pointed out that two principles must be observed in the process 
of reform and opening: First, the principle of being generally 
beneficial; that is, the adoption of any reform measure must 
bring benefits to most people and must not cause most people to 
suffer losses. Second, the principle of overall endurance; that 
is, the overall endurance capacity must be taken into 
consideration, reform measures that go beyond the people's 
endurance should not be adopted even if the measures are 
correct, and the timing of the adoption of such measures should 
be decided according to current conditions. 
  The sources said that reform will be carried out according 
to 
the principles of general benefits and overall endurance, and 
this means that reform measures will be adopted, but will be 
adopted very prudently. This is correct. However, if the 
authorities just stress that "stability is the overwhelming 
priority," reform and development may be hindered. Without 
reform, it will not be possible to build up a correct path of 
development, and without development, it will not possible to 
maintain stability over a the long term. Therefore, reform, 
development, and stability are three interdependent things, and 
the slogan that "stability is the overwhelming priority" may not 
be appropriate. 
  The sources said that State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
also spoke at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau. He 
said that in order to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy, an important factor is to 
consolidate party and government leading bodies at all levels. 
There are three criteria for judging whether a party and 
government leading body is a good one: 1) whether it 
consistently takes economic construction as the central task; 2) 
whether it is honest and incorrupt and is carrying out 
down-to-earth work; and 3) whether it keeps in line with the 
central leadership. 
  People in political and economic circles in Beijing say that 
as explicit principles and policies for developing the national 
economy have been laid down, Zhu Rongji grasped the key link by 
stressing the role of leading bodies at all levels. Zhu set 
forth three criteria requiring leading bodies to focus attention 
on the central task without deviation, perform public duties 
honestly without corruption, and obey the central authorities 
for the sake of the overall public interest. 
  They said that there are still many problems in China, and 
the most prominent problem is that some localities are not 
obeying the central authorities. For example, inflation could 
not be effectively curbed and was getting more and more serious, 
and this was related to the fact that the local authorities were 
still doing: things in their own way without regard to central 
instructions. Beijing and Guangdong were criticized by the 
central authorities for raising prices. 
  The sources said that these local leaders were daring to do 
this even while Deng Xiaoping was still alive; once Deng passed 
away, there would be a situation of separatist rule by local 
lords. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education for party 
and government leading cadres in this regard and make them 
understand: In the past 15 years since the beginning of reform, 
the general trend was the devolution of power, with the central 
authorities delegating powers to the local authorities; however, 
at the present stage of building the market economy system, the 
situation in which "the central government is poor while the 
local governments are rich" must be changed, because only when 
the central government has sufficient financial resources can 
local governments also benefit. However, in today's market 
economy, it is very hard to make people accept the idea of 
taking the whole country into account. The best way is to 
establish a legal system by means of legislation so that the 
distribution of wealth can be determined by laws. This will be 
an extremely arduous project of legislation!

  [Text] As Gou Qinghui was returning home from work on 
April 12, she looked up at the window of her flat. When she saw 
there was no light on, she knew immediately that something was 
wrong. She had already tried unsuccessfully to telephone her 
husband at his office and knew he had not been to work. Gou's 
husband, who had still been asleep when she left for work at 
6.30 am, had vanished. 
  At 9.20 pm, four men -- police and state security agents -- 
arrived at the flat. They ordered Gou to sign and put her 
thumbprint to a piece of paper which informed her that her 
husband, 32-year-old Xiao Biguang, had been detained for 
"shelter and investigation". The document Gou was shown said 
Xiao had been involved in "illegal activities" related to State 
Council Document number 56, issued in 1980. 
  The police searched the flat and confiscated several 
manuscripts written by Xiao and books in Chinese and English, 
mostly about Christianity. They listed the titles on an 
official form which Gou was also required to sign. One of the 
English titles, copied down awkwardly in an uncomprehending 
police hand, read Cherish No Illusions, Nor Despair. 
  The flat Gou lives in is in a block owned by the party's 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, where her father 
works. On her front door, Gou displays an Easter message which 
reads, in English, "Christ is Risen". Inside the one-room 
apartment, a cassette tape of choral music by Handel played as 
Gou, her curly hair tied back and wearing a simple blue sweater 
and checked skirt, told the story of her husband's 
disappearance. She is a strong and feisty woman who is not 
afraid to challenge the police. But by the end of her tale, she 
had broken into wrenching sobs, her voice rising in outrage that 
the man she described as a good Christian had been taken away 
from her. 
  China's dissidents and their families are, in the main, a 
stoic lot. They have to be. Many dissidents have spent much of 
their lives in prison. Their relatives may have no contact or 
information about their loved ones for years at a time, though 
the policy on visits has become somewhat more relaxed. In 
recent months, some high-profile dissidents have been in and out 
of police detention like yo-yos. Others are on the run, facing 
what may be years of exile from families and friends. But it is 
rare that the emotion shows through. 
  Most dissidents claim they are not afraid of anything the 
authorities can do to them. Wei Jingsheng, before his 
re-arrest, would describe how the prison guards force-fed him, 
twisting a tube down into his stomach. He said he was prepared 
to live through it again. Just once in a while, however, the 
fear shows through. A young student who had escaped from jail 
and was on the run admitted in despair "I don't want to go to 
prison again" just days before being re-arrested. 
  Gou and her husband met at the Yanjing seminary, where she 
teaches. They married in 1991, though they had little in the 
way of prospects or worldly goods. Her tears were a reminder, 
if any was needed, of the real pain and frustration suffered by 
those involved in dissent in China and those who love them. 
  The men who visited Gou the night of her husband's arrest 
refused to give her any more information about her husband's 
alleged crime. She was told to inquire at the police and state 
security bureau on Zhengyi Road, about an hour's bus ride away. 
Her conversation at the Zhengyi Road office the next day went 
like this: "Can I see regulation number 56?" "We don't have 
it." 
  "Please tell me what law he's broken." 
  "We have no comment." 
  "Please tell me where he is being held." 
  "We have no comment." 
  "That," Gou said, "was when I decided to walk out, and to 
make public what had happened to my husband." 
  Xiao is believed to have been detained because of his 
friendship with Yuan Hongbing, a labour activist and legal 
expert who was detained on March 3 in Guizhou. Xiao has, 
however, been known to the police ever since 1985 for his 
involvement in the underground Protestant church. He frequently 
attended Gangwashi church in Beijing, where the aged pastor, 
Yang Yudong, has incurred the wrath of the authorities for his 
failure to co-operate with the state- controlled "Three Self 
Patriotic Church". 
  Xiao had been an associate professor in comparative 
literature at Beijing University, but he had had to surrender 
his university ID card after 1989. Recently he has been working 
in a trading company. He had always wanted to study at a 
seminary, but was refused official permission to do so. 
  Gou does not despair. "I believe God will keep my husband 
safe," she said through her tears. 
  But like millions of her fellow countrymen and women, she 
does not cherish any illusions.

Study Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" column: "How the 'Chief Architect' Designed 
China's `Image'"] 
  [Text] According to Volume 3 of Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping,, as the chief architect of China's reform 
and opening, Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only scientifically 
designed the grand blueprint and fundamental strategy of China's 
reform and opening up, but also designed all aspects of our 
country's "image" and our national "image." In the book, 12 
passages directly discuss the "image" of our country and nation. 
Through these discussions, we may clearly see that the issue of 
the "image" of our country and nation is an important element in 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's many theoretical viewpoints and major 
strategic decisions. It is related to "two revolutions," the 
"three-stage" strategic objective, the "one center, two basic 
points" conception, the theory of socialism and patriotism, 
contemporary China in the nineties, and the future China in the 
21st century. 
<H5>  I. There Are Three Significant Changes in China's "Image" in </H5>
Modern History, at Present, and in the Fifties of the 21st 
Century 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions of the "image" of our 
country and nation had an unusual viewpoint. That is, 
proceeding from the basic position and viewpoint of dialectical 
and historical materialism, he closely linked the molding of and 
the change in the image of our country and nation with the 
revolutionary cause led by our party. In his eyes, the point 
that "revolution is for emancipating the productive forces" can, 
in a certain sense, find more concrete expression in the point 
that revolution is for changing the "image" of our country and 
nation. Proceeding from this basic viewpoint, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping held that three major changes of revolutionary 
significance have occurred or will occur in China's image in 
modern history, at present, and in the fifties of the 21st 
century. 
  The establishment of the PRC was the first "change in 
China's 
image," and this event showed that "the Chinese people stood 
up." In 1984, when meeting a visiting delegation of Hong Kong 
businessmen and some Hong Kong celebrities, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "For more than a century after the Opium 
War, foreigners looked down on Chinese people and humiliated 
Chinese people. Since the founding of the PRC, China's image 
has changed." In April 1987, he pointed out more concretely: 
"Since the founding of the PRC, China's features have indeed 
been changed," and this mainly found expression in the fact that 
"the Chinese people had stood up." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said 
that this was a significant event. For a country "remaining in 
a humble position in the world over more than a century" after 
the Opium War, this was certainly a fundamental and historic 
change in the image of the country and nation. Being a 
revolutionary of the older generation who was an eyewitness and 
personal participant in this change, Comrade Deng Xiaoping was 
always full of deep feelings and indignation when mentioning 
this change. He pointed out: "China became a semifeudal and 
semicolonial society after the Opium war, and Chinese people 
became well-known in the world as the 'sick man of East Asia.'" 
Up to the founding of the PRC, "more than 10 foreign powers 
bullied China, and the first was Britain. Earlier than that, 
Portugal forcibly leased China's territory of Macao. Japan and 
Czarist Russia, including the Soviet Union for a certain period, 
gained the greatest benefit from China." "In history, Japan 
owes China the largest debt." "Tens of millions of Chinese 
people were killed by the Japanese." Czarist Russia seized the 
largest area of territory from China, "the Chinese territory 
occupied by Czarist Russia through unequal treaties exceeded 1.5 
million square km." 
  So, why could the Chinese people stand up? Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "It was not Chiang Kai-shek but the 
Communist Party and socialism who enabled the Chinese people to 
stand up." He also stressed: "China's current image was not 
created by the former Qing Government, nor by the Beiyang 
Warlords, nor by Chiang and his son. It was the PRC that changed 
China's image." This revealed the true reason for the 
tremendous historic changes in this nation which experienced 
untold disasters. In the first third of this century, when the 
CPC had just mounted the stage of history in China, the country 
was being carved up; the Chinese nation was being humiliated and 
bullied; the warlords were fighting each other and causing a 
chaotic situation; and foreign enemies were driving straight in 
to invade our country. The CPC, which mastered the truth of 
Marxism and fought indomitably, united the whole Chinese nation 
to win victory in the new democratic revolution against 
imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping said: "In the past, we carried out the new 
democratic revolution; after the founding of the PRC, we carried 
out the land reform and also carried out socialist 
transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and 
capitalist industry and commerce. We thus laid the socialist 
economic base. That was a great revolution, and the revolution 
lasted more than 30 years." That is to say, the first 
successful "image" change of our country and our nation in 
modern history was linked with the first CPC-led revolution, 
which was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. The 
revolution was one for "selecting a doctrine [zhu yi 0031 
5030]." Relying on our people, we selected Marxism and 
scientific socialism; and this rescued China, changed China's 
conditions, and changed the image of the country and the nation. 
  The "new revolution" (or second revolution), comprising 
reform, opening up, and modernization, led by our party "changed 
China's image" for the second time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
said, "after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the image of our country changed." The second "image 
change" was mainly reflected in the fact that "China became more 
active" and "the economy was developed"; moreover, in the 
changeable international situation, China "stood firm" like an 
unshakable rock. From the first image change, which found 
expression in the fact that "the Chinese people stood up," to 
the second image change, which found expression in the fact that 
"China's socialism stood firm," the process not only reflected 
the in-depth advances of the Chinese revolution, but also showed 
that the Chinese Communists more broadly and deeply changed 
China's "image." 
  Why did our country and nation still face the issue of the 
second "image" change? The reasons can be found in two aspects. 
On the one hand, the first revolution in our country just 
solved the issue of "rescuing China." Only by overthrowing the 
three big mountains that oppressed the Chinese people could the 
Chinese people stand up. After the task of "rescuing China" was 
fulfilled, "developing China" became the main issue. On the 
other hand, we underwent many twists and turns on the issue of 
"developing China." As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out when 
summing up the positive and negative experience since the 
founding of the PRC, the twists and turns were mainly reflected 
in the fact that "after the establishment of the socialist 
economic base, we did not formulate policies for creating 
favorable conditions for the development of the productive 
forces over many years. The productive forces in society 
developed slowly; the people's material and cultural lives were 
not properly improved; and the state could not shake off the 
condition of poverty and backwardness. This state of affairs 
forced us to carry out reform. The general principle was to 
uphold four things. The issue was how to uphold these things. 
Should we maintain the policies that could not enable us to 
shake off poverty and backwardness or should we select good 
policies on the basis of adhering to the four cardinal 
principles so that the social productive forces could be 
developed faster? The reform after the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee was aimed at selecting such good 
policies." These remarks accurately answered why it was 
necessary to carry out the second revolution of reform, opening 
up, and modernization after the victory of the first revolution 
in our country; and also correspondingly answered why it was 
necessary for our country and nation to change the "image" for 
the second time. 
  If the victory of the first revolution in our country was 
linked with the correct selection of the "doctrine," then the 
great successes in the second revolution were related to the 
correct selection of the "policies." In the late eighties and 
early nineties, socialism with Chinese characteristics could 
"stand firm" in the changeable international situation, and the 
fundamental reason was that after the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, according to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's proposal, our party carried out the second revolution 
through reselecting policies and rebuilding the institutional 
structure. The so-called "policy reselection" means the 
"formulation of new political, economic, and social policies" 
and a series of other "new principles and policies. The central 
point was to change from taking class struggle as the key link 
to taking the development of productive forces as the central 
task, from being closed to opening up, and from staying in a rut 
to carrying out reform." The new policies were effective in 
bringing about the rapid development of the socialist social 
productive forces in our country. The comprehensive national 
strength of our country grew to a new level, and the people's 
living standards were markedly enhanced. Therefore, the policies 
were supported by the vast majority of the Chinese people. "The 
people have their personal experience, and their eyes are 
discerning. In the past, they could not have enough food and 
clothing; today, they can have not only enough food and 
clothing, but also modern household appliances. The people are 
glad." As the first revolution led by our party profoundly 
changed China's "image," the second revolution led by our party 
also brought about great changes in the "features" of our 
country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping often described the new changes 
in the "image" of our country and nation in a delighted tone and 
style and expressed the same feelings as the people. For 
example, he said: "In the more than five years after the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, very good 
changes indeed occurred. The image of our country has changed, 
and this has been discerned by our people and also noticed by 
the international community." "The people's livelihood has 
indeed been improved," "the nation has become more prosperous, 
and is enjoying higher international prestige." "The features 
of the whole country are greatly different," and there is a 
"prosperous scene" everywhere. The people are "faring better 
year after year." He summed up all such changes by saying that 
"reform and opening up have actually invigorated China." The 
invigoration was reflected in all aspects, not only in the 
ideological aspect, but also in the economic, social, political, 
and cultural aspects. Invigoration brought about greater 
dynamism, and dynamism ensures the continuation of life. 
  In the middle of next century, when China achieves the 
third-stage strategic objective of modernization, China's 
"image" will undergo the third change, which will be marked by 
the fact that the Chinese nation will "stand steadfastly among 
other nations of the world" with a brand-new image of 
"prosperity, powerfulness, democracy, and civilization." After 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping often told people about the bright 
prospects for China in the middle of next century. He said: 
"From 1981 to the end of this century, the economy will be 
quadrupled in 20 years and will reach the level of being 
comparatively well-off. That is, the annual per capita GNP will 
increase to $800 to $1,000. On the basis of this achievement, 
it will increase to $4,000 in another 50 years. What does that 
mean? That is to say, by the middle of next century, we will 
reach the level of an intermediately developed country." "It 
will be a significant matter that a country with a population of 
1.5 billion people reaches the level of an intermediately 
developed country." "It will be extremely unusual if our country 
is built into an intermediately developed country in a period of 
100 years from the founding of the PRC." The revolutionary of 
the older generation, who had reached an advanced age, always 
directed his eyes toward the middle of the 21st century. This 
showed that he was always considering what kind of China should 
be brought into the 21st century. As mentioned above, the 19th 
century witnessed China's decline; the 20th century recorded the 
Chinese nation's struggle for regeneration; while the 21st 
century will mark the Chinese nation's reinvigoration and 
prosperity. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly 
stressed: "Now, people say that marked changes are occurring in 
China. I told some foreign guests that the current changes are 
just minor changes. Quadrupling production and reaching the 
level of being comparatively well-off will just be an 
intermediate change. The major change will come when we 
approach the level of a developed nation in the world by the 
middle of next century." He summarized the essence of the third 
"image" change, which is of far-reaching significance, in our 
country and our nation by saying that "since the Chinese people 
have the ability to stand up, they will certainly have the 
ability to stand firm among other nations of the world." 
  Thus, we can clearly see that the three changes of great 
significance in China's "image" in modern history, at present, 
and in the fifties of the 21st century are mainly reflected in 
"standing up [zhan qi lai 4541 6386 0171]," "standing firm [zhan 
zhu le 4541 0145 0055]," and "standing steadfastly among others 
[kui ran yi li 8354 3544 1473 4539]." This is the general 
"image" designed by the "chief architect" for our country and 
nation according to the objective law that governs historical 
development. 
<H5>  II. The Five "Images" With Distinct Chinese Characteristics </H5>
That China Will Show to the World at Present and in the Future 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only designed the general "image" 
of our country and nation, but also carefully designed the 
concrete "image" of contemporary China and future China. The 
concrete "image" designs fully express his scientific theories 
and strategic conceptions. Therefore, understanding these 
concrete "images" will also help us better master the scientific 
system of his theories. In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concrete 
designs, contemporary China and future China will mainly show 
five "images" to the world: 
  First, China "will give an image of reform and opening up to 
the international community and to the people." This was 
repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping after the political 
storm at the turn of spring and summer in 1989. He mentioned 
this sometimes from the angle of the leading body and sometimes 
from the angle of leaving an impression with people at home and 
abroad. For example, he said: "It is necessary to organize a 
central leading body with the image of reform and opening up so 
that the people can set their minds at rest." "China must have 
a leading collective with an image of reform and opening up." 
He also stressed that China "should give an image of reform and 
opening up to the international community and to the people, and 
this is of great importance." It should be pointed out that his 
remarks were all uttered for the purpose of "giving a political 
explanation," so they were of unusual significance. 
  Why did China have to always maintain the "image" of reform 
and opening up? Comrade Deng Xiaoping first considered this 
according to the state interests and the people's interests. He 
pointed out that with regard to the general orientation and the 
major policy of reform and opening up, "the international 
community was worried that we might backtrack from this" and 
"the people were worried that we might change this." Therefore, 
"we should do a number of things to show that our policy of 
reform and opening up remains unchanged and that we shall 
further open up more broadly." "It is necessary to give 
expression to reform and opening up, to large-scale opening up." 
"There should be opening up on a larger scale than before." 
"The banner of opening up must be unfurled." Thus, we shall not 
only "make the people set their minds at rest," but also 
eliminate various misgivings and conjectures in the 
international community. 
  In addition, Comrade Xiaoping 
stressed that China must maintain the "image" of reform and 
opening according to the viewpoint of acting according to the 
objective laws. As compared with the period of the Eighth CPC 
Congress, our party now much more profoundly understands the 
laws governing socialist construction in our country. For 
example, we are now aware that "reform is China's second 
revolution"; "persistently carrying out reform and continuing 
opening up is a move that determines China's destiny"; "reform 
and opening up is the only way to develop China's productive 
forces"; "without upholding socialism, without reform and 
opening, and without improving the people's livelihood, there 
will only be a blind alley." All this represents our awareness 
of the objective regularity. Respecting the objective laws, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly told the whole party that 
"reform and opening up is a fundamental principle that must not 
be given up"; "even if there is trouble [feng bo 7364 3134] or 
big trouble in the future, reform must still be continued; 
otherwise, there will be no way out in the next decade"; "reform 
and opening should still be advocated, and should be advocated 
for several decades"; "an important point is that China must not 
be turned back into a closed country"; "we must never return to 
the previous course and stifle the economy"; "if we backtracked 
to the previous course, we would just return to the condition of 
poverty and backwardness." He also summarized all this, which 
represents the understanding of the objective regularity that 
can be expressed in innumerable words, into two phrases. That 
is, "carrying out reform without indulging in controversy, and 
opening up without closing the door." 
  Second, it is necessary to strive to create the "image" of 
an 
"economic power." This is also a point that Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping is always concerned about and has repeatedly stressed. 
He said many times: "China is a big country and also a small 
country. Being a big country, it has a huge population and vast 
territory; being a small country, it remains a developing 
country and remains rather poor." "China is a small country in 
real terms and is also a big country in real terms; China is one 
of the permanent members of the UN Security Council," and this 
shows that China "is now a political power." "The PRC will 
become an economic power in not too long a period." The 
so-called "economic power" means that we shall enhance our 
comprehensive national strength, "turn a poor China into a 
comparatively well-off China" and "turn a backward China into a 
developed China" so that we can "solve the issue of poverty 
among 1 billion people and solve the development issue of 1 
billion people" and can prove the superiority of socialism with 
facts. When turmoil occurred in some countries, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping cool-headedly pointed out: "When these countries were 
bogged down in turmoil, China was really planning the 
realization of the second quadrupling, and this was another 
success of socialism. If we basically realize modernization by 
the fifties of next century, then we can more definitely 
announce socialism's successfulness." Of course, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping also repeatedly stressed that while creating an 
"economic power," we do not intend to seek hegemony; instead, we 
shall fulfill our duties. "We are bearing our responsibilities, 
and we should be responsible to the one-fifth of the world's 
population and enable them to live better by developing the 
economy." He warned us: "Do not boast, we should be more 
modest as our country is becoming more developed." "China does 
not seek hegemony now, and will not seek hegemony after it 
becomes developed in the future." "If China, with a population 
of 1 billion, does not adhere to a policy of peace, does not 
oppose hegemonism, or even pursues hegemonism as its economy 
becomes developed, that would be a disaster for the world and 
would be retrogression in history." 
  Third, it is necessary to "give an image of stability and 
unity to the international community and to people at home." 
Therefore, we repeatedly stressed the need to establish the 
image of stability and unity, and this is first of all based on 
historical experience. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We should 
let foreigners see that China is stable. If the country is made 
chaotic and disintegrated, will there still be any hope? In the 
past, the imperialists bullied us because our nation was just 
like a sheet of loose sand." Second, stressing stability and 
unity is also based on the lesson drawn from the negative 
experience in reality. At present, some countries in the world 
are bogged down in endless turmoil and civil war, and we learn a 
lesson from their negative experience and we know that a nation 
cannot make advances in turmoil, and development is possible 
only in a stable environment. At present, "China is situated in 
the process of economic development and in this period attention 
must be concentrated on economic development." "In order to 
realize the four modernizations in China and to free China from 
poverty and backwardness, we must have a political situation of 
unity and stability and must ensure that construction is being 
conducted in an orderly way under effective leadership. Any 
trouble in society may prevent us from concentrating on economic 
construction." If there are demonstrations, debates, and big 
posters in the streets from time to time, people will not be 
able to concentrate their energy on construction. Moreover, if 
any trouble and unrest occur in society, the domestic situation 
will become unstable, and "foreign funds will not come into our 
country. We should more strictly exercise control in this 
regard. This will not affect foreign investment; on the 
contrary, foreign investors will become more confident." In 
this sense, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "We handled a 
number of people who advocated liberalization and violated the 
criminal law several years ago. China's image was not harmed; 
instead, our reputation is getting better day by day." 
  Stability and unity includes the two aspects of stability 
and unity. Stability [an ding 1344 1353] is a matter in society 
as a whole, and this is sometimes also called steadiness [wen 
ding 4489 1353]. In this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
uttered a lot of remarks. For example, he said: "It is 
necessary to issue a signal to show that no turmoil is allowed 
in China." "Stability is an overwhelming requirement." He also 
said: "We must eliminate all factors that oppose our taking, 
and obstruct us from taking, the socialist road and all factors 
that may cause chaos or even turmoil for China." As for unity, 
this is mainly a matter within the decisionmaking body and 
within the leadership, especially the central leading core. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping stated seriously that in China, "the most 
important thing is to maintain a united leading core." "As long 
as no problem occurs in this link, China will be as stable as 
the Tai Shan. The international community will not look down on 
us, and more and more people will come to China to make 
investment." "As long as the leading collective is united and 
insists on reform and opening up, even if we develop stably for 
several decades, China will still undergo a fundamental change." 
We should give deep thought to all these earnest instructions. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to keep the image of developing the 
two civilizations in a well-coordinated way. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's designing of the image of our country and nation was 
comprehensive. He said that the superiority of socialism should 
be brought into play in all aspects, and required that we 
"should not only boost economic development, but should also 
improve public order and public conduct." Only when the two 
civilizations surpass capitalist society can this be called 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to this basic 
point of view, he not only deeply hated the phenomena that 
smeared the national dignity and personal dignity, slurred the 
"image" of socialism and the "image" of our country and nation, 
but also repeatedly demanded that the whole party adopt severe 
measures to suppress and prevent such phenomena. He stressed 
the need to continuously "eliminate various ugly and evil 
phenomena" and "resolutely resist and eliminate the phenomena of 
corruption." The phenomena of greed, corruption, and unfairness 
and such things as drug-consumption, prostitution, and economic 
crime must not be allowed to exist and spread in China. Our 
youngsters must not be captured by bourgeois ideology. He 
pointed out in a clear-cut way that "spiritual pollution must 
not be allowed on the front of ideology," and "the situation in 
which young people are being influenced by the decadent culture 
of the Western bourgeoisie must not be tolerated any longer." 
He stressed that efforts should be made to develop spiritual 
civilization and to foster a new generation of socialist people 
"with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education, and a sense 
of discipline." In view of the situation of "paying attention 
only to material civilization while neglecting spiritual 
civilization" before the 4 June Incident, he repeatedly stressed 
the need to "promote both civilizations at the same time by 
doing effective work [liang shou zhua liang shou dou yao ying 
0357 2087 2119 0357 2087 6757 6008 4289]." 
  Fifth, it is necessary to "safeguard our image of being 
independent and being unafraid of evil spirits [bu xin xie bu pa 
gui 0008 0207 6723 0008 1830 7607]." Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
mentioned this point as a basic principle for China's foreign 
policy, and took it as our nation's lofty aspiration. He 
repeatedly mentioned that being independent and self-reliant is 
our foothold in the past, at present, and in the future. He 
also stressed that China is now a poor country, but why can it 
hold the position of a pole in the multipolar pattern of the 
world? Because we do not act according to other peoples' orders 
and do not sit on other people's chariots; instead, we are an 
independent country. "Why do we say that we are independent? 
Because we insist on the socialist road with Chinese 
characteristics." 
  Persisting in independence and self-determination is closely 
linked with the position of opposing hegemonism and power 
politics. In the late eighties and early nineties, there was a 
furious countercurrent in the world, and the imperialist Western 
world tried to force us to give up socialism and slide into the 
capitalist road through peaceful evolution, thus finally 
subjecting ourselves to the rule of international monopoly 
capital. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out sternly out of a 
sense of justice: "Now, we must resist the countercurrent with 
a clear-cut attitude." "China can never be intimidated." 
"Those who try to interfere with us and threaten us will 
eventually fail. The Chinese people have self-confidence, and a 
sense of inferiority will get us nowhere. In the past, our 
nation felt itself inferior for more than a century, and stood 
up under the leadership of the CPC. The huge monster is rather 
frightening, we Chinese people are not afraid of it." "The 
Chinese people are not afraid of being isolated and will not be 
frightened by evil spirits." "In the world, China is the nation 
that is the least afraid of isolation, blockades, and 
sanctions." He required of the whole party and the entire 
people throughout the country that "we must not be weak." It 
was against such a background that Comrade Deng Xiaoping called 
for "keeping the image of being independent and being unafraid 
of evil spirits." During the past years, the sanctions imposed 
by the West on our country have been broken through, and this 
fully demonstrated the power of our policy of being independent 
and being unafraid of evil spirits. In the future, we must 
continue to pass on the fearless national spirit from generation 
to generation as the mental force of our nation, and should 
safeguard our nation's independence and continue to be unafraid 
of evil spirits, external pressure, and threats at any time, 
thus making indomitable efforts to reinvigorate our great nation.

  [Text] Haikou, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese departments of 
industry and commerce have formulated new laws and regulations 
to facilitate the creation of a market economy nationwide. 
  A number of new laws and regulations were formulated in 1993 
to maintain market order, according to delegates to a national 
conference on the legal system, which opened here today. 
  These include the Law Against Unfair Competition and the Law 
on the Protection of Consumers' Interests and Rights. 
  Delegates said that in 1993 local departments of industry 
and 
commerce formulated rules for regulating advertising, another 
set of regulations regarding the registration and management of 
commodity markets, and still another set of regulations 
governing punishment of smugglers. 
  Furthermore, departments of industry and commerce in Fujian, 
Guangdong and Shanxi provinces and in the big cities of Qingdao 
and Shenyang published rules for regulating the activities of 
brokers. 
  Also in 1993, the departments in Jiangsu Province and 
Beijing 
formulated a set of regulations on the management and 
registration of joint stock companies; the Gansu provincial 
administration of industry and commerce published a set of 
provisional regulations concerning auctions; and the Hainan 
Provincial administration of industry and commerce formulated a 
set of regulations regarding the registration of enterprises' 
legal status and another set of regulations against unfair 
competition. 
  The departments in Jilin Province and big cities of Tianjin, 
Xiamen, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Xian and Zhuhai have abolished or 
revised existing regulations that are in conflict with the needs 
of building a market economy, they said. 
  Local departments also formulated regulations and rules to 
improve supervision of law enforcement by their staff, delegates 
said. 
  The Tianjin municipal administration of industry and 
commerce 
and the Dalian city administration of industry and commerce 
published a set of regulations on the initiative-based 
responsibility system for their staff and another set of 
regulations concerning the punishment of rule-breaking staff 
members. 
  Delegates said that departments of industry and commerce in 
all the provinces and regions except Inner Mongolia and Tibet 
have set up offices in charge of formulating regulations and 
rules. 
  To date, 184 departments at the prefectural level and 528 
departments at the county level have set up such offices, they 
added.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "State Brings in New Law for Legal </F>
Eagles"] 
  [Text] The State is bringing in a new system to improve 
the management of lawyers and increase their role in the 
country's development, a top legal official said yesterday. 
  It will reduce the part the central government plays in 
their 
business and leave them to be managed by bar associations, said 
Justice Vice-Minister Zhang Geng. 
  And the move will give lawyers more freedom to open up 
businesses and offer the public better services, Zhang told a 
council meeting of the All China Lawyers' Association (ACLA). 
  Bar associations will handle lawyers' registration, training 
and exchanges and protect their legal rights. This will divorce 
them from the decades-old system under which they served as 
government employees and were assigned work by judicial 
administrations. 
  The new system will make judicial organs responsible for 
approving law offices and mapping out official policies, Zhang 
said. 
  Work to introduce bar associations began several years ago, 
leading to the establishment of the ACLA, and 29 provincial 
associations. 
  The change was necessary as China switched to the socialist 
market economy, said Zhang. 
  For lawyers and law offices would have to serve as counsel 
for the government, enterprises and individuals. 
  And more and more lawyers and law firms would be needed as 
the economy continued to develop. 
  Last year, 20,000 lawyers began practising and 900 law 
offices were setup -- rises 46.3 percent and 22.8 percent 
respectively from 1992. At the end of last year there were 
66,700 lawyers in 51,000 offices. 
  Zhang called on Chinese attorneys to learn laws and 
regulations thoroughly, and master the theory of the market 
economy to serve their clients better.

<F P=106> [By Chen Pingjun: "Marriages Threatened by Rise in Divorce </F>
Rate"] 
  [Text] The love which is shared in over 95 percent of 
Beijing marriages is being endangered by domestic violence and 
rising divorce rates. 
  Divorce rates hit an estimated 19 percent last year. 
  And one in five husbands beat up their wives, according to 
the Beijing Society of Research on Marriage and Family. 
  However, home is where the heart is and more than 90 percent 
of married couples said they were basically happy with each 
other. 
  The city-wide survey of more than 2,100 families also 
revealed that by and large Chinese husbands take the lead when 
it comes to sex and leave the household chores to their wives. 
  Divorce rates in Beijing have climbed from 15.2 percent in 
1990. 
  They went up to 16.5 percent in 1991, 17.7 percent in 1992 
and about 19 percent in 1993, according to the society. 
  Violence in the home wasn't just limited to the male of the 
species. Over 15 percent of wives beat up their husbands, 
according to the survey, which was led by Li Yinhe of the 
Sociology Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
  But women's leader, Shang Languo, said that male victims of 
domestic violence could not be compared with battered wives. 
  "For the women it may be self defence. The wife has to fight 
back when being attacked by her husband," said Shang, deputy 
director of the Women's Rights Protection Department. "And then 
there's the question of physical differences, women are usually 
smaller than men, battered husbands will probably suffer less 
than abused wives," said domestic violence expert Shang, who 
works under the auspices of Beijing's Women's Federation. 
  The survey revealed that 1 percent of husbands beat their 
wives very often. 
  Most of the violence was reported in the homes of 
ill-educated, working class, young couples, according to Li 
Yinhe. 
  Beijingers generally regard men and women as equals in the 
home, the survey said. 
  More than 80 percent of spouses believe they enjoy equal 
relations with their mates. 
  And when it comes to sex inequality, it is women who rule 
the 
roost, with almost 10 percent of husbands reporting domineering 
wives. 
  The husbands still take the lead in bed, only 3.2 percent of 
wives initiate sex, the survey found. 
  And actions speak louder than words, perhaps, for 88 percent 
of respondents said it was acceptable for female mates to ask 
for sex. 
  Wives who take charge or have a say in sex are generally 
from 
the younger generation born after 1950. 
  But, despite all the marital problems revealed by the 
survey, 
Li said that most modern marriages in the city are good. 
  Spouses from 92 percent of homes are thoughtful and 
understanding towards each other, said Li, a permanent director 
at the family research society.

broke out in a lumbering site of the Hulun Buir League 
(prefecture) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still 
raging on after six days concerted efforts of fighting. 
  Two fires started in the operational area six days ago. One 
was reported to have been brought under control and the other is 
still going on due to strong winds and difficult terrains. 
  Acting Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councillor Chen Junsheng 
are being kept up-to-date with reports on the firefighting. 
They have sent messages of encouragement to fire fighters via 
the regional government of Inner Mongolia and the Ministry of 
Forestry. 
  Xu Yufang, China's forestry minister and Zhu guangyao, the 
vice-minister, as well as Zhang Tingwu, vice-chairman of the 
Inner Mongolia Regional Government, are on the spot to direct 
fire fighting operations.

Hepatitis C"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Public Health is to introduce an 
instant test for the hepatitis C Virus in medical centres across 
the country this month. 
  The test, which can show up results in half an hour, will be 
applied to blood products in a bid to curb the spread of the 
chronic and sometimes fatal liver ailments caused by the virus. 
  About three per cent of China's 1.2 billion population carry 
the new virus strain. 
  Many hepatitis C victims contracted the virus through blood 
transfusions. 
  The instant test which will be used in the nation's 
hospitals 
and blood banks, was developed by the microbiological research 
department of the People Liberation Army's No. 2 Medical 
University. 
  Hepatitis C, which is mainly transmitted through blood, can 
lead to cirrhosis and cancer of liver. 
  About 90 percent of Chinese hepatitis cases caused by 
medical 
treatment are C type. 
  The PLA researchers studied the country's hepatitis C 
epidemics and established a virus gene bank.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Acting Premier 
Zhu Rongji had a cordial conversation here this afternoon with 
all members of the International Committee for the Promotion of 
Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (ICCIC) who are attending the 
committee's general assembly here. 
  Zhu paid tribute to the efforts that the ICCIC has made in 
promoting the cause of the Chinese industrial cooperatives. 
  He expressed the hope that all members of the ICCIC will 
continue their contributions to the development of industrial 
cooperatives in China and other countries in the world. 
  Present at the meeting were Yang Bo, chairman of the ICCIC, 
and Vice-Chairmen Lu Guangmian and Israel Epstein. 
  The meeting, which opened here today, will last three days. 
  This is the first meeting of the ICCIC since it resumed 
activities here in 1987. 
  During the meeting both domestic and overseas ICCIC members 
will hear, examine and approve a report on the work of the 
ICCIC; to discuss and revise the constitution of the ICCIC; and 
to elect a new ICCIC leading body. 
  The ICCIC was founded in January 1939 in Hong Kong with 
outstanding Chinese Stateswoman Soong Ching Ling as its honorary 
chairman and Rewi Alley as the executive secretary. 
  The committee suspended its work in 1952 and resumed 
activities here in September 1987, thanks to the efforts of 
Rewi Alley and consultations with parties concerned.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (CNS) -- Now is not a suitable 
time for China to undertake land option trading judging from the 
actual situation of the country, the Director of State Land 
Administration Mr. Zou Yuchuan said today in an interview with 
this agency. 
  So-called land option trading, according to Mr. Zou, 
amounted 
to land speculation from the viewpoint of the actual situation 
in China. When taking into consideration the market concept, 
land option transactions should not be undertaken until a more 
complete market system has taken shape. 
  Mr. Zou said he was convinced that it was necessary for the 
land market to be exploited for a period of time before land 
option trading was adopted in the country. The provisional 
regulations issued by the State Council in 1990 for the use with 
payment of state-owned land in urban and rural areas, Mr. Zou 
said, were aimed at keeping the land market under regulation and 
control. The regulations which govern the affairs in this 
sector are still operating. A draft law for administration of 
real estate in urban areas put forward by the Ministry of 
Construction, the State Land Administration and the Bureau of 
Legislative Affairs of the State Council was recently approved 
at a routine meeting of the State Council and then submitted to 
the National People's Congress for final approval. The draft 
law covers the real estate market and will be the main law and 
rule for regulation and control as well as administration of the 
real estate market if endorsed. The land administration is now 
drafting regulations for land registration in a bid to greatly 
improve the land market in the country.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China's first bonded 
textile trading center will be established in the Waigaoqiao 
bonded zone in the eastern sector of the Pudong New Area in 
Shanghai. 
  This was stated here today by Wu Wenying, the president of 
the China National Textile Council. 
  The trading center will be located in Huayuan International 
Mansion, whose foundation was laid today, and will include an 
exhibition hall, a spot-trade market and bonded warehouses for 
the display and trading of textile machinery and new textile 
products and technologies. 
  As one of China's largest industrial sectors and the 
mainstay 
of its exports, the textile industry has seen closer contacts 
with international markets and faster steps in restructuring 
during recent years, making the establishment of a national free 
trade market a necessity, according to Wu Wenying. 
  The president also explained that Shanghai, as the country's 
largest economic center and number one trading port, and blessed 
with China's largest free trade zone in Waigaoqiao, has been 
chosen to take on the task.

  [Text] Yinchuan, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China will set up an 
automobile market chain in Beijing next month. 
  Preparations started in October 1993, and the chain went 
into 
trial operation last February in this capital city of Ningxia 
Hui Autonomous Region. 
  Preparations are underway to move the headquarters of the 
chain from Yinchuan to Beijing. Meanwhile, the Beijing Asian 
and Pacific Auto Market Town is expected to open May 26. 
  The first meeting of members of the chain is to be held in 
June. 
  Guo Jiyuan, director of the Preparatory Committee for the 
auto market chain, said that its establishment is aimed at 
building an auto sales network nationwide. 
  Guo said efforts will be made to build wholesale centers in 
major auto manufacturing and distributing areas, and to bring 
along a retail sales network in the surrounding areas. 
  So far, more than 1,000 auto manufacturers, salesmen and 
customers have showed their willingness to join the market 
chain, and 110 have already signed up. 
  With the improvement of the people's living standards there 
has been a growing demand for automobiles in China. 
  Statistics show that China's automobile market is as large 
as 
one million units a year, with 80 percent domestically produced 
and 20 percent imported. 
  Annual sales of autos will reach two million by the year 
2000, Guo predicted. 
  In the beginning of this year the Ministry of Machine 
Industry announced 1994's plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3 
million automobiles will be produced. 
  The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in 
China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993 
China produced 1.18 million automobiles, an increase of 20 
percent over 1992.

  [Text] Wuhan, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Construction of Wuhan 
Economic and Technological Development Zone in central China's 
Hubei Province, listed as one of China's projected car 
production centers, is going ahead at full steam. 
  The development zone, approved by the State Council, is 
where 
a major Sino-French joint venture to produce 300,000 sedan cars 
will soon be launched. The zone is to focus on the development 
of businesses linked with the production of cars and automobile 
components. 
  According to local officials, Wuhan city, the provincial 
capital of Hubei, has approved the establishment of 107 projects 
in the development zone, involving a total investment of nine 
billion yuan. 
  On eight sq km of the 10 sq km development zone, ground 
leveling has been completed, said the officials. 
  The Shenlong Automobile Corporation, which was jointly set 
up 
by Dongfeng Automobile Company, headquartered in Shiyan city of 
northwestern Hubei, and the Citroen Automobile Co.,Ltd. of 
France, has decided to make an investment of 4.6 billion yuan to 
start businesses in the development zone. 
  Five big plants, with a total floor space of 260,000 sq m, 
for welding, general assembly and maintenance, for the 
Sino-French joint venture began to be constructed last year and 
are expected to be completed in 1996. 
  In addition, the Dongfeng Automobile Company has also joined 
hands with a Taiwan-based firm to jointly invest 50 million U.S. 
dollars and build a plant in the development zone for turning 
out 100,000 light-duty trucks a year. 
  Construction of basic facilities in the development zone has 
been speeded up, said the officials, adding that 23,000 sq m of 
standard workshops in the development zone have been completed 
and put on sale. 
  Moreover, construction of 11 buildings for foreign experts, 
and a school for their children, have been completed. 
  Local officials are also making concerted efforts to improve 
facilities of management and for providing services.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The growth of the 
notarial system has brought benefits for the reform and open 
policy, and the socialist market economy in China. 
  China's notarization system, resumed at the end of the 
1970s, 
has made rapid progress in the drive for economic development. 
  Statistics released by the Ministry of Justice show that 
16,000 notaries-public are working busily in 3,000 offices all 
over the country. Their business scope ranges from exit 
formalities for Chinese citizens to civil and economic items 
concerning both external and domestic affairs. 
  Documents issued by Chinese notarial offices are effective 
in 
130 countries and regions. 
  Notarization is playing an increasing role in the promotion 
of the market economy. Some 98 percent of business contracts 
are notarized, according to experts here. 
  Some 99 percent of nearly 100 million yuan (about 11 million 
U.S. dollars) in circulating funds and agricultural loans issued 
by financial institutions has been repaid promptly as a result 
of being guaranteed by notarial documents. 
  The Beijing notarization office has issued over 11,000 
economic notarial certificates involving a huge sum of money for 
over 150 foreign-funded firms and organizations in recent years, 
smoothing the way for commodities, technology and labor to enter 
international markets. 
  China's Ministry of Justice has authorized 83 Hong Kong 
lawyers as notaries to legally guarantee mainland exchanges with 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan since 1981. 
  With the progress of the housing reform, notarization is 
also 
used in house auctions and purchases, and mortgage loans, as 
well as the rebuilding of old residential areas. 
  In the early days of the rural reform notaries managed 
nearly 
30,000 agricultural responsibility contracts. 
  Notarization is becoming increasingly popular in the fields 
of company leasing, contract operation, enterprise mergers, 
assets division, bidding, contracts for projects abroad, labor 
service, fund import, patent application and inheritance.

  [Text] Hefei, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Having received 
complaints from two members of the Provincial Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) that 
some traffic check stations had imposed charges on passing 
vehicles at random, the Anhui provincial government issued an 
emergency circular to cancel or ban of such traffic check 
stations. 
  The provincial committee of the CPPCC has become an 
important 
source for the government of Anhui in east China to make 
decisions. 
  By the end of last month, 645 of the 653 proposals made by 
members of the first session of the seventh congress of the 
provincial committee of the CPPCC have been dealt with by the 
local government. Some 426 of the proposals were adopted. 
  The CPPCC, which consists of personnel from all walks of 
life, is a major advisory body to the Communist Party of China 
and plays an indispensable role in the country's political life. 
  Wang Rongkang, a member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers 
Democratic Party, put forward three proposals about the stable 
and sustained development of agriculture which were adopted by 
the provincial commission for agriculture and the department of 
agriculture. According to the proposals, an agricultural 
information service center and 280,000 agricultural technology 
models have been set up in the province. 
  The provincial commission for agriculture also suggested 
that 
the provincial government invest a part of its annual increased 
revenue in agriculture. 
  As to the proposals that cannot be put into practice within 
a 
short period, the government will give members clear 
explanations. 
  About 93 percent of the members of the CPPCC in Anhui are 
satisfied or basically satisfied with the handling of their 
proposals, a recent poll conducted by the CPPCC provincial 
committee showed.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Jiangsu State Enterprises Streamline Operation </F>
Mechanism"] 
  [Text] Nanjing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The output of major 
state enterprises in east China's Jiangsu Province in the 
January-March period surpassed the province's average for the 
first time. 
  "This indicates that the endeavors of the key state 
enterprises in shifting their operational mechanism has paid 
off," a local economist said. 
  According to the latest statistics, these enterprises 
generated a gross output value topping 50 billion yuan in the 
first quarter of this year, an increase of 25.4 percent over and 
one percent higher than the province's average. 
  Jiangsu is one of China's most economically-developed 
provinces, and its industrial increase value accounted for 9.66 
percent of the country's total last year, ranking first among 
all the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the 
mainland. 
  Jiangsu has 1,652 key industrial enterprises. A total of 
1,021 are state-owned and the rest are collective ones. 
  Yang Xiaotang, deputy governor of the province, said, "the 
provincial government has adopted a package of policies to help 
enterprises to shift their operational mechanism over the past 
few years in a bid to help them to develop healthily and in line 
with the market economy. 
  "To reform public ownership so as to form an economy with 
public ownership in the main coexisting with other economic 
factors is a key way to help a state enterprise to shift its 
operational mechanism," he added. 
  He said he was convinced that the reform will surely 
"enliven 
enterprises." 
  One example is the Wuxi Weifu Company, which, after 
succeeding in trying out a share-holding system, is undertaking 
whole-staff contracts for production while streamlining its 
administrative organizations and personnel. 
  An official of the company said, "after the employees become 
share-holders of the company they care more for enterprise 
management and pay more attention to improving the products to 
suit the market needs." 
  As a result, the company's sales income in the first two 
months rose by 68.4 percent over the same period of last year. 
  A survey of 589 key enterprises by the end of last year 
showed that most of these enterprises were profitable. 
  According to the deputy governor, to encourage state 
enterprises to co-operate with foreign companies in importing 
advanced technology and management expertise is another shortcut 
to help enterprises to shift their operational mechanism. 
  At present, about 70 percent of the key state enterprises in 
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou Prefectures, where the economy is 
developing more rapidly than in other places, have co-operated 
with foreign business people to modernize themselves. 
  Through foreign co-operation the Wuxi Steel Plant has 
replaced its out-of-date equipment with modern facilities. It 
has formed an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of 
alloy steel, special steel tubes and seamless steel tubes. 
  One of China's old industrial bases, Jiangsu has mainly 
medium- sized and small industrial enterprises. 
  To better compete in the international market, the 
provincial 
government encourages the formation of enterprise groups. 
  Through the contract system, the Xuzhou Engineering Group 
has 
admitted the Anhui Bengbu Crane Plant and the Shanghai Universal 
Motor Vehicle Fittings Plant as its members. It also has 
annexed the Bengbu Diesel Engine Plant. 
  An official of the group predicted that the group's sales 
will reach three billion yuan and exports will be at least 50 
million U.S. dollars-worth in the first two years, making it 
the country's largest engineering machinery producer. 
  Although Jiangsu has made progress in helping enterprises to 
shift their operational mechanism, the deputy governor said, it 
still has a long way to go. The provincial government has vowed 
to further tap the potential of enterprises in line with the 
needs of the market economy.

  [Text] Jinan, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The construction of 
three ventures with a total overseas investment of 608 million 
U.S. dollars started on Wednesday [20 April] in Weifang, a 
famous kite city in China's coastal Shandong province. 
  The Weifang International Industrial and Commercial Center 
and the Weifang Sunlight International Dressing Center are two 
Singapore ventures costing 280 million U.S. dollars and 28 
million U.S. dollars respectively.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter from Guangzhou" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i </F>
(5170 2556 0308): "Guangdong Goes All Out To Eliminate Pirated 
Compact Discs"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- At 1300 on 19 
April, according to prior arrangements, the departments in 
charge of copyrights, public security, industrial and commercial 
management, culture, and urban management in cities such as 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou in Guangdong Province acted 
simultaneously in a joint and concerted effort to thoroughly 
inspect audiovisual stalls, mounting a vigorous offensive 
against audiovisual product piracy. 
<H5>  Pirated Products Cost Little, But Earn Big Money </H5>
  The copyright law in China only has a short history of two 
or 
three years. Although the start was late, the development has 
been rapid. China started out by first promulgating the PRC 
Copyright Law on 1 June 1991, and by 30 April 1993, China had 
already joined the Bern Copyright Convention, the Universal 
Copyright Convention, and the Cassette Products Convention, thus 
incorporating copyright protection in China into the 
international copyright system. When Dr. Bogsch, director 
general of World Intellectual Property Organization, visited 
China early this year, he described China's copyright protection 
as "from zero to everything." 
  It was under the conditions that propaganda was inadequate, 
management was lagging behind, and copyright piracy and 
infringement was given room to grow that the legislation was 
adopted. The audiovisual business developed only in the last 10 
years or so, and in particular, compact discs (CD) and laser 
discs (LD) spread and became popular at a surprising speed, 
while pirated CD's and LD's also developed simultaneously. 
According to people in the trade, it costs only three or four 
yuan to pirate a CD, then sell it at the price of the original 
CD if the packing is good and the quality is not bad. 
Generally, it can sell at 10 to 20 yuan. Low prices naturally 
attract many consumers, and some Hong Kong and Macao residents 
also go to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou to buy a large number 
of them. Lured by the low cost and the high profits, many 
audiovisual manufacturers and individual operators have 
participated in the production and sale of pirated CD's and 
LD's. Taking into account the smuggled goods pouring in from 
outside the province, even before inspection, the prices of 
pirated CD's and LD's in Guangdong had already dropped to 8 to 
10 yuan and 160 yuan respectively. The smooth production and 
sales channels enabled piracy in the audiovisual market in 
Guangdong, and even in the whole country, to become increasingly 
rampant, and this not only seriously disrupted the local 
audiovisual publication market, but also caused concerns in Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. At present, seven departments, 
including the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, China 
Press and Publications Administration, and State Copyright 
Bureau have issued a joint notice, demanding strengthened 
management of work in duplicating CD's and LD's, as well as 
serious efforts to handle copyright piracy. 
<H5>  Some Shops Close Doors </H5>
  Guangdong carried out six inspections of the audiovisual 
market last year, but the main goal was to wipe out "poisonous 
pornography" and counterfeit products. During the unified 
inspection campaign this time, over 1,600 stalls selling 
audiovisual products in the province were inspected in one day 
alone, over 140,000 pirated CD's and 1,300 LD's were seized and 
sealed for storage, and more than 80,000 videotapes were also 
seized. During the inspection campaign in Guangzhou, the 
relevant personnel made a special effort to inspect some 
electric appliances markets such as Yifa Mall in Panyu City, 
Haiyin Electric Appliances Concourse in Dongshan District, and 
Xicheng Electric Appliances City in Liwan District, and when 
they arrived at some stalls which refused inspection by closing 
their doors, they took compulsory measures. Thus, in one day, 
over 60,000 CD's were seized. In Zhuhai and Shenzhen, where the 
situation pirated CD's was rather serious, they also seized over 
20,000 CD's. This morning, the Guangzhou City Copyright Bureau 
and the relevant departments took the lead in using a 
steamroller to crush some of the seized CD's and audiovisual 
products -- about 20,000 pieces -- in front of the public. 
  The emergency action in Guangdong Province is still going 
on. 
Today in Guangzhou I have visited some popular spots which sell 
electric appliances, such as the Haiyin Electric Appliances 
Concourse and Huifu Road Electric Appliances Street, and I found 
that the often busy electric appliances markets have been 
deserted, some shops have shut their doors, and the windows 
which used to display numerous pirated CD's are empty or have 
only a few original CD's and LD's, while the shelves which were 
specifically used to keep pirated CD's are now being used to 
keep blank cassette tapes. Some stall owners told me that in 
the past, they knew generally that sales of pirated audiovisual 
products were not permitted by the state, but the profits were 
high, and the business had become popular in Guangdong, and they 
never received any notice saying that this was unlawful behavior 
and must be strictly banned, so they dared to do it. They also 
said that the confiscation this time did not really cause great 
economic losses to them, but they would not wantonly sell 
pirated CD's and LD's for a short period to come. 
<H5>  Copyright Law Badly Needs To Be Publicized </H5>
  Looking at this mighty unified inspection campaign, various 
social quarters in Guangdong have responded differently. The 
departments in charge of culture and publications have hated 
this kind of copyright piracy and infringement for a long time, 
and a manufacturer of audiovisual products said that this kind 
of behavior, which infringes on the legitimate rights of 
copyright holders, should have been severely punished through 
legislation a long time ago. A person in charge of Guangdong 
Provincial Copyright Bureau said that the current 23 CD 
production lines in 16 factories inside the province will be 
included under press and publications management, and the China 
Press and Publications Administration will soon promulgate 
regulations on the registration and examination of CD 
copyrights, while the relevant departments will coordinate 
efforts with the customs department in cracking down on the 
smuggling of pirated CD's and LD's. Regarding the stalls or 
wholesalers which sell audiovisual products, a management method 
of "first permit, then license" will be practiced; that is, they 
must first apply for permits from the administrative department, 
then apply for licenses from the industrial and commercial 
management department. As for the manufacturers and retailers 
who stubbornly go the wrong way, they will be punished according 
to law. This move is not to restrict the development of CD's, 
but to guide the production of audiovisual products onto a 
healthy track of development. 
  When the public saw piles of CD's being crushed to dust by 
the steamroller, the first response of many citizens was: Too 
bad. Some citizens said that original CD's, especially some new 
ones, are too expensive, whereas pirated CD's suit the 
purchasing power of the ordinary citizens. They added that some 
Hong Kong and Taiwan singers have also relied on pirated CD's 
and tapes to become popular on the mainland. 
  Here we can see that it is an urgent task to crack down on 
copyright piracy and infringement, and to protect intellectual 
property; and that the relevant quarters must adopt 
corresponding measures to publicize the sense of the copyright 
law and establish the correct values among the citizens.

  [Text] Haikou, April 21 (XINHUA) -- South China's Hainan 
Province, the largest special economic zone in the country, will 
quicken the establishment of a sound property rights market, 
according to Deputy Governor Wang Xiaofeng. 
  Wang said that the province's property rights transactions 
market is open to any economically eligible and reliable 
domestic and overseas investment institution or individual. 
  The property rights can appear in various forms, such as 
fixed assets of enterprises, management rights, land-use rights 
and intellectual property rights. 
  The property rights can be transferred by way of agreement 
or 
public auction, and investors can buy the assets, take the 
original debts and conduct barter trade, the deputy governor 
said. 
  Between April 8 and 13 the province sponsored its first 
property rights transactions fair, attended by more than 100 
domestic enterprises. 
  The entire property rights of three state-owned or public 
enterprises were bought by other large firms at the fair.

  [Text] The problem of unprofitable enterprises and 
enterprises which have completely or partially suspended 
production is a problem which has always concerned the 
provincial party committee and government. 
  Li Changchun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
held separate discussions with officers of unprofitable 
enterprises, officers of enterprises which have had to 
completely or partially suspend production, and with the 
competent departments in charge of textile enterprises in 
Zhengzhou at the offices of the provincial party committee on 12 
and 13 April to help enterprises find solutions to their 
problems and offer suggestions for enterprises to recover as 
soon as possible. 
  During the discussions, Li Changchun frequently chipped in, 
giving his views on the questions raised by meeting 
participants. Comrade Li Changchun pointed out: Enterprises 
suffering losses and are having to suspend production is, in the 
final analysis, an inevitable phenomenon as the old structure is 
being replaced by the new, and is the result of the failure of 
enterprises to change operational mechanisms and manage 
themselves well. The solution to the problem lies in deepening 
reform. For this purpose, he made three suggestions: 
  1. First, to intensify reform and speed up the pace of 
changing enterprises' operational mechanisms, we should 
emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts, make bold 
explorations, and enhance our sense of urgency and 
responsibility. Enterprise operators and employees must 
conscientiously study the decision of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the theory of the 
socialist market economy and clearly understand in both theory 
and practice the urgency of changing enterprise operational 
mechanisms so that everybody will willingly get involved in the 
reform. Second, we should intensify reform by starting with the 
property rights relationship and modes of asset operation. Some 
enterprises must backtrack from the old structure characterized 
by large size and a higher degree of public ownership and 
restore the shareholding cooperative system at an accelerated 
pace. Various contract systems can be introduced such as [word 
indistinct]. Third, we should intensify reform in the selection 
of enterprise operators and appropriately introduce the 
competitive mechanism. In selecting enterprise operators, we 
should adopt the method of "choosing horses at the horse track" 
instead of letting those removed from the enterprise decide, set 
operational goals, and let the best candidates distinguish 
themselves through competition and take up their posts. We 
should introduce a democratic election mechanism in an organized 
way, under which a factory director is elected democratically so 
that he can share ups and downs with his employees. We should 
devote efforts to the reform of the three systems in enterprises 
and really ensure that employees can be both hired and 
dismissed, cadres can be promoted and demoted, and people can be 
assigned to higher or lower jobs. We should deeply cut the 
administrative structure and reduce the number of nonproductive 
personnel. As far as enterprises suffering losses and 
suspending production completely or partially, no units or 
individuals should interfere in their internal structural setups. 
  2. We should expedite the readjustment of the product mix in 
accordance with market demands. While changing enterprise 
operational mechanisms, we should promptly readjust the product 
mix, gear to market needs, and develop the products which are 
marketable and promise high efficiency. 
  3. We should strengthen ideological and political work among 
enterprise employees and maintain social stability. In 
difficult times, enterprise operators should share ups and downs 
with their employees. In regard to major expenditures, 
enterprises should follow the mass line and talk with the masses 
of employees. Enterprises should find ways to help the employees 
who have special financial difficulties to solve their 
difficulties. 
  Li Changchun urged leaders of economic departments and 
competent departments in charge of enterprises at all levels to 
correct their guidance, help enterprises suffering losses and 
enterprises suspending production, try every possible means to 
eliminate trouble and solve difficulties for them, and earnestly 
create conditions for them to turn losses into profits. 
  Fan Qinchen, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and vice governor, and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua 
attended and spoke at the meeting which was held on the 
afternoon of 13 April.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Donors have 
contributed more than 600,000 yuan to a Beijing foundation that 
offers awards to heroes who rush to help others whose lives are 
endangered. 
  An official from the "Beijing Courageous Deeds Foundation" 
announced here today that 13 donors, including several large 
companies, supermarkets and individuals, were honored at a 
gathering here. 
  He said that the foundation will award public heroes and 
underwrite life and accident insurance for them. It will also 
offer pensions for those seriously injured in performing their 
courageous deeds. 
  Established in November 1992, the foundation received its 
first donation of 200 yuan from Wang Shufen, a retired woman 
with the Beijing winery, who heard of the establishment of the 
organization over the radio. 
  So far, a total of 173 individuals and 26 companies have 
made 
donations to the foundation. Contributors include workers and 
doctors, from other parts of China as well as from Beijing. 
  In support of courageous spirits, the Beijing Municipal 
Government offers 100,000 yuan each year for the fund, said the 
official. 
  An elderly foreigner who has lived in Beijing for many years 
but is unwilling to reveal his name has made the largest 
individual contribution so far -- 10,000 yuan. 
  "I am old and cannot fight against the culprits with my own 
hands," he wrote in a letter, "but I can show my support for the 
spirit of courage through my donations."

<F P=106> [By reporter Ge Xiquan (5514 6007 0538) and Duan Mingxuan </F>
(3008 2494 6513): "The State Council Has Approved Our Province 
To Experiment With the Method of Directly Linking Cotton 
Production With Marketing"] 
  [Text] Provincial Governor Ye Liansong and Vice Governor Gu 
Erxiong recently conducted an inspection tour to Hengshui 
Prefecture. On 12 April, after listening to briefings given by 
leaders of Hengshui Prefectural party committee and the 
administrative office, they particularly touched on the issue of 
cotton production. The provincial leaders stressed: The State 
Council has approved our province to experiment with the method 
of directly linking cotton production with marketing this year. 
This is the State Council's important measure for supporting 
Hebei to work hard to bring about an upsurge in cotton 
production. 
  They said: Directly linking the cotton production with 
marketing does not mean to decontrol the management. It is to 
link up the production and marketing under the situation of 
maintaining the role of the county supply and marketing 
cooperative as the main business channel and through making 
cotton textile enterprises sign contracts with the county cotton 
and flax companies, making the county cotton and flax companies 
sign contracts with township cotton stations (plants), and 
making the township cotton stations (plants) sign contracts with 
peasants. In this way, the cotton circulation links between the 
province and cities (prefectures) can be reduced, and the funds 
used for cotton circulation can be saved and returned to 
peasants. At the same time, based on the state stipulated 
price, cotton textile enterprises will give a certain amount of 
funds to peasants to support cotton production. Thus, the 
returns in growing cotton will be greatly enhanced. The 
relevant provincial departments are stepping up their efforts to 
make an estimate and to draft the "method on experimenting with 
the plan of directly linking cotton production with marketing," 
which will be issued for implementation after being studied and 
decided by the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government. It is necessary to quickly give the peasants this 
information and make them give up the idea that planting cotton 
will suffer losses.

<F P=106> [Report on implementation of Hebei's 1993 economic and </F>
social development plan and its 1994 draft plan delivered by 
Gong Huanwen, director of the Hebei Provincial Planning 
Commission, at the second session of the eighth provincial 
people's congress on 25 February] 
  [Excerpt] Fellow deputies: Entrusted by the provincial 
people's government, I now give a report on Hebei's 
implementation of its 1993 economic and social development plan 
and its 1994 draft plan to this session for discussions by 
deputies and for opinions from members of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference and other delegates attending as observers. 
<H5>  1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan </H5>
  Thanks to the guidance of the guidelines of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th party congress and 
the correct leadership of the provincial party committee, the 
people throughout the province, firmly focusing on the goal of 
building an economically strong province, seized the 
opportunity, deepened reform, accelerated development, and 
continued the rapid development trend in the economy in 1993 
after the rapid growth in 1992. Our gross domestic product 
registered a 16.5-percent increase over the preceding year and 
an increase of 4.5 percentage points over the target, marking 
the largest annual growth since the beginning of reform and 
opening up. Science and technology, education, and various 
social undertakings also made new headway, and most of the 
targets in these areas as defined at the first session of the 
eighth provincial people's congress were fulfilled or 
overfulfilled. 
  A. The rural economy developed steadily and township 
enterprises grew fairly rapidly. Hebei encountered serious 
drought last year, but peasants' enthusiasm was further 
stimulated thanks to the series of policies and measures 
preferential to agriculture adopted by the provincial party 
committee and government to reduce peasants' burdens and ensure 
the supplies of funds for agricultural use. Grain output totaled 
23.802 million tons, equivalent to 105.8 percent of the target 
and also a new record; cotton output totaled 192,000 tons, down 
by 37.1 percent from the preceding year and equivalent to 42.8 
percent of the target; and the output of oil- bearing crops 
totaled 805,000 tons, up 21.4 percent from the preceding year 
and equivalent to 107.3 percent of the target. Forestry, animal 
husbandry, and sideline production registered fairly rapid 
growth, but production of fisheries declined. The annual added 
value of agriculture was 29.5 billion yuan, up 3.5 percent. 
Township enterprises developed rapidly. Their annual output 
value totaled 171 billion yuan, up 65.5 percent; profits 20.1 
billion yuan, up 59.8 percent; and taxes paid to the state 3.4 
billion yuan, up 37.7 percent. Township enterprises not only 
constituted an important pillar of the rural economy, but they 
also became new growing points of the rapid economic development. 
  B. Industrial production grew rapidly, and economic 
efficiency continued to improve. Despite the "bottleneck" 
restrictions imposed by funds, energy resources, and 
transportation, a rapid increase was achieved in industrial 
production. Hebei's industrial output value was 260 billion 
yuan, up 29.4 percent. Of the total, the output value of the 
enterprises at and above the township level was 162.51 billion 
yuan, up 17.8 percent. The output of most major products 
reached or exceeded the planned targets. Electricity output was 
48.37 billion kw hours, equivalent to 99.1 percent of the 
target; raw coal output 60.524 million tonnes, 97.6 percent of 
the target; pig iron output 8.14 million tonnes, 115.5 percent 
of the target; rolled steel output 4.915 million tonnes, 114 
percent of the target; cement output 22.28 million tonnes, 106 
percent of the target; cotton yarn output 384,000 tonnes, 118.7 
percent of the target; and cigarette output 1.181 million 
crates, 101 percent of the target. While production developed, 
economic efficiency continued to improve. The general index of 
the economic efficiency of Hebei's industrial enterprises at and 
above the township level that exercised independent accounting 
reached 94.9 percent, up 10.4 percentage points from the 
preceding year; their profits and taxes 16.34 billion yuan, up 
47.1 percent; their profit-tax rate of funds rose from 8.57 
percent in the preceding year to 9.94 percent; and the net value 
of their fixed assets grew by 24.6 percent. In this way, the 
targets of "three increases and one rise in ranking" as defined 
earlier last year were attained. 
  C. Increase in fixed asset investment gained momentum and 
construction of key projects was intensified. Fixed asset 
investment made by the entire society in the year was 54 billion 
yuan, showing a 60.8-percent increase and equivalent to 142.1 
percent of the target. Of the total, 31.03 billion yuan was 
invested by state-owned units, up 54.8 percent. In the 
investment made by state-owned units, 11.35 billion yuan was 
invested in local capital construction, up 83.1 percent; and 
7.51 billion yuan was invested in technical transformation, up 
36.6 percent. Construction of key projects throughout the 
province proceeded fairly rapidly thanks to the attention given 
by governments at all levels and the support given by monetary 
departments. By the end of the year, 9.7 billion yuan was 
invested in the 149 continued and new key projects in the 
province, equivalent to 103.3 percent of the annual target. 
Forty-one projects, including the no. 1 generating unit of the 
Xibaipo power plant, were completed and commissioned to increase 
production capacity. Investment in the 82 projects that should 
be ensured as required by the provincial government exceeded the 
annual target by 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, breakthroughs were 
achieved in the early-stage work for the large projects that had 
a bearing on the overall economic situation of Hebei, such as 
the middle-section construction of the project to divert water 
from south to north, the Huanghua Port construction, and the 
Shuoxian-Huanghua Railway construction. 
  D. The areas where foreign investment was used increased, 
the 
scope of foreign investment was expanded, and the stagnant 
situation in exports was changed. Throughout the province, 
1,879 foreign- funded enterprises of the three types were newly 
registered, and their registered foreign capital totaled $1.19 
billion, up 44.4 and 27.96 percent, respectively, from the 
preceding year and new records both; and 500 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types were newly built, thus attaining 
the target defined earlier last year. The actual amount of 
foreign capital Hebei used totaled $480 million, an increase of 
68.6 percent over the preceding year and equivalent to 160 
percent of the target. Of the total, $360 million were direct 
foreign investment, up 100 percent. Last year, the three types 
of foreign-funded enterprises in the province created 6.7 
billion yuan in output value, earned $170 million through 
exports, and paid 210 million yuan of taxes, up 158, 137.2, and 
160 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. Foreign 
trade increased fairly rapidly. Hebei's imports and exports 
totaled $2.35 billion, up 10.9 percent. Its exports totaled 
$1.99 billion, increasing by 11.4 percent and equivalent to 
106.2 percent of the target; of which exports through ordinary 
trade and exports by the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises totaled $1.59 billion, increasing by 12.9 percent 
and equivalent to 103.4 percent of the target. 
  E. Construction of markets was further intensified and the 
scope of commodity distribution was continuously expanded. 
Hebei's investment in the construction of the markets for 
consumer goods neared 1.3 billion yuan, up 30 percent from the 
preceding year. Markets for means of production totaled 304 in 
the province, and their annual transactions 13.6 billion yuan. 
Nearly 2,000 markets for labor forces and employment agencies 
at various levels were built, and markets for personnel were 
built in the 12 cities and prefectures in the province. 
Securities exchange agencies totaled 275 in the province, and 
the markets for technology and information also became more and 
more vigorous. The scope of commodity distribution was 
continuously expanded thanks to economic development and the 
cultivation of the market system. The annual commodity retail 
sales totaled 57.7 billion yuan, up 16.1 percent from the 
preceding year. The general level of retail prices rose by 10.5 
percent over the preceding year and was 2 percentage points 
lower than the national average. 
  F. The financial situation improved and revenues increased 
substantially. The financial order was rather chaotic in the 
first half of 1993. After July, monetary departments at all 
levels conscientiously implemented the correct central policy of 
strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control 
and actively adopted effective measures to gradually improve the 
financial order. By the end of 1993, the savings deposits of 
the monetary institutions in the province totaled 140.6 billion 
yuan, an increase of 24.48 billion yuan over the figure 
registered at the beginning of the year; and their loans totaled 
146.12 billion yuan, an increase of 25.22 billion yuan, thus 
effectively supporting production and construction. Notable 
results were achieved in financial and tax work. The annual 
revenue totaled 14.39 billion yuan, increasing by 44.4 percent 
from the preceding year and equivalent to 132.2 percent of the 
budget. Financial balance was by and large achieved. 
  Science and technology, education, and other social 
undertakings were further developed, and the standard of living 
was improved. In 1993, Hebei achieved positive results in its 
"scientific and technological advance year" activities. 
Scientific and technological achievements registered with the 
province and ministries totaled 1,082, of which 33 were new in 
the world, 155 were advanced in the world, 475 were new in the 
country, and 379 were advanced in the country. Fifty advanced 
and applicable scientific and technological achievements were 
disseminated, and eight permanent technology markets at the 
provincial and city levels were built, thus attaining the 
targets defined earlier last year fairly successfully. 
Education developed fairly rapidly. Ordinary institutes of 
higher learning enrolled 38,400 students (including 4,900 
students of institutes for adult education), up 39.2 percent 
from the preceding year; and secondary specialized schools 
enrolled 75,000 students, up 57.6 percent. The increase 
resulted mainly from recruitment of self-funded students and 
students to be trained on the entrustment of some organizations. 
Hebei's natural population growth was 9.17 per thousand, which 
was 3.53 per millage points lower than our planned target of 
12.9 per thousand. Cultural undertakings were made flourish, 
and urban and rural sanitation work was strengthened. Sports, 
radio and television broadcasting, press, publication, archives, 
tourism, and environmental protection all made new headway. 
  The living standard further improved on the basis of 
developed economy. Hebei's total wage was 20.27 billion yuan, 
up 20.4 percent; and the per capita cash income of staff members 
and workers was 2,945 yuan, up 18.5 percent. Peasants' per 
capita net income was 803.8 yuan, up 17.8 percent. 
  On the whole, Hebei scored great achievements in the economy 
and various social undertakings. However, as our systems and 
mechanisms were in the process of transition, there were still 
many contradictions and problems in our economic activities. 
  First, the foundation for agriculture was weak, and capacity 
for sustained development was lacking. After the rather large 
decrease in cotton production in 1992, 1993 saw another large 
decrease, with the output equivalent to about one-third of that 
of normal years. The comparable efficiency of cotton and other 
crops was rather low, and peasants' income increased slowly. 
This restricted the increase in agricultural investment to a 
certain extent and affected the capacity for sustained 
development. 
  Second, structural adjustment proceeded slowly, and overall 
industrial quality was rather low. In 1993, Hebei's rapid 
increase in heavy industry resulted chiefly from the increase in 
fixed asset investment, and the proportions of finely processed 
goods and goods with high added value were not high. Light 
industrial production grew by 12.3 percent, which was 9 
percentage points lower than the growth in heavy industry and 10 
percentage points lower than the national average. Hebei's 
improvement in the industrial economic efficiency was attributed 
to the price rises in the raw materials in metallurgical 
industry and building materials industry and the increase in 
their quantity, and merely a very small part of it was 
attributed to management and technological advance. 
  Third, contradiction between the supply and demand in funds, 
electricity, and means of transportation was conspicuous, and 
the "bottleneck" restrictions still existed. Contradictions, 
such as fund shortages, strained railway cargo transportation, 
and shortages of electricity supply, remained conspicuous due to 
the rapid economic growth and the increase in investment. 
Despite the series of measures for strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control adopted by the state, it would take time 
to alleviate these contradictions once and for all, and some 
enterprises still had difficulties. 
  Fourth, our level in opening to the outside world and 
reliance on foreign trade in economic development remained low. 
Hebei made notable progress in opening to the outside world in 
1993. Compared with advanced provinces and the requirement for 
building an economically strong province, however, we still 
lagged far behind. Major manifestations were the small amount of 
foreign capital we had used and the small number of the 
foreign-funded enterprises of the three types we had 
established, especially the small number of large projects; and 
the low percentage, merely about 13 percent, of our imports and 
exports in GNP, which was very incompatible with our status as a 
coastal province. 
  We should pay attention to and address the above-mentioned 
problems in the new year. 
  2. The Guiding Thought for Arranging the 1994 Plan 
and the Targets of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control 
  The year 1994 is an important year for China to continue the 
good economic development trend and also a decisive year for 
Hebei to implement the "outlines of development," 
comprehensively fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and attain 
the second 100-percent-increase target. In line with the 
guiding principles and arrangements of the state and the 
province for economic work, the guiding thought for arranging 
Hebei's 1994 plan is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee, accelerate 
establishment of the socialist market economy system to meet the 
requirement for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability, continue to strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic regulation and control, realistically intensify 
construction of basic industries and infrastructural facilities, 
greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture and the nonstate sectors of the 
economy, intensify the technical transformation of old 
enterprises, restructure the economy, improve economic 
efficiency, and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development and comprehensive social progress. 
  In compliance with this guiding thought, we have paid 
attention to the following points when arranging this year's 
plan. 
  --Only development is the essential criterion. All projects 
that can be accelerated will be as long as conditions permit and 
there is a good market and good efficiency so that the gap 
between Hebei and advanced provinces can be narrowed. We will 
both do our best and act according to our capacity, never 
competing unrealistically. 
  --Promote development by deepening reform. The modern 
enterprise system will be established, deep-seated 
contradictions in economic activities resolved, and the 
financial and tax, monetary, foreign trade, foreign exchange, 
planning, investment, and money lending systems reformed in 
compliance with the target and requirement of establishing the 
socialist market economy system and with a focus on transforming 
the operating mechanism of enterprises to invigorate large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, so that the systems will 
develop internal impetus to promote sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development. 
  --Implement the strategy of promotion through the 
export-oriented economy. All trades and professions and all 
localities should add impetus to the endeavor of opening to the 
outside world, give attention to and develop foreign investment, 
foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously, 
and strive for a new level this year. 
  --Regard optimizing structure, strengthening management, and 
improving efficiency as priorities in economic development. 
Based on the existing foundation, we will accelerate the 
technical transformation of the existing enterprises through 
scientific and technological advance. We will strengthen 
enterprise management and fully tap their potential to achieve 
better efficiency through better management. Guided by market 
demand, we will greatly adjust and improve the product mix and 
the industrial composition. 
  --Achieve a basic balance between total demand and total 
supply. We will both make active efforts to achieve dynamic 
equilibrium and proceed from reality to consider objective 
possibility. We will both fully develop the potential of 
resources to facilitate rapid economic growth and prevent large 
fluctuation in the economy and notable inflation. 
  --Develop economic construction and social undertakings in a 
coordinated manner and promote social stability. On the basis 
of a developed economy, we will continuously improve people's 
living standards and quality of life and make particular efforts 
to increase peasants' income. Meanwhile, we will strictly 
control population growth, strengthen environmental protection, 
develop the two civilizations simultaneously, and greatly 
promote the socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Based on the above-mentioned guiding thought and 
principles, the major targets of the 1994 economic and social 
development plan are as follows: 
  A. Economic growth rate: GNP growth of more than 11 percent, 
which, translated, will be a 4-percent increase in primary 
industry, an increase of over 14 percent in secondary industry 
(a 12-percent increase in industries at and above the township 
level), and an increase of over 14-percent in tertiary industry. 
  B. Output of major products: Grain output will be 23 million 
to 23.5 million tonnes, cotton output 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes, 
output of oil-bearing crops 800,000 tonnes, raw coal output 60 
million to 63.4 million tonnes, electricity output 53.8 billion 
kilowatt hours, rolled steel output 5 million tonnes, pig iron 
output 8.5 million tonnes, and cement output 23 million tonnes. 
  C. Fixed asset investment: Investment in fixed assets made 
by the entire society totals 61 billion yuan, up 13 percent from 
the preceding year. Of the total, 34.9 billion yuan, an 
increase of 12.5 percent, will be investment by state-owned 
units, and the investment rate will be 32 percent. 
  D. Revenue and banking: Calculated according to the new 
revenue- sharing system, local revenue is budgeted at 8.03 
billion yuan, up 7.9 percent from the preceding year. Savings 
deposits of banks increase by 17 billion yuan, up 17 percent; 
and their loans increase by 22 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent. 
  E. Foreign economic relations and trade: The actual amount 
of foreign capital used will be $600 million, up 25 percent from 
the preceding year. Exports total $2.16 billion, up 8.5 
percent; of which exports through ordinary trade and exports by 
the three types of foreign-funded enterprises will be $1.83 
billion, up 15 percent. 
  F. Commodity distribution and prices: Commodity retail sales 
total 67 billion yuan, up 16 percent from the preceding year; 
and the increase in the general index of retail prices is kept 
within 10 percent. 
  G. Scientific and technological advance: We will undertake 
140 key scientific research projects, tackle 40 major scientific 
and technical difficulties, study and develop 100 new 
technologies at and above the advanced level of the province, 
and disseminate 50 key scientific and technological achievements. 
  H. Social development and living standard: Ordinary 
institutes of higher learning will recruit 36,000 students, 
ordinary secondary specialized schools will recruit 75,000 
students, and the natural population growth will be kept within 
12 per thousand. Total wage of staff members and workers of the 
province will be 24.57 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent from the 
preceding year; and efforts will be exerted to make peasants' 
per capita net income 900 yuan, up 12 percent. 
  The above-mentioned targets have been arranged after 
calculation and comprehensive balancing, and they are positive 
and reliable while leaving some leeway as we have considered 
both the tasks assigned Hebei by the state and the requirements 
of the "Hebei's outlines of economic development" which were 
approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's 
congress and because we have not only considered the favorable 
conditions of various fields, but also analyzed the restricting 
factors of various fields. In line with the requirements of the 
"Hebei's outlines of economic development," we should ensure a 
500-percent increase and strive for a 700-percent increase in 
Hebei's GNP by the end of this century, raise Hebei's rankings 
in the country in terms of the major indicators of the economy, 
and turn Hebei into an economically strong province. Judging 
from the practice in the first three years of the 1990's, the 
500-percent increase in GNP can be achieved as long as it 
increases by 9 percent every year in the next seven years, but 
an average annual increase of 13.2 percent should be maintained 
if we are to achieve the 700-percent increase. For this reason, 
this year's GNP increase is planned at over 11 percent. In the 
process of implementation, we will strive for a higher increase 
and still better results in fulfilling other targets. [passage

Has Been Cracked"] 
  [Text] The 10 small-caliber pistols and 700 bullets stolen 
from the Handan city Physical Culture and Sports Commission were 
returned to the owner on 31 March. This is good news for the 
province's spring offensive. 
  The pistols and bullets in the warehouse of the Handan city 
Physical Culture and Sports Commission were stolen at night on 
28 February. Principal leaders of the Fuxing District public 
security sub-bureau and the Handan city public security bureau 
carefully organized efforts to crack this exceptionally big case 
on stolen pistols. Criminal Hu Zhiguo was arrested and a 
small-caliber pistol was seized. Cadres and policemen fought 
successively, conducted an investigation on the spot, and 
arrested the rest of the criminals within a short period of 
time. That night, the principal criminals Guo Fangtao, Chen 
Shikao, and Lu Junhong were captured and brought to justice, and 
nine stolen small-caliber pistols and most of the bullets were 
also seized. This case is being tried.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Zhenkui (0712 2182 1145): "Accurately Find </F>
Out the Point of Contact in Shifting Enterprise Business 
Mechanism and Establishing Modern Enterprise Systems"] 
  [Text] "Establishing modern enterprise systems represents 
a necessary demand for developing socialized mass production and 
the market economy and also an orientation of conducting reform 
among the state-owned enterprises in China." The issue of how 
to boost the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises is 
not only an important task faced by the province but also the 
key content of conducting reform throughout the country. Before 
1988, the rate of the state-owned money-losing enterprises was 
about 10-20 percent. The present rate of state-owned enterprises 
that have suffered losses and whose profits are false and losses 
are true is 70 percent. However, the rate of state-owned 
enterprises that have overtly or covertly suffered losses 
actually is more than 80 percent calculated in term of new 
accounting systems. The proportion of output value scored by 
the state-owned industrial enterprises in the total industrial 
output value decreases year after year. The yearly average 
decrease in this regard before 1992 was 2 percent, that of 1992 
was 4 percent, and that of 1993 was 6 percent. It is thus clear 
that if we fail to fundamentally boost the state-owned large- 
and medium-sized enterprises, it is impossible for the country 
to make success in its reform. 
  Heilongjiang is one of the provinces that have more large- 
and medium-sized enterprises. This represents the province's 
glory in its history but becomes a heavy burden that has 
perplexed the province's economy. 
  By judging from the focal points of the province's economic 
development strategy, the province has 429 large- and 
medium-sized enterprises. Of these enterprises, 409 are 
people-owned ones; 17 are collectively owned ones; and three are 
of other categories. The province has 17,671 small enterprises 
and most of them are privately or individually owned. The 
original value of fixed assets owned by large- and medium-sized 
enterprises is 68.15 billion yuan and the net value of them is 
47.52 billion yuan; as well as that of fixed assets owned by 
small enterprises is 17.16 billion yuan and the net value of 
them is 12.6 billion yuan. By carrying out comparison among 
these values, we may realize that in the structure of the 
province's enterprises, the proportion of publicly owned 
enterprises in the original value of fixed assets accounts for 
about 80 percent and that of net value accounts for about 79 
percent. Such high proportions prevailing in this regard in the 
province are rare in the country as a whole. This shows that 
placing hopes for the province's whole situation and fate of 
economic development on the development of privately owned and 
township enterprises in an effort to improve the backward 
economic outlook seems very unsuitable to the province's 
reality. Without the vitality of large- and medium-sized 
enterprises and the radiation function exerted by these 
enterprises, it is also difficult for privately owned and 
township enterprises to achieve great development. 
  Establishing modern enterprise systems represents a final 
way 
out for large- and medium-sized enterprises across the province. 
However, this also represents an arduous and complicated task. 
By no means should we rush headlong into action in this regard 
and indulge in formalism. It is imperative to accumulate 
experience, to create conditions, and to gradually push the 
establishment forward. 
  First of all we must obtain an accurate and overall 
understanding of modern enterprise systems that can meet the 
demand for socialized mass production and the market economy. 
Those are of new-style enterprise systems with the 
standardization and improvement of enterprise corporate system 
as the main content and with the limited responsibility system 
as the core. Thus, we should understand these systems from the 
following several angles: 
  1. Modern enterprise systems are of microeconomic ones; are 
not the systems only with one or two specific contents; and are 
the setup of systems which involves various fields in the 
external environment and internal mechanism of enterprises. 
  2. Modern enterprise systems do not refer to the equipment 
and managerial levels and managerial methods of enterprises but 
indicate the reflection of internal and external production 
relations of enterprises. Therefore, by no means should we make 
the conclusion that success can be made merely by boosting 
enterprise and enterprises can get rid of the possibility of 
being eleminated from markets as long as modern enterprise 
systems have been established. As a matter of fact, the 
nationally famous U.S. Rockefeller Financial Group was sold to 
another due to the 51 percent shares held by the Mitsubishi 
Financial Group of Japan. 
  3. Although modern enterprise systems have cropped up along 
with the development of the market economy and there is common 
character between systems and the market economy, we must find 
out the point of contact which is suitable to our reality in 
conducting the reform of modern enterprise systems on the 
premise of observing the common character. Meanwhile, it is 
imperative to integrate the experience scored by China in 
conducting enterprise reform in the past and the method of 
creating something new with the international convention and 
feasible methods and to establish in a creative way modern 
enterprise systems suitable to Chinese history and culture and 
to the characteristics of the age. 
  4. Whether enterprise can establish modern systems cannot be 
decided by their ownership. This means that all enterprises may 
take up the establishment in this regard. The state-owned 
enterprises may exercise mixed ownership in carrying out 
company-style reorganization. As for whether hold-shares can be 
decided by the character of enterprises and by the social and 
economic position and role played by enterprises -- meaning that 
"whether the proportion of the state share right in the company 
is relatively adequate," we may handle the issue in line with 
the difference of industries and trades and according to the 
scattered extent of share right. 
  Lastly, we must push forward the reform in various fields in 
a coordinated way to ensure the smooth progress of "shifting the 
enterprise business mechanism and establishing modern enterprise 
systems" because having the state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises to "shift their business mechanism and establish 
modern systems" represents a complicated and systematic project. 
In enforcing the project, a slight move in one part may affect 
the situation as a whole. The present burdens undertaken by the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises for the 
retirement and convalescence leave of staff members and workers 
are very serious. According to statistics, 20-30 percent of 
on-the-job personnel in the state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises across the country are surplus ones. In addition, 
the number of staff members and workers who are going to retire 
from their posts accounts for more than 20 percent in the total. 
By putting the two figures together, the state-owned 
enterprises in the country are shouldering the burden of 
50-percent surplus personnel and so doing the large and 
medium-sized enterprises throughout the province. For this, we 
must further accelerate the reform in the systems of social 
security and establish or improve the social security setup. 
Meanwhile, we must adopt the method of "gradually being 
stripped" to handle the financial burden the enterprises have to 
bear in supporting social undertakings.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Turn Our Eyes Inward, Deepen Reform, </F>
and Restore the Prestige of Heilongjiang"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji guided 
responsible persons of state departments concerned to conduct 
investigations and study in our province and to help resolve the 
temporary difficulties cropping up in the course of advance. 
Like spring wind blowing over the land of Heilongjiang, this 
thing made all people of the province filled with exultation. 
We should take this opportunity, turn our eyes inward, deepen 
reform, expand the scale of opening up, and restore the prestige 
of Heilongjiang. 
  With rich natural resources, a solid agricultural 
foundation, 
and a strong lineup of state-owned enterprises, Heilongjiang is 
the country's key base for production of coal, timber, 
petroleum, machinery, and commodity grain and has made major 
contributions to the country. However, with various 
contradictions and problems accumulated for a long period of 
time under the traditional systems, in the past 10 years, the 
province relatively lagged behind in the economic development, 
and the industrial development speed was noticeably lower than 
the national average level. The problems of Heilongjiang being 
an old industrial base prominently exist among the petroleum, 
coal, forest, and war industries; grain trades; and large and 
medium-sized enterprises. The central leading comrades have 
extremely been concerned with the temporary difficulties ahead 
of Heilongjiang. For a period of time, six standing committee 
members of the political bureau of the party Central Committee, 
namely Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, 
and Hu Jingtao, successively inspected our province and helped 
resolve difficulties and problems. The central authorities made 
such a great determination to help our province solve problems. 
This was the most favorable condition for restoring the 
prestige of Heilongjiang. The central authorities fully 
understand Heilongjiang's difficulties, affirm the contributions 
made by the people of Heilongjiang the work ideas of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, and 
place great expectations on restoring the prestige of 
Heilongjiang. Therefore, changing the cordial concern of the 
central leading comrades into the real deeds of relying on 
self-efforts to tide over difficulties is a major task ahead of 
all people of the province. We should base ourselves on turning 
our eyes inward; rely on our own efforts to solve problems; and 
concentrate our work on emancipating the mind, deepening reform, 
expanding the scale of opening up, and promoting development. 
  To restore the prestige of Heilongjiang, we should proceed 
from the actual conditions of the province and make efforts to 
build new industries and economic advantages. To this end, the 
provincial party committee has worked out a strategic idea for 
extending five aspects and speeding up two aspects as well as a 
work idea for following five roads. To realize the strategic 
idea and the work idea, we must pioneer ways for deepening 
reform and expanding the scale of opening up. To suit the 
general target of setting up the socialist market economic 
system, we should further deepen the reform of the economic 
system, focus on reforming the property rights of state-owned 
enterprises, boldly explore ways for setting up a modern 
enterprise system, enliven state-owned large and medium- sized 
enterprises, coordinate reform with transformation, vigorously 
promote technological transformation among old enterprises, 
grasp the construction of key projects, strive to expand pillar 
industries, and form new economic growth points. We should 
bring into play the advantages of opening the border areas to 
the outside world, extensively invite businessmen and introduce 
foreign capital to conduct grafting transformation, positively 
pioneer domestic and foreign markets, and comprehensively 
promote the development of Heilongjiang. To restore the 
prestige of Heilongjiang, we should turn our eyes inward, rely 
on our efforts to make the province strong, work arduously, and 
quietly immerse ourselves in hard work. The central leaders 
support Heilongjiang to tide over difficulties. This is an 
external factor. Only when we concentrate our own efforts will 
we be able to bring into play the functions of the external 
factor and to promote a change in Heilongjiang. 
  We should fully use the support of the state, rely on our 
own 
efforts, work arduously, and do better the things of 
Heilongjiang. Practice showed that although the units have the 
same economic strains, their situations are greatly different 
because they make different efforts to conduct reform and 
enhance their internal strength. For example, by pioneering 
ways for marketing, some of the collieries under Jixi Mining 
Administrative Bureau have basically not owed the staff and 
workers' wages. Therefore, we stress the necessity not to wait 
for or rely on others' assistance but to make efforts to resolve 
the economic difficulties of various trades in the province. We 
should vigorously advocate the spirits of doing solid work, 
immersing ourselves in hard work, and doing pioneering work; set 
up a work mechanism of doing solid work and stressing real 
efficiency; and have the daring to do pioneering work, to have a 
try, to run a risk, and to bravely blaze new trails in doing our 
practical work. Only when the people from higher levels 
downward across the province form a good practice of seeking 
truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work, and doing 
solid work will we certainly be able to promote the economic 
development and restore the prestige of Heilongjiang.

<F P=106> [Speech by Gao Yan, Governor of Jilin Province, delivered at </F>
the provincial meeting on launching the activities of 
"transforming mechanism and improving management, skills, and 
efficiency," on 1 April, entitled: "Extensively Launching the 
Activities of `Transforming Mechanism and Improving Management, 
Skills, and Efficiency,' and Fulfilling All 1994 Industrial 
Economic Tasks"] 
  [Excerpts] Fellow comrades: 
  This meeting is being convened according to the decision of 
the provincial government. Major tasks of this meeting are to 
mobilize the entire industrial front of the province to 
extensively launch the activities of "transforming mechanism and 
improving management, skills, and efficiency," further implement 
the targets concerning the provincial industrial economy of this 
year, and make arrangements for the production in the second 
quarter of this year. Successfully holding this meeting is of 
positive and promoting significance in implementing in an even 
better manner the guidelines of the second session of the eighth 
National People's Congress, in submitting to and facilitating 
the overall task of "seizing the favorable opportunities to 
deepen reform, open still wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability," and in comprehensively 
fulfilling the goal of pushing the economy onto a new stage this 
year. 
<H5>  1. On the Current Provincial Economic Situation </H5>
  In the first quarter of this year, the province's situation 
in economic operation was, in general, normal, and new headway 
was made based on the high-speed increase of last year. The 
situation in the countryside was very good. The bumper grain 
harvest and the increased purchasing prices of grain and cooking 
oil last year mobilized the initiative of peasants in growing 
grain. As a result, the funds and materials prepared for spring 
plowing were relatively sufficient. The prepared chemical 
fertilizers reached 2.8 million standard tonnes, accounting for 
68 percent of the total demand, of which, 2.4 million standard 
tonnes have already been delivered to the hands of peasants. 
This year, 150 million kg of seeds are needed, and 140 million 
kg has already been delivered to peasants, accounting for 92 
percent of the total demand. Affected by market demand, the 
structure of the cropping industry was readjusted. Local 
financial revenues of the province increased by a relatively 
large margin. Revenues in January and February totaled 520 
million yuan, an increase of 82.4 percent over the corresponding 
period last year, of which, revenues from industrial and 
commercial taxes amounted to 430 million yuan, an increase of 
44.5 percent. Financial situation was relatively stable. Saving 
deposits of urban and rural residents increased by a large 
margin. In the first two months of this year, savings deposits 
of urban and rural residents increased by 4.05 billion yuan, an 
increase of 10.4 percent, or 2.18 billion yuan more than the 
increased amount in the corresponding period last year. Of this 
amount, bank savings deposits increased by 3.11 billion yuan, an 
increase of 10.1 percent, or 1.75 billion yuan more than the 
increased amount of the corresponding period last year, a record 
high. Foreign economic relations and trade continued to keep 
the trend of rapid development. In January and February, export 
volume totaled $240 million, an increase of 50.6 percent over 
the corresponding period last year. Of this, the barter trade 
volume was $43.58 million, an increase of 480 percent. Since 
the beginning of this year, the province has newly approved 303 
foreign-invested enterprises, with the value of contracted 
foreign funds reaching $233 million. Sales on market were 
relatively brisk. In the first two months of this year, the 
total volume of retail sales of commodities was 5.51 billion 
yuan, an increase of 17 percent over the corresponding period 
last year. 
  In the first quarter of this year, industry in the 
provincial 
economic operation increased slowly. Major problems facing 
industry were: First, the increase margin of industrial 
production was relatively small. From January to February, 
output value of the industry at or above the township level was 
9.355 billion yuan, an increase of 1.6 percent only over the 
corresponding period last year. Of this, output value of heavy 
industry increased by 3.8 percent, that of light industry 
declined by 2.7 percent, that of state-owned enterprises dropped 
by 5.3 percent; that of nonstate-owned enterprises increased by 
30 percent; and that of large- and medium-sized enterprises 
increased by 1.5 percent. Sales value realized by enterprises 
amounted to 10.65 billion yuan, a decline of 1.8 percent from 
the corresponding period last year; and marketing rate of 
enterprises was 85.7 percent, a decrease of 4.4 percentage 
points from the corresponding period last year. In January and 
February, the national industry increased by 18.2 percent, while 
the increase in the provincial industry was 16.6 percentage 
points lower than the national level. In March, the growth rate 
of the production of the province's industry at or above the 
township level was enhanced. It is estimated that from January 
to March this year, the increase margin of industry at or above 
the township reached 3.1 percent. However, this margin lagged 
far behind the goal of effecting a 15-percent 
increase. 
  Second, the economic results were not ideal 
enough. In the first two months of this year, the state-owned 
budgetary industrial enterprises registered only a 1.1- percent 
increase in profits; the money-losing budgetary enterprises 
suffered 264 million yuan of deficits, an increase of 330 
percent over the same period of last year; and 60.4 percent of 
the budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises suffered 
deficits. After striking a balance between profits and 
deficits, the state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises 
across the province changed their situation from creating 110 
million yuan of profits in 1993 to suffering 150 million yuan of 
losses. Increasingly more enterprises partially or completely 
suspended their production. According to the statistics 
compiled by the end of February, of the 4,930 enterprises at or 
above the county and district levels in the province, 19.5 
percent partially or entirely suspended their operation. There 
emerges a tendency that the scale of entire or partial 
suspension of operation has been expanded from small-sized 
enterprises to large- and medium-sized ones. 
  There were many factors for causing the changes in the 
province's industrial production situation from fast development 
in 1993 to low-speed increase in the first three months of this 
year and for creating the bigger fluctuation. Viewing the major 
environment, we know that the state stresses the necessity to 
control the aggregate credits and the scale of investment in 
fixed assets in order to control inflation, alleviate the 
"bottle-neck" restrictions, and maintain a sustained, fast, and 
sound development of the national economy. Our province lays 
particular stress on the industrial structure. The state-owned 
enterprises account for a large proportion. So, we are rather 
poor in suiting the market changes. The implementation of the 
"general rules for financial affairs of enterprises and the 
business accounting standards" as well as such state major 
reform measures as the new tax system and the unified foreign 
exchange rate is the necessary step for speeding up the setup of 
the socialist market economic system. However, some new 
problems have been brought to enterprises. That is, some 
enterprises have the factors for increasing taxes and reducing 
profits and undertake heavier burdens. According to the 
statistics compiled through the survey on 98 budgetary 
enterprises of 12 industrial bureaus in Changchun city, through 
implementation of the "general rules and standards," these 
enterprises are expected to reduce 190 million yuan of profits 
in the first half of this year, and have to pay another 130 
million yuan of taxes this year due to the increase in tax rates 
and the changes in the categories of taxes. The implementation 
of the unified foreign exchange rate has results in the increase 
in the value added taxes of imported vehicle parts. Thus, the 
production cost of each Audi sedan car of the Changchun No. 1 
Vehicle Manufacturing Plant increases by 28,000 yuan. After 
implementation of the new tax system, the Jilin carbon plant and 
the Jilin paper-making mill will hand over to higher levels 
23.36 million yuan of taxes annually. Due to the increase in 
taxes, some enterprises that used to make small profits will 
suffer profits. 
  Viewing the overall situation of the province, we know that 
there were two direct reasons for causing the declines in 
industrial production in the first quarter of this year: First, 
since the beginning of this year, the large enterprises and key 
trades, that gave a stimulus to the increase in the province's 
industrial production last year, have lowered their production 
growth rate. When compared the first quarter of this year with 
the same period of last year, the production growth rates of 
such large enterprises as the No. 1 vehicle manufacturing plant, 
the Jilin ferroalloy plant, the Jilin paper-making plant, and 
the Qianguo oil refinery were reduced in varying degrees; and 
those of medical, sugar refining, and metallurgical trades were 
reduced by a big margin. Second, the working funds for 
industrial production were in short supply. Although more 
capital was put into circulation, the enterprises used a 
considerable number of funds to pay taxes, electricity charges, 
debts, and wages retroactively; and only a small amount of money 
were directly used in production. Therefore, from the beginning 
of this year, the enterprises were generally short of funds. 
According to the calculation by the provincial economic and 
trade commission, this year, 8.29 billion yuan of working funds 
should be added for industrial production but only 4.7 billion 
yuan can be supplied and 3.59 billion yuan are in short supply. 
The main reasons for causing the strain on capital are 
insufficient input, the increasingly higher occupation of 
capital by enterprises, and the increasingly heavier debt 
chains. According to the statistics compiled by the people's 
bank, the industrial credits in the first two months of this 
year only increased by 46 million yuan, a drop of 120 million 
yuan from the same period of last year. As of the end of 
February, the 1,248 enterprises with industrial and commercial 
bank accounts had 24.51 billion yuan of funds tied up by 
finished products, goods shipped in transit, and receivable and 
advanced payment for goods, an increase of 820 million yuan over 
the figure at the beginning of the year. Enterprises were 
linked up with one another with the debt chains involving 31 
billion yuan. Due to the bigger deficiency in capital and the 
excessive more capital occupied, many enterprises are unable to 
normally organize production. 
  The current economic situation shows that to 
comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting Jilin's 
economy to a new height this year and to safeguard political and 
social stability, we should ensure the attainment of three 
targets as defined by the provincial government earlier this 
year, namely a 12-percent increase in gross domestic product, a 
15-percent increase in industrial output value, and the price 
rise kept within 10 percent. Industry is the key to fulfillment 
of these three targets. We may say that industry is where the 
priority, difficulty, potential, and hope lie. A large part of 
Jilin's economic growth and revenue come from industry. We plan 
to increase this year's industrial output value by 15 percent 
and will strive for an 18- percent increase, and we will 
increase the profit-tax rate of funds by 2 percentage points. 
These two indicators will be the major criteria for judging 
Jilin's endeavor to promote the economy to a new height. 
Industry is the sector affected most by the measures that the 
state has drawn up and is drawing up for the reform of the 
financial and tax, banking, foreign exchange, price, and 
investment systems. To achieve rapid and healthy development in 
industrial production, we should do a good job in helping the 
enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially 
resume production and provide for themselves in addition to 
making a number of key enterprises successful. This has a 
direct bearing on social stability. Therefore, making this 
year's industrial economy successful is at once an arduous 
economic task and a major political task. Leaders at all levels 
must approach this issue from the perspective of safeguarding 
the basic principles and general task for the work of the entire 
party and entire country this year and correctly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. Since 
the beginning of this year, cities and the autonomous prefecture 
as well as economic departments and departments in charge of 
industries have exerted great efforts to organize industrial 
production under rather difficult conditions, and they have 
scored some achievements. We should play up the achievements, 
continue to work hard in unity, change the current passive 
situation in industrial production as soon as possible, promote 
industry, and facilitate sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development in the province to provide a solid economic 
foundation for the smooth progress of reform and for maintaining 
political and social stability. 
<H5>  2. Regard the Activities of "Transforming Mechanism and </H5>
Improving Management, Skills, and Efficiency" as the Theme of 
This Year's Industrial Work 
  The State Economic and Trade Commission decided to carry out 
the activities of "transforming mechanism and improving 
management, skills, and efficiency" among all the enterprises in 
the country beginning this year. This represents an important 
measure to respond to the central authorities' call for 
establishing the modern enterprise system and for new ideas for 
economic development and also is the road enterprises should 
take in the new situation of deepening reform. In early March, 
the State Economic and Trade Commission again conducted further 
study and made arrangements at the national enterprise 
management forum held in Zhuzhou. The activities have changed 
the past practice of dealing with mechanisms, management, and 
efficiency separately and brought to light the internal 
relationship between the mechanisms, management, skills, and 
efficiency of enterprises. Related to the establishment of 
enterprises' position as the major participators in market 
competition and establishment of the modern enterprise system, 
the activities constitute a basic project for establishing the 
socialist market economy system and are in total conformity to 
Jilin's reality. We should carry out the activities among all 
the enterprises in the province and regard the activities as the 
theme of the endeavor to organize Jilin's industrial economy. 
  We should note that the activities have a very important 
immediate significance in Jilin's endeavors of deepening 
enterprise reform, enhancing the vigor of large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, relying on scientific and 
technological advance, adjusting the product mix, and improving 
economic efficiency. Jilin's state-owned enterprises are faced 
with the common problems of sluggish transformation of the 
operating mechanism, outdated technology and equipment, 
low-level management, and heavy debts. In the past, we 
invigorated enterprises, to a very large extent, by granting 
them more autonomy, allowing them to share more profits, and 
implementing supporting policies. Following the in-depth 
development of the economic reform, the focus of enterprise 
reform has been shifted from policy adjustment characterized by 
tax reduction and more profit retention to system innovation 
aimed at establishing the modern enterprise system. It can be 
said that reform has entered a period for tackling the most 
difficult problems and the arduous task of establishing the 
modern enterprise system, with the focus on reform of property 
right, has been put forward. Under such conditions, the way for 
state-owned enterprises, especially competitive enterprises, to 
survive and develop lies in deepening reform, transforming the 
operating mechanism, and participating in the market competition 
by relying on their own efforts. Poor economic efficiency is 
the conspicuous contradiction restricting Jilin's faster 
industrial development. Our profit-tax rate of funds was 3.3 
percentage points lower than the national average last year, and 
factors leading to enterprises' increase of expenses and 
decrease of profits will increase due to the implementation of 
the several major reform measures this year. To improve the 
economic returns of industry, we should strengthen enterprise 
management, tap the potential of enterprises, improve their 
quality, reduce their material consumption, and raise their 
efficiency. To promote the economy to a new height this year, 
the basic measure is still to invigorate enterprises. The 
activities of "transforming mechanism and improving management, 
skills, and efficiency" will facilitate enterprises' reform and 
development and speed up their march toward the market economy. 
We should pay close attention to this theme and use it to lead 
the various work of enterprises so as to fulfill the tasks for 
promoting industry to a new height this year. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  3. Go All Out To Organize Well the Industrial Production for </H5>
the Second Quarter of This Year 
  The second quarter is the golden season for industrial 
production. In view of the underproduction in the first 
quarter, the second quarter is the key to a better growth rate 
and efficiency in industrial production in the first half of 
this year. The general demand is to uplift spirit, organize 
meticulously, and mobilize forces from all quarters to promote 
industrial production. We should pay attention to funds, which 
constitute the key link; help the enterprises which have 
suspended production totally or partially, especially large- and 
medium-sized ones, start up production; explore and address the 
new contradictions and new problems we encounter in the process 
of deepening reform; and ensure a two-digit growth rate in 
industry in the first half of this year and better efficiency in 
second quarter than in the first quarter. 
  First, we should adopt every means possible to collect and 
enliven the circulation of funds. Funds are the most 
conspicuous problem which arouses the strongest dissatisfaction. 
Whether the industrial production of the second quarter of this 
year can be promoted is decided, to a certain extent, by how the 
problem of funds is solved. The following are the current 
priorities. 1) We should pay attention to collecting funds. We 
should maintain the good trend in the increase of bank savings 
that emerged in the first quarter and strive to increase urban 
and rural savings deposits to overfulfill the task of increase 
in bank savings deposits for the first half of this year. 
Meanwhile, we should collect funds from various channels, such 
as inter-bank lending, introduction of foreign capital, issuance 
of bonds and securities, and other direct or indirect 
money-lending methods. We should further strengthen contacts 
with the head offices of the various specialized banks of the 
state and do more work to win state support. 
  2) We should 
grasp fund enlivenment. The target set in this regard is to 
have the industrial enterprises throughout the province release 
1.2 billion yuan from enlivening the irrational occupation of 
three funds. Various cities, autonomous prefecture, and 
departments concerned should further break down the target; 
fulfill the target to every enterprise; and integrate fund 
enlivenment with bank loans. Loans lent to enterprises that 
have fulfilled the target will not be withdrawn and those that 
have not fulfilled the target will no longer receive new loans. 
Financial and banking departments should help enterprises 
handle their left-over debts, do a good job in adjusting the 
equipment set aside and conducting mortgage and auction for 
tangible assets, and actively clear up the idle accounts and 
loans as well as the "debt chain" among them so as to promote 
the fund circulation to enter a benign cycle. The provincial 
economic and trade commission and banks should cooperate each 
other, do a good job in fund management, optimize the 
orientation of investments, and ensure the limited funds to be 
put to best use. 
  Second, a good job should be done in boosting the large 
enterprises that are influencing the province's economic 
situation. The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
have occupied an important position in the national economy of 
the province and made important and great contributions over the 
past few years to the province's reform, development, and social 
stability. The rapid growth scored by the industrial 
enterprises throughout the province last year and the somewhat 
of improvement in their economic results chiefly depended on the 
impetus given by large enterprises, including the Changchun No.1 
Motor Vehicle Plant and the Tonghua Iron and Steel Plant. The 
low growth of industrial production across the province in the 
first quarter this year was also, to a certain degree, due to 
the fluctuation of production in the large enterprises, also 
including the motor vehicle and iron and steel plants. By 
judging from the whole situation in the economic development 
strategy, Jilin Province requires the vigorous fostering of 
collectively-owned and township enterprises; "three types of 
foreign-funded" enterprises; and privately and 
individually-owned enterprises. These new growing points of the 
economy may upgrade the proportion of non-state-owned 
enterprises in the national economy. However, the decisive 
position occupied by large and medium-sized enterprises in 
economic development and the pillar industrial business formed 
by these enterprises, which is with the No.1 motor vehicle plant 
and the Jilin chemical industrial company as the mainstay, 
cannot be replaced by other economic sectors and industries. 
Therefore, successfully boosting the large and medium- sized 
enterprises always represents a focal point of the province's 
work. [passage omitted] 
  Third, we should actively do a good job in encouraging the 
production-suspension-or-semi suspension enterprises to fully 
restore their production. Present prominent factors that are 
affecting the social stability include commodity prices and 
these production-suspension enterprises. The province's 
increased scale of retail prices scored in January this year was 
10.7 percent calculated in term of new accounting standard and 
that in February was 17.3 percent. Although the increased scale 
of prices is lower than the national average level, it is still 
too high. By no means should we lower our guard in this regard. 
[passage omitted] In dealing with the production suspension or 
semi suspension of enterprises, we should have in principle 
every level be responsible for the work. Problems belonging to 
the level should be resolved by units at the level. According 
to the different conditions of these production-suspension 
enterprises, we should conduct classified guidance. As for the 
enterprises whose products enjoy good sale and that have 
encountered production suspension or semi suspension just 
because of fund shortage, we should help them restore their 
production. With the agreement of departments concerned, we may 
allow these production-suspension enterprises covered by the 
local tax revenue plan to be the first group of restoring their 
production by postponing paying the taxes of various categories. 
Banks should allow these enterprises to preferentially use the 
debt and loan repayments to buy raw materials and to 
retroactively pay their staff members and workers. Governments 
at all levels should raise some funds specially for these 
production-suspension enterprises to restore their production. 
They should integrate their investments with the output of 
enterprises and use the funds by circulating them. These 
production-suspension enterprises should extensively open more 
avenues, organize their staff members and workers to provide for 
and help themselves by engaging in production, and find out a 
way out by opening markets. The leading personnel of these 
enterprises should set an example in work and lead their staff 
members and workers to wage arduous struggles and to commonly 
tide over the difficulty. The leading cadres of all 
money-losing enterprises are not allowed to buy sedans and 
marketable houses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on a recent public opinion poll which 
pointed out that public sentiment for Taiwan independence was 
increasing, Premier Lien Chan said this is a natural phenomenon 
because the people expressed their dissatisfaction with the 
Chinese communist regime. However, the government should uphold 
its past position with regard to the country's future 
orientation for development, adding that there will be no change 
in the position of the government. The following is a report by 
Wang Chiang-mao: 
  [Begin recording] [Wang] Since the occurrence of the 
massacre on Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in mainland China, there has 
been a marked increased in public support for Taiwan 
independence. In this connection, Premier Lien Chan told 
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan on 19 April that a public 
opinion poll shows the public is dissatisfied with the Chinese 
communists' handling of the Chientao Lake incident. However, 
the government should uphold its past position and continue to 
work hard for the future of the Republic of China. Premier Lien 
Chan said: 
  [Lien] A public opinion poll conducted recently shows that 
public sentiment for Taiwan independence is increasing. Most 
people expressed their dissatisfaction with the Chinese 
communist regime. Therefore, this phenomenon is natural. The 
people here are dissatisfied with the Chinese Communist regime, 
and especially with its handling of the Chientao Lake incident. 
I, myself, am not satisfied with its handling of the incident. 
However, we are talking about the orientation for the country's 
development. [words indistinct] This is a matter of prime 
importance for the country and nation. [end recording]

first multiracial votes next week, knowing they can mark the end 
of Taipei's relations with its biggest diplomatic partner. 
South Africa is the largest of the 29 nations that recognize 
the Republic of China on Taiwan. 
  Mainland China has said it wants to establish relations with 
Pretoria once South Africa holds all-race elections on 26 to 28 
April. On Tuesday, Taipei's semi-official Central News Agency 
said President Li Teng-hui will attend the inauguration of the 
new South African president on 10 May. Tu Lin, director of the 
ROC [Republic of China] Foreign Ministry's African Affairs 
Department said Taipei is trying its hardest to maintain its 
relations with the future South Africa. Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress [ANC] is widely expected to play a 
major role in any new South African government. The ANC has 
also said it wants to normalize ties with Peking, and the South 
African embassy in Taipei is not sure what is going to happen.

  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan's government- 
consumption expenditure accounted for 17.2 percent of the 
nation's gross national product in 1992, the highest level of 
any major Asian country that year, according to data made public 
recently by the International Monetary Fund. 
  IMF tallies show that government-consumption expenditure 
rates in all other major Asian countries were below 10 percent 
in 1992, except in South Korea, where the rate was 11.4 percent. 
Singapore and Indonesia had 9.6 percent rates, and Hong Kong an 
8.6 percent rate. 
  Government-consumption expenditures include spending on 
personnel, office equipment, rent, and payouts on debts. 
  Government officials said the 17.2 percent was bloated by 
the 
10 percent of GNP spent on personnel. Personnel spending in 
Japan and South Korea was 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, 
in 1992. 
  They said that spending on 700,000 government officials, 
half 
million-strong army, public schoolteachers, and on retired 
government employees' pensions added greatly to the governmet's 
burden. 
  The huge spending on personnel not only is a waste of the 
nation's limited resources, but also reduces government 
effectiveness, they warned.

  [Excerpt] Governor Chris Patten may appeal for clemency 
for a Hong Kong youth sentenced by a Singapore judge yesterday 
to 12 strokes of the cane. The family of 17-year-old Shiu 
Chi-ho, who was found guilty of four charges of spray-painting 
cars with American Michael Fay and others, will be consulted by 
the Hong Kong Government before any decision is made. 
  "We will wait until we have a formal report and have taken 
advice before we react," a spokesman for Mr Patten said last 
night. Legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing urged supportive and 
sympathetic action by the Government on what she described as a 
cruel punishment. "When Hong Kong people get into trouble 
overseas, of course they look to the Government for help, but it 
is doubtful whether anything can be achieved because the 
American protests [over Fay's sentence] have had absolutely no 
effect," she said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten says there is a "red carpet 
ready to roll down the steps of Government House" to welcome 
senior Chinese official Lu Ping. 
  He said during Legislative Council question time that it 
would be a matter of "considerable satisfaction" for the whole 
community if Mr Lu were to come to Hong Kong. 
  "I think we would throw our hats in the air...my door 
remains 
always open and there is a red carpet ready to roll down the 
steps of Government House," he said. 
  Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, is said to have arranged a visit to the 
territory to attend meetings of the China-appointed Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC). However, it is unlikely he will meet 
Mr Patten because of the row over political reform. The 
Governor was less generous to the PWC, saying he would welcome 
it holding meetings in Hong Kong, just as he welcomed those of 
the International Lions and the International Rotary Club. But 
he said all he could offer would be his "thoughts and prayers" 
that it would give "advice in the interests of Hong Kong" to the 
Chinese Government. "It would be totally wrong of me to offer 
anything else and I'm sure if I were to do so, I'd have my wrist 
very promptly slapped by the NCNA (New China News Agency). 
  Mr Patten said it was his job to facilitate the meetings of 
the "existing and very important" channels of communication 
between the present and future sovereign powers of Hong Kong, 
including the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Land 
Commission and the Airport Committee. 
  "While I welcome anybody who comes to meet in Hong Kong, it 
is not for me to facilitate meetings that lie outside the usual 
relationships between the sovereign powers and Hong Kong. 
  "So, I welcome meetings by the International Lions and I 
welcome meetings by the International Rotary and I welcome 
meetings by the Chamber of Commerce and I welcome the meeting of 
the PWC, but I am not actually responsible for them," he said.

  [Text] The Legislative Council [Legco] will be committing 
suicide if it calls Beijing's bluff and passes the Governor's 
political reform bill, according to Sir Percy Cradock, the 
former foreign affairs adviser to the prime minister. 
  He said Legco would be signing its own death warrant. "It 
would be wound up, extinct, in 1997." 
  Sir Percy, who made the remarks in Hong Kong yesterday, is 
on 
a business trip that also takes in China. 
  He has met the Director of Xinhua (the New China News 
Agency), Zhou Nan, but declined to reveal what was discussed. 
  "Mr Zhou is one of those who can brief me on how Hong Kong 
is 
developing under the present confrontation between Britain and 
China," Sir Percy said. 
  But he emphasised Mr Zhou was "no friend or sparing 
partner". 
[as published] 
  Sir Percy remained critical of the current British policy on 
Hong Kong and maintained that it was entirely 
counter-productive, harming rather than helping the development 
of democracy in the territory. 
  He also argued that the British Government rather than Legco 
was responsible for the well-being of Hong Kong, even after 
1997, and so it had a responsibility to halt the collision 
between Legco and Chinese authorities. 
  "They (Legco) are being encouraged, indeed driven, into a 
situation which is a legislative charge of the Light Brigade. 
It seems to me that a responsible government would be rolling 
them back, pulling them back from that conclusion." 
  If the confrontation continued Hong Kong would be doomed, 
especially in the constitutional arena, Sir Percy said. 
  "In the central area which is about democracy, the rule of 
law, continuity of administration then I am afraid Hong Kong is 
shooting itself in the foot," he said. 
  Sir Percy said he would not be meeting Governor Chris Patten 
during his visit to the territory as he had not been invited.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, a senior 
Chinese leader, told Cheng Yu Tung, chairman of the board of 
directors of the Hong Kong New World Development Co. Ltd, that 
he hopes that Mr. Cheng would more actively participate in 
governmental and political affairs and in making contacts with 
overseas people. 
  Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made this 
remark today while meeting Cheng, who came here to attend the 
second session of the 7th national conference of the All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce. 
  The chairman, also a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central 
Committee, reaffirmed that it remains a leading policy that an 
economy of public ownership co-exists with multiple sectors of 
the economy with the former as the dominant part, which is an 
important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  During the past few years, Cheng, also an advisor on Hong 
Kong affairs, extended his concern and support to the All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce, which is considered as a 
representative of non-public economic sectors in China. 
  Cheng said that he will continue his efforts to contribute 
to 
China's economic construction and Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the 
CPPCC, also attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Kenneth Ko] </F>
  [Text] The Sino-British Land Commission yesterday approved 
the release of 56.81 hectares of land for private and assisted 
housing Although the overall amount of land -- 117.27 hectares 
-- endorsed in the disposal programme for 1994-95 is eight per 
cent down on last year's 127 hectares, the grant for residential 
use has been increased by 23 per cent, or 10.8 hectares. 
British team leader Tony Eason described the three hour meeting 
as a "positive and co- operative" exchange with his Chinese 
counterpart, Chen Rongchun. 
  The extra land supply for residential housing was greeted 
enthusiastically by the chairman of the Hong Kong Bank John 
Gray, who said that the Government was heading in the right 
direction in combatting property speculation. Big developers 
also hailed the increase as a significant step towards 
moderating housing prices, which have reached unaffordable 
levels for most families. 
  A spokesman for the Real Estate Developers' Association of 
Hong Kong, Stewart Leung, called the increase in private 
residential land supply "substantial". However, he stressed 
that to make domestic apartments available sooner, the 
Government should try to streamline the increasingly complicated 
and time-consuming procedures for processing developments. 
  The chairman of the Legislative Council housing panel, Lee 
Wing- tat, also welcomed the news as a "good sign". 
  Yesterday, both the Chinese and British team leaders were 
cautious in commenting on the effect on property prices. 
However, they said the land grant should be seen as a positive 
sign of each government's will to solve the housing shortage. 
Of the 56.81 hectares of residential land, 31.43 hectares was 
granted for assisted-housing programmes such as the Home 
Ownership Scheme, the private sector participation scheme, the 
sandwich-class housing scheme, the housing society development 
and village housing. This represents a 14 per cent, or 
3.8-hectare, increase on last year's grant for 
Government-assisted housing. Another 25.38 hectares for private 
residential construction was included in the 31 hectares set 
aside for commercial, residential and industrial development. 
  According to Mr Eason, about 20 hectares will be used for 
high- density development. But he refused to estimate the 
number of flats nor the total floor area of the residential 
housing that might be provided. He refused also to specify 
where the sites were, apart from saying that most of them were 
likely to be in the New Territories. 
  Asked whether the increase would cool the property prices, 
Mr Eason said: "I do expect the market to see this as 
a...positive step to inject additional supply into the market. 
"[As to] what effect there is on the market sentiment, of 
course, this is not the only factor that people in the market 
will take into account," he said. "So I think we shall have to 
wait and see exactly what its effect is." 
  Mr Chen said the extra land grant would ease property 
prices. 
However, he said the property price-rise was a complicated 
problem to be solved by the Hong Kong British Government. 
  The question of the Container Terminal 9, which requires 
about 60 hectares of land, remained unresolved. Both Mr Chen 
and Mr Eason said it would be discussed at another forum. 
  Mr Chen said: "China and Britain are discussing the issue 
through other channels. Before there is a result, the Land 
Commission will not consider that." Mr Eason said he was not 
disappointed by the lack of agreement on a land grant for the 
container terminal. Until discussions elsewhere had been 
concluded, the Land Commission had postponed its consideration, 
he said. 
  Other categories of land grant included 17.67 hectares for 
public utilities including educational, welfare, religious, 
recreational and other uses. Another 37.16 hectares of land is 
allocated for special requirements. This more than doubled last 
year's grant of 16.51 hectares.

<F P=106> [By Timothy Charlton] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong stocks plunged yesterday as panicked 
investors fled the market ahead of an expected increase in 
interest rates and a deteriorating property market. The Hang 
Seng Index fell 3.1 per cent to close 286.42 points down at 
8,934.59. At one stage the market was down 360 points as 
traders stood back and watched the frenzy of overseas selling. 
  Yesterday s slump compounded the local market's reputation 
as 
one of the worst performing in the world in 1994. In the year 
to date, the market, in Hang Seng Index terms, is down 26 per 
cent and it is down 26.8 percent off its last record close of 
12,201 on January 4. 
  The Robert Fleming Index was up four points to 8,938 in 
early 
trading overnight, but brokers are bracing themselves for a 
further sell-off when the market re-opens today. Brokers blamed 
the deteriorating residential property market and fears of a 
rise in interest rates today for the fall. Hardest hit in the 
massive sell- off were the large property developers. 
  Cheung Kong fell $1.75 to $35.75, Sun Hung Kai Properties 
lost $2.75 to $47, and New World Development dropped $1.70 to 
$23.40. Bank shares were also hit on fears that an interest rate 
increase would further erode lending margins. HSBC fell $3 to 
$85 and Hang Seng Bank dropped $1 to $50. 
  Panic selling in the morning stripped 360 points from the 
index in the first few minutes of trading as investors sold 
their stocks. "People have seen the property bubble burst and 
they want out," said one broker. Barclays de Zoete Wedd 
assistant director Nial Gooding said his clients were equally as 
grim. "Foreign investors are saying 'get me out of property, I 
don't want it'," he said. 
  Any hope of a recovery in property counters was dashed after 
the Sino-British Land Commission released 56.81 hectares of land 
for private and assisted housing. The move effectively 
increases the amount of land available for residential use by 23 
per cent compared with last year's grant. Brokers said it was 
clear the Government was serious about bringing prices down and 
that developers would suffer as a result. The sudden turn-about 
in residential property prices has even caught the experts off 
guard. And while the news is good for those wanting to buy a 
home the implications for property developers are serious. 
  Baring Securities director James Osborn said everyone was 
waiting on the Government's next move. "The jury is still out 
on whether the market will fall by the 5-15 per cent the 
Government hopes for or whether prices will plunge even 
further," he said. "They could fall by 30 or 40 per cent -- 
that's the scary thing," he added. Nobody expected flat prices 
to fall as quickly or as dramatically as they did. The sudden 
turn-about in flat prices over the week has sparked a dramatic 
sell-off in property related stocks. 
  Yesterday's sell-off was even more worrying because the main 
sellers were European institutions, typically strong supporters 
of the local market. There had been signs that foreigners were 
taking an interest in Hong Kong stocks again after having been 
heavy sellers in February. The sudden downturn in the property 
market and the likelihood of higher interest rates has now 
scared many away. 
  Bank stocks also came under heavy pressure ahead of today's 
Hong Kong Association of Banks meeting where interest rates will 
be discussed. Monday's increase in United States interest rates 
-- the third this year -- will put pressure on Hong Kong banks 
to increase their rates. This is because the Hong Kong dollar 
is pegged to the US dollar and any difference in interest rates 
will pressure on the peg.

<F P=106> [By Victoria Finlay and So Lai-Fun] </F>
  [Text] Amnesty International yesterday accused the Hong 
Kong Government of failing to safeguard human rights. It also 
called for the immediate establishment of an independent human 
rights commission. But Governor Chris Patten believes a 
commission might be a "pretty toothless creature." 
  In its first comprehensive report on the territory for four 
years, Amnesty claimed Hong Kong fell short of its minimum 
obligations to provide an effective complaints system for people 
who believed they were victims of violations of the Bill of 
Rights. 
  "People in Hong Kong have been priced out of the market," 
said international law expert Chris Avery, who compiled the 
report. He said people claiming the Government had violated 
their rights were often deterred from bringing a civil case by 
the fear that, should they lose the case, they would be ordered 
to pay the "often huge" costs. "Many people feel they must 
simply let their rights be violated rather than risk financial 
ruin trying to enforce them in court." 
  Mr Avery was very surprised there had been only 15 
applications for legal aid in civil Bill of Rights cases, with 
the exception of immigration cases which were treated 
separately. Only one application had been granted and two 
applications had been withdrawn. 
  Legal Aid Department spokesman Andrew Leung Kin-pong said 
all 
cases were dealt with on an independent basis. He said there 
was a comprehensive appeal procedure. 
  The report called for the Government to make the legal aid 
agency fully independent and also to set up a human rights 
commission to provide an "accessible, affordable, speedy and 
effective remedy" for victims of human rights violations. Mr 
Avery said the Legislative Council [Legco] had already voted for 
a commission, but Mr Patten had not spoken in its favour. 
  Mr Patten, speaking during Legco question time yesterday, 
said the administration would look at the pros and cons of the 
suggestion before stating its position by the end of June. He 
added: "One can think of some human rights commissions which 
are pretty toothless creatures and perhaps at the end of the day 
do less for the advance of human rights than could have been 
achieved in other ways." 
  Legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk, the sponsor of a private 
member's bill on the commission, described the Governor's 
attitude as "empty- minded" and aimed at preserving the status 
quo. 
  Senior law lecturer at Hong Kong University, Dr Nihal 
Jayawickrama, said he agreed with the recommendations of the 
45-page Amnesty report, Hong Kong and Human Rights: Flaws in 
the System. 
  He said the Bill of Rights had been introduced by the 
Government in 1991 as a confidence-boosting measure after the 
Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. "They seemed to say that now 
they had got the Bill of Rights, they would be able to leave it 
alone, without introducing the necessary safeguards." But he 
said the commission provided those safeguards. 
  Meanwhile, more than 70 members of the United States House 
of 
Representatives have written urging Mr Patten to set up a 
commission.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Smooth Landing"] </F>
  [Text] At first glance, the Sino-British Land Commission's 
approval of the release of 117 hectares [ha] of land at the 
start of the financial year seems generous. It looks as though 
China has been co-operating fully in the Government's stated aim 
of releasing more land to take the heat out of the property 
market. That is particularly true of the release of 25.38 ha 
set aside for private sector residential development, 38 percent 
more than a year ago. The whole package is more than double the 
minimum 50 ha for which the commission's approval is required. 
  However, while the figures are high for the first meeting of 
the year, there is no guarantee the trend will continue to stay 
ahead of past years. In previous exercises, more land has been 
released as the season has progressed, bringing the figure up to 
considerably more than yesterday's total. Over the whole of 
last year, the commission released 127 ha. It may be that 
yesterday's agreement was a political signal, designed to take 
some of the steam out of property prices, rather than a genuine 
indication of the prospects for the year ahead. 
  There are no grounds, therefore, for more than cautious 
optimism that the Hong Kong Government has a clear idea of how 
much land needs to be released to reduce prices without 
precipitating a crash. Nor are there for confidence that the 
Chinese Government's assessment of the market will be the same. 
  It is unclear whether the Government understands what it is 
doing. How can people have faith in the competence of an 
administration which opens a new phase of its sandwich-class 
housing scheme just as it is trying to slow prices down and then 
finds the banks are unwilling to lend into a falling market? 
Nevertheless, the fact that the two sides are working together 
on a sensibly measured increase in the amount of land released 
at the beginning of the year bodes well for continued 
Sino-British co-operation on economic matters and for the Hong 
Kong Government's ability to get its programme right despite its 
inexperience in the market. 
  It has set itself the delicate task of taking some of the 
air 
out of the property bubble without bursting it. The success of 
the enterprise depends less on the current balance between 
supply and demand than on the market's perception of future land 
supply. The decisions of the Land Commission suggest the 
Government may yet confound the sceptics and alter perceptions 
without engineering a crash.

  [Text] Forces From Various Quarters Vie With Each 
Other To "Step Forward" 
  At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], the proposal put forward by Cheng Yiu-tong (an 
NPC deputy from the Hong Kong region) suggesting that Hong 
Kong's constitutional structure should not straddle 1997 was 
bearing down menacingly, as if to hand down a "death penalty" on 
the Hong Kong Government. But his motion did not make it onto 
the agenda of the session. The "abortion" of this proposal for 
"denouncing Britain" greatly disappointed the forces from 
various quarters who were eager to seize power. 
  One would seem to be blaming the pro-China people wrongly if 
one thinks they have misjudged the situation and vied with each 
other to "step forward." There is one "encouraging" factor in 
all this, that is, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has also 
put forward proposals for "denouncing Britain." Because the 
proposals were very sensitive, after the high-level CPC 
personalities did some "persuasive work," they were quietly 
withdrawn. 
<H5>  Commanders of Three Military Regions Submit Proposals for </H5>
"Denouncing Britain" Signed by 88 People 
  It is learned that the undisclosed proposals were handed in 
to the general meeting on 12 March, after they had been signed 
by 88 members of the PLA delegation. The three initiators of 
the proposal are powerful people. They are: Lieutenant General 
Li Zhu, commander of Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant General 
Gu Hui, commander of Nanjing Military Region; and Li Xilin, 
commander of Guangzhou Military Region. They submitted two 
proposals, the thrust of which was to condemn Britain for 
confronting China and causing disturbances in Hong Kong, and 
they demanded the termination of its colonial rule in Hong Kong. 
  According to some personalities who read the proposals, this 
was tantamount to the military openly expressing their opinion 
on the Hong Kong issue. Judged by the wording of the proposals, 
they are very unhappy with the current policy toward Hong Kong, 
thinking that it is weak and even smacks of capitulation. 
<H5>  The Military Decided for Themselves and Demanded the </H5>
Remaking of Hong Kong Policy 
  This is a very subtle mentality. One wonders if it is 
because Deng Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on "reflecting 
sovereignty through the stationing of armed forces" has 
imperceptibly upgraded the status of the gun barrel. As things 
stand now, the military is showing a tendency toward making 
decisions for themselves on the issue of Hong Kong. 
  The proposals signed by 88 military personalities contain 
the 
following five major points: 
  1. To sternly condemn the British authorities for openly 
violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and brazenly 
tearing up the agreements between the governments of the two 
countries. 
  2. To lodge a serious protest about the British authorities 
blatantly putting forward the constitutional reform package that 
interferes in China's internal affairs and attempts to extend 
their colonial rule. 
  3. To issue a stern warning to the British authorities that 
they should not try to turn Hong Kong, which is China's 
territory, into a zone of international political dispute and a 
base for opposing China and the communist party. 
  4. Asking the government to take firm and resolute measures 
in the event of changed circumstances, especially when Hong Kong 
is plunged into a trauma, and recover Hong Kong to end Britain's 
colonial rule ahead of time. 
  5. Asking the government to give serious thought to 
terminating high-level contact and withdrawing the Chinese 
ambassador to Britain in view of Britain's change of position on 
China and deliberate deterioration in bilateral relations. 
  A battery of such terms as "solemnly" and "request" sound as 
if the military is above the CPC Central Committee. A point of 
breakthrough seems to have been made in "letting the gun command 
the party." 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin Personally Persuades Military Deputies </H5>
  This situation immediately attracted the attention of the 
CPC 
high-level leadership. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin took 
the matter up himself and visited the military deputation two 
times to persuade them. Jiang Zemin said: The Central 
Committee is following the principle of striking only after the 
enemy has struck on the issue of Hong Kong, because the 
initiative and timetable are both in our hands. As things stand 
now, we can recover Hong Kong ahead of schedule according to 
reason. Our stand has not changed, and it will not change. 
Political cooperation between China and Britain is entirely 
nonexistent. But we should watch how things develop so that we 
can better handle the affair with justice on our side, to the 
benefit of ourselves, and with restraint. 
  The current CPC policy toward Hong Kong seems to be pleasing 
neither the people at home nor abroad. It cannot explain to its 
people what is meant by "striking after the enemy has struck," 
yet it cannot cut off all cooperation with the British Hong Kong 
Government. This very policy of "being strong in appearance but 
weak inside" has met with criticism at home and caused 
"ideological confusion" among the loyal "patriots" in Hong Kong 
in particular. 
  In order to reassure people, some political figures, such 
as Qian Qichen, Wang Hanbin, and Lu Ping, had "heart-to-heart" 
talks with some NPC deputies and vice chairmen of the national 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] from Hong Kong and Macao during the recent 
NPC and CPPCC sessions. They explained what the central 
authorities have been doing to fulfill its "obligation" to the 
people. 
<H5>  Qian Qichen Claims China Is Strong Enough To Deal With </H5>
Britain 
  Qian Qichen said: The Sino-British relations are now at rock 
bottom and facing noncooperation or even confrontation. This is 
a natural result of Britain changing its policy toward China and 
confronting us on the issue of Hong Kong. This situation is not 
something we wanted to see, because Hong Kong is, after all, 
China's territory and the 5 million odd Hong Kong compatriots 
are part of the big family of China. But Britain wants 
confrontation, wants to extend its colonial rule beyond 1997, 
and wants to turn Hong Kong from an international financial, 
industrial, and commercial center into a city of international 
political dispute. How can we let Britain's plot succeed! We 
must be responsible to history, to the 1.2 billion Chinese 
people, and to our 5 million odd compatriots in Hong Kong. 
Also, we must be responsible to foreign businessmen who have 
properties and investments in Hong Kong. Therefore, we will not 
yield even a single inch or compromise even once to colonialism 
on matters of sovereignty and principle. We have the confidence 
and strength to deal with and defeat Britain's old political 
tricks. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping Recently Instructs: Check the Dynamic From a </H5>
Point of Stillness, Overcome Disturbance With Substantial 
Strength 
  Qian Qichen also emphasized: After putting up such 
confrontations, Britain lost what it had been capitalizing on. 
Now the initiative is entirely in our hands and so is the 
timetable. A high degree of consensus among the party, the 
government, the military, and the people nationwide is the basis 
on which we make our decisions. 
  Qian Qichen also revealed the central authorities' latest 
strategy for dealing with Britain, that is, to check the dynamic 
from a point of stillness and overcome disturbance with 
substantial strength. It is said that this was proposed by Deng 
Xiaoping when he recently spoke to the central leading comrades. 
  Lu Ping put forward the policy of "uniting with all those 
who 
love China and Hong Kong." He said: "With the exception of the 
core members of the pro-Britain, anti-China ultra-right 
organizations that attach themselves to foreign forces, we 
should unite with all Hong Kong compatriots and expatriates in 
Hong Kong who are willing to work for the smooth transition of 
Hong Kong and who are willing to stay in Hong Kong and help 
build a new Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two 
systems, the Basic Law, and the leadership of the future Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This is our policy." 
<H5>  Wang Hanbin on "Preparing for Both Eventualities" </H5>
  Wang Hanbin was more specific when he talked about the 
current preparatory work. He said: Now Sino-British relations 
are in an abnormal state. It is impossible for China to take 
the initiative to try relaxing and mending relations, because 
the basis for doing so is not there. The Sino-British Joint 
Declaration has been sabotaged by the British side, so its role 
has been almost entirely taken away. We no longer have the 
basis for Sino-British cooperation at this stage and such basis 
will not be ready for some time. The Chinese side does not 
place any unrealistic hope in the situation. The current work 
is mainly to prepare for the following two things: 
  1. The Preliminary Working Committee's work should be 
realistic and should be strengthened, increased, and 
accelerated. The preparations for setting up the SAR should be 
carried out and arranged earlier than scheduled. 
  2. The work of the relevant departments in the central 
government has been more or less assigned and various 
preparations made. Once Hong Kong is plunged into a political 
trauma, the society lands in protracted turbulence, and foreign 
countries meddle in Hong Kong affairs and try to change Hong 
Kong's status, we will not have a second choice. 
  Wang Hanbin said: The initiative is entirely in our hands. 
No violation of the integrity of national sovereignty and the 
sacredness of our internal affairs is allowed, as they override 
everything else at all times. 
<H5>  Ye Xuanping: China and Britain Will Not Have the Conditions </H5>
and Climate for Cooperation 
  CPPCC Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping disclosed a piece of 
information to the NPC deputies from Guangdong Province: The 
central authorities have made it clear that they will do 
everything to ensure the stability and development of Hong Kong. 
Naturally, they have various preparatory measures, including 
full political, economic, and military considerations. They 
will not let Britain control the destiny of Hong Kong beyond 30 
June 1997. You and I can see that day when it comes. If things 
change, it will not be in three years and a few months. China 
and Britain will not possibly have the conditions and climate 
for cooperation. 
  That "restoring cordial relations with the British side is 
impossible" seems to have become a "common understanding" shared 
by personalities at all levels in the CPC. But opinions on how 
to deal with the "British colonialism's plot in Hong Kong" 
differ. What merits attention is that the CPC's Hong Kong 
policy has been constantly challenged, which is bound to cause 
the already "left"- leaning policy to get out of control.

  [Text] Macao, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said that his recent visit to China 
was a great success. 
  In a special interview with XINHUA before he left Macao, 
Cavaco Silva said while in Beijing he exchanged views with 
leading Chinese leaders on the current Sino-Portuguese political 
and economic relations, as well as matters relating to Macao, 
adding both sides were happy with good bilateral political 
relations and agreed to strengthen contact in economic and trade 
fields. 
  The Portuguese prime minister also said on Macao issue, both 
sides held that it was necessary to maintain Macao's stability 
and economic development through dialogue between the 
governments of China and Portugal. 
  During his visit in Beijing, Silva said, a loan agreement 
involving 200 million U.S. dollars was signed to support 
Portuguese exports and investment in China, and his entourage of 
over 60 Portuguese businessmen had wide contacts with Chinese 
enterpreneurs, noting that these have laid a foundation for the 
development of economic and trade relations between the two 
countries. 
  Silva also praised the rapid economic development on China's 
mainland, saying it should be attributed to the reform and 
opening policies launched by the Chinese leaders and the 
enterprising spirit of the Chinese people. 
  On Macao issue, Silva again stressed the importance of 
dialogue and cooperation between the two countries, adding it 
would guarantee the settlement of matters relating to the 
transition in Macao. 
  He eventually said, the Portuguese Government, as will the 
Chinese side, would make all-out efforts to maintain the 
stability and progress in Macao.

<F P=106> [By trainee WEN WEI PO reporter Fang Hsiao-i (2075 2556 </F>
1837): "Wu Jianmin Comments on Handling of Xi Yang Case, Says It 
Is China's Internal Affair"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Wu Jianmin commented on the Xi Yang case at a Foreign 
Ministry news briefing here. He said that the case had 
absolutely nothing to do with most-favored-nation [MFN] 
treatment and that the handling of the case had nothing to do 
with Sino-British relations and with confidence in Hong Kong. 
  A Hong Kong Commercial Radio reporter said that a few days 
ago the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong had publicly supported Xi 
Yang. The reporter went on to ask the spokesman whether or not 
he was worried about the impact of this incident on China's 
efforts to strive for MFN treatment. Wu Jianmin said that the 
Xi Yang case was a criminal case, whereas MFN treatment is an 
issue between China and the United States. He said that these 
two things have nothing to do with each other, therefore, we did 
not have anything to worry about. 
  A Hong Kong Asia Television reporter said that as far as Xi 
Yang's case was concerned, the Hong Kong Government wanted to 
make representations to the Chinese side through the British 
Embassy in China, while the British Government had summoned the 
Chinese ambassador to Britain, but these two diplomatic channels 
were to no avail. The reporter asked whether or not the case 
was related to Sino-British relations? Wu Jianmin replied that 
the reason was very simple as the handling of the Xi Yang case 
was an internal affair which had nothing to do with Sino-British 
relations. 
  Another Hong Kong reporter asked whether or not the verdict 
on Xi Yang would undermine people's confidence in Hong Kong 
after the its return in 1997. Wu Jianmin said: China is a 
country ruled by law and Xi Yang's case was handled strictly in 
accordance with the law. It has nothing to do with confidence in 
Hong Kong. From 1 July 1997, the Chinese Government will firmly 
implement the policy of one country, two systems in the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and work in accordance with 
the Basic Law. We are fully confident of maintaining Hong 
Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and worries are 
unfounded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Is This a `Reasonable, Habitual Practice of </F>
Reporters Worldwide'?"] 
  [Text] Chris Patten made irresponsible comments [shuo san 
dao si 6141 0005 6670 0934] regarding the Beijing municipal 
judiciary's completion of the trial on the Xi Yang 
secret-stealing case by saying that "the sentence was completely 
disproportionate to the charge." Shortly after that, the U.S. 
Consulate General in Hong Kong issued a statement: "According 
to what is known to the U.S. Government, it seems that Xi Yang 
merely collected data by the reasonable and habitual 
professional means used by reporters worldwide and his sentence 
was far more serious than the crime he was accused of 
committing." The two sides expressed themselves in different 
ways but the meaning was the same. They were echoing each other. 
  In the British Parliament report, highly praised by Patten, 
a 
passage stated: In its China policy, Britain "should adopt the 
same policy and carry out cooperation with other countries in 
the world, especially the European allies and the United 
States." By linking these words with current happenings, people 
may ask: Was Britain trying to carry out "cooperation" with its 
allies against China by using the Xi Yang case? 
  Here, we may first quote the "Proclamation" of international 
law: "A country does not have the right to directly or 
indirectly interfere in the internal and foreign affairs of 
other countries for whatever reasons; therefore, armed 
interference or interference in other forms, or attempts to 
threaten another country's dignity or political, economic, or 
cultural affairs must be condemned." 
  Was the handling of Xi Yang's secret-stealing case by the 
municipal judicial organs of Beijing Municipality an internal 
Chinese affair? Did the criticism of China's handling of the Xi 
Yang case in the form of making comments and issuing a statement 
constitute interference and should this be condemned? China has 
never made comments on the handling of criminal cases inside 
Britain and the United States but Britain and the United States 
have often attacked China's handling of criminal cases according 
to its own laws. Why so? Can Mr Patten answer this? 
  Here, we can analyze "what was known to the U.S. 
Government." 
According to the United States, "Xi Yang just collected data by 
the reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters 
worldwide." If that was the case, Xi Yang should not have been 
found guilty but should have been given credit. Would there 
still then be any difference between good and evil in the world? 
Would there be any rule-of-law society? 
  In June and July last year, Xi Yang did not collected 
so-called "data" in Beijing but secrets. This is a plain fact. 
Some people said that China did not clearly define "secrets" 
and demanded that the state give the definition. This is 
untrue. Like all other countries, China has its own secrets and 
the degrees of confidentiality are determined by their influence 
regarding state security and state interests. The state will 
not maintain things which need not be kept confidential as 
secrets. Being a reporter, especially one who has lived and 
worked on the Chinese mainland for many years, Xi should be well 
aware of this. Xi Yang was not unaware that he was collecting 
secrets; on the contrary, he was well aware that the documents 
about the printing of banknotes, the People's Bank of China's 
decision on selling gold on the international market and 
adjusting the interest rates, and the "Explanation of the 
Interim Rules for the Renminbi Business Operation of 
Foreign-Funded Banking Institutions" were all confidential 
documents. Therefore, he pried into such information and stole 
the secrets by taking surreptitious action and coming into 
secret personal contact with the information supplier. 
  As for the "means," Xi Yang adopted the means of stealing 
secrets rather than the means of gathering news. Lumping these 
two things together and even describing secret-stealing as the 
"habitual means used by reporters worldwide" is just an insult 
to reporters worldwide. 
  Reporters are not supermen and superwomen free from the 
control of the law. When gathering news in any country or 
region, reporters must abide by local laws and the international 
norms and practices. Naturally, when gathering news in China, 
reporters from outside the mainland should abide by China's 
laws. When covering news in Britain and the United States, 
Chinese reporters should also abide by the laws of Britain and 
the United States. Would Britain and the United States allow 
foreign reporters to freely pry into their secret information 
and steal their secrets by despising their laws? The means is 
always linked with the purpose. By seeing whether a means is 
proper and legal, we should link the means with the purpose. 
The means aimed at stealing secrets constitute illegal means 
and must not be regarded as news covering. 
  A country has its national dignity, a newspaper has its 
reputation, and a person has his or her personal dignity. Being 
a reporter with personal dignity, he or she must not do things 
which violate the rights and interests of other people in order 
to curry favor with his or her employer, or do things 
endangering the security and interests of a country or even his 
or her own motherland! A provision of the international 
convention specifies that when citizens exercise their right of 
"freedom of speech," they "have to be subject to certain 
constraints," including the need to "respect other people's 
rights and reputation" and to "guarantee national security, 
public order, or public health and morality." Is it not true 
that reporters worldwide should abide by this norm? Can they 
behave like Xi Yang in doing what is harmful to their 
motherland's security and interests for the self-interest of 
themselves and their newspapers? Is this the "reasonable and 
habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide?" 
  When covering news in China, reporters from outside the 
mainland can dispatch as many reports as they like. The Chinese 
authorities do not censor such reports and do not require them 
to only report good news and cover up bad news. Are they not 
free enough? If some people say that they are still not free 
enough, does this mean that they should be allowed to freely pry 
into the state's secret information and steal state secrets? 
Would there be such freedom in any part of the world? 
  It seems that it is not true that the sentence "was 
disproportionate to the charge" in Xi Yang's case; instead, 
Patten's interference was very disproportionate to his status.

  [Text] Washington, April 20 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton will announce details of a new U.S. plan on Bosnia later 
today, the White House said. 
  "We have new military and diplomatic initiatives which the 
President will likely discuss later today," White House 
spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. 
  Clinton met twice with his national security advisers for 
some four hours Tuesday [19 April] on how to deal with the 
worsening situation in Bosnia, especially in the encircled 
Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
  It was reported that the U.S. plan included the support of 
wider use of air power against the Bosnia Serbs, not only in the 
six U.N.-authorized "safe areas" for the Muslims but on other 
Serb strategic positions. 
  The plan also called for tougher economic sanctions against 
the Serb republic, seen by the West as supporter of the Bosnian 
Serbs in perpetuating the two-year war. 
  In Brussels, NATO officials discussed the wider use of air 
power on Bosnia but no final decision was reached. 
  Analysts believe that little objection will be expected to 
stiffer sanctions on Serbia but the military moves might 
encounter differences because many European countries have 
troops on the ground in Bosnia and their governments fear Serb 
retaliations.

<F P=106> [Report: "Premier Li Peng Delivers Important Speech in </F>
Tashkent"] 
  [Text] Tashkent, 19 Apr (RENMIN RIBAO) -- At the Uzbek 
Parliament today, Premier Li Peng delivered an important speech 
to hundreds of parliament members, government officials, and 
personalities from various circles. The following is the full 
text of his speech: 
  In the past two years or so, President Karimov and leaders 
of 
other Central Asian nations have visited China. Now, at the 
invitation of the leaders of Central Asian nations, and bringing 
with me the friendship of the Chinese people, I have made the 
first stop of my trip, in the beautiful and richly endowed land 
of Uzbekistan, and embarked on a tour of China's good neighbors 
of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. Such 
frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of China and 
the Central Asian nations is unprecedented, and is an important 
signal that the relations between China and the Central Asian 
nations have entered a new era. 
  The Republic of Uzbekistan is an important country in 
Central 
Asia. It has a long history, a splendid culture, rich 
resources, and an industrious and ingenious people. Since it 
became independent, Uzbekistan, under the leadership of 
President Karimov, has been dedicated to maintaining stability 
and developing the national economy at home, and expanding 
friendly communication with its neighbors and other countries in 
the world, which has yielded positive results. The Chinese 
people heartily rejoice in this and sincerely hope the people of 
Uzbekistan will make greater achievements in building their own 
country. 
  China and Uzbekistan are friendly, close neighbors. The two 
countries shared many similarities in the past, and continue to 
do so today. In the past, the ancient Silk Road once closely 
linked our two countries; today, we both concentrate on building 
our own nations, both want an international environment that 
enjoys long- term stability, and both are willing to develop 
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and 
establish a long-term, stable, good-neighborly, and friendly 
relationship. In the past two days, President Karimov and I 
have exchanged views extensively and in depth on the 
international situation, regional situation, and bilateral 
relations. The meetings were pleasant, friendly, and fruitful. 
The government officials in charge of foreign trade and 
economic relations, as well as entrepreneurs, of both countries 
seriously discussed ways to further strengthen economic 
cooperation, and signed a series of agreements. Both sides took 
a positive attitude to cooperation and were optimistic about the 
prospects. I believe this visit is bound to improve our mutual 
understanding and strengthen our cooperation. This will 
undoubtedly bring further development to existing 
Sino-Uzbekistan relations. 
  The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of 
the Central Asian nations goes back to ancient times. The 
Central Asian nations, as the main corridor on the Silk Road, 
once made important contributions to establishing commercial 
enterprise and cultural exchange on the Eurasian continent. 
Today, the ever-expanding exchange between the Central Asian 
nations and the rest of the world is writing a new chapter of 
common development and friendly exchange between Europe and 
Asia. China sets great store by its relations with Central 
Asian nations. We are willing to work with Central Asian 
nations, have our eyes on the future and the next century, and 
do our part to help build a new Silk Road. China's basic 
policy for developing its relations with Central Asian nations 
can be summarized into the following four brief points: 
  First, maintaining good-neighborly and friendly 
relations and peaceful coexistence. China and the Central 
Asian nations are either neighboring countries sharing common 
borders, or are close to each other. It is the common wish of 
the Chinese people and the Central Asian peoples to be friendly 
neighbors, for this is entirely in line with our fundamental 
interests. Now, as the Chinese people are concentrating on 
building their own country, they need a peaceful international 
environment of long-term stability, especially a good 
surrounding environment. We have always cherished good will and 
friendly sentiment toward the Central Asian peoples, and will 
forever remain your good friends and neighbors. China never 
seeks self-interest or sphere of influence in the world, 
including this region. Even when China becomes more developed 
economically and more powerful and prosperous in the future, it 
will never seek hegemony or power politics. China will always 
maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You 
can fully trust that no matter what happens in the world, China 
will not change this policy. We mean what we say. 
  Second, conducting mutually beneficial cooperation 
and promoting common prosperity. Developing economic 
cooperation and trade occupies an important position in our 
relations. We have made a good start in this regard, but there 
is still a lot that we should, and can, do. In developing 
economic cooperation with Central Asian nations, China will 
strictly abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, 
and attach no political conditions to it. We would like to work 
with all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the 
environment for cooperation, expand the scope of cooperation, 
and upgrade the level of cooperation; and with mutual benefit, 
march along the path of common development. 
  Third, respecting the choice of the Central Asian 
peoples and refraining from interfering in other nations' 
internal affairs. As the world is diversified, the 
national conditions of the Central Asian nations differ from one 
other. There has never been, and can never be, a uniform mode 
of development that suits the realities of all countries. We 
believe that the Central Asian nations, like China and other 
countries in the world, are entitled to independently choose the 
social system, values, and path of development compatible with 
their national conditions. It is our conviction that the 
Central Asian nations have all the capabilities and wisdom 
necessary to handle their own affairs well. 
  Fourth, respecting independence and sovereignty and 
contributing to regional stability. China sincerely hopes 
that Central Asia will be able to maintain long-term peace and 
stability. We appreciate and support all the efforts made by 
Central Asian countries to safeguard their national independence 
and sovereignty, promote regional peace and stability, and 
enhance friendship and cooperation among nations. The 
development of our relations with any Central Asian nation is 
not directed against any third country. We are willing to see 
the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each other. 
Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all 
countries in the world, including Russia and other CIS 
countries. The development of Central Asian nations needs world 
peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and 
prosperous Central Asia. 
  Dear friends! Today's world is developing toward 
multipolarization. The Chinese Government sees a positive 
significance in this trend. Safeguarding peace, strengthening 
cooperation, and promoting development is a common wish 
cherished by all peoples. But we should also be able to see 
that some problems left behind by the Cold War are not 
thoroughly resolved, while many new conflicts and contradictions 
have kept emerging. The world is far from being a peaceful 
place. The pauperization of many developing countries is 
aggravating. While the issue of world peace has yet to be 
solved, the problem of development is more outstanding. On the 
whole, today's world is still locked in complicated and profound 
changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international 
political and economic order has become an urgent wish of 
various peoples around the world. The new international 
political and economic order we advocate is different in essence 
from the old order characterized by hegemony and power politics. 
We believe such a new order may contain many aspects, but the 
most central aspects are as follows: 
  In handling international relations, the principles of 
mutual 
respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual 
nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, 
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be 
strictly followed. 
  The right of the people of each nation to choose the social 
system and mode of development in light of their national 
conditions should be respected. 
  All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are 
entitled to participate in international affairs, which should 
not be determined by one or several big countries. 
  Disputes among nations should be settled in a fair and 
reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of 
equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual 
accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be 
shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while 
reserving differences. Differences over some issues should not 
hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations. 
  Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in line 
with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of 
equal value. Developed nations face an unshirkable 
responsibility for gradually reducing the gap between the North 
and the South. 
  The establishment of a new political and economic order of 
the world is a long-term, arduous task. We are ready to work 
unremittingly toward that, along with all Central Asian nations 
and the rest of the world. 
  Dear friends! Here, I would also like to give you a brief 
account of China's domestic situation. Since the end of the 
1970's, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics established by Deng Xiaoping, the 
chief architect of China's reform and opening up, China has made 
marked achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization. 
From 1979 to 1993, the average annual growth rate of China's 
economy was over 9 percent. As the living standards of urban and 
rural people significantly improved, our cause has won extensive 
and wholehearted support from the people. China is now enjoying 
economic growth, political stability, nationality solidarity, 
and social progress. Under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, the whole 
nation, full of confidence, is marching further ahead along the 
path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The objective of China's economic structural reform is to 
establish the system of a socialist market economy. This system 
of a socialist market economy which we are going to establish 
will enable the market to play the role of a foundation for the 
disposition of resources under state macroregulation and 
control, and enable economic activities to follow the 
requirements of the law of value and accommodate any changes in 
the supply-demand pattern. To gradually realize the transition 
from the planned economy to the market economy, we make a point 
of giving play to the roles of both market and planning as two 
different means to our end. In other words, we will bring into 
full play the role of market mechanism on the one hand and, in 
the meantime, actively change the functions of the government in 
managing the economy and improve and strengthen the state 
macroregulation and control over the economy. The chief method 
is to use economic policies, economic legislation, planning 
orientation, and necessary administrative control to guide the 
national economy to develop in a healthy direction. The system 
of a socialist market economy is also integrated with the basic 
system of socialism. In terms of the structure of ownership, we 
adhere to the principle of letting public ownership dominate and 
allowing the common development of diversified economic sectors; 
and in terms of a distribution system, we rely primarily on the 
system of distribution according to work, encouraging some 
people in some areas to get rich first and seeking to reach the 
goal of common prosperity through a gradual process. Practice 
has proved that developing socialist market economy was a 
correct choice, compatible with China's realities. 
  The economic structural reform and the political structural 
reform in China are conducted simultaneously and in conjunction 
with each other. In the course of the gradual establishment of 
the system of a socialist market economy, we set great store by 
the need to strengthen the building of a socialist democracy and 
legal system and strengthening the building of spiritual 
civilization. While we attach importance to absorbing and 
drawing upon other countries' advanced science and technology, 
experience in management, and excellent cultural achievements, 
we also pay close attention to rejecting decadent things. An 
important sign of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is to attach importance to the building of 
spiritual civilization while attaching importance to the 
building of material civilization. In the course of building 
spiritual civilization, we pay special attention to inheriting 
our fine national traditions and culture. 
  In the process of reform in China, we pay special attention 
to handling the relationship among reform, development, and 
stability. Economic construction is the focal point of all our 
work; reform and opening up are the motive powers of 
development; and maintaining social stability is an 
indispensable condition for developing the economy and 
conducting reform smoothly. We regard the establishment of the 
socialist market economy as a long process of development. If 
counted from 1979, China's reform has been going on for over 15 
years. According to our present plan, we will preliminarily set 
up a new economic system in the 1990's and, on the basis of this 
and making a further effort for about 20 years, move on to 
forming a more mature and established system in various fields. 
At present, we are moving toward this goal step by step on the 
basis of continuously summing up our experience gained through 
practice. We are full of confidence in China's future. 
  The essential aim of China developing its economy is to 
upgrade the whole people's living standards in terms of material 
and culture. China is still a developing country and its 
people's livelihood is still below the level of affluence. It 
will take decades of arduous work for China to catch up with the 
living standards of medium-developed countries in the world. 
China's construction requires not only a domestic environment 
of long-term stability, but also a peaceful international 
environment of long- term stability, in particular, a good 
surrounding environment. Today, mankind is moving toward a new 
century. For the bright future of China and the world at large, 
China will make every effort to manage its own affairs well; 
unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace; 
develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, 
especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence; and strive to make due 
contributions to peace, stability, and development in Asia and 
the world. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition 
party leaders today formally chose Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
as candidate to succeed out-going Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation two weeks ago. 
  At a meeting this afternoon, the leaders endorsed a policy 
platform for a new cabinet and named Hata as the coalition's 
joint candidate for the prime ministerial election in both 
houses of the Diet (parliament) that is expected to meet next 
Monday, coalition officials said. 
  Hata, 58, concurrently the deputy prime minister in the 
Hosokawa cabinet, is expected to win the premiership election 
because of the coalition's majority status in the Diet. 
  Soon after the election, Hata, who is the leader of 
Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) which is the coalition's core party, is 
expected to launch his new administration, the officials said. 
  The endorsement of Hata came after secretaries general of 
the 
ruling parties struck a deal early today on two key issues -- 
tax system reform and Japan's response to the suspected nuclear 
development program on the Korean peninsula. 
  The agreement put an end to two weeks of feud, first over 
the 
procedures for picking Hosokawa's successor and then over the 
above- mentioned two issues, which are crucial to keeping the 
nine-month-old alliance intact.

"Guangdong Destroys Pirated Audio, Video Products"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Guangdong has 
achieved preliminary success in joint operations against pirated 
audio and video products. This morning, the Guangzhou City 
Copyright Bureau, together with the public security department, 
the industry and commerce department, the radio and television 
department, the culture department, and the city administration 
publicly destroyed all seized pirated audio and video products. 
  According to incomplete statistics, as of 1200 on 20 April, 
1,657 stalls and shops had been inspected across the province, 
and over 140,000 counterfeit compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, 
and more than 85,000 audio and video tapes had been seized. 
Operations were particularly large in scale in such key areas 
as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In Guangzhou's [as 
published] case , it launched "Implement the Copyright Rights 
Law and Protect Intellectual Property Rights Week" across the 
province on 19 April. 
  This morning, industry and commerce, culture, and 
broadcasting departments gathered together at a work site at the 
Guangzhou Yuexiu Hotel with pirated audio and video products 
seized from markets in raids which took place from 19 to 20 
April, and an 11-tonne road roller repeatedly crushed the goods 
into pieces. Guangzhou Vice Mayor Guo Xiangyang, Vice Secretary 
General Li Zhiyuan, and others were present at the site. It is 
said that in the first day of operations on 19 April, Guangzhou 
sent a total of 921 personnel on several occasions, inspected 
407 stalls and shops selling audio and video products, and 
seized a total of 63,248 fake compact discs, laser discs, and 
tapes. Today's destruction will have a deterrent effect on 
piracy. 
  At present, all areas across Guangdong are continuing the 
crack down in light of their actual situations. Relevant 
quarters in the province are formulating a series of measures to 
strengthen the regular management of the processing, 
reproduction, wholesaling, and retailing of audio and video 
products. It is learned that after regulating the province's 16 
laser disc [including compact disc] producing businesses, 
Guangdong will place them under the management of the 
information and publication departments. The Provincial 
Copyright Bureau has already formulated Copyright Verification 
and Registration Regulations for the reproduction of compact 
discs. In the future, "two licenses" will be required for the 
wholesaling and sale of audio and video products, namely, no one 
can get a business license unless one has already obtained a 
business approval license from the relevant department. Customs 
will also step up antismuggling operations against audio and 
video products and stop the flow of illegal foreign publications 
into the country.

  [Excerpts] As a deputy to the municipal people's congress 
elected by Xuanwu District, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, joined the group discussion held by 
the Xuanwu District delegation on the government work report on 
the afternoon 9 April. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong listened attentively to the speeches given by 
the 
deputies and took notes. He said: The deputies have given many 
good opinions and suggestions. To promote Beijing's work, the 
wisdom and concerted efforts of the deputies and the people of 
Beijing are indispensable. This year, Beijing should put 
stability in the first place. Stability is the prerequisite. We 
should resolutely safeguard the political and social stability 
of the capital. Without a stable and united situation, reform 
cannot be conducted, nor can development be achieved. Speaking 
on the medical system, Chen Xitong said: The reform of the 
medical system should be coordinated with the endeavor to 
accelerate establishment of the social security system. The 
principle of the reform is to actively protect people's health 
and change the past practice of eating form the common big pot 
and letting the state take care of everything into the practice 
that burdens are shared by various fields of society together. 
  Chen Xitong emphasized: We should earnestly address the 
specific problems in people's live, ensure the steady 
improvement of their living standard, and, in particular, 
improve the conditions of difficult plants, difficult shops, 
difficult schools, difficult households, and poverty-stricken 
households in mountainous areas. We should help them reduce 
deficits and increase profits. Speaking on improvement of 
literary and art organizations, Chen Xitong said: Municipal 
leaders should go deep into literary and art organizations to 
conduct investigation and study, find out problems, and work out 
ways to address them. Literary and art organizations should, on 
the one hand, conduct reform and, on the other, continuously 
improve their artistic quality and create the literary and art 
works that are loved by the masses so that the literary and art 
stages of the capital can be made more flourish.

  [Text] As indicated by the "decision of the CPC Central 
Committee on some issues concerning the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure adopted by the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, establishing a modern 
enterprise system is a necessary requisite for developing 
socialized mass production and the market economy, and it 
represents the orientation of reform of China's state-owned 
enterprises. This exposition is a strategic measure adopted by 
the CPC Central Committee in the time when the reform is 
entering the most difficult stage and when the microeconomic 
foundation for the socialist market economy is being remolded. 
This exposition has provided a completely new angle of view and 
train of thought for the deepening of the reform of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  The so-called modern enterprise system means a kind of 
enterprise system that is suitable for the demands of socialist 
mass production, reflects the requirement of the socialist 
market economic structure, and enables enterprises to truly 
become the legal entities and the main body of market 
competition commensurate with the world and domestic markets. 
The modern enterprise system is a completely new system that 
standardizes the series of basic relations, such as the 
relations of enterprises with investors, with creditors, with 
the government, with the market, with other enterprises, with 
consumers, and with staff and workers, and that touches upon the 
external environment and the internal mechanism. Based on 
China's existing state-owned enterprises, not only are there no 
ready-made modes to follow but also there are many practical 
difficulties in establishing a modern enterprise system with 
Chinese characteristics and that is geared to the international 
economy. For this reason, when promoting the practice of this 
great reform, the vast numbers of theoretical and practical 
workers are all the more required to further emancipate the mind 
and make bold explorations and brave practice for this system in 
a bid to perfect it gradually. 
<H5>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System Is An Objective </H5>
Demand for Building the Socialist Market Economic Structure 
  As early as at the initial stage of reform, some theoretical 
workers set forth the "theory of regarding enterprises as the 
foundation" and the theses that enterprises should become 
producers of commodities, enterprises should have their 
independent economic benefits, and enterprises should assume 
sole responsibility for their own profits or losses. In the 
middle of the 1980's, some comrades set forth the theory of 
separating ownership from management right, thus pushing forward 
enterprise reform in both theory and practice. After entering 
the 1990's, changing enterprises' operational mechanism with 
focus on delegating autonomy to enterprises has become the main 
orientation of endeavor of enterprise reform. These 
explorations and practices have played a tremendous role in 
promoting the initiation of China's enterprise reform and the 
formation of the idea of urban reform with focus on invigorating 
enterprises. This kind of new economic structure has decided 
that reform measures must change from the readjustment of a 
policy nature to the innovation of systems and has also decided 
that China must establish a modern enterprise system suitable 
for the demand of establishing a socialist mass production and 
the market economy. 
  The socialist market economic structure is different from 
the 
traditional planned economic structure. Its major 
characteristic is to enable the market to play a fundamental 
role in the distribution of resources. And the key to 
exploiting the role of the market mechanism lies in the endeavor 
of making state-owned enterprises to truly become the main body 
of market competition. According to this requirement, new trails 
must be blazed in the modern enterprise system. The specific 
pattern of the enterprise reform must serve this general goal. 
It is necessary to set up a modern enterprise system which 
meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the 
property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of 
enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and 
enterprise management are separated, and scientific management 
is established. In division of functions and duties between 
governments and enterprises under this new system, the state, as 
an investor, enjoys the right to take part in strategic 
decisions and choice of managers and the right of dividend but 
will not directly interfere in enterprises' specific management 
activities any longer. In regard to the change of the enterprise 
managerial mechanism, enterprises are able to fully embody their 
capabilities and forms of behaviors under the market economic 
system and enter the markets in the capacity of legal persons. 
That is, the production and management orientation depends on 
the price mechanism and the market supply. The dynamics of 
competition depends on the amounts of cost, the quality, and the 
service quality. Self-development depends on the returns on 
investment, the results of management, and the management level. 
By standardizing the behaviors of managers, we can resolve the 
long-standing problems that state-owned enterprises have not 
clearly identified the responsibilities of plant directors 
(managers) and to whom they should be held responsible to, that 
responsibilities are divorced from rights, and that enterprises 
have myopic behaviors. With clear property right 
responsibilities and scientific organizational management 
organizations, enterprises will form powerful self-restriction 
mechanisms. In coordinating with the international practice, 
state-owned enterprises should operate according to the 
standards for companies. In this way, the enterprises will find 
it convenient to enter the international market; smoothly 
conduct the international trade, investment, and 
capital-circulating activities; and enhance their 
competitiveness on the international market. All these are 
specific targets for reforming the macroeconomic regulation and 
control and changing the enterprise managerial mechanisms that 
we have made persistent efforts to pursue for several years. 
<H5>  To Set Up a Modern Enterprise System, We Should Resolve the </H5>
Deep-Layered Contradictions and Problems in Enterprises' 
Development 
  Since the implementation of the reform policy, we have 
successively adopted major reform steps, such as expanding 
rights, conceding profits, replacing profits by taxes, carrying 
out the contract system, and changing the enterprise managerial 
mechanisms, basically with the focus on expanding rights, 
conceding profits, and giving a stimulus by giving profits in 
order to enhance enterprises' vitality and resolve enterprises' 
development problems. Of course, by no means does it mean that 
it is not necessary to readjust the relations of interests among 
the state, the enterprises, and the staff and workers. Under 
the highly centralized planned economic system, the state 
carried out a financial policy on unified revenues and unified 
expenditures, and enterprises had no independent economic 
interests and had no differences between good and bad 
performances. Thus, the enthusiasm of both staff and workers 
and enterprises was dampened. Enterprises will not be able to 
create internal economic motivation if the relations of 
interests among the state, the enterprises, and the staff and 
workers are not readjusted. The problem is that the change of 
mechanisms must be the prerequisite for readjusting the 
relations of interests. If the relations of interests are 
simply readjusted not in coordination with the change of 
mechanisms, the space for "talks on interests" will be left for 
enterprises. As of now, these reform measures of state-owned 
enterprises have not yet fundamentally got to the reform of the 
traditional enterprise systems under the planned economic 
system, but an orbit of reforming the comparatively simple 
shallow-layered enterprise managerial form emerges. The problems 
of not separating government functions from enterprise 
management and of enterprises having no clear property rights, 
no decision-making powers, and no perfect self-restriction 
mechanisms, by which the state-owned enterprises have been 
puzzled for a long period of time, have not fundamentally been 
solved so that enterprises are still noticeably short of 
vitality, have difficulties in standardizing their activities, 
and do not register ideal economic results. In short, the 
microeconomic foundation conforming to the market economic 
system has not really been established. To this end, the 
central authorities pointed out that determination should be 
made to blaze new trails in enterprise mechanisms, to resolve 
the deep-layered contradictions and problems affecting and 
restricting the development of enterprises, and to find out from 
the microeconomic layers an enterprise system that has the 
strongest competitiveness and efficiency and suits the needs of 
the market economic system. It is what we have said that the 
setup of the modern enterprise system is the fundamental task 
for enterprise reform. 
  Viewing the actual conditions of Heilongjiang Province, we 
know that fulfilling this task is of urgent and realistic 
significance. Although great changes have taken place in the 
overall appearances of the state-owned enterprises in our 
province through the reform over the past 10 years or so, we 
must calmly notice that the current situation of state-owned 
enterprises is worrisome. As a typical representative of the 
traditional planned economic system, our province objectively 
has more prominent contradictions and difficulties than any 
other provinces. Viewing the state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises, we know that the natural resource 
distributions forms and established patterns, that took shape 
for a long period of time under the planned economic system, 
have brought about considerably great difficulties to the 
structural readjustment of state-owned enterprises and that with 
the influence by the habitual functions of the traditional 
economic management system, enterprises are still engaged in the 
nonmarket economic activities. Large- and medium-sized 
enterprises' deficits, debts payable, burdens to support the 
running of social undertakings, development speed, and economic 
results are not satisfactory. Viewing the small- and 
medium-sized enterprises subordinate to the counties, we know 
that after the 1993 Huachuan meeting, some counties (cities) 
boldly reformed the property right system so that the continuous 
declines in the production of county-run industrial enterprises 
starting from 1991 was halted. However, the problems, including 
the declines in production, more deficits, and insufficient 
reserve strength, are still extremely serious. Viewing the 
social environment, we know that the reform of the macroeconomic 
system, the change of the government functions, and the reform 
in the development of the market system and the social security 
system prominently cannot keep abreast of the fast progress of 
marketization in the realistic economic activities. This 
greatly restricts the pace of enterprise reform and development. 
To set up a modern enterprise system, enterprises should blaze 
new trails in the systems both internally and externally. By 
readjusting and blazing new trails in the property right system, 
the enterprise organizational form, the government functions for 
macroeconomic control, and other serialized systems, we should 
resolve the deep-layered contradictions and problems affecting 
the development of enterprises. This is a starting point as 
well as an ending point that must constantly be persisted in the 
course of setting up the modern enterprise system. If we are 
divorced from this point, the setup of the modern enterprise 
system will become meaningless. So long as we constantly 
persist in this point, the state-owned economy with state-owned 
large- and medium-sized enterprises as its main body will 
certainly be able to extricate itself from the strained 
circumstances and to step toward the new stage. 
<H5>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System Requires the </H5>
Endeavor of Building a Contingent of Mature and Outstanding 
Entrepreneurs 
  The process of establishing a modern enterprise system is 
the 
process of gradually making enterprises the main body of market 
competition. In this process, enterprises must compete with one 
another in an even sharper manner. Competition between 
enterprises can be manifested as the commodities and service of 
enterprises first, as technology and management of enterprises 
second, and as the skills of managers and the quality of workers 
third. Practice has proven that under the same condition and 
environment, all the enterprises that have taken the lead in 
embarking on the fast lane of the economy, have anticipated 
others in reform and development, and has yielded marked 
economic returns can ascribe their success to their excellent 
managers. The real strength and momentum of enterprises lies in 
professionals, the managerial professionals of high level in 
particular. Training a group of managers who are highly 
professionalized and who meet the demand of the market economy 
constitutes an important condition for successfully establishing 
a modern enterprise system as well as a cardinal guarantee for 
establishing the socialist market economic structure. In this 
sense, without a contingent of mature and outstanding 
entrepreneurs under the market economy, the socialist market 
economic structure will not come to success. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system touches upon 
many fields. As a complete set of systems, the modern 
enterprise system is extremely rich in contents, many of which 
are the knowledge we have not commanded and understood yet. 
When viewed from the current situation, many leading cadres of 
enterprises were managers under the planned economic structure 
and thus they are still accustomed to the ideas and habits of 
the planned economy to a certain extent. These cadres lag far 
behind the demands of new circumstances and new structures and 
face extremely arduous task of study in renewal of ideas, in the 
structure of knowledge, in the method of management, and in 
practical skills. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels and 
all the comrades on the enterprise circles should first 
strengthen the study to improve themselves. All pertinent 
departments should adapt themselves to the demand of reform and 
development by positively creating conditions for training 
economic cadres and leading cadres of enterprises in an effort 
to enable these cadres to grasp and understand the guidelines of 
the "decision" as quickly as possible and to grasp the new 
circumstances and new contents of transforming the operating 
mechanism of enterprises, establishing a modern enterprise 
system, and many other major reform measures and in an effort to 
guide enterprises to keep abreast of the new reformed systems as 
quickly as possible. Managers of enterprises in the province 
have made tremendous contributions to developing the economy and 
invigorating Heilongjiang and have, in particular, experienced a 
lot of hardships under the current situation of having 
relatively more difficulties. Generally viewing, the quality of 
the ranks of entrepreneurs in the province is good. Of course, 
we should also catch sight of shortcomings. Excellent 
enterprise managers cannot be brought up without market 
competition. For this reason, we should proceed from the 
overall situation of our province's economic development and 
rapidly impose an external competition pressure and an internal 
profit-making motivation on entrepreneurs; cultivate a strong 
sense of mission of caring for the enterprise property of all 
legal entities, including state-owned assets; cultivate a 
pioneering spirit of participating in competition on one's 
initiative, reform and improve the enterprise leadership system 
and organizational management system, and create conditions for 
cultivating a great number of outstanding entrepreneurs in the 
course of market competition. 
<H5>  To Build a Modern Enterprise System, Pilot Enterprises </H5>
Should Shoulder the Mission of Exploring Ways To Develop and To 
Accumulate Experience 
  The establishment of the modern enterprise system involves 
not only enterprises in various sectors but also many issues 
concerning the economic system and political system. 
Therefore, the "decision" pointed out that since the 
"establishment of the modern enterprise system is an arduous and 
complicated task, we must accumulate experiences and create 
conditions to gradually push it forward." The State Council 
has designated 100 enterprises to experiment with this system, 
and explore the priorities and difficulties in establishing the 
modern enterprise system through conducting experiments in 
selected enterprises. In line with the demand of deepening 
enterprise reform, the provincial authorities have designated 50 
provincial-level enterprises to experiment with the modern 
enterprise system. These experimental enterprises are our 
province's leaders in establishing the modern enterprise system 
as well as the experimental fields, which will become the 
pioneers in establishing this system. They have to undertake 
very arduous tasks, and have to get ready for paying a price of 
varying degrees, because this reform is different from the 
previous policy adjustment. It is a new system carried out 
under the situation in which the current enterprise internal and 
external environments have not yet been improved. At present, 
we should attach importance to boldly exploring ways to improve 
the enterprise property relations, establish the enterprise 
property system, separate government responsibility from that of 
enterprises, establish diversified enterprise organizational 
forms that suits the level of productive forces, establish and 
improve scientific enterprise internal management system, and 
implement new financial accounting system, gradually accumulate 
experience in the course of experiments, and lay a good 
foundation for comprehensively promoting the modern enterprise 
system in other enterprises. 
  The establishment of the modern enterprise system indicates 
that the state-owned enterprises will finally free themselves 
from the shackle of the traditional planned economy. At 
present, it is the favorable opportunity for us to extricate 
ourselves from a difficult position and to tackle the most 
difficult aspect in reform. We have courage and determination 
to overcome all sorts of difficulties facing us. However, the 
establishment of the modern enterprise system, which is one of 
the fundamental systems created in the process of moving towards 
the socialist market economy, needs a series of supporting 
reforms. To establish this new system, we must have a 
scientific and practical spirit and guard against the old 
mistakes of easily rushing headlong into mass action, breaking 
up in a hubbub and formalism which we often practiced in the 
past. Meanwhile, we should conduct a series of related 
supporting reforms in changing government functions, cultivating 
the market system, and building the social security system. 
Otherwise, it will be impossible for us to make a great batch 
of state-owned enterprises eliminate difficulties in face of the 
market economy. This is a choice which we cannot avoid in the 
course of establishing the modern enterprise system.

<F P=106> ["Investigations Intensifying With Three Suspects in Qiandao </F>
Lake Incident"--XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Zhejiang 
provincial procuratorate Tuesday [19 April] approved the arrest 
of three suspects involved in the March 31 robbery and murder of 
32 Taiwan and mainland tourists and the subsequent torching of 
their tour boat on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province, and 
further investigations are intensifying, according to the 
provincial public security bureau here today. 
  The three suspects are Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun. 
  According to sources at the bureau, Wu Lihong is from 
Kanjiao 
village of Tongziwu Township, Chunan County in Zhejiang; Yu 
Aijun is a resident of Xinanjiang Town, Jiande City; and Hu 
Zhihan is from Qiandaohu Town of Chunan County. 
  The three were friends and they shared the same idea of 
seeking fortune but not wishing to put in honest labor. 
  Wu Lihong first conceived of robbing tourists on Qiandao 
Lake. When he talked with Hu and Yu about his scheme, he 
immediately got approval from them. And the three men jointly 
hatched a plot on the time, place and means for the robbery, 
according to the three men's confessions. 
  In the early evening of March 31, the three took their motor 
boat and sailed into waters at Huangniling, where there would be 
few boats and ships at nightfall. 
  At that time, two tourist boats, Qiandaohu No.6 and 
Huangshan 
No.3, passed through the waters. The three did not dare to 
launch their scheme right then, for it was still dusk and there 
were a few other boats passing by. 
  When the tourist boat named "Hairui" approached the area, it 
was dark and raining, and there was no other boat in the 
vicinity. The three intercepted it. 
  As soon as they boarded the "Hairui", they threatened the 
crew with hunting guns and an ax, forcing them to enter the 
lower cabin of the boat. They then asked all passengers to hand 
over their cameras, jewelry, watches and money, and forced them 
to move into the cabin, saying that they would not harm their 
life. 
  After the robbery, the three attempted unsuccessfully to 
sink 
the boat by opening the anti-fire valve. They then set fire to 
the boat to kill the tourists and the crew and fled. 
  Two hours later when the "Hairui" did not show up, the local 
department concerned immediately sent out speed boats to look 
for it. Because of a heavy fog, they were able to find the boat 
only at eight the next morning. 
  They immediately reported to the local government which 
organized people and boats to explore the area as no man was 
found on the burning boat. 
  Firemen extinguished the flames and towed the boat to shore, 
where they found that all tourists, guides and the crew had died 
in the lower cabin. 
  After the incident, the Central Committee of the Chinese 
Communist Party and the State Council ordered the Zhejiang 
provincial authorities to deal promptly with the case and 
uncover the facts of the incident. 
  The Zhejiang provincial government and Hangzhou City 
government formed a leading group to take charge of the matter 
under the guidance of the department concerned under the State 
Council. They took measures to help relatives of the Taiwan 
victims in the incident identify the remains and personal 
articles and arrange mourning according to Taiwan customs. 
Proper arrangements were also made with regard to the crew and 
tourist guides who died in the incident. 
  Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province 
assigned more than 300 policemen to investigate the case. 
  After a 17-day investigation, they apprehended the three 
suspects. In their search of the three men's houses, the police 
retrieved 5,250 U.S. dollars, 154,620 yuan (Taiwan currency), 
seven cameras, eight rings, one jade bracelet and two watches. 
  They also tracked down instruments used to commit the crime, 
such as the motor boat, hunting guns and an oil pail. 
  Sources said that the property and money will be returned to 
the relatives of the deceased.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Shih Lei (4258 4320) from </F>
Tangshan: "Pro-Democracy Activist Wang Jiaqi Flees to Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Wang Jiaqi [3769 1367 3825], a prominent mainland 
pro-democracy activist, escaped to Hong Kong on 15 April; he is 
now being provided with daily necessities by a nongovernmental 
organization in Hong Kong and is waiting for a trip to some 
Western country to seek political asylum. The senior level of 
the CPC is very shocked and has expressed concern about the 
development of the incident. 
  According to an authoritative informed source, Wang Jiaqi 
escaped while being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan City 
Public Security Bureau. When they arrived in Tangshan, Wang 
Jiaqi escaped from the control of the public security personnel 
and, thereafter, was assisted by another person to flee safely 
to Hong Kong. 
  According to sources, this pro-democracy activist, who has a 
"special status," was a high official in Tangshan City Public 
Security Bureau's Legal System Office. Because he had worked 
for 11 years in the public security bureau and was involved in a 
wide range of work, he had the opportunity to examine files 
which were not known to outsiders. Therefore, the authorities 
are very nervous about Wang Jiaqi's sudden escape and the 
possible leak of internal files. Beijing's Public Security 
Ministry has already issued notices to various localities, 
demanding that they strengthen precautions and prevent similar 
incidents from happening. Several days ago, Tangshan City 
Public Security Bureau received a notice from the senior level 
demanding a thorough investigation into the cause of the 
incident. According to information, the relevant personnel will 
face disciplinary action and will lose their jobs. 
  Information has it that Wang Jiaqi, 34, was admitted to the 
graduate program at Beijing University Department of Law after 
the 4 June incident. Thereafter, he and some dissident 
intellectuals, such as Yuan Hongbing, were involved in 
pro-democracy organizations. During the period of the "two 
meetings" on the mainland, Wang Jiaqi, Yuan Hongbing, and Zhou 
Guoqiang initiated an underground labor organization called the 
"Labor Union." Because the organization involved more than 100 
people, the authorities viewed it as "illegal" and banned it, 
and several dozen of the participants, including the 
abovementioned three persons, were summoned by the authorities. 
Zhou Guoqiang, the lawyer representing Han Dongfang, was also 
arrested by mainland public security personnel after a secret 
"seven-day tour" of Hong Kong. 
  According to information, Wang Jiaqi was the lawyer 
representing Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to Jiaojiang City People's 
Congress in Zhejiang Province, in a case of conflict between the 
people and the police in Beijing last September, a case which 
drew widespread attention in the municipality. On 19 April, the 
Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth Jiaojiang 
City People's Congress in Zhejiang decided that the relevant 
department should educate Yan Zhengxue through labor. Wang 
Jiaqi, who is now overseas, does not have the opportunity to 
defend Yan. 
  Szeto Wah of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the 
Democratic Movement in China, said yesterday that as regards 
Wang Jiaqi's arrival in Hong Kong, he was not aware of his 
whereabouts.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "The Chinese </F>
Government Shows Concern for the Stability of the Ranks of Hong 
Kong Civil Servants"] 
  [Text] Dear brother: 
  At its sixth meeting held in Beijing recently, the political 
affairs sub-group of the Hong Kong Preliminary Working Committee 
[PWC] discussed the issue of stabilizing the ranks of Hong Kong 
civil servants. The meeting was held in a very lively 
atmosphere. Both mainland and Hong Kong members unanimously 
praised Hong Kong civil servants' contributions to society. 
  However, with the approach of 1 July 1997, the stability and 
morale of the ranks of Hong Kong civil servants have become an 
issue of general concern. At the meeting, PWC members answered 
one by one the questions Hong Kong civil servants are concerned 
and worried about, from ruling out the possibility of "a 
complete turnover" and the possibility of "squaring accounts" 
with Hong Kong civil servants after 1997, to guaranteeing that 
the pay, allowances, fringe benefits, and service conditions of 
civil servants after 1997 will not be lower than the original 
standards. Based on the law, their every sentence is fair and 
reasonable. For this reason, I am sure that, after reading the 
written replies of the political affairs sub-group of the PWC, 
the civil servants, who have various misgivings due to a lack of 
understanding of Chinese Government policy toward Hong Kong 
civil servants and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, 
will remove their doubts and strengthen their resolve to stay in 
Hong Kong to serve the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
[SAR] Government and the people of Hong Kong beyond 1997. 
  As far as I know, the Chinese Government has always attached 
importance to the stability of the ranks of Hong Kong civil 
servants and regards this as an important aspect of ensuring a 
stable transition for Hong Kong. Take as an example the 
retention of expatriate civil servants. Taking into account the 
characteristics of Hong Kong as an international metropolis and 
the present composition of civil servants, not only will the 
Chinese Government not reject expatriate civil servants but, on 
the contrary, adopt an attitude of enthusiastic welcome. 
According to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, all 
expatriate civil servants who formerly worked in various 
departments of the Hong Kong Government will be retained after 
1997 and, with the exception of a small number of posts 
equivalent to those held by directorate-level officials, posts 
can be taken up by people of foreign nationalities. British and 
other foreign citizens can also be employed as advisers to 
various government departments. This represents a striking 
contrast to the British policy of discriminating against local 
Chinese during its colonial rule in Hong Kong over the past 100 
years and more. As another example, some years ago, for fear 
that they would not be able to get full pension after 1997, some 
civil servants called for setting up a pension fund. The Basic 
Law has provided a legal guarantee for Hong Kong civil servants 
to receive a pension after 1997, stipulating that the Hong Kong 
SAR shall pay the pension, remuneration, allowances, and fringe 
benefits to them or their family members at a level not lower 
than the original standard and, judging from the current 
financial situation and economic prospects in Hong Kong, there 
should not be any problems in paying the civil servants' 
pension. However, the Chinese Government still has expressed 
understanding of and support for the civil servants' call to set 
up a pension fund. It has urged the British side through the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group to adopt positive and effective 
measures to this end. This is truly a case of "thinking and 
sharing the concerns of civil servants." 
  You may have heard about the "Beijing course" held at 
Qinghua 
University for Hong Kong civil servants. Set up last July at 
the request of the Hong Kong Government, the course has been 
successfully run twice, each time attended by about 20 people. 
Many more classes will reportedly be held this year. The civil 
servants attending the course not only made considerable 
progress in their practical capability to speak Mandarin and 
write Chinese but, through on-the-spot inspection in different 
provinces and cities, also had a better understanding of the 
institutional setup, operations, and relevant systems of the 
Chinese Government, China's national conditions, the life of the 
people on the mainland, and even the conditions and customs in 
various localities. The course has been run with the firm 
support and assistance of the relevant departments of the 
Chinese Government. Public media in Hong Kong praises the 
Chinese Government for doing a good, practical thing for the 
steady transition of Hong Kong civil servants in 1997 and for 
increasing their confidence. 
  Conversely, what sincerity has the British side shown and 
what has it done to maintain the stability of the ranks of Hong 
Kong civil servants and to make a stable transition? Almost 
simultaneously with the PWC political affairs sub-group 
discussion in Beijing on the question of civil servants, senior 
Hong Kong Government officials let on that the British Hong Kong 
Government had worked out a list of principal officials that 
would work beyond 1997 and hoped to consult with the Chinese 
side. The true intention of this move is quite obvious. 
According to the provisions of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, the principal officials of the 
Hong Kong SAR Government are to be nominated by the chief 
executive of the Hong Kong SAR and submitted to the central 
people's government for appointments. How can the British Hong 
Kong Government make arrangements for a group of people and then 
bargain with the Chinese side for them? 
  However, I believe that the great majority of civil servants 
in Hong Kong will work contentedly at their posts and attend to 
their own duties after 1997 as they do today. The overall image 
of high quality and efficiency that so distinguishes Hong Kong 
civil servants is sure to be continuously preserved. 
  Yours, 
  [Signed] Bao Xin

  [Text] Customs officers are set to pose as computer game 
customers to crack a completely new type of intellectual 
property crime costing manufacturers millions of dollars a year. 
New technology is being used in the territory to keep one step 
ahead of law enforcers battling to keep a lid on the sale of 
counterfeit computer games and the illegal copying of 
programmes. The latest scam involves copying more than 100 game 
programmes on to a compact disc which can in turn be copied 
individually on to customers' hard disks for as little as $10 a 
game. Original games can cost up to $500 each. 
  Previously, Customs officers raiding game stores could 
easily 
identify whether copying was taking place because large numbers 
of hard disks containing the programme recordings were stored 
there. But the new CD ROM discs, the same size as music CDs, 
contain hundreds of times as much information as the older 
discs. One CD ROM with hundreds of games can easily be 
concealed during a customs raid. 
  Officers from the Customs' Intellectual Property 
Investigation Bureau yesterday seized for the first time 
equipment they suspected could record game programmes on to CD 
ROMs. They raided a house in Kwun Tong and arrested two men 
leaving the premises at 3.30 pm. Officers subsequently searched 
two other homes and a private car and seized 1,128 counterfeit 
game cartridges, computer chips, and a large quantity of copy 
packaging valued in total at $500,000. But the bureau's deputy 
head, Simon Wong Shinming, said the most significant part of the 
haul was the confirmation that the counterfeiters had switched 
tactics. 
  "We have been conducting raids on shops and had been able to 
seize equipment being used for copying together with the hard 
disks with the recordings on them. But recently we have not 
been finding any hard disks. We couldn't understand why so we 
switched our attention to the distributors." 
  Intelligence information led to yesterday's raid on the 
distributors of CD ROMs and revealed the new tactics being used. 
Mr Wong said his officers would now consider reviewing their 
strategy. "We are likely to be focusing on the distributor 
level or posing as customers in order to be able to hit them at 
the right time," he said. 
  Russell Yeh, director of KPS Video Express, the largest 
distributor of home entertainment software in Hong Kong, said he 
estimated the industry was losing up to $3 million a month from 
counterfeiting. "We need Customs to keep hitting 
(counterfeiters). We know of shops that are selling copy 
cartridges without even attempting to make them look like the 
real thing. Their quality is not as good and we believe there 
are a lot of people that would rather pay more and get the 
original."

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123) and TIANJIN </F>
RIBAO reporter Wang Hong (3769 1347)] 
  [Text] Tianjin, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor, 
pointed out during his inspection of the preparatory work for 
the 43d world table tennis championship in Tianjin: To host 
well the 43d world table tennis championship is the work of the 
whole country, not just the work of Tianjin. The entire society 
should be concerned about and support it and make it show 
Chinese characteristics, world standards, and the Chinese 
people's sports style of the 1990's. 
  Li Tieying inspected the Tianjin stadium under construction 
on 31 March. He was accompanied during the inspection by Xu 
Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Wu 
Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports 
Commission; and Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin Municipality. 
They held an on-the-spot business meeting in a simple work shed 
on the construction site and listened to a briefing of Tianjin 
on the preparatory work for the 43d world table tennis 
championship. 
  Li Tieying said: China successfully hosted the 26th world 
table tennis championship in 1961. After 34 years, Tianjin 
Municipality will host the 43d world table tennis championship. 
We must carefully plan, scientifically organize and 
meticulously direct such a major world competition. We must 
make the championship a grand, lively and spectacular event, as 
well as a complete success. Its success will be of great 
significance to promoting China's sports, economic construction 
and building of the spiritual civilization, as well as to 
further enhancing our international image. The State Council 
will go all out to support Tianjin in hosting well the 43d world 
table tennis championship. All departments concerned, 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should 
coordinate all the activities like pieces in a chess game and 
contribute to the success of this major international 
competition. 
  Li Tieying emphasized: The 43d world table tennis 
championship will provide Tianjin a stage for performance, and 
the 9 million Tianjin people have a glorious and yet heavy 
responsibility for performing well on the stage. Tianjin 
Municipality should take it as an opportunity to make major 
progresses in comprehensive urban management, appearance of the 
city, public order, and spiritual civilization, to promote the 
city's reform, opening up, and modernization, to make itself 
more famous in the world, and push itself onto the world. 
  Li Tieying pointed out: In hosting large-scale sports and 
cultural activities, we should adhere to the principle of both 
striving for spectacle and complete success and practicing 
economy. We should advocate participation by all, free service, 
and voluntary work. We should form a contingent of volunteers 
for the world table tennis championship, integrate the 
preparatory work for the championship with the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization, and strive for success in both 
the sports competition and the spiritual civilization.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The authorities of 
five universities in Beijing have recently decided to cooperate 
in making use of their resources so as to improve education 
quality. 
  At a forum on cooperation between these five, Vice-Premier 
Li 
Lanqing said that the cooperation in running institutes of 
higher learning is an experiment in China's educational reforms. 
  He said it will promote the development of higher education. 
  The five universities are the University of International 
Business and Economics, Beijing Chemical Engineering Institute, 
Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, 
Beijing Garment College and China Institute of Banking. 
  The five institutions are administered by different 
ministries, but they are located close to one another. 
  They have decided to jointly hire teachers, share their 
libraries, computer labs and other laboratories. 
  The students at each are being encouraged to select some 
courses at the other four. 
  The five will also jointly undertake scientific research 
programs and run some enterprises.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Let the Bethune Spirit Reappear"] </F>
  [Text] After reading reports about Zhao Xuefang's deeds, 
who could not but be deeply touched by them? It is not at all 
going too far to call her a living Bethune because she vividly 
embodies Norman Bethune's spirit; neither is it going too far to 
call her a banner in medical circles because what the motherland 
demands and what the people look forward to are precisely good 
doctors like her. 
  As a communist party member, she has turned the lofty ideals 
she is pursuing and the aim of wholehearted service to the 
people into practical actions of giving quality service to 
patients. The relationship between a communist party member and 
the masses should be as completely harmonious as that between 
her and her patients. 
  As a doctor, she regards the work of healing the wounded and 
rescuing the dying as her duty. She constantly improves her 
skills; has an unremitting sense of responsibility in her work; 
treats her patients enthusiastically, patiently, and cordially; 
looks at all their angles; takes care of their every need; and 
tries by every possible means to relieve them of their pain. 
For this reason, she is highly trusted, loved, and held in high 
esteem by vast numbers of patients. 
  As a "daughter of the Taihang Shan," she never forgets the 
people's upbringing and kindness. She never forgets the 
difficulties caused by the shortage of doctors and medicines in 
the mountain areas and takes advantage of every opportunity to 
examine and treat the diseases of the women of the mountain 
areas. She has devoted her love to the masses of the people. 
  As a section head and secretary of the party branch in a 
hospital, she takes the lead in setting an example and leads her 
colleagues in working conscientiously and sternly resisting the 
corrosion of such unhealthy practices as money worship and 
egoism in medical circles. She has maintained the pure image of 
a people's doctor. 
  As a patient who suffers from two types of cancer, she 
thinks 
first of patients who suffer from lingering diseases and then of 
herself. Before undergoing an operation, she made only one 
request to the party organization: she should be allowed to 
first perform gynecological and obstetrics operations on 
patients who had been admitted to the hospital. After 
undergoing two operations, she tenaciously threw herself into 
her work again. What she thought about was how to make better 
use of her limited time to preserve the lives and health of more 
patients rather than how to preserve her own life. 
  In her medical practice of the past three decades and more, 
Zhao Xuefang's motto is to devote all her love to the people and 
not create a fuss. Day after day she works for ordinary peasant 
sisters without taking remuneration into consideration. Her 
spirit of absolute selflessness can be rated as a paragon for 
contemporary medical workers. We should take good care of good 
comrades like Zhao Xuefang who are respected by colleagues and 
held in high esteem by patients. This is the wish of the masses 
as well as the duty of leaders. 
  It should be admitted that, in the current process of 
replacing the old medical structure with the new, power and 
benefits have been readjusted and some people have lost their 
sense of righteousness at the sight of benefits and have sought 
private interest through medical practice. There are some in 
the medical ranks who are not concerned about the weal and woe 
of patients, are irresponsible, and give poor service. They 
have damaged the image of medical workers in the public's minds. 
This is a conspicuous issue that should be conscientiously 
tackled in medical and public health reform. 
  Holding the banner of Zhao Xuefang and learning from the 
Zhao 
Xuefang spirit is not only of practical significance to medical 
circle, but is also needed in the present era of reform. It is 
hoped that, like Zhao Xuefang, our medical workers will turn 
their true love for the public into the inflexible pursuit of 
undertakings, working industriously and wholeheartedly, offering 
quality services, and making positive contributions to promote 
the building of two civilizations on the public health front.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zou Jiahua is to pay an official visit to the United States from 
April 27 to May 8 at the invitation of the U.S. Government. 
  The purpose of the visit is to maintain the momentum of 
high-level exchanges between the two countries, to enhance 
mutual understanding and to facilitate the bilateral 
co-operation. 
  This was announced by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin here this afternoon at a weekly press conference. 
  Replying to a question, Wu said that since the official 
meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Seattle in the U.S. last November, 
the bilateral exchanges and contacts on various levels and in 
all fields have been on the increase. 
  During the visit, he said, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua will 
engage in extensive contacts with U.S. leaders, government 
officials, and industry and business personages, and would 
exchange views with them on Sino-U.S. ties, Sino-U.S. economic 
cooperation and trade and other issues of common concern, in 
order to promote the improvement and development of bilateral 
relations.

  [Text] After more than five months in detention, mainland 
journalist Gao Yu went on trial in Beijing yesterday for 
allegedly "leaking state secrets to foreigners." Chinese 
sources said such cases usually took one or two days for a 
verdict to be given. 
  Gao, 50, was detained in October as she prepared to leave to 
take up a fellowship at the Columbia University Journalism 
School in the United States. 
  Neither the Intermediate People's Court nor the Higher 
People's Court in Beijing could be contacted yesterday. Nor was 
there any notice on Gao's trial posted outside the court 
yesterday. Gao's husband, Zhao Yuankang, would not comment and 
it is thought he did not attend yesterday. 
  It is understood that Gao was accused of having obtained a 
copy of a speech, considered to be top secret, given by the 
president and military head, Jiang Zemin, early last year. 
  For a conviction involving such a document, she could face a 
jail term of 10 years or more, sources said. It is understood 
she might also be charged with leaking other confidential 
documents to jingwai [outside the borders] organisations -- a 
reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan, rather than overseas groups 
in general. 
  Gao had been a contributor to Hong Kong publications 
including the pro-China THE MIRROR monthly. However, its 
publisher, Xu Simin, has said he had no idea whether his 
magazine articles had led to her arrest. 
  Last month, Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang was convicted and 
jailed for 12 years for "spying and stealing state financial 
secrets".

  [Text] Xi Yang's heavy 12-year jail sentence was due to the 
personal intervention of the Chinese Communist Party general 
secretary and President, Jiang Zemin, according to reliable 
sources in Beijing and Hong Kong. 
  The Ministry of State Security had originally suggested that 
Xi's sentence be limited to a maximum of two years. Jiang 
overruled the proposal last month. The main reason for this, 
according to analysts in Beijing, was to maintain the current 
policy of tightening control over Hong Kong and foreign 
journalists in China. 
  Senior Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Beijing had 
expressed resentment over the relatively lenient treatment given 
to Leung Wai-man, the Hong Kong Express reporter who publicised 
a leaked advance copy of a speech by Jiang in 1992. 
  Yesterday, Hong Kong reporters announced they would 
selectively boycott Chinese press events launched or funded by 
the Beijing government until the end of next month. 
  Xi was convicted at a secret trial last month of stealing 
"state secrets" about internal policies on interest rates and 
gold. His appeal was rejected last Friday. Eastern Express can 
reveal the series of twists and turns Xi's case took since his 
detention last September. 
  Yu Pun-hoi, the chairman of the Ming Pao Group, explored a 
variety of channels to secure Xi's release. These included 
meetings with a senior Chinese leader, Bo Yibo, and the State 
Security Minister, Jia Chunwang. In early October, a deputy 
head of Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau told Ming Pao 
that Xi had made "mistakes" in covering news. There was no 
indication that he had committed a criminal offence at the time. 
  The official suggested MING PAO should do three things: Keep 
a low profile; reject any assistance from the British-Hong Kong 
Government, foreign countries, local political groups or media 
groups; and make an open apology to the Chinese Government. 
  Louis Cha, the former chairman of Ming Pao, was receiving 
similar advice at the same time from Zhou Nan, the director of 
the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) in Hong Kong. 
  Yu, the chairman, made a public apology over the case on 
October 10, 1993. Yu also sought assistance from Bo Yibo, the 
former vice-chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, through 
his personal connection with his son, Bo Xicheng. 
  The Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau, after its 
investigation, completed its initial report on Xi's case at the 
end of November. It concluded that Xi had made mistakes but 
also said that Xi was not connected to any "economic and 
political crime." That report led to a heated debate within the 
Ministry of State Security. One faction argued that Xi should 
be judged "in accordance with the law". 
  In the wake of Leung Waiman's case, this faction argued that 
Hong Kong journalists should not be granted any leniency and 
insisted that Xi undergo full legal proceedings so that "justice 
should be seen to be done." The State Security Ministry, faced 
with internal divisions and requests for leniency from several 
senior Chinese officials, came up with three proposals for 
settling the Xi case. 
  One was to give a strong warning to Xi and send him back to 
Hong Kong. 
  The second was to take Leung's case as a precedent and ban 
Xi 
from entering the mainland for three years. Leung was released 
and allowed to return to Hong Kong in 1992. 
  The third proposal was to hand Xi over to the judicial 
organs 
with the instruction that he be sentenced to two years in prison 
with eligibility for parole. 
  In December, the ministry submitted its report on the Xi 
investigation to Jiang Zemin. In the meantime, the message that 
Xi would be treated leniently had already been relayed to Ming 
Pao through XINHUA, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and 
the Ministry of State Security. But Jiang, after apparently 
sitting on the Xi file for three months, suddenly handed down an 
instruction last month that Xi's case should be treated severely.

<F P=106> [Report: "Jiang Zemin Orders Heavy Sentence for Xi Yang, </F>
Rejects Lenient Treatment Proposed by the Ministry of State 
Security"] 
  [Text] It is reportedly said that Jiang Zemin, state 
president of China, rejected three proposals from the Ministry 
of State Security on what sentence should be given to MING PAO 
reporter Xi Yang, and held that only by giving a heavy sentence 
of 12 years' imprisonment could Hong Kong and overseas reporters 
be effectively controlled while gathering news on the mainland. 
According to a report in EASTERN EXPRESS today, the three 
proposals on sentencing Xi made by the Ministry of State 
Security included: 1) giving a strong warning to Xi Yang and 
sending him back to Hong Kong; 2) taking KUAI PAO [EXPRESS] 
reporter Leung Wai-man's case as a precedent and banning Xi Yang 
from entering the mainland for three years; and 3) handing the 
case over to the Ministry of Justice for trial with the 
instruction that Xi should be "heavily sentenced" to two years 
in prison with eligibility for parole. 
  The Ministry of State Security's proposals were sent to 
Jiang 
Zemin for consideration, and Jiang is in charge of state 
security and the administration of justice in the Political 
Bureau. At the same time, it was disclosed to MING PAO through 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office that so long as MING PAO handled the case 
with a low profile and admitted their guilt, Xi Yang would be 
treated leniently. Yu Pun-hai, chairman of the MING PAO Group, 
once sought help from Bo Yibo and was told about the three 
proposals made by the Ministry of State Security. It is 
reportedly said that State Security Minister Jia Chunwang told 
Xu Simin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, in November last 
year that the Ministry of State Security would give lenient 
treatment to Xi Yang according to the laws of China. 
  However, Xi Yang's case took an abrupt turn in March this 
year. After the National People's Congress, Jiang Zemin handled 
the case personally, rejected the three proposals from the 
Ministry of State Security, and held that the punishment was not 
heavy enough. 
  In particular, Leung Wai-man of KUAI PAO, who published a 
leaked advance copy of the full text of a speech by Jiang Zemin 
in 1992, was only sent back to Hong Kong immediately and banned 
from entering the mainland for two years. The punishment was 
too light; therefore, it was decided to punish Xi Yang heavily 
to serve as a warning.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- The second national 
conference to commend collectives and individuals having 
distinguished themselves in promoting national unity and 
progress will take place in Beijing in September this year. 
Speaking at a news briefing today, Ismail Amat, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission, said the meeting, in addition to commending 
the collectives and individuals, will also sum up the brilliant 
successes and experiences achieved and gained in promoting 
national unity and progress under the new situation, and 
earnestly discuss ways and means to promote national unity and 
progress under the socialist market economic system. 
  It has been learned that, compared with the first meeting, 
the forthcoming second meeting will have many new features: 
First, it will be a sizable meeting in which advanced 
collectives and 1,200 advanced individuals will be commended. 
Second, the scope it covers will be extensive. Collectives and 
individuals to be commended will come from all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central

committees and organs affiliated to the party Central Committee 
and the State Council; units under the People's Liberation Army 
and the Armed Police Corps; people's groups; democratic parties, 
and federations of industry and commerce; and people of all 
nationalities in all circles and from all trades and 
professions. Third, it attaches importance to the broadness of 
representation. Those who will be invited to attend not only are 
representatives of minority representatives from all regions on 
the mainland, but also are representatives from Hong Kong and 
Macao. Fourth, it will underscore the spirit of the times. A 
large percentage of the representatives will be advanced 
collectives and individuals who have assisted and supported 
minority people and minority areas in their economic and 
cultural development or who have contributed to the development

  [Text] While carrying out an inspection tour of our 
province, Qiao Shi, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, stressed: We must 
be firm and unshakable in implementing the various CPC Central 
Committee measures for deepening reforms and soberly treat and 
solve specific problems arising in practical work. 
  Between 13 and 18 April, accompanied by provincial party 
Secretary Xie Shijie, provincial Governor Xiao Yang, Yang 
Xizong, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee, provincial party Deputy Secretary Song Baorui, and 
other comrades, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected work in Sichuan. He 
inspected medium and large state-owned enterprises and township 
and town enterprises, listening to work reports by the Sichuan 
Provincial CPC Committee and Chengdu City CPC Committee. 
  This is an important year for deepening reforms in our 
country. Qiao Shi paid close attention to the implementation of 
various measures for reforms and specific problems arising in 
practical work. He said: Since the last quarter of last year, 
more reform measures have been promulgated which carry greater 
weight. This has been an urgent demand of the situation and a 
demand for pushing forward our country's socialist 
modernizations. We must seize opportunities both at home and 
abroad which are favorable to our country's construction. Under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must conscientiously 
implement the spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to 
firmly and resolutely implement those reform measures which have 
been promulgated. We know that these reform measures have 
played an important role and that they have achieved initial 
results, receiving a favorable response both at home and abroad. 
Of course, to carry out extensive and profound reforms in a big 
country like ours, we are liable to encounter some problems. In 
the face of them, we must be cool-headed and calm. If those 
problems can be solved earlier, we must firmly grasp our work to 
solve them as early as possible. If some problems cannot be 
solved for the time being, we must actively create conditions to 
solve them gradually. 
  Qiao Shi pointed out: In the course of implementing the 
various reform measures, we must truly strengthen the party 
leadership. Leaders and cadres at all levels must: Be clean and 
honest and exercise self-discipline; oppose corruption and work 
hard for the people; show concern for the livelihood and work of 
the masses; lead them to overcome difficulties and solve 
problems; and they must push forward with the various 
undertakings. 
  During the inspection tour, Qiao Shi also issued important 
instructions on enterprise reforms, rural work, and so on.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The current visits by 
Chinese Premier Li Peng to four Central Asian countries are by 
no means directed against any other country, Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said here this afternoon. 
  Wu was addressing a weekly press conference, at which he 
denied a report that Li's visit was aimed at contending with 
Russia for influence in the countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  The spokesman said that the Chinese premier's visits are 
return visits for those made by the leaders of the countries in 
question, and the purpose is to enhance mutual understanding 
with these countries, and promote good-neighborly friendship, as 
well as develop mutually beneficial co-operation. 
  "Therefore, the visits are by no means directed against any 
other country," Wu said. 
  "The friendly co-operation in various fields between China 
and Russia is developing steadily." 
  He went on: "We are keen to see the continued development of 
the friendship between Russia and the Central Asian countries, 
which are neighbors of both China and Russia."

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP) -- A Sino-Vietnamese 
territorial row over the Spratly islands intensified Thursday, 
with China defending as "totally legal" its deal with a U.S. 
company to explore for oil in the disputed island chain. 
  "China has irrefutable sovereignty over the Spratly islands 
and adjacent waters and this fact enjoys full international 
legal basis," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a 
weekly press briefing. 
  "Oil contracts between Chinese companies and foreign 
countries concerning these waters is action totally within 
China's sovereignty and is therefore totally legal," Wu said. 
  Hanoi reacted strongly Wednesday to what it described as the 
"illegal" contract signed by China and Colorado-based Crestone 
Energy, warning that the deal marked a "serious escalation of 
the situation in the South China Sea." The Spratly islands are 
claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, 
the Philippines and Taiwan. The crux of the dispute revolves 
around what are believed to be vast oil deposits in the area. 
  Crestone had announced Tuesday that it would sink 
exploratory 
wells under the protection of the Chinese Navy, which has 
recently stepped up its operations around the disputed island 
chain. The contract provides Crestone with access to a 25,155 
square kilometer (10,062 square miles) area -- the largest ever 
included in a prospecting contract in Southeast Asia. 
  Wu also returned Hanoi's accusations that mineral 
exploration 
around the Spratlys constituted a violation of Vietnamese 
sovereignty. "In recent years, Vietnam has carried out a lot of 
oil and gas exploration in Chinese waters. These activities are 
illegal and encroach upon China's sovereignty," Wu said. 
  Historical enemies China and Vietnam normalised diplomatic 
relations in November 1991 after a 12-year freeze, agreeing at 
the time to peacefully settle border disputes through 
negotiations. But mutual suspicion and allegations of violating 
bilateral understandings have continued to strain relations, 
with rival claims to the Spratly and Paracel islands the main 
point of contention.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The conclusion of the 
report issued by the British House of Commons runs totally 
counter to its professed desire to develop Sino-British 
relations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said 
here today. 
  At the weekly press conference here this afternoon, Wu made 
the statement when asked to comment on a lengthy report on 
Sino-British relations issued on April 13 by the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the British House of Commons. 
  In disregard of the fact, Wu noted, this report confuses the 
right and wrong and insists on supporting the erroneous policy 
of the British Government on the issue of Hong Kong and 
supporting its continued confrontation with China, thus fully 
revealing the true intention of the British side to prolong its 
colonial influence in Hong Kong by creating chaos there. 
  Wu stressed that Hong Kong will return to the motherland, 
which no force whatsoever can stop. 
  The Chinese Government has the resolve and the capability to 
resume exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, 
pursuing "One Country, Two Systems", implementing the basic law 
and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong 
Kong, Wu said. 
  Wu pointed out that the report, while recognizing China's 
economic success and the importance of its international role, 
makes irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs and 
even made an attempt to meddle in them. 
  "We would like to remind the authors of this report that one 
has to have some sense of history and reality," said Wu, adding 
that today's China is no longer what it used to be when it was 
"bullied and lorded over at will." 
  He went on to say that people can "never forget" the role 
Britain played on the issue of Tibet and can only hope it will 
"draw lessons" from history and adopt a "prudent attitude." 
  Any attempt to create "Two Chinas" or "One China, One 
Taiwan" 
runs counter to the principles governing the establishment of 
the diplomatics relations between China and Britain and 
therefore "will meet our firm opposition," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP) -- China called Thursday on 
Indonesia to defuse the situation in northern Sumatra which was 
rocked this week by violent anti-ethnic Chinese rioting. 
  "We hope and believe that the Indonesian Government will 
properly settle this case so that people there can enjoy a 
stable and happy life," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin 
told a weekly press briefing. "China is a friendly country to 
Indonesia," Wu stressed. 
  Anti-Chinese riots in the Sumatran capital Medan left one 
ethnic businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses 
sacked. There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia 
against the country's wealthy ethnic-Chinese minority, which 
comprises a mere three percent of the population but controls a 
disproportionate share of economic wealth.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP) -- China dismissed Thursday 
suggestions that the 12-year jail term handed down to Hong Kong 
journalist Xi Yang might further sour relations with Britain or 
the United States. 
  British Ambassador to China Sir Robin McLaren recently urged 
Beijing to show clemency in Xi's case, while the U.S. Consulate 
in Hong Kong strongly criticised the severity of the sentence. 
  "The case of Xi Yang is an internal affair of China and has 
nothing to do with Sino-British ties," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin said. He also flatly rejected any 
suggestion that Xi's sentence could further harm China's chances 
of having its most favoured nation (MFN) trading status with the 
United States renewed in June. 
  Xi's case is a criminal issue, while MFN is a purely 
economic 
one, Wu said, stressing that "both cases are totally irrelevant 
to each other." Washington has made MFN renewal conditional on 
progress in human rights in China. 
  Xi, a China-born journalist working for the Hong Kong 
newspaper Ming Pao, was secretly tried in March for allegedly 
stealing state secrets. His appeal against the 12-year sentence 
was rejected last Friday, angering Hong Kong journalists and 
raising concerns about local press freedoms after the British 
colony reverts to China in 1997. 
  "The trial and sentence of Xi Yang was carried out strictly 
in line with China laws," Wu said. "The case has nothing to do 
with confidence in Hong Kong."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 20 (XINHUA) -- NATO today backed a 
UN request for new air strikes against defiant Bosnian Serbs to 
protect UN-designated "safe areas" like Gorazde, but UN 
peacekeeper commander say it is too late, reports reaching here 
said. 
  The NATO ambassadors in Brussel held a meeting to discuss 
the 
latest situation in embattled Bosnian town of Gorazde. They 
endorsed the UN request for air strikes, but delayed a final 
decision pending military advice on options for using air power. 
  The allies agreed "we have got to find a way to respond 
positively" to the request, Britain's Ambassador, Sir John 
Weston, said Wednesday. 
  However, UN Commander Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose said it is 
too late for air strikes around Gorazde because Serb troops are 
too close and bombing would most probably endanger the 50,000 
civilians huddling in the war-ravaged town. 
  "There is nothing we can do to sustain the fences of 
Gorazde," rose told reporters. 
  In Gorazde, UN aid workers strongly pleaded for their lives 
as Serbs relentlessly shelled the hospital and other buildings 
in the Muslim enclave. 
  Workers said in a message to UN offices in Geneva that three 
rockets hit the hospital, killing at least 10 people and 
wounding more than 15. They spoke of despair after a three-week 
Serb offensive that has reportedly killed at least 367 people 
and wounded more than 1,000. 
  A new cease-fire agreement was signed by Serb leaders and 
the 
UN late Tuesday, but it appeared to be only the latest in a 
string of broken promises. 
  Serbs' political leader Radovan Karadzic today issued a 
statement saying: "The Serbian side unilaterally proclaims 
peace in Gorazde. With this, the Gorazde crisis comes to an end." 
  He made the statement in an apparent response to appeals for 
a cease-fire by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  NATO planes launched three rounds of air strikes in the past 
three weeks after serb offensive on Gorazde, one of six 
UN-declared "safe area" in Bosnia. Two air attacks only 
infuriated the Serbs while a third attack was thwarted Saturday 
when a British jet was shot down. 
  Bosnian Serbs began the war in April 1992 after a 
Muslim-Croat vote to secede from Yugoslavia. The Serbian armed 
forces have seized about 70 percent of Bosnia in fighting that 
has killed or left missing more than 200,000 people.

  [Text] Paris, April 20 (XINHUA) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand today proposed a quadripartite emergency 
meeting between Western Europe, the U.S., Russia and the UN to 
work out a coordinated position for solving the Bosnia crisis. 
  The press bureau of the presidential office announced that 
Mitterrand made the suggestion in a telephone conversation with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Earlier this month, Mitterrand had respectively wrote to 
Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, executive president of 
the European Union, Greek Prime Minister Andreas George 
Papandreou and UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  In the letters, Mitterrand asked the four sides to 
coordinate 
their positions and urge the warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks immediately in a bid to 
seek a political solution to the crisis. 
  On April 18, Mitterrand also had telephone talks with German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. French official sources said Kohl 
agreed to such a quadripartite emergency meeting while Yeltsin 
also gave his consent in a telephone conversation with Kohl. 
  In a related development, a spokesman of the French Foreign 
Ministry said today that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had 
telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
Tuesday afternoon and reiterated the following French position 
on an end to the Bosnia conflict: 
  -- Adoption of a UN resolution on an immediate cease-fire 
in, 
the withdrawal of the Serb troops from and the deployment of UN 
peacekeepers in Gorazde. 
  -- Effective measures to protect the security zones 
designated by the United Nations in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  -- A united position among Russia, Western Europe, the 
United 
States and the United Nations for pressing the warring parties 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks. 
  "The U.S. secretary of state agreed in principle that it is 
necessary to further coordinate the diplomatic actions of all 
parties," but he failed to take a clear-cut stand on the French 
proposal, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Moscow, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Lord David Owen, co- 
chairman of the Coordination Committee of the International 
Conference on Yugoslavia, arrived here from London on Wednesday 
[20 April] to discuss with Russia on its participation in the 
Bosnian issue. 
  Thorvald Stoltenberg, another co-chairman of the conference, 
is expected to arrive later. 
  The two international mediators are scheduled to have talks 
with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Russia's 
participation in adopting political resolutions on the war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics. 
  Before his departure from London, Lord Owen said Russia 
should not only take part in drawing a chart dividing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and attend talks on lifting sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also join the adoption 
resolutions on what military actions should be carried out by 
the world community in this area, according to the ITAR-TASS 
NEWS AGENCY. 
  On Tuesday, Kozyrev told a news conference: "I would 
strongly 
recommend the Serb side not to try patience of the international 
community." 
  His deputy Vitaly Churkin said on Wednesday that "all Serbs 
(in Bosnia-Herzegovina) are on the brink of catastrophe, which 
may have grave consequences for the world." 
  Moscow's recent tough statements on Bosnian Serbs should not 
be viewed as backtracking on its previous policy, Churkin said, 
adding that "if Serbs find strength to turn to peace," Russia 
will continue acting as a "channel of communication between 
Serbs and the world community."

  [Text] Tehran, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Thousands of Iranian 
students from Tehran University this morning held a rally in 
front of the UN Office here to raise their strong protest to the 
Serbian attacks against moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Shouting "death with the U.S." "death with the Serbians" and 
"death with the Russians," the students condemned the occupation 
of Gorazde, a UN-declared safe zone for Bosnian Moslems and the 
silence of the United Nations toward the Serbian attacks them. 
  In a resolution read at the rally, the students announced 
their readiness to be dispatched as Moslem volunteers to Bosnia 
to defend the Bosnian Moslems against Serbian attacks. 
  They urged the United Nations and international community to 
accept Iran's demand to dispatch forces to the balkan republic 
as UN peacekeeping forces. 
  Last year, Iran offered to send 10,000-man forces to Bosnia 
under the UN control to protect the Bosnian Moslems, but the 
offer was rejected. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati and other officials reiterated Iran's readiness to 
dispatch forces after the Moslem city of Gorazde was sieged by 
the Serbian forces. 
  Rafsanjani Tuesday [19 April] made a telephone call to the 
Greek prime minister and current chairman of the European Union 
(EU), Andreas Papandreou, expressing concern over the tragic 
situation in Gorazde. 
  He criticized the "negligence" of the United Nations toward 
violation of the most basic regulations by the serbs in a UN- 
declared safe haven. 
  While the Bosnian Moslems are deprived of having weapons 
under the UN Security Council's resolution, the Serbs "are 
receiving all types of arms from the neighboring countries," 
Rafsanjani said. 
  He noted that such situation would "lead the Europe toward 
racism and exerting pressure upon ethnic minorities." 
  Also Tuesday, commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guards 
Corps 
(IRGC) Mohsen Rezai said that Iran insisted that "the UN 
Security Council use volunteer forces from Iran and other 
countries to stop the savage massacre of the Moslems."

  [Text] Islamabad, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The deployment of 
Pakistani troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be possible by the 
end of June, said a Foreign Office spokesman here today. 
  Pakistan has decided to provide 3,000 troops for deployment 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina in response to U.N. Security Council 
Resolution 836 designed to protect six safe areas there. 
  The Pakistani troops, whose equipment supply is arranged by 
the United Nations from Germany, will be deployed in Bosnia 
under U.N. auspices. 
  Speaking at the weekly press briefing, the spokesman also 
informed journalists that Pakistan has moved a resolution in the 
U.N. Security Council seeking use of air strikes against Serbian 
artillery shelling on Gorazde. 
  The resolution also demands the withdrawal of the Serbian 
forces behind the line drawn when Gorazde was declared safe area 
and lifting of arms embargo against Bosnian forces, he said. 
  "The resolution was moved in light of Serbian aggression 
against the safe area of Gorazde," he added.

  [Text] London, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Singapore's Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong has urged the United States to be 
pragmatic on the question of China's most-favored-nation status, 
according to a report by LONDON FINANCIAL TIMES today. 
  In an interview with the newspaper, Goh Chok Tong, who was 
on 
a three-day visit in Britain, warned that a break in Sino-U.S. 
relations over the question would have severe long-term 
consequences for the world, because China would interpret the 
U.S. action as an attempt to limit its growth and would 
remember it for a long time. 
  But he emphasized that he did not foresee a fracture in 
relations between the two countries because he did not expect 
President Clinton to revoke China's most-favored-nation status 
when it comes up for annual renewal in June. 
  "The U.S. at the end of the day will be rather pragmatic," 
he said. "China is a huge export market for the U.S.. U.S. 
business people are putting pressure on the administration that 
you can only make a point on human rights thus far and beyond 
that the Chinese are not going to move." 
  If there were a break between China and the U.S., the prime 
minister said, Singapore would continue to invest in China. "The 
market would be open to those who trade with China," he added. 
  And China will continue to grow because in China, he said, 
"the resources are generated internally, not like the former 
Soviet Union which depends on (other countries) for resources." 
  Goh Chok Tong was in London to spearhead a marketing effort 
for Singapore's "External Wing" policy, under which it is 
building industrial parks in other Asian countries and wants 
foreign companies to set up plants in them while also basing 
part of the operation in Singapore.

<F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Zheng Defang: "Fighting for </F>
Rights in Sea of Corruption"] 
  [Text] Spring has suddenly come to Beijing. 
  Last winter registered higher temperatures than usual. So, 
without the almost inevitable and uncomfortable spring cold, 
Beijing residents find peach blossoms, magnolia, and forsythia 
blooming with a vengeance. 
  For us, Chinese spring is the time for "planning the 
livelihood of the year." Since our forefathers were mostly 
peasants, agricultural production is of prime importance. Even 
today, a good plan in spring largely brings about bumper 
harvests in autumn. 
  But, of course, all walks of life need early planning each 
year. 
  As usual, it was in early spring this year that the National 
People's Congress (NPC), our highest legislative body, and the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened to 
work out their annual plans. 
  This is doubtlessly much more complicated than ruling over 
agrarian China. But certain time-honoured principles for 
running the government still apply. For instance, if officials 
are clean and public funds are used for the benefit of the 
common people and if there is social stability, prosperity would 
come easily. 
  So this year's new budget law interested me greatly. It 
establishes the NPC's overall control of the state budget and 
places local budgets under NPC scrutiny. 
  Complicated as the new budget law seems, it does not really 
need much expertise to decide if the people's money is used 
correctly. 
  For one thing, farmers want real payments for selling what 
they produce, not IOUs. So the first thing the NPC deputies 
will do in examining local budgets is to eliminate IOUs. The 
next thing they will try to eliminate is feasting at public 
expense. Then they should raise teachers' pay and increase 
funding for college education -- astute farmers certainly would 
like to see their children go to university. 
  As to the rest, they can argue it out among themselves. 
  All this seems very well, if the local officials are honest 
and decent. What if they are not, or worse, if they become 
local despots riding roughshod over the people? We must resort 
to something which the Chinese people do not like to do. They 
do not like to go to court, trying to avoid public notoriety. 
But with a growing sense of self-protection, more people are 
going to court to seek justice. 
  Last year, 118,400 bureaucrats were found guilty of 
corruption and more than 237,000 offenders were convicted of 
violent crimes. 
  Our top prosecutors and judges have announced the battle 
against corruption, murder, robbery, and organized crime remains 
a top priority for judicial departments in 1994. It was 
revealed at the NPC session that a vice-minister of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, Li Xiaoshi, was convicted for 
embezzlement and accepting bribes and Shen Taifu, the gang 
leader of the Great Wall Machinery and Electronic Company bonds 
scandal, was sentenced to death. 
  Prior to his sentencing, rumours flew about that the scandal 
would be swept under the rug. I told these people that 
Shakespeare mentioned "the law's delay" as one of the vices 
suffered by humans so we must allow for its delays. 
  Now that law-breaking vice-ministers have been mercilessly 
brought to justice, we can be prepared to fight for our own 
rights if local despots turn ruthless. 
  Democracy and justice do not drop like "gentle rain from 
heaven"; they should be fought for with consciousness and 
tenacity.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Rational Targets Set for National </F>
Development"] 
  [Text] Only by pursuing sustained development can China 
have a bright future. Achieving this goal will require the 
nation to control its population growth, save resources, protect 
the environment and ensure social stability, reported Management 
World magazine. 
  China has a long way to go to complete these tasks and is 
already confronting serious challenges in these four areas of 
concern. 
  China entered a period of rapid population growth in the 
1950's when industrialization took off following Liberation in 
1949. 
  The baby boom slowed down after family planning began in 
1978 
but the problem still looms large because of the huge population 
already created. Birth control limits should be based on 
economic development, the reserve of resources and environmental 
conditions, said the State Council-supported magazine. 
  Demographers have set specific targets for national birth 
rate. China should keep its population below 1.3 billion by the 
turn of the century, below 1.46 billion by 2020 and realize zero 
growth -- where the number of births and deaths are roughly 
equal -- by the year 2030. 
  Maximum population in the next century should not exceed 1.6 
billion, the article suggests. 
  Experts predict the elderly and labour population will peak 
between 2020 and 2040. Total population will be at least 1.5 
billion by 2040, two thirds of whom will be in the 15-64 age 
group. About 300 million people will be at least 60 years old. 
  To provide work for all these people China should try all 
possible means to create more opportunities by developing 
labour- intensive businesses. 
<H5>  Old Age </H5>
  The article suggests the 1990's will be a golden time to tap 
workforce potential. After this decade a large proportion of 
the population will enter old age. 
  Much of the populace are from the rural areas. To provide 
jobs for them, it is important to transfer surplus labour to 
related or even nonagricultural sectors. 
  Farmers can be organized to harness desertification, 
assigned 
to afforestry and irrigation projects or the construction of 
other infrastructure facilities. 
  Alternative employment can be found in township enterprises 
and service industries. 
  The vast pool of scientific personnel should also develop 
hi-tech enterprises in big cities, coastal areas, and regions 
along the Yangtze River. 
  Secondly, China should save and make a more efficient use of 
its limited resources. Thriftiness must be upheld in both 
consumption and production. 
  China cannot imitate the developed countries' model of 
resource allocation; instead, it should choose a cost efficient 
plan. 
  To promote efficient agriculture, land and water should be 
saved. Fields can be used for multiple cropping and advanced 
irrigation projects can bring marginal arid lands into 
production. 
  In industry, new technology should be introduced to save 
energy and raw materials. Redundant projects should be 
eliminated and waste should be recycled, a practice that would 
also help the environment. 
<H5>  Lifestyle </H5>
  A luxurious lifestyle in daily life should be discouraged. 
  Staple food should be plant-oriented; more chemical fabrics 
should be manufactured to replace cotton products to relieve the 
pressure on the land, allowing more food to be grown; more 
apartment buildings, public buses, and subways should be 
developed. 
  Thirdly, environment protection should run parallel to 
economic construction. 
  Protection should be written into the long-term social and 
economic development programme. 
  Environment-friendly economic and technological policies 
should be encouraged. Clean industrial production and 
ecological agriculture should be promoted. 
  Environmental protection agencies at all levels should be 
reinforced; laws and regulations should also be drafted and 
strictly enforced. A national network monitoring environmental 
conditions should be established and international cooperation 
should be sought and enhanced. 
  Fourth, national economic development should be stable, 
sustained and concerted. 
  The past 40 years demonstrated that too high a growth rate 
can lead to economic setbacks and severe losses. 
  The government should take economic measures to regulate 
development speed. And the development of different sectors of 
the national economy should be coordinated. 
<H5>  Growth Rate </H5>
  After analyzing economic growth in the past 40 years, 
experts 
suggest that the Gross National Product should grow at 6 to 7 
percent, the agricultural output value should increase 3-4 
percent, and grain output 2-3 percent. Industrial output value 
should grow 10-12 percent. Specifically, light industry needs 
to grow 10-12 percent and heavy industry 11-13 percent. Per 
capita income should climb at 5-6 percent. 
  If such growth can be maintained, the economy can develop 
smoothly. 
  As China witnesses the economic boom, it will have trouble 
adjusting the relationship between population and resources, 
supply and demand, and between economic development and social 
progress. 
  During this period, the government should keep close watch 
on 
the national economy and be cautious in introducing economic and 
social reform packages. 
  The government should curb inflation, minimize the widening 
income gap, and reduce the friction between conflicting 
interests and political and cultural groups. 
  Meanwhile, the government should also establish a management 
system compatible with the demands of the market economy. This 
management system should extend its responsibility to 
production, distribution, circulation, and consumption.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Malaysia's "1994 
Asia Defense Exhibition," scheduled to last for four days, 
opened here today. 
  In his opening speech, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib 
Razak 
said more than 500 firms from 37 countries and regions are 
participating in the exhibition. The reason why so many firms 
from all parts of the world vigorously are taking part in this 
exhibition is that Southeast Asia is one of the world's economic 
centers experiencing a vigorous growth and that Southeast Asian 
countries are now carrying out defense modernization. 
  The Malaysian Asia defense exhibition, held every two years, 
began in 1988. This year's exhibition exceeds all previous ones 
in scope. Many new weapons and equipment are displayed at the 
impressive British, German, U.S., and Australian pavilions. 
  Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army, attended the opening ceremony. He 
also viewed the exhibition.

  [Text] Manila, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China has earned 
world-wide appreciation for helping prevent the crisis in the 
Korean peninsula from further deteriorating, Senator Blas F. 
Ople said here today. 
  Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
said that as he welcomed the Foreign Affairs Committee 
delegation of the National People's Congress of China at the 
Ninoy Aquino International Airport. 
  He said to a great extent it was due to China's efforts that 
the threat level to peace between the two Koreas has apparently 
now subsided. 
  The senator, who just returned from Marrakesh, Morroco, 
where 
97 nations signed the final act of the Uruguay Round of talks on 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said various 
delegations assembled in Marrakesh favored the early admission 
of China to GATT to be an original member of the new World Trade 
Organization (WTO), expected to succeed GATT by January 1995. 
  The WTO, to be credible, needs to be universal, and that 
standard cannot be attained without the admission of China, Ople 
said. 
  Zhu Liang, head of the Chinese parliamentary delegation, 
said 
Philippine-Chinese relations were a stabilizing influence in the 
East Asia region.

  [Text] According to XINHUA, President Jiang Zemin and

connection with the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon. 
  The message says: We are shocked to learn that Mr. Richard

  Mr. Nixon was a statesmen with strategic foresight and 
political courage. When he was U.S. President, he and the late 
Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai opened the gate of Sino-U.S. 
relations and created a new situation for the relations between 
the two countries. After he was relieved of his office, Mr. 
Nixon continued to concern himself with Sino-U.S. relations and 
make important contributions to safeguarding and developing the 
two countries' relations. 
  We are convinced that, under the joint efforts exerted by 
China and the United States, Sino-U.S. relations which the late 
Mr. Nixon cared about certainly will continue to improve and 
develop. We wish to express our sincere sympathy to Mr. Nixon's 
family. 
  Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen also sent messages of 
condolences.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said here today that he was "deeply grateful" to late 
former U.S. President Richard Nixon "for his wise counsel on 
many occasions" over the past year. 
  Clinton made the remarks from the White House Rose Garden 
when formally announcing that Nixon had died in New York at 
09:08 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time. 
  He hailed Nixon's contributions in reaching out to countries 
such as China and the former Soviet Union. 
  Clinton said that Nixon "had the wisdom to know when the 
time 
was right to reach out to the Soviet Union and China." 
  He said that his relationship with Nixon was "warm and 
constructive" and that "he went out of his way to give me his 
best advice." 
  Clinton said that he would attend Nixon's funeral in 
California. 
  The U.S. national flag, the Strip and Star [as received], 
will flow at half mast for 30 days, beginning this evening, to 
honor the passing away of Nixon.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Withdrawal of 
China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status will probably 
raise the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) by 2.2 percentage 
points, according to a study released here today. 
  According to the study done by CS First Boston Corporation 
Economist Neal M. Soss, raising the cost of Chinese imports, if 
with no other effects, will raise the U.S. CPI by 0.15 
percentage points. 
  "If the increased tariffs on Chinese items created a pricing 
umbrella so that all other toy and apparel and footwear prices 
went up commensurately, the effect would be to raise the CPI by 
2.2 percentage points," the economist said. 
  "For reasons of inflation control, it would be better if the 
political discussions with China were resolved in a way that 
permitted the continuation of China's MFN status," the economist 
said in a press release. 
  According to U.S. statistics, the 1993 U.S. merchandise 
trade 
deficit was 115.8 billion U.S. dollars, with China accounting 
for 22.8 billion dollars, or 19.7 percent. 
  China now accounts for 1.9 percent of total U.S. merchandise 
exports and 5.4 percent of imports. The U.S. accounts for about 
one-third of China's merchandise exports. 
  The average U.S. tariff rate is now 8.8 percent and would 
almost sextuple to 50.5 percent if MFN was withdrawn. The bulk 
of U.S. imports from China are toys, apparel, footwear and 
electronics. 
  China products account now for 48 of all the toys sold in 
the 
U.S.. Chinese products account for almost 15 percent of 
imported apparel and footwear in the U.S., the New York-based 
economist explained. 
  The threat to China's MFN status along with the invocation 
of 
Super 301 "led some observers to fear the U.S. is sliding down a 
slippery slope toward protectionism with adverse consequences 
for our inflation outlook among other potential harms," Soss 
said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Conditional MFN' Status Will Not Work"] </F>
  [Text] Wu Yi, minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, concluded her U.S. visit this 
week. During her visit to the United States, Minister Wu Yi 
attended the Eighth Conference of the Chinese-U.S. Commercial 
and Trade Joint Committee, during which both sides profoundly 
discussed the question of strengthening economic and trade 
cooperation. Their discussions were frank and pragmatic and 
yielded constructive results. The Chinese-U.S. Trade and 
Investment Symposiums in New York and Los Angeles also concluded 
satisfactorily, during which various U.S. corporations signed 
all kinds of agreements with Chinese central and local 
authorities as well as enterprises, involving a total amount of 
$10 billion. This has once again proved that there is huge 
potential for Chinese-U.S. economic exchanges and that such 
business talks are greatly beneficial to both sides. 
  The problem now is that, at a time when Chinese-U.S. 
economic 
and trade relations are developing vigorously, an irrelevant 
factor to economic and trade relations is casting a shadow over 
the two countries' entrepreneurs. That is, what policy will the 
United States adopt on the question of renewing China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status? In April and May every year, 
U.S. exporters to China frown because the White House stand and 
practice on this issue are quite unfavorable to them. The 
Chinese side is concerned about this and Hong Kong and Taiwan 
businessmen who have built factories on the mainland are 
seriously worried about it. 
  Last year the Clinton administration decided to renew 
China's 
MFN status for a year, with the caveat that "China must make a 
significant improvement on the human rights issue" before it can 
obtain renewal this year. In other words, this is a conditional 
MFN status. When meeting U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
last month, the Chinese side explicitly clarified its position 
on this issue: China cannot accept a conditional MFN status. 
China's human rights concept is different from the U.S. one but 
this does not prevent the two countries from having a dialogue 
on this question. However, China absolutely does not allow 
others to interfere in its internal affairs on the pretext of 
human rights. China's position is clear and its attitude is 
reasonable. 
  China needs MFN status because it affords both sides equal 
treatment and mutual conditions in trade and also because the 
United States is China's biggest export market. Similarly, the 
United States needs China: It needs to import large amounts of 
cheap but good quality industrial products from China and it 
also needs China because it is a big market. While in the 
United States, Minister Wu Yi said that, in future, China will 
import commodities worth $1,000 billion from the United States. 
For U.S. corporations, Chinese markets are absolutely 
necessary. As Wu Yi said, should the United States withdraw 
China's MFN status, a trade war could break out between China 
and the United States in which there would be no victor. 
  The Clinton administration is unlikely to withdraw China's 
MFN status rashly because this could hit U.S. entrepreneurs 
heavily; more seriously, Chinese-U.S. economic and trade 
relations would break off and this would affect Chinese-U.S. 
political relations and even the global strategic pattern. 
China is a large country which plays a decisive role in the 
Asia-Pacific region, is the pillar for economic growth and 
stability in this region, and is a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council. Should the United States prefer a 
confrontation with China, U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific 
region will be affected. The U.S. economy is just starting to 
recover and the Clinton administration is facing difficulties 
which are proving hard to cope with in the diplomatic field, 
such as the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. If the United States prefers 
confrontation against China, it will, as Minister Wu Yi said, 
commit a strategic mistake. 
  Recently the Clinton administration held discussions with 
Democratic congressmen about China's MFN status. Reports said 
that the U.S. side may possibly propose a so-called partial MFN 
status. That is, it may possibly cancel preferential treatment 
for products imported to the United States by Chinese 
state-owned enterprises. This act of discrimination against 
Chinese state-owned enterprises will not work. Let us put aside 
this question of "conditional MFN," which is technically hard to 
execute; imposing sanctions against Chinese state-owned 
enterprises could damage the Chinese people's feelings and the 
Chinese Government will not accept it. 
  There is only one action for the U.S. Government to take: It 
must separate the human rights issues from trade and grant China 
permanent MFN status. This will be the best conclusion for the 
United States and China and both sides will be the victors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Great Potential in Sino-U.S. Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] At the Sino-U.S. trade and investment talks held in 
New York, entrepreneurs from the two countries took only two 
days to conclude and sign 62 agreements and contracts, under 
which the U.S. side would make investment in or sell equipment 
to China for a total amount of $5.4 billion. Major consortia 
headed by Morgan and Dupont, as well as large multinational 
groups headed by IBM, Merrill Lynch, the American Computer and 
Telephone Corporation [mei guo dian nao dian hua gong si 5019 
0948 7193 5207 7193 6114 0361 0674], and so on, took an active 
part in the talks with the Chinese side. Earlier, the Chinese 
trade delegation had also held similar activities in Los 
Angeles, signing $1.3 billion worth of contracts and more than 
$4 billion worth of agreements of intent with U.S. businessmen. 
All this shows that China is an enormous market with powerful 
appeal. Meanwhile, it also shows that there are extremely broad 
vistas for cooperation between China and the United States. 
  China's economy is growing at a rate which has rarely been 
seen in the world. It is anticipated that the total amount of 
imported goods will reach $1 trillion in the next seven years. 
In China, 12 million telephone lines will be installed, 1,000 
km of railroads will be built or renovated, 3,500 km of highways 
will be constructed, and from several hundred thousand to 
several million sedans will be imported each year. Just think, 
where else can people find such a huge market in the world? It 
is precisely because of the sustained economic growth in China 
that the economic and trade cooperation between China and the 
United States has been able to develop rapidly these past years. 
The volume of trade between the two countries reached $27.6 
billion in 1993, a 70-fold increase compared with that before 
diplomatic ties were established in 1979. 
  However, dark clouds have been consistently cast over the 
otherwise exceptionally favorable situation of cooperation, 
namely the threat by U.S. authorities to withdraw the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status from China under the pretext of 
the human rights issue. 
  Everybody knows that the withdrawal of MFN status will not 
only cause an onslaught on the trade between the two countries 
but will also certainly infringe upon the economic contacts and 
affect the political and diplomatic relationships between China 
and the United States. The gate, which was opened by former 
President Nixon in conformity with the historical trend of the 
times, will probably be closed again. This certainly runs 
against history and, therefore, is a perverse act, against which 
sagacious Americans will rise to express their opposition. Over 
the past period of time, voices calling for unconditional 
renewal of MFN status for China have been heard here and there. 
The U.S. Government's stand of linking human rights with trade 
has not gained any support from the international community. A 
short time ago, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew 
once again warned the United States not to exert pressure on 
China through the human rights issue because that simply would 
not work and would only jeopardize the economic growth and 
strategic stability in Asia. In order to continue brandishing 
the baton of MFN status, the United States tried by every 
conceivable means to obstruct China's reentry into GATT and was, 
therefore, bogged down in an extremely isolated situation. Even 
its allies -- the various European countries -- unanimously 
stand for China's reentering the international trade 
organization as early as possible. 
  The withdrawal of MFN status will do harm not only to 
mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, but also to the United 
States itself. This is obvious to all and China has repeatedly 
expounded on this view. However, China is absolutely not afraid 
of U.S. threats having made full preparations for the worst a 
long time ago. Just as Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, said: "If there is darkness in the east, 
there is sunlight in the west," and "if the north turns dark, 
the south is bright," so "the sky over China will never 
collapse." 
  Recently, China sent a number of high-level delegations to 
visit the United States and clarify its points of view, showing 
its sincerity in seeking positive development and cooperation 
with the United States. We are now waiting to see if the 
Clinton administration will make the correct political decision. 
There is an old Chinese saying: "It is impolite not to 
reciprocate." If the United States makes a choice for 
development and cooperation, the Chinese will certainly 
coordinate with it so that there will be fruitful results 
arising from equal and reciprocal exchanges; but, if the United 
States disrupts the trade relations which are based on MFN 
status, the Chinese side will certainly "give tit for tat." 
China is opposed to linking trade with human rights because they 
belong to entirely different matters. Fair-minded people in 
various countries have noted that, along with the economic 
development and increased democracy and legal system in China, 
the human rights situation has improved considerably and will 
continue so to do. There are only a handful of anti-Chinese 
elements in the United States who take advantage of a couple of 
criminals to attack China and who are not actually concerned 
with human rights in this country. 
  What merits our attention is that some U.S. forces hostile 
to 
China have not only stirred up trouble on the issue of MFN 
status but have also availed themselves of various opportunities 
to provoke incidents and confront China. There is a rumor that 
they want to take advantage of the Dalai Lama's upcoming visit 
to the United States to set off another new surge against China. 
There is also a report that the United States is going to 
increase its sales of weapons to Taiwan to create tension across 
the Taiwan Strait. All this obviously runs counter to the U.S. 
commitment to a "one China" policy and is deliberately aimed at 
splitting China. In the face of this, under no circumstances 
will China sit idly by and remain indifferent. Certainly, the 
objective of these individuals in the United States will never 
be achieved.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has called for strong economic ties with India which has 
offered "exciting possibilities for our bilateral trade and 
economic relations." 
  in a letter to congressmen recently, Clinton said that his 
administration was keen on enhancing Indo-U.S. cooperation in 
trade, science and technology. 
  The Department of Commerce's big emerging markets study 
should provide important help to companies seeking to enter the 
Indian market, he said. 
  India has been identified by the U.S. Commerce Department as 
among the 10 "big emerging markets," which hold tremendous 
potential for boosting exports and profitable investments for 
U.S. businesses. 
  Referring to the recent strain in Indo-U.S. relations over 
the situation in Kashmir and human rights standards in India, 
Clinton called for a pragmatic approach, saying that political 
differences ought not to color the gamut of Indo-U.S. ties.

  [Text] Singapore, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Minister 
of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng criticized the United States today 
for trying to impose its system on Singapore concerning the 
caning sentence on an American teenage vandal. 
  In recent weeks, much has been said about caning as a form 
of 
punishment in Singapore, he noted when addressing the official 
opening of two prisons here this morning. 
  He said some in the American media had gone so far as to 
equate caning to torture because caning caused pain and possibly 
permanent cane marks. And they called caning a "cruel", 
"inhuman" or "unusual" punishment. 
  "It is absurd that societies so stricken with crime should 
attempt to apply their standards on us and teach us what to do," 
the minister said. 
  The United States should not "try to impose its system on 
others" since even in the United States, it does not have a 
criminal justice system that is universally applied in every one 
of the 50 states, he said. 
  The American teenager, Michael Fay, 18, was sentenced here 
last month to four months imprisonment, a fine of 3,500 
Singapore dollars, and six strokes of the cane. 
  "Nobody takes any joy in carrying out these strict 
punishments, be it imprisonment, caning or execution. But if it 
has to be done, it must be done," Wong said. 
  "Laws will not be effective if the penalties are not 
sufficiently strict. Only then will these laws have the desired 
punitive and deterrent effects," he added. 
  "In Singapore, our own experience has convinced us that 
strict laws, rigorous and impartial enforcement and a fair and 
transparent judicial system have made our country relatively 
crime-free," the minister said.

"Hata Selected as Prime Minister, But Many Difficulties Remain 
in Japan's Political Situation"] 
  [Text] Two weeks after Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa resigned from office, it was still hard to find a new 
prime minister. Early yesterday morning, the seven-party 
coalition finally reached an agreement on the basic policy to be 
pursued by the new cabinet. It was decided that Tsutomu Hata, 
currently deputy prime minister and foreign minister, will 
succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. The post, which had gone 
unfilled for two weeks, was finally manned. 
  After repeated considerations, the ruling coalition still 
decided to select Hata. It is expected that when the two houses 
of the Diet vote next week, the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party will nominate its leader Kawano to contend for the post, 
but it is certain that Hata will win majority support in 
parliament. 
  In the past two weeks, the Japanese political situation has 
been volatile, and political disputes have arisen again and 
again. The main problem is that the ruling coalition did not 
reach agreement on the basic policy it will pursue in the 
future. When the bickering became fierce, those involved even 
threatened to break with each other. 
  The seven political parties within the ruling coalition are 
divided into two major factions. One faction is the mainstream 
faction headed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] (Hata, Ozawa) 
and Komeito (Ichikawa), and the other faction is the 
non-mainstream faction formed by the Social Democratic Party 
(Kubo), the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Sakigake 
[Harbinger] party's Masayoshi Takemura (chief secretary in 
Hosokawa's cabinet). The two sides refused to concede on two 
major issues, namely, the new cabinet's tax policy and nuclear 
developments in Korea. In the end they made reciprocal 
concessions to each other in consideration of their overall 
interests and an instant split was prevented. 
  At present, the consensus reached by the ruling coalition on 
the taxation issue is an agreement to reduce direct taxes, 
improve or remove current consumption taxes, and greatly 
increase indirect taxes while calling for the nation's 
understanding. 
  The Social Democratic Party originally strongly opposed the 
option of substantially raising indirect taxes and held that 
this meant no tax reduction at all. It insisted that the new 
taxation system must be endorsed by the nationals. At present, 
the compromise is: The new taxation system being endorsed by 
the nationals is changed into "being understood by the 
nationals," and the bill concerned will be formulated by June 
this year. 
  As for the issue of nuclear development in Korea, both sides 
also reached a compromise. They agreed that according to the 
specifications of the Japanese Constitution, preparations be 
made against emergencies, and "close coordination be made with 
the United States and the ROK" and at the same time "cooperation 
be carried out with the Asian countries concerned if necessary." 
  The Social Democratic Party originally stressed "cooperation 
between Japan and China" on the Korean issue and opposed Japan's 
participation in sanctions against Korea. It worried that Japan 
might follow the United States, and once U.S. forces carried out 
a maritime blockade against Korea, the Japanese Self-Defense 
Force would support U.S. military action from the rear. Because 
the United States and Japan have signed a security treaty, if 
the United States acts recklessly, Japan could be entangled by 
events. 
  Shinseito's Ozawa proposed that Japan should take part in 
military missions by the United Nations. This evoked an outcry 
in society. Therefore, the Korean "nuclear mystery" is very 
sensitive in Japan. Because of the U.S.-Japan security treaty, 
if the United States or the United Nations takes action, Japan 
will have to make a choice. 
  Since Clinton took office, the United States has often 
overreacted to some local disputes in the world. Clinton once 
mentioned the option of taking preemptive action on Korea's 
nuclear mystery, and this has naturally aroused Japan's 
nervousness, causing the Social Democratic Party to call for 
cooperation with China. 
  After Hata takes office, the weak points of the Hosokawa 
cabinet and such serious issues as political reform, the new 
taxation policy, Japanese-U.S. trade frictions, the new budget, 
and stimulating domestic demand will all be put before the new 
cabinet. It is expected that the Hata cabinet's workload will be 
no less arduous.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tang Shuifu: "Kim Yong-sam Strives To </F>
Control Power"] 
  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The dismissal of Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Friday [22 April] has demonstrated 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's strong determination to 
control the cabinet. 
  Yi Hoe-chang, chosen as the prime minister last December, 
suddenly tendered his resignation Friday to the president who 
immediately appointed Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and 
National Unification Board (NUB) minister, to fill the vacant. 
  The new appointment is subject to approval by the national 
assembly which is expected to endorse it next Monday. 
  Yi Hoe-chang's resignation came just one day after he lashed 
out the decision-making process of President Kim's 
administration. 
  Yi Hoe-chang, who is called "Mr. Bamboo" for his 
uncompromising character, reportedly became furious when he was 
left in the dark about a major change in the government policy 
on the nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) at a recent strategy meeting. 
  The meeting, named the policy coordinating conference, 
opened 
under instruction from the president in response to the media 
and public criticism of the government's "inconsistency" in 
security policies. 
  The meeting, which was held on April 15, decided that South 
Korea would withdraw unconditionally its demand on an 
inter-Korean envoy exchange as a pre-condition for the DPRK to 
hold further talks with the United States at high level. 
  Yi Hoe-chang also complained, apparently targeting the 
presidential staff, that a policy decision on the acceptance of 
all the DPRK's "escapees in Pyongyang-run logging camps" in 
Russia, who wish to settle in South Korea, was leaked to the 
press even before it was formally adopted by the cabinet. 
  On the other hand, Yi himself initiated steps to control the 
so- called "safe houses," which are owned by police and other 
investigating authorities, without consulting the presidential 
office, which was reportedly annoyed by the presidential office. 
  A presidential official said the president's swift 
acceptance 
of Yi's resignation could be seen as a "dismissal." 
  Kim said on several occasions that under the presidential 
government system, only the president is responsible for major 
state affairs. 
  The replacement of Yi, however, is expected to arouse strong 
criticisms on what the opposition calls Kim's "one-man rule," 
political analysts here said. 
  The democratic party, South Korea's major opposition, said 
that it regretted Yi's resignation after having been held in 
checks by his rivals. 
  The dismissal of Yi, who had served as chairman of the board 
of audit and inspection until last December, spearheaded the 
non-military president's campaign to tighten his control of 
political power, the analysts noted.

  [Text] Manila, April 25 (XINHUA) -- President Fidel Ramos 
today called for intensified economic cooperation between the 
Philippines and China, particularly in the field of science and 
technology. 
  Ramos made the call during his meeting with a Chinese 
National People's Congress [NPC] delegation led by Zhu Liang, 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  He emphasized that the Philippines can benefit from China's

China's laser laboratory in Beijing which he visited during his 
trip in China last year. 
  Ramos said that one of the agreements reached during the 
Asia 
Pacific economic cooperation meeting in the United States last 
November was the transfer of technology from developed countries 
to the developing ones, especially their science and applied 
technology for small and medium enterprises. 
  The Chinese delegation arrived here on April 21 after a 
visit 
to Thailand. 
  During its stay in the country, the delegation met with

  [Text] Urumqi, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A joint project between 
Australia and China on sheep research will be conducive to 
China's sheep raising, said visiting Australian Governor-General 
Bill Hayden after he toured the Sino-Australian Sheep Research 
Center here today. 
  Hayden said the project will play a positive role in 
popularizing new technologies and in improving the quality of 
sheep bred in China, which includes the sheep's hereditary 
features and mutton and wool quality. 
  To inspect the development of the project, the 
governor-general made a special trip to the Nansha [Spratly] 
sheep-breeding pastureland, located in the suburbs of Urumqi, 
capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was 
jointly set up by China and Australia. He checked and was 
satisfied with the wool of the sheep, which had been cultivated 
from Australian breeds. 
  The Sino-Australian joint project on sheep research was 
initiated in accordance with the technological cooperation 
agreement between the two countries. It is one of Australia's 
biggest aid projects to China in agriculture, in which Australia 
has invested 6.44 million Australian dollars. 
  The five-year project, starting from 1991, involves nine 
items and 30 subjects covering the fields of breeding, 
nutrition, reproduction, wool technology, pastures, and 
veterinary surgery as well as women's participation and 
development. 
  At present, 33 Chinese have been sent to Australia for 
long-term and short-term training sessions, while two Australian 
experts are working in Xinjiang. 
  A Chinese official with the research center said that the 
two 
Australian experts are working well here and the project has 
been developing smoothly. 
  To improve the teaching conditions of the school in the 
pastureland, the Australian Government has provided ten thousand 
Australian dollars and improved the laboratory of the school. 
One hundred thousand Australian dollars will help to establish 
a knitting mill, which will enable 80 Kazak women to get jobs, 
part of the effort to solve the Kazak nationality women's 
employment problems. 
  Governor Hayden highly praised such cooperation, which may 
promote the economy in the autonomous region inhabited by 
minority nationalities.

Rong (6200 2837): "Flower of Friendship Grows From the Weaving 
of Carpets" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Ashkhabad Carpet 
Factory was filled with laughter in the afternoon of 21 April. 
Age-old legends and touching scenes again added splendor to 
Sino-Turkmen friendship. 
  At 1515, Premier Li Peng, who is currently on a visit to 
Turkmenistan, arrived at the Ashkhabad Carpet Factory, which was 
established over 60 years ago, for a visit. Factory Director 
(Bayilan) warmly welcomed Premier Li Peng and his party at the 
gate. 
  After walking into the workshop, Li Peng frequently extended 
greetings to women workers skillfully doing their work. The 
factory director said: The factory employs over 1,000 staff and 
workers. The carpets it produces are famous all over the world 
for their beauty as well as their fine and close-woven texture. 
It is here that Turkmen's industriousness and wisdom, as 
demonstrated by pairs of weaving hands making their traditional 
carpets, enjoy long- standing popularity and brisk sales to 
other parts of the world. 
  What makes the factory proud is the fact that Turkmen 
carpets 
have won eight gold medals at international expositions. One of 
them was awarded by the Paris Expo in 1937. Factory Director 
(Bayilan) said to Li Peng: The carpet weaving industry occupies 
an extremely important position in Turkmenistan. Our national 
emblem incorporates five basic carpet designs. 
  Chinese guests gasped with admiration at pieces of carpets 
full of ancient, legendary figures at the factory museum. 
Pointing at a carpet with designs woven on both sides, the 
factory director said: The texture of this rare carpet is very 
close-woven. It has over 1 million knitting knots per square 
meter. The host said with pride: The craftsmanship of the 
decorative carpets and tapestries produced by the factory is 
very exquisite. They are very valuable. The factory has an 
annual output of 2,700 square meters [figure as published]. 
Products are mainly sold to Germany and Britain. 
  Standing in front of a carpet woven with a dragon design, Li 
Peng examined the carpet for a long time. It is an unusual 
carpet, woven with a design of eight legendary Chinese dragons 
and a cotton boll, which is a traditional Turkmen design. 
According to a briefing given by the host, this was the design 
on the ceiling of a mosque in the 12th century. A male artisan 
and an 18-year-old girl tried to weave the design on a carpet. 
When the weaving of the design on the carpet was almost 
finished, with only a space of 15 cm left undone, they perished 
in an earthquake that destroyed the mosque. The wife of the 
artisan completed the weaving of the carpet. Factory Director 
(Bayilan) said: "The design signifies that Turkmen-Chinese 
contacts date back to ancient times." The guests were touched 
by the story. Li Peng and his wife posed for a photo in front 
of the carpet. 
  To welcome Premier Li Peng's visit to Turkmenistan and the 
carpet factory, two female workers specially hastened to produce 
a tapestry woven with a portrait of Li Peng and offered it as a 
present to their honored Chinese guest. The factory director 
said: "In the tapestry are woven the friendly feelings of all 
the workers of our factory for you and the Chinese people." In 
return, Premier Li Peng offered a traditional Chinese embroidery 
as a present to the host. He said: "Like your carpets, famous 
Chinese embroidery is also embroidered by needle, stitch by 
stitch." 
  At the end of the visit, Premier Li Peng gladly wrote an 
inscription: "Great Achievements From Industriousness and 
Wisdom and Masterpieces of Superb Craftsmanship." The visit, 
which lasted less than an hour, left an unforgettable impression 
on the Chinese guests.

security in Asia and to promote regional economic cooperation in 
the light of Asia's situation and characteristics.

political stability and economic development in Central Asian 
countries are not only in the fundamental interest of people of 
all countries in the region, but are also significant for 
safeguarding peace in Asia and the world as a whole. The 
Chinese Government supports Turkmenistan's efforts to stabilize 
the domestic and regional situation and to develop its national 
economy. 
  The communique says: The two sides are satisfied with the 
results of the meetings and the talks, maintaining that it is

  [Text] Ashkhabat, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Persons in charge of 
the relevant departments of China and Turkmenistan signed three 
documents here in the morning of 22 April. Premier Li Peng, who 
is currently on a visit here, and Turkmen President Niyazov 
attended the document-signing ceremony. 
  The three documents are an agreement on a government loan to 
be offered by China to Turkmenistan, a protocol on [regular] 
consultations between the Chinese and Turkmen Foreign 
Ministries, and a letter of intent on cooperation between the 
China National Petroleum Corporation and Turkmenistan's Ministry 
of Oil and Gas on a natural gas pipeline project. 
  An exchange of notes on China's granting goods and materials 
to Turkmenistan free of charge was signed today, too. 
  Prior to the document-signing ceremony, Turkmen Oil and Gas 
Minister Suyunov briefed Premier Li Peng and his party on a 
tentative plan to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan 
to Japan via China. He said: Turkmenistan's current proved 
reserves of natural gas and petroleum reached 21,000 billion 
cubic meters and 5 billion to 6 billion tonnes, respectively. 
The exploitation of these resources will make Turkmenistan 
become an energy-exporting country. The length of the natural 
gas pipeline is 6,130 km on land and 880 km to 1,100 km by sea. 
It will be a project whose implementation will span this 
century and the next. Its inauguration will be beneficial to 
Turkmenistan, China, and Japan. Premier Li Peng attentively 
listened to the briefing and asked detailed questions about the 
relevant situation. 
  Today, a ceremony conferring on Premier Li Peng the title of 
academician emeritus of the Turkmenistan Academy of Sciences was 
also held in the hall of the presidential office. 
  Today at noon, Ismail Amat, state councillor and 
concurrently 
minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, and who 
accompanied Premier Li Peng on his visit, cut the ribbon for the 
inauguration of the Asia Hotel, a Sino-Turkmen joint venture 
located in a suburb of Ashkhabat. Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister 
Saljayev [name as received] and Chinese Ambassador to 
Turkmenistan Cheng Zhensheng attended the ribbon-cutting 
ceremony.

  [Text] Ashkhabat, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng met with hundreds of MP's, government officials, scholars, 
and entrepreneurs at the presidential palace in Ashkhabat this 
morning, where he gave an offhand, ebullient speech. 
  President Niyazov of Turkmenistan spoke first at the 
meeting. 
He said that leaders of Turkmenistan and China are determined 
to develop all-round friendly relations between the two 
countries. They will not only develop the ongoing good relations 
in the political and cultural fields but will also expand 
cooperation in the economic sector. 
  President Niyazov said that he fully agrees with Premier Li 
Peng's view that countries, whether big or small, are entitled 
to participate in international affairs or to choose their own 
path of development in accordance with their own characteristics. 
  In his speech, Premier Li Peng said that he was accorded 
very 
warm hospitability during his official visit to Turkmenistan. 
  He said: "In the past two days, I have had very friendly, 
sincere [fei chang you hao er cheng zhi 7236 1603 0645 1170 5079 
6134 2304] talks with President Niyazov. We had an extensive 
and in- depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and on 
international and regional issues of common interest. Officials 
and businessmen of the two nations also held counterpart talks. 
We have discovered that our two nations share identical or 
similar views on many issues. We can say that our talks and 
meetings have been fruitful." 
  Li Peng said: China is ready to expand friendly cooperation 
with Turkmenistan in all fields, including the building of a 
modern "Silk Road" linking China and Central Asia -- including 
Turkmenistan -- by modern railways. Such ties will also serve 
to enhance contacts between Asia and Europe. "This `New Silk 
Road' will not only serve as a broad way for economic 
cooperation but also as a brilliant path toward friendship." 
  Li Peng said in conclusion, "Dear friends, I am convinced 
that with this visit, the friendship between the people of China 
and Turkmenistan will certainly become more solid and that 
mutually beneficial cooperation will certainly grow day by day." 
  Upon hearing this, the hundreds of people present rose and 
gave a long ovation to Li Peng's ebullient speech and heartfelt 
wishes.

  [Text] Bishkek, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Peng arrived in Bishkek on 22 April at 1830 local time on a 
special aircraft to start his official visit to Kyrgyzstan at 
the invitation of Akayev, president of the Republic of 
Kyrgyzstan. 
  When Li Peng stepped down from the ramp of the airplane, 
Akayev elatedly stepped forward to meet with him, and Akayev 
firmly shook hands and exchanged greetings with him. Kyrgyz 
girls presented bouquets, bread, and salt to Li Peng to show 
their warm welcome to the honored Chinese guest. 
  A military band played the national anthems of the two 
countries at the airport, where the flags of China and 
Kyrgyzstan fluttered in the breeze. Li Peng, together with 
Akayev, viewed the honor guards. 
  A large banner stating "We warmly welcome Premier Li Peng" 
in 
Chinese characters could be seen hanging down from an airport 
building. Premier Li Peng warmly shook hands with Prime 
Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov and other Kyrgyz Government 
officials. A large, bright, eye-catching, five-starred Chinese 
national flag could be seen among the welcoming crowd. Premier 
Li Peng waved at and greeted the Chinese-flag-waving crowd. 
  Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin and the entire 
diplomatic staff from the embassy were at the airport to welcome 
Premier Li Peng and his delegation. Foreign envoys in 
Kyrgyzstan also welcomed them at the airport. 
  Those arriving at Bishkek on the same plane with Premier Li 
Peng included Zhu Lin, the wife of Li Peng; Ismail Amat, State 
Councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State 
Council Office of Foreign Affairs. 
  Citizens along both sides of the road greeted Li Peng when 
he 
was driven to the state guesthouse in the accompany of Akayev. 
  Premier Li Peng delivered a written speech at the airport. 
He said: China and Kyrgyzstan are friendly neighbors linked by 
mountains and rivers, and they share a common border stretching 
over more than 1,000 km. The friendly contacts between the two 
countries' peoples date back 2,000 years. The "Silk Road," the 
famous belt of friendship that historically linked China with 
the countries of Central and West Asia, ran through this stretch 
of land on which we now stand. 
  He added that the relationship between China and Kyrgyzstan 
has developed in an excellent manner since diplomatic relations 
were established. The successful visit of President Akayev to 
China in 1992 has propelled the development of the neighborly, 
friendly, and mutually beneficial-cooperation relationship 
between the two countries. "I believe that my visit to your 
country will surely further enhance the understanding between 
the two countries, deepen the friendship between the peoples of 
the two countries, expand the mutually beneficial cooperation in 
all spheres, and benefit the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan."

  [Text] Bishkek, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng and President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan today 
agreed to solve the border issue between the two countries 
sometime soon. 
  In two and half hours of formal talks here this morning, the 
two leaders agreed to pace up work to turn previously-reached 
agreements into a legal form and, meanwhile, continue friendly 
negotiations on the remaining issues, according to a Chinese 
spokesman. 
  With sincerity from both sides, the two leaders are 
confident 
that the border issue "will be successfully resolved in not too 
long a time," the spokesman said. 
  Li said that an early agreement on the border issue will be 
of great significance to the enhancement of Sino-Kyrgyz 
relations. He also hoped to see the common border become "a 
bond of peace and friendship as well as a bridge towards the 
promotion of economic prosperity." 
  Akayev, voicing agreement with Li's remarks, said Kyrgyzstan 
hopes to solve the border problem left over from history at an 
early date. China and Kyrgyzstan share more than 1,000 
kilometers of common border. 
  Kyrgyzstan fully understands that an early settlement of the 
border issue will be of great importance to the promotion of 
mutual trust and friendship between the two countries, the 
president said. 
  He described Li's visit as "of historic significance to the 
further promotion of Kyrgyz-Chinese relations." 
  What's more, China's clear-cut principles for developing 
friendly relations with Central Asian nations, which Premier Li 
stated in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent, are of great 
significance to peace and stability in the whole Central Asian 
region, including Kyrgyzstan, he said. 
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China 
plays 
a special positive role in international affairs, he noted, 
adding that Kyrgyzstan will learn from China's experiences, 
including those in handling international relations. 
  He hoped that the two countries would maintain consultations 
and cooperation in international organizations. 
  Li said China is ready to work for the constant growth of 
its 
traditional friendship with Kyrgyzstan. 
  Akayev asked Li to convey his invitation for President Jiang 
Zemin to visit Kyrgyzstan, saying the augment of his country's 
overall cooperation with China is "in the paramount national 
interests of Kyrgyzstan" and represents a priority in its 
foreign policy. 
  Akayev agreed with Li's proposal for building up a new silk 
road, saying Kyrgyzstan will work towards the establishment of 
such a path of cooperation and friendship. 
  "Kyrgyzstan will always see China as a friendly neighbor and 
a reliable partner of Central Asian nations," the spokesman 
quoted Akayev as saying. 
  Akayev, in evaluating the momentum of bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation, said China has become an important trade 
partner of Kyrgyzstan. He expected to see bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation raised to a new high. 
  He also invited Chinese enterprises to invest in Kyrgyzstan. 
A high-level delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs is traveling 
with Premier Li throughout the tour of Central Asia. 
  Kyrgyzstan has set up joint ventures with China's Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region with positive results, he said, adding that 
vast potentials exist in this regard. 
  Li agreed that China and Kyrgyzstan should expand 
cooperation 
in trade, economic, scientific, technological, cultural and 
other fields. 
  While bilateral trade has seen considerable growth in the 
past few years, this has been primarily achieved within border 
trade, Li said. "I agree that bilateral economic trade 
cooperation should be expanded on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit." 
  He said that the Chinese Government adopts a positive 
attitude towards Chinese enterprises' investment in kirghizstan. 
  On regional issues, Li said China supports the maintenance 
of 
central Asian nations' friendly relations with each other and 
with Russia. 
  Akayev said that the central Asian nations' relations with 
Russia are "historically formed over the years and it is very 
important to maintain a good relationship with each other." 
  During the talks, the two leaders also had an in-depth 
exchange of views on other regional issues.

  [Text] Bishkek, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng and Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov of Kyrgyzstan held 
talks here this afternoon on expanding bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  The meeting, covering a wide range of issues, proceeded in a 
practical and in-depth manner, according to a Chinese spokesman. 
  Dzhumagulov said that Kyrgyzstan, which is carrying out 
economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening 
economic ties with China and to learning from its experience, 
especially in rural reform. 
  He said that over 70 Sino-Kyrgyz joint ventures in food 
processing, leather making and other areas are operating 
smoothly. He added that the two sides are considering 
cooperation in public health, paper-making and other fields. 
  Dzhumagulov hoped that the two countries will explore the 
vast potential existing for cooperation in energy, mining, 
agriculture, communications and transportation. 
  He added that cooperation in these fields would not only be 
beneficial to the two countries, but would also have a positive 
impact on the economic prosperity of the region. 
  Premier Li Peng said that the difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan 
are "only temporary, and through effort, will undoubtedly be 
overcome." 
  Referring to the rapid growth of bilateral trade, Li said 
"potentials still exist" and that the Chinese Government, and 
the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in particular, would strive to 
promote trade and economic cooperation with Kyrgyzstan. He said 
that "there has been already a good beginning." 
  Li also said both sides need to create better conditions and 
strive to resolve problems hampering the development of trade 
and economic cooperation. 
  Experts in the two countries should make in-depth studies of 
the large projects proposed by Prime Minister Dzhumagulov on 
cooperation in mining and hydro-power generation, Li said. 
  The Chinese Government encourages Chinese enterprises to 
participate in the economic construction of Kyrgyzstan on the 
basis of equality and mutual benefit, he said. 
  During the talks, Li invited Dzhumagulov to visit China when 
it is convenient for him, and the Kyrgyz premier accepted the 
invitation with pleasure.

  [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, Premier 
Li Peng held wide-ranging and in-depth talks with Kyrgyz Prime 
Minister Apas Dzhumagulov on expanding bilateral economic 
relations and trade. The talks proceeded in a pragmatic and 
friendly [wu shi you hao 0523 1395 0645 1170] atmosphere. 
  Dzhumagulov said: Kyrgyzstan and China enjoy traditional 
friendly relations. These relations are being increasingly 
enriched and constantly developed. 
  He said: Kyrgyzstan, which is currently in a stage of 
economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening 
economic ties with China and to learning from its experiences, 
including those in agricultural reform. 
  He said: Xinjiang and other regions in China have 
established more than 70 joint ventures in Krygyzstan, including 
those engaged in food processing and leather making; these joint 
ventures are operating smoothly. Experts on the two sides are 
considering cooperative projects in papermaking, public health, 
pharmaceuticals, and other fields. 
  Dzhumagulov also briefed Li Peng on Krygyzstan's economic 
situation. 
  Li Peng said: The economic difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan 
during the course of reform are temporary; it is entirely 
possible to overcome them through great efforts. 
  Li Peng said: Over the past two years or so, the two 
countries have successfully initiated economic cooperation and 
trade, and they have made impressive progress. Bilateral trade, 
which has developed rapidly, continues to show potential. The 
Chinese Government -- the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 
particular -- will strive to develop cooperation in trade, 
economics, and other fields with Kyrgyzstan. In the future, the 
two countries should exploit and utilize their favorable 
conditions more fully, act in accordance with the law of the 
economy, ensure that benefits will accrue to both sides, 
constantly introduce diverse forms of cooperation, and improve 
and upgrade their trade. To this end, both sides should create 
better conditions, including those aimed at solving 
communications and transportation problems that are hampering 
the development of economic cooperation and trade. 
  Li Peng added: "A number of entrepreneurs are accompanying 
me on my current trip, thereby enabling the two sides to 
increase contacts. The Chinese Government encourages and 
supports participation by Chinese entrepreneurs in Kyrgyzstan's 
economic construction on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefit." 
  Premier Li Peng invited Prime Minister Dzhumagulov to visit 
China at a convenient time. Dzhumagulov expressed his thanks 
and accepted the invitation with pleasure.

  [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and 
Kyrgyz Republic President Askar Akayev held 150-minute talks at 
the Government Building this morning, during which they had an 
in-depth exchange of views on relations between the two 
countries and on regional issues. The talks proceeded in a 
cordial and friendly [qin qie you hao 6024 0434 0645 1170] 
atmosphere. 
  President Akayev first warmly welcomed Premier Li Peng to 
the 
Kyrgyz Republic. Akayev said emphatically: In his important 
speech in Tashkent, Premier Li Peng set forth China's clear-cut 
principles for developing good-neighborly and friendly relations 
with Central Asian nations. These principles are of great 
significance to peace and stability in Kyrgyzstan and in the 
entire Central Asian region. He maintained that China, as a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council, plays a special 
positive role in international affairs. 
  Akayev noted: As a young country that became independent not 
long ago, Kyrgyzstan needs to learn from China's experiences, 
including those in international activities. He expressed the 
hope that diplomats from the two countries would maintain 
consultations and strengthen cooperation in international 
organizations. 
  Premier Li Peng first conveyed President Jiang Zemin's 
cordial greetings to President Akayev. Li Peng said: China and 
Kyrgyzstan share a common border and a traditional friendship. 
Relations between the two countries have developed smoothly 
since Kyrgyzstan became independent. For its part, China is 
willing to work hard to deepen this friendship continuously. 
Akayev asked Li Peng to convey his regards to President Jiang 
Zemin, as well as his invitation to the latter to visit 
Kyrgyzstan. 
  Akayev said: Strengthening cooperation with China in various 
fields -- political, economic, scientific and technological, and 
cultural -- is in the paramount interests of the Kyrgyz nation; 
it also represents a priority in Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy. 
President Akayev agreed with the idea proposed by Premier Li 
Peng for building a new silk road. He said: Kyrgyzstan will 
work toward this goal so that the new silk road will become a 
path of cooperation and friendship. He noted: Kyrgyzstan will 
always see China as a friendly neighbor of Central Asian 
nations, as well as a cooperative partner that inspires mutual 
trust. 
  On the Sino-Kyrgyz border issue, the two sides maintained 
unanimously: At present, it is necessary to expeditiously turn 
previously concluded agreements into a legal form and implement 
them accordingly. Meanwhile, friendly negotiations on some 
remaining issues should be continued. In light of sincerity on 
both sides, it is believed that the border issue between the two 
countries will be successfully resolved in the not-too-distant 
future. Li Peng said: Reaching a border agreement at an early 
date will be of great significance to strengthening Sino-Kyrgyz 
relations. It is hoped that the border between the two 
countries will become a bond of peace and friendship, as well as 
a bridge leading to economic prosperity. 
  Akayev said: Economic cooperation and trade between the two 
countries have shown strong momentum. China has become an 
important trade partner of Kyrgyzstan's. Kyrgyzstan hopes to 
raise economic relations and trade between the two countries to 
a new level. Chinese enterprises are welcome to invest in 
Kyrgyzstan. He noted: Some of the joint ventures that 
Kyrgyzstan set up along with China's Xinjiang region have 
yielded positive results; there is still vast potential in this 
regard. Akayev also spoke highly of fruitful cooperation 
between scientific and technological personnel from the two 
countries. 
  Li Peng said: China and Kyrgyzstan should strengthen 
cooperation in such fields as economics, trade, science and 
technology, and culture. He noted: "Since Kyrgyzstan became 
independent, trade between the two countries, border trade in 
particular, has grown substantially. I agree that economic 
relations and trade should be further expanded on the basis of 
equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese Government adopts a 
positive attitude toward investment by Chinese entrepreneurs in 
Kyrgyzstan." 
  Premier Li Peng added: China supports the maintenance of 
friendly relations among Central Asian nations and between 
Central Asian nations and Russia. President Akayev said: The 
relations between Central Asian nations and Russia have been 
formed over the years, and it is very important to maintain good 
relations with each other. 
  The two leaders also had an in-depth exchange of views on 
some regional issues.

XINHUA reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)] 
  [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Akayev, president of the 
Republic of Kyrgyzstan, gave a grand banquet at the Wucaiyunshan 
[name as received] Guesthouse, which is located at the foot of 
Tian Shan, this evening to warmly welcome Premier Li Peng and 
his party. 
  Akayev delivered an ebullient speech first. He spoke highly 
of Premier Li Peng's speech in Tashkent and said: China's four 
cardinal principles for developing relations with the Central 
Asian nations have deeply impressed these countries, including 
Kyrgyzstan; they are in the interests of the peoples of all 
Central Asian nations and will have a far-reaching impact on 
maintaining peace and stability in the region. He said: Li 
Peng's remarks that China will always be a good friend and 
neighbor of all Central Asian nations reached every family in 
the region within a couple of days. 
  Akayev added: The whole world knows that under the guidance 
of Deng Xiaoping, the reverend chief designer, reform and 
opening up have brought about astonishing economic development 
in China in the late 20th century. He praised China for having 
found the correct path of development and having become a 
successful model of revitalizing the economy among developing 
countries. 
  Premier Li Peng said in his reply: "My visit to four Central 
Asian countries is aimed at deepening understanding, promoting 
friendship, and expanding development. Judged by the conditions 
in the three countries I have visited, this goal will surely be 
achieved." 
  He said: "His excellency the president has just highly 
evaluated China's achievements over the past decade or so, and I 
extend my sincere gratitude for his remarks. However, I would 
also like to say that China has indeed undergone some 
significant changes, but we have also met with some difficulties 
and problems in the course of forging ahead. We have the 
confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee with President Jiang Zemin as the core, we will 
overcome one difficulty after another and constantly push our 
cause forward." 
  Li Peng said: Situations differ in various countries; all 
countries should search for a course of development suitable to 
their respective conditions, and Kyrgyzstan is doing this 
presently. He said: It is hard for a young country which has 
just become independent to avoid having some difficulties, and 
"I believe that the Kyrgyz people have the ability and wisdom to 
overcome the temporary difficulties, to constantly achieve fresh 
progress on the path of development, and to gradually realize 
prosperity." 
  Li Peng said: The towering and giant Tian Shan will not cut 
off the friendship between the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan; 
it should become a link connecting the two countries. China 
will always live in a friendly manner with Kyrgyzstan and other 
Central Asian nations, as well as its northern neighbors such as 
Russia, and it will always seek common development through 
mutual benefit and cooperation. 
  Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife; Ismail Amat, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of 
Foreign Affairs under the State Council; and others were invited 
to the banquet. Also attending the banquet were President 
Akayev's wife; Prime Minister Dzhumagulov and his wife; Supreme 
Soviet Chairman Sherimkulov and his wife, and other high-ranking 
Kyrgyz officials.

Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504): "Tian Shan, a Bridge of 
Friendship"] 
  [Text] Bishkek, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- Bishkek, situated at the 
foot of Tian Shan, has in the last several days been enveloped 
in an atmosphere of Sino-Kyrgyz friendship. The arrival of 
Premier Li Peng has further deepened and harmonized the 
friendship between the two peoples living on both sides of Tian 
Shan. 
  "Love begins with the first meeting." President Akayev 
warmly used this Kyrgyz proverb to describe how Kyrgyzstan is 
developing its relations with China. Following talks with 
Premier Li Peng, he told us: "My understanding of China began 
with my visit to China in 1992. Premier Li Peng's current visit 
to Kyrgyzstan serves to make him understand Kyrgyzstan better 
and to complete the stage of mutual understanding. The time for 
carrying out very effective cooperation has finally arrived." 
Akayev made a general summary in the following terms of the 
development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and China since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations: "We have solved 
the three most important issues over the last two years. First, 
we have enhanced our neighborly and friendly relations. Second, 
we have laid a legal foundation for cooperation. Third, we have 
begun consultations on international and regional affairs." 
  Kyrgyz leaders consider Premier Li Peng the "brother and 
friend" of the Kyrgyz people and they expressed deep emotion 
toward the honorable Chinese guest and toward the Chinese 
people. At many occasions, be it at the airport, at the elegant 
state guesthouse, and at the lively banquet, President Akayev 
and Premier Li Peng talked freely about friendship, exchanged 
views, and explored ways of cooperation. The scheduled one-hour 
official talks continued, as the passage of time was not 
noticed, for two and a half hours in a sincere and friendly 
atmosphere. At the ceremony for signing six important 
documents, the two leaders wore smiles of contentment. 
  Strengthening economic and trade cooperation was one of 
Premier Li Peng's important intentions during the visit to 
Kyrgyzstan. He carried out with Prime Minister Abbas 
Dzhumagulov an in-depth exchange of views on some major 
cooperation projects in a pragmatic atmosphere. No sooner had 
the Chinese entrepreneurs who accompanied Premier Li Peng's 
visit arrived in Bishkek than they got in contact with and held 
talks with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The two countries' 
businessmen signed letters of intent for cooperation in 
engineering projects and gold mining, as well as in other areas 
of mutual interest. As a matter of fact, Sino-Kyrgyz 
cooperation has already borne satisfactory fruits in some 
sectors. At the hotel where we stayed, we had the luck of 
enjoying Chinese-style noodles. The restaurant's manageress told 
us that the instant noodles produced by "Ketelapu," a 
Sino-Kyrgyz joint venture, are much loved by the Kyrgyz people 
and can be enjoyed at all local restaurants. President Akayev 
had also recently mentioned this noodle factory, which is a 
model for joint ventures, to Chinese reporters. Its fine dried 
noodles and instant noodles have not only met the demands of the 
Kyrgyz market but have also been exported to other countries, 
including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Therefore, the Kyrgyz 
Government awarded the state's highest honor certificate to 
Liang Chuansen, the former manager of this plant who had worked 
so hard to set up the plant. 
  "Expanding and deepening the cooperation between the two 
countries are quite necessary and will benefit the two 
countries." This remark by Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov 
speaks volumes about the wish shared by the business circles of 
the two countries. 
  Kyrgyzstan's radio station began its morning broadcast amid 
melodious music. The first news report was Premier Li Peng's 
goodwill visit to this mountainous country. The first video 
news report carried by the state television station's evening 
news program was the lively scene of Premier Li Peng's visit. 
Local media evaluated Premier Li Peng's visit highly. To cite 
just a few of them: "Premier Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan is a 
major event of historical significance," "His visit will turn a 
new page in the Kyrgyz-Chinese relationship," "The friendly 
messenger from a great neighboring country is building a new 
Silk Road"..... Premier Li Peng's remark that "China is willing 
to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with 
countries in Central Asia" was broadcast over the radiowaves to 
hundreds and thousands of households. Information officials at 
the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry told us that in the last several 
days, newspapers and radio and television stations in Kyrgyzstan 
have carried extensive report on China and have praised China's 
recent construction achievements. In Tashkent, Premier Li Peng 
delivered a speech in which he declared in a firm and friendly 
manner that China will always be a "good friend and good 
neighbor" of the peoples of Central Asia. This has further left 
a deep impression in the minds of the people. 
  Under the bright sunshine, the rolling Tian Shan looks great 
and magnificent. Today, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese 
and Kyrgyz leaders, the mountain chain linking the territories 
of the two countries is becoming a strong link of friendship and 
cooperation between the two peoples.

that the documents just signed by the two countries were very 
important to strengthening the good-neighborly relations and 
friendly cooperation between the two countries. 
  Premier Li Peng said: My visit has promoted bilateral 
friendship and understanding as well as laid a good foundation 
for further cooperation between China and Kyrgyzstan. He 
expressed his hope that the Central Asian region would enjoy 
stability and development and that the people's living standards 
would improve constantly. 
  Li Peng asked the Kyrgyz media to convey the Chinese 
people's 
regards to their Kyrgyz counterparts.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], April 22 (XINHUA) -- Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev said here today that 
the Chinese premier's upcoming visit will enhance the 
traditionally friendly relations between China and Kazakhstan. 
  He told XINHUA that the good neighborly relations between 
the 
Chinese and Kazakhstan people are centuries long, and many 
common elements bring the two peoples together. 
  He added that the joint statement on Sino-Kazakh friendly 
relations signed in Beijing last fall was an historic document 
of great significance, paving the way for long-term and steady 
development of bilateral relations. 
  On economic cooperation, Nazarbayev said that the two 
countries have established 150 joint ventures in Kazakhstan. He 
hoped these joint ventures will develop rapidly. 
  On the domestic economic situation, he said Kazakhstan is 
rich in natural resources and has tremendous potential economic 
power. But the disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed 
the economic connection between the former Soviet Republics. 
The economic situation and the people's lives have been 
seriously affected. 
  He said Kazakhstan is carrying out industrial structural 
reform aimed at transforming a raw material economy into a 
high-tech oriented market economy. 
  He added that Kazakhstan is creating investment laws to 
better attract more foreign investment, introducing more foreign 
technology and improving management.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Zhanlin (1327 0594 2651)] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- President Nazarbayev of 
Kazakshtan pointed out that friendly relations between 
Kazakhstan and China cannot be reversed. He believed Premier Li 
Peng's visit to Kazakhstan would give fresh impetus to further 
developing traditionally friendly relations between the two 
countries. 
  President Nazarbayev made the above statement when receiving 
a written interview by a XINHUA reporter before Premier Li 
Peng's visit. 
  He said: Kazakh and Chinese peoples have been living as 
next- door neighbors for generations, exchanging visits with 
each other, and supplying each other's needs. Many common 
elements have brought us together. Kazakhstan has established 
ties with the PRC on the basis of equality, respect for 
independence and territorial integrity, and mutual 
non-interference in internal affairs. The joint statement on 
the foundation of Kazakh-Chinese friendly relations signed in 
Beijing last fall between leaders of the two countries was a 
document of historic significance which paved the way for 
long-term and steady development of bilateral ties. 
  On economic cooperation between the two countries, 
Nazarbayev 
pointed out that there are over 150 Kazakh-Chinese joint 
ventures and 13 Chinese shops in Kazakhstan. He hoped the 
number would continue to increase. He said emphatically: It is 
absolutely possible for Kazakh-Chinese economic and trade 
relations to develop faster. We can utilize Chinese investment 
to process raw and semifinished materials and export finished 
products to China. 
  On the domestic economic situation, Nazarbayev said: 
Kazakhstan has abundant mineral deposits and other natural 
resources and tremendous economic potential. However, the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed the economic 
links between its republics and seriously affected the economic 
situation and people's lives. He pointed out: Kazakhstan is 
carrying out a systematic industrial structural reform to change 
its position as a producer of raw and semifinished materials, 
and to lay the foundation for modern high- technology 
production. He said emphatically: Kazakhstan's strategy for 
development is to build a market economy which will enable its 
economy to meet up with world standards in the shortest time 
possible. 
  President Nazarbayev said: Kazakhstan relies mainly on 
itself to push forward economic reform. However, it will not be 
able to reach its expected goal if it fails to extensively 
attract foreign investment, or if it does not possess advanced 
technology and techniques and modern management methods. He 
said: Kazakhstan is drafting a foreign investment law to set 
the stage for attracting foreign investment.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China supports the 
idea of expanding the U.N. Security Council at the proper time, 
China's foreign minister told his Egyptian counterpart in talks 
here today. 
  Qian Qichen, who is also a vice-premier, added that the 
regional distribution principle, especially how to reach balance 
between the developing and developed countries, should be taken 
into account in the reform of the U.N. Security Council. 
  'Amr Musa, Egypt's foreign minister, agreed with Qian's 
views 
on this issue. The two foreign ministers also reached extensive 
consensus on the international situation and bilateral ties in 
their talks. 
  Qian said that yesterday's talks between Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak and Chinese President Jiang Zemin were very good, 
and he was convinced that the current visit of Mubarak would 
enhance Sino- Egyptian relations. 
  Musa said that in recent years, the bilateral ties had 
developed smoothly and steadily. The two countries should 
explore new ways of economic and trade cooperation in order to 
promote the equal and mutually-beneficial cooperative relations, 
he said. 
  Touching on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Qian said 
that China was deeply worried about the conflict in the region, 
which has lasted for a long time, and heartily sympathized with 
people there. 
  The Chinese Government sincerely hoped that all the parties 
involved would take the people's interests into consideration 
and at once stop the conflict and all hostile activities, Qian 
said. 
  China was also concerned with the deteriorating situation in 
Gorazde, he said, adding that the Chinese Government held that 
the problem should be solved by peaceful means rather than by 
actions which would make the situation more complicated. 
  China's foreign minister said that China, along with the 
international community, would continue to promote the peace 
process in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spare no effort to help 
national reconciliation to be reached and people there to shake 
off the sufferings brought by the war. 
  Musa told Qian that Egypt was concerned about the problem, 
especially the suffering and unfair treatment of the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He pointed out that the United Nations and international 
communities should take effective actions to end the war in the 
region. 
  The two foreign ministers also discussed such problems as 
the 
situation in the Persian Gulf, the nuclear issue in the Korean 
peninsula, and the non-aligned countries movement.

<F P=106> [Remarks by President Husni Mubarak in response to questions </F>
from unidentified correspondents following a visit to the 
economic and technological development area in Beijing on 22 
April-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you view 
prospects for Egyptian-Chinese cooperation in the technological 
fields? 
  [Mubarak] There is cooperation between Egypt and China in 
many fields. I hope this cooperation will continue. China has 
a great deal of potential and capabilities and we can benefit 
from them. The similarity between Egypt and China in many 
aspects calls on us to maintain that cooperation and enhance it. 
  China is a Third World country. It is a big state that has 
strong determination. Everyone here must work; there is no room 
here for empty talk. I admire the Chinese for their 
determination to develop and progress. They see world progress 
and work to develop themselves. The type of development we have 
seen, in fields like journalism and communications, calls for 
admiration. China is a Third World state and we have always 
called for cooperation with it within the framework of 
south-south cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] How can we benefit from China's experience 
in 
increasing rates of development while sustaining political, 
economic, and social stability in the country in spite of the 
huge population, and how can this experience benefit us in 
economic reform and openness? 
  [Mubarak] You know that we always consult with China in the 
areas of development. China's development rate might have been 
very high. However, many disadvantages were involved. The 
Chinese decided to reduce these rates. When the rates resulted 
in very high standards, prices increased. A steep drop in these 
rates involved a number of problems, too. They are trying to 
determine the rate that suits the citizens most. This is 
exactly what we are doing. They keep social justice and the 
quality of the citizens' lives in mind. The same thing happens 
with us. In all our actions, we must see how the citizen will 
cope. Sometimes our citizens complain of increasing prices, but 
[words indistinct] are unavoidable. Problems arise [words 
indistinct] and it is the same with China. 
  [Correspondent] China is a nuclear state. What is the 
Chinese stance on your call for making the Middle East free from 
weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons? 
  [Mubarak] I am making this call. Being a nuclear state 
itself, America is making the same call. Why should I talk 
about America or China? Why should I get involved in such an 
issue? All countries agree that the Middle East should be free 
from nuclear and chemical weapons. 
  [Correspondent] What about the talks between Your Excellency 
and the Chinese president? 
  [Mubarak] We have excellent relations with China. We are 
linked by very strong ties. The first time I visited China was 
on 17 April 1976, when I was vice president. As an Egyptian 
citizen, I share the same problems with the Chinese citizens. 
  We talked with the Chinese president about all international 
issues. We have almost the same views and have no differences 
as to how to tackle international issues. China has supported 
Arab rights in the Middle East issue from the outset. It has 
adopted noble stances regarding the Arab nation, particularly 
Egypt. Of course we discussed bilateral relations. I think 
that scopes of cooperation are very wide. Thank you.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 22 Apr (MENA)--Following meetings today 
with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen and the Arab and 
African ambassadors here, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said that 
the talks with Chinese officials dealt with bilateral relations 
and issues regarding investment, trade, and technical and 
economic cooperation. 
  The foreign minister said that the talks also touched on the 
international economic and political situation; the problems in 
Asia, Africa, and the Arab world; and the issues that are under 
discussion at the United Nations. 
  'Amr Musa said: We also discussed the UN and Security 
Council roles because China is a permanent member. We reviewed 
the ongoing study to increase the number of the council's 
permanent members. 
  Responding to a question about the issues focused on during 
talks with Chinese officials, the foreign minister said that the 
talks centered on all important issues, including the grave 
situation in Bosnia, the continued Serbian aggression, and the 
inaction prevailing at the Security Council. Musa added: We 
also discussed the existing problems in Africa, including the 
situation in Somalia, Rwanda, and the developments in South 
Africa. The talks also touched on Libya and the Lockerbie 
issue, Musa said. 
  Continuing, the foreign minister said: The talks also 
focused on developments in the Middle East peace process. The 
two sides discussed certain problems in Asia, such as the Korean 
problem and the situation in the Pacific, he added. [passage 
omitted] 
  Responding to a question on Egypt's ability to compete in 
the 
world market, the foreign minister said: Certainly, we can 
compete in the world market because everyone has a chance. 
Take, for example, countries like Malaysia and Singapore, who 
are part of the competition game. Egypt can do the same. 
  The foreign minister said that the trade balance between 
Egypt and China is estimated at $200 million. We import Chinese 
goods worth $140 million, and our export to China is $60 
million. [passage omitted]

chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) on the ongoing Middle East peace process. 
  Wang, who arrived here today with a 10-member CPPCC

Resolutions," he said. 
  Wang said that as one of the U.N. Security Council members, 
China will continue to make efforts for a peaceful solution to 
the Arab- Israeli conflict so as to realize peace in the region 
as early as possible. 
  For the difficulties Jordan is facing, Wang said, China 
expressed its understanding and sympathy. China supports 
Jordan's rational demands, he added. 
  Wang, who came here at the invitation of Ahmed al-Lawzi,

  On his part, al-Majali said Jordan has suffered a great deal 
in its effort to realize peace in the Middle East. 
  The prime minister asked China to exert its influence for a 
peaceful solution to the Middle East problem. He also called on 
the U.N. to shoulder the responsibility of implementing relevant 
U.N. resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338, on the 
Middle East issue. 
  Earlier today, Wang met with al-Lawzi and discussed with him 
the Middle East peace process and bilateral relations.
