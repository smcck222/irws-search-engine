  [Text] Wen Shizhen, executive vice governor of Liaoning 
Province, received the friendly delegation headed by (Elson 
Towpair), governor of Baden-Wurttemberg Lander of Germany, at 
the Youyi Hotel on the afternoon of 23 April. 
  During the reception Wen Shizhen extended a warm welcome on 
behalf of the province's 40 million people to the visit paid by 
the German friendship delegation. He said: The eight-year 
cooperative course traversed by the province and the lander has 
enabled us to realize that the potential of developing 
cooperation between the two sides and supplement each other with 
our strong points is tremendous and the prospects in this regard 
are broad. It is hoped that the governments of the province and 
the lander, as well as personages in various social circles, 
treasure the achievements scored in the cooperation and 
coordinate with each other in developing economic and technical 
cooperation so as to promote the development of friendly and 
economic relations between the province and the lander. 
  During the reception, Governor (Towpair) expressed thanks 
for 
the invitation extended and the enthusiastic hospitality shown 
by the Liaoning Provincial People's Government. After reviewing 
the several-year contacts made by both sides, he said: The 
visit paid by the 110-member friendship and economic delegation 
to Liaoning is aimed at strengthening the friendly relationship 
between the lander and the province and probing into the 
cooperation with Liaoning in the fields of economy, trade, 
culture, and education. 
  After the reception, Vice Governor Wen Shizhen held a 
working 
meeting with Governor (Towpair) on the matters regarding 
developing friendly relationship between the two sides in the 
future and promoting economic and technical cooperation. During 
the meeting, both sides exchanged opinions based on obtaining 
common understanding and probed into the plans. 
  In the morning of that day Quan Shuren, chairman of the 
Liaoning Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, 
received in Shenyang the friendship delegation headed by (Elson 
Towpair), governor of Baden-Wurttemberg Lander of Germany. 
During the reception, Quan Shuren warmly welcomed the visit 
paid by the German delegation. He said: Since 1979, the 
province and the German lander have established the cooperative 
relationship and over the past 15 years the province and the 
lander have scored certain achievements in the exchanges and 
cooperation of the economy, education, and culture. Governor 
(Towpair) expressed appreciation for the enthusiastic reception 
given by Chairman Quan Shuren. After reviewing the several-year 
contacts made by both sides, he said: We are fully confident in 
the economic development of Liaoning after having witnessed the 
changes scored by Liaoning over the past few years. Therefore, 
we organized a large friendship and economic delegation composed 
of 110 members and came to Liaoning to pay a visit. We are very 
interested in having economic cooperation with Liaoning. Quan 
Shuren also told Governor (Towpair) that the contact and 
cooperation between the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress 
Standing Committee and the lander parliament should be enhanced 
in the future. 
  Attending the reception were Qi Zheng, Hu Jiyan, (Zhang 
Wenzhu), and Tao Jingyan.

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the 
External Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress 
[NPC] issued a statement today in connection with a report on 
Sino-British relations issued by the British Parliament's House 
of Commons External Affairs Committee. The statement severely 
denounces the British side for crudely interfering in China's 
internal affairs. The following is the full text of the 
spokesman's statement: 
  Since the beginning of last year, the British Parliament's 
House of Commons External Affairs Committee has held several 
hearings on the so-called China issue. On 13 April the 
committee published a report: "British-Sino Relations Before and 
After 1997." The report openly advocated [gu chui 7849 0706] 
the adoption of a policy of further confrontation against China 
on the Hong Kong issue and preposterously commented on China's 
domestic affairs, thus crudely interfering in China's internal 
affairs. In this regard we express our strong indignation and 
regret. 
  On the Hong Kong issue, the report actually admitted that 
the 
British side, proceeding from its erroneous appraisal of the 
prospects for the development of the situation in China, indeed 
changed its policy toward Hong Kong, supported Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten's erroneous way of doing things on the 
Hong Kong issue, continued to pursue confrontation against 
China, and even agitated for [gu dong 7849 0520] "international 
support" on the Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by the British 
Parliament's House of Commons External Affairs Committee's 
actually issuing such a document and adopting such a position on 
the Hong Kong issue at a time when the truth of the controversy 
between China and Britain over the question of the political 
system in Hong Kong is being understood by more and more people 
and when the British side indicated time and again its desire to 
cooperate with China in other spheres. 
  The report preposterously claimed that by 1997 China may not 
necessarily change the framework for the three-level political 
system established according to the Hong Kong governor's "three 
violations" program. The Chinese Government has stated many 
times that in order to safeguard the dignity of the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Legislative Council and 
regional organizations established according to the Hong Kong 
governor's program can exist only until 30 June 1997. After 
that, the first government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR], its Legislative Council, and 
regional organizations must be established according to the 
Basic Law. We resolutely support this solemn position of the 
Chinese Government. 
  The report went so far as to attack Article 18 and Article 
158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's 
Republic of China, claiming that these articles are "a serious 
potential threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR and to the 
implementation of the joint declaration." 
  In accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the 
Basic Law, the NPC Standing Committee has the power to decide, 
when necessary, to place Hong Kong SAR in a state of emergency. 
Article 158 of the Basic Law stipulates that the power of 
interpretation of this law shall be vested in the NPC Standing 
Committee. These provisions are concrete expressions that the 
Chinese Government resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong beginning on 1 July 1997. The report's attack on these 
provisions is utterly unjustifiable; it only reveals British 
true motive to attempt to extend its control over and influence 
on Hong Kong. 
  The report takes great pains to advocate promotion of 
democracy and safeguard of human rights in Hong Kong. This only 
makes people see through more clearly British hypocrisy and 
ulterior motives on the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese Government 
has pointed out on numerous occasions that the essence of 
controversy over Hong Kong's political structure is not a 
question of, indeed, whether to develop democracy or not; rather 
it is a question of whether to observe international commitment 
and whether to bring about the convergence with the Basic Law 
and achieve Hong Kong's stable transition. Facts speak louder 
than words. It was the Chinese Government which, in accordance 
with the policy of "one country, two systems," at the earliest 
proposed practicing "a high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong and 
"Hong Kong be governed by the Hong Kong people themselves." The 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR also has adequate, specific 
provisions on the development of democracy and the rights and 
freedom to be enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong's 
return to the embrace of the motherland. Under the British rule 
of more than 100 years, when did Hong Kong enjoy democracy and 
human rights? Even today, Britain still uses "Letters Patent," 
"Royal Instructions," and similar statutes of colonial rule to 
govern Hong Kong. What qualifications does it have to talk 
glibly about Hong Kong's democracy and human rights? Now that 
only a few years before its withdrawal from Hong Kong, Britain 
hypocritically and hurriedly talks volubly about what it calls 
democracy and human rights. Its true motives are like "Sima 
Zhao's ill intent known to all" [the villain's design is 
obvious]. It merely tries to divide Hong Kong people and create 
chaos there. 
  The British House of Commons External Affairs Committee's 
report proposes the establishment of so-called human rights 
commission and human rights monitoring organization in Hong 
Kong. The goal is nothing other than to place new obstacles to 
Hong Kong's smooth transition. The British should understand 
that as in the case of the political framework, any decision 
unilaterally made by the British side during the transitional 
period on major matters spanning beyond 1997 will not be 
recognized by the Chinese side. 
  The report also brazenly attempted to meddle and interfere 
in 
China's internal affairs by openly advocating Tibet's self- 
determination. As is known to all, Tibet has been an 
inalienable part of the Chinese territory since ancient times. 
Before 1959, a feudal serf system was practiced there, which 
went even further than the system practiced in the Middle Ages 
in Europe in terms of darkness and cruelty. It is safe to say 
that old Tibet was one of the regions in the world where human 
rights were infringed upon most seriously. After abolishing the 
feudal serf system, Tibet has taken the broad road of national 
unity and economic development, with people living and working 
in peace and contentment. This is a change of epoch-making 
significance in safeguarding human rights and promoting social 
progress. 
  The writer of the report dislikes such change but extols 
those serf owners who trampled on human rights as "defenders of 
human rights." This greatly ridicules human rights. In fact, 
they did that in order to sabotage the unification and national 
unity of China. May we offer a piece of advice to the writer of 
the report -- that it would be better to take a prudent attitude 
on the issue of Tibet because of Britain's historical role in 
the past. We want to sternly point out that all attempts to 
interfere in China's internal affairs by using the so-called 
Tibet issue will be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese 
people, including the compatriots of Tibetan nationality, and 
that their attempts can never succeed. 
  The External Affairs Committee of the British House of 
Commons has also suggested that the British parliament should 
make contacts with Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" and has asked the 
British Government to relax its restrictions toward Taiwan. It 
should be pointed out that there is only one China in the world, 
that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the People's Republic 
of China is the sole legitimate government representing the 
whole China. This has long been publicly recognized by the 
international society. The absurd remarks made by the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons related to the 
Taiwan issue runs counter to the principle for the establishment 
of diplomatic relations between China and the United Kingdom. 
The real intention of the committee is to create "two Chinas" 
or "one China, one Taiwan." This will be resolutely opposed by 
the entire Chinese people, including people in Taiwan. 
  The report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British 
House of Commons also publicized "the Chinese threat" with an 
ulterior motive in order to sow dissension between China and her 
neighboring countries. All people know that China has always 
followed an independent, peaceful foreign policy. China is a 
positive factor in safeguarding peace and stability in the 
world. Those who fabricate "the Chinese threat" are totally 
groundless and their efforts will be futile. 
  The External Affairs Committee of the Chinese NPC has 
attached great importance to maintaining and developing friendly 
relations and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the British parliament. The Chinese side has never done 
anything which would harm the United Kingdom, the British 
parliament, or relations between the two countries. However, 
recently some people of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
British House of Commons have repeatedly done things which will 
harm relations between the two countries, while they have also 
stressed the need to maintain and develop Sino-British 
relations. People cannot but ask: What is their intention? 
Where do they want to lead relations between the two countries? 
We can say with certainty that the viewpoints and suggestions 
which are hostile to China put forward in the report are not 
only extremely harmful to Sino-British relations but will also 
bring harm to the long-term interests of the United Kingdom. We 
believe that those things will be disliked [bu yuan kan dao di 
0008 1959 4170 0451 4104] by those who truly show concern for 
and protect the traditional friendly relations between China and 
the United Kingdom.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
and its entire people including compatriots of the Tibetan 
nationality are firmly opposed to any attempts to use the 
so-called Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal affairs. 
  These attempts will never be realized, said a spokesman for 
the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National People's 
Congress (NPC) here today while commenting on a report related 
to the relations between Britain and China before and after 
1997, issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British 
House of Commons on April 13. 
  The spokesman said the report advocated self-determination 
of 
Tibet in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. 
  It is known to all that since ancient times, he noted, Tibet 
has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory. 
  Before 1959, he said, a system of feudal serfdom was 
practiced in Tibet, an insidious oppression darker and more 
cruel than that of the Middle Ages in Europe. 
  The spokesman said old Tibet was one of the regions in the 
world which suffered most seriously from violations of human 
rights. After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march 
down the road of national unity, economic development and people 
living in peace and contentment. 
  This is a reform of epoch-making significance toward 
safeguarding human rights and promoting social progress, he said. 
  But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind 
of 
change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners who 
trampled human rights as "guards of human rights," which he said 
pokes great fun at human rights. 
  The purpose of making such claims is in fact to attempt to 
sabotage China's reunification and national unity, he said. 
  The spokesman said: "We advise them to take a cautious 
attitude toward the issue of Tibet in light of what part Britain 
has played in history." 
  The spokesman said the British House of Commons also 
suggests 
strengthening the ties between the British Parliament and 
Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan", calling on the British Government 
to ease its restrictions on Taiwan. 
  He pointed out that there is only one China in the world, 
and 
Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the People's 
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing 
China, which he said has been recognized by the world community. 
  The spokesman said that the points of view on the issue of 
Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of 
Commons run counter to the principles concerning the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Britain. 
  Its real aim is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one 
Taiwan", which is firmly opposed by the entire Chinese populace 
including the people of Taiwan, he said. 
  The report also has the ulterior motive to advocate "China 
threat" so as to undermine the relations between China and its 
neighboring countries. 
  It is known to all that China pursues an independent foreign 
policy of peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world 
peace and stability. So talk of "China threat" is totally 
groundless and works in vain. The spokesman said that the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC attaches great importance 
to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation 
with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of 
Commons. 
  The Chinese side does not do anything harmful to Britain and 
the British Parliament as well as to Sino-British ties. 
  But, he said, some from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
British House of Commons have recently repeatedly done harm to 
Sino- British relations while stressing maintaining and 
developing Sino- British relations. 
  "We should ask what their motives are and where they will 
lead to in bilateral relations," he said. 
  It is certain that the views and suggestions against China 
that the report has raised will bring harm not only to 
Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term interests of 
Britain, he stressed. 
  "We believe that those who really care for and want to 
safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral relations are not 
willing to see such kinds of results," the spokesman added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Foreign Affairs 
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) has today 
expressed its strong indignation and regret over the report on 
Sino- British relations issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee 
of the British House of Commons. 
  A spokesman for the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee said the 
report openly advocated the adoption of a confrontational policy 
toward China and made random comments on China's internal 
affairs while unscrupulously interfering in China's internal 
affairs. 
  The report issued on April 13 admits to the British side's 
change of policy on Hong Kong and its support of Chris Patten's 
wrong practices in Hong Kong, proceeding from its inaccurate 
assessment of the current situation and the prospects in China. 
  While continuing to adopt the policy of confrontation with 
China, the report even advocates seeking international support 
over Hong Kong issue. 
  The NPC Foreign Affairs Committee is shocked by the report 
at 
a time when the British side has repeatedly stated that it would 
cooperate with China on other issues now that the truth of the 
disputes on Hong Kong's political system has been made clear to 
the public. 
  The report has wrongly claimed that China will not 
necessarily change the three-level political framework 
established by the Hong Kong governor in violation of the 
Sino-British Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the bilateral understandings reached 
by the two sides before. 
  The report even openly attacked some articles in the Basic 
Law which provide that the NPC Standing Committee has the right 
to announce a state of emergency in Hong Kong when necessary and 
that the right to explain the basic law lies with the NPC 
Standing Committee. However, the report claims the articles as 
a serious potential threat to the Special Administrative Region 
of Hong Kong, thus revealing the true motive of the British side 
to attempt to prolong its control and influence over Hong Kong. 
  The promotion of democracy and the safeguarding of human 
rights in Hong Kong as advocated in the report has revealed the 
hypocrisy of the British side, the spokesman said. The essence 
of the disputes over Hong Kong's political system is whether or 
not to abide by international commitment and whether or not to 
ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong in line with the basic 
law. The basic law has provided adequate and specific 
provisions on the development of democracy in Hong Kong after 
the Special Administrative Region is established. There has 
been no democracy or human rights to speak of over the past 
century or more while the British codes for colonies have still 
governed Hong Kong. To make much fanfare about democracy and 
human rights just a few years before the ending of its rule over 
Hong Kong is nothing but to create confusion, the spokesman said. 
  The report also suggests that a human rights committee and 
human rights supervision agency be established in Hong Kong. 
The purpose is to create new barriers for smooth transition of 
the sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Chinese side will not 
recognize British unilateral decision on major affairs extending 
beyond 1997, according to the spokesman.

<F P=106> [by Gao Jianxin] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Jurists here said that 
the recently-issued British report on Sino-British relations 
deliberately confuses right and wrong, tries to create chaos and 
wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs. 
  The British report referring to relations between Britain 
and 
China before and after 1997 was issued by the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the British House of Commons on April 13. 
  The report indicated that in total disregard of the 
interests 
of Hong Kong residents, Britain insists on taking the path of 
confrontation with China, the jurists noted. 
  They said that the attacks launched by the report on the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region serves 
to expose the ill intentions of Britain. 
  Every article of the Basic Law reflects the fundamental 
interests of the Hong Kong people, they said. 
  However, the report went so far as to attack Article 18 and 
Article 158 of the Basic Law as a "serious potential threat" to 
the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and 
the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  That attack is "untolerable and without any reason," the 
jurists said. 
  Article 18 of the Basic Law states that in the event of the 
Standing Committee of National People's Congress (NPC) deciding 
to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which endangers national 
unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of 
the region, deciding that the region is in a state of emergency, 
the central people's government may issue an order applying the 
relevant national laws in the region. 
  The jurists agreed that such a turmoil not only endangers 
national unity and security, but also seriously damages Hong 
Kong's stability and prosperity, as well as the safety of Hong 
Kong people's lives and property. 
  In the event of such a turmoil, China's central government 
must act promptly and the NPC Standing Committee must declare a 
state of emergency in Hong Kong, the jurists said. 
  Only by doing so will it be possible to put a swift end to 
the turmoil in order to maintain China's unity and security, and 
to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and Hong Kong 
people's lives and property, they pointed out. 
  The jurists explained that as regards other types of turmoil 
or riots, such as riots resulting from serious natural 
disasters, economic crisis or other social problems, as long as 
they do not endanger China's unity or security and are not so 
grave as to be beyond the control of the government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Hong Kong SAR 
Government will handle them independently. 
  Anyone with common sense can conclude that the attack by the 
British report on Article 18 of the Basic Law is "totally 
groundless," the jurists said. 
  Article 158 of the Basic Law states that the power of 
interpretation of the Basic Law shall be vested with the NPC 
Standing Committee. 
  Jurist Wang Shuwen, who is also an NPC Standing Committee 
member, said that the Basic Law was formulated by the NPC 
Standing Committee, so its interpretation involves China's 
sovereignty. 
  That article also states that the courts of the Hong Kong 
SAR 
may also interpret other provisions of the Basic Law in 
adjudication cases. 
  It also stipulates that the NPC Standing Committee shall 
consult its committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR 
before giving an interpretation of this law. 
  Half of the committee's 12 members are from Hong Kong. 
  Article 158 of the Basic Law makes sure that in adjudication 
cases, courts of the Hong Kong SAR enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy in interpreting all provisions of the Basic Law. 
  In attacking the two articles of the Basic Law, the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons had ulterior 
motives, Wang said. 
  The articles 18 and 158 serve as a "reliable guarantee" for 
a 
high degree of autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR, Wang added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A memorial meeting 
for Arthur Clegg (1914-1994) who died in Yorkshire in February, 
a long- time British friend of the Chinese people, was held here 
today. 
  He was one of the founders of the China Campaign Committee 
(CCC), which was set up in 1937 when the Sino-Japanese war broke 
out. He worked tirelessly to draw trade unionists, 
working-class activists and public figures into aiding and 
supporting China's resistance to Japanese invasion. 
  Clegg published three books on China: "The Birth of New 
China" (1943), "New China, New World" (1949), and "Aid China, 
1937-49 -- A Memoir of a Forgotten Campaign" (1989). 
  Right until his death on February 8, Arthur Clegg showed a 
keen interest in China's modernization drive. He told his 
daughter that he appreciated China's "building a market economy 
within the framework of socialism". 
  He also expressed the belief that China would solve the Hong 
Kong problem well. 
  Among those attending today's meeting were Huang Hua, 
president of the China Society for People's Friendship Studies 
(CSPFS), and friends and former colleagues. 
  Israel Epstein, vice-president of the CSPFS, and Clegg's 
daughter Jenny Clegg were among those who spoke at the meeting.

  [Text] Shanghai, China's leading supplier of nuclear power 
generating equipment, has banded together the city's strongest 
scientific and technological talent to add impetus to the 
country's nuclear industry. 
  The Professional Committee of Nuclear Power Equipment, under 
the Shanghai Institute of Atomic Science and Technology, has 
recruited 265 individuals and 29 groups as members. 
  The group members are large and medium-sized enterprises 
that 
make equipment for nuclear power stations, including the 
Shanghai Boiler Factory, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and 
the Shanghai No 1 Machine Tool Works. 
  "The Professional Committee is expected to reinforce local 
academic research on civil nuclear energy and to supply local 
manufacturers with more advanced technology," said Wang Zurong, 
the committee's director. 
  Wang is also managing director of the Shanghai Nuclear Power 
Office. 
  Local manufacturers have seen the domestic market blossom as 
provinces like Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and 
Guangdong are planning to build nuclear power stations. 
  The committee's members are divided into seven smaller 
groups 
according to profession to facilitate their work, according to 
sources from the committee. 
  "One of the most important groups in the committee is the QA 
(quality assurance) group. To all nuclear power station 
equipment suppliers, nuclear safety is the first consideration," 
Qian Huimin, secretary general of the committee, said in an 
interview. 
  The city has invested nearly 200 million yuan ($23 million) 
in buildings for equipment suppliers and has loaned the local 
industry more than 13 million yuan ($1.5 million) for scientific 
and technological research. 
  Another 200 million yuan will be used to technically 
renovate 
some 20 suppliers in the next two years, according to the 
Shanghai Nuclear Power Office. 
  Shanghai plans to continue supplying equipment for the 
second 
phase of the Qinshan Project in Zhejiang and has contracted with 
Pakistan to build parts for a 300-megawatt nuclear power station.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230) and Zhang Jinsheng (1728 </F>
6930 0524)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a meeting about the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation's [BFLIC] experience in 
trial comprehensive and coordinated reform today, Li Tieying, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring 
Commission, emphatically noted: The decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drafted 
the goals and blueprint of the reform; the most important thing 
at present is to translate it into action, do a solid job, be 
meticulous in operation, and establish new systems and 
mechanisms through practical work. While learning from the 
BFLIC, we should emulate their practice of "stressing the focal 
points, doing a solid job, and bringing about concrete results." 
  The three-day meeting on the BFLIC's experience in trial 
comprehensive and coordinated reform, which was convened by the 
State Economic Restructuring Commission, closed today. At the 
meeting, Li Tieying gave an important speech about the valuable 
points in the BFLIC's experience which merit attention from 
other regions and enterprises. He said: First of all, reform 
must center on development and be carried out with a view to 
tackling practical problems in economic life. The most urgent 
problems and the cruxes of problems are the focal points of our 
reform. The value of the BFLIC's trial reform lies in its firm 
grasp of practical problems in Beijing's development and the 
gradual resolution of them through reform to promote 
development. For example, in moving against problems such as 
considerable losses of state assets, difficulties in circulating 
available capital, dull enterprise mechanisms, a shortage of 
capital, obstacles to the mobility of staff and workers, and 
heavy debt burdens, the BFLIC proposed the basic idea of 
"increasing the value of assets, switching the industry's 
production of products, changing functions, transforming 
mechanisms, and reassigning staff and workers" in its trial 
comprehensive and coordinated reform, and it integrated the 
reform of the enterprise system with the readjustment of the 
industrial structure. It started the industry all over again 
for the second time through the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system and comprehensively took in new systems step 
by step on the one hand, and on the other hand it brought about 
a switch in industries in its urban enterprises in order of 
importance and urgency, vigorously developed tertiary industries 
by redeveloping assets, and developed secondary industries to a 
high level. In the meantime, it has resolved the problems 
concerning the future of urban enterprises, the needs of 
developing the rural economy, and the lack of suitable projects 
for village and town enterprises as well as their upgrading by 
supplementing urban areas with the supremacy of rural areas and 
vice versa, and it has promoted the coordinated development of 
the urban and rural economies. 
  Li Tieying said: Having developed to the present stage, 
reform must be carried out comprehensively and in a coordinated 
manner in order to proceed further. The BFLIC's experience in 
trial reform is not the experience in a single trial reform by 
an individual enterprise; it is the experience in a 
comprehensive and coordinated reform for revitalizing the 
state-owned economy. One of the important reasons why their 
trial reform could show results within only one year is because 
of the high attention received from the Beijing municipal party 
committee and government. Since the inception of the reform, 
they have proposed that the comprehensive and coordinated reform 
should be supported by comprehensive and coordinated policies; 
principal leaders of the municipal party committee and 
government personally organized various departments to study and 
implement the trial comprehensive and coordinated reform program 
and demanded that all departments transform their functions, 
improve their work style, and support the reform in a spirit of 
reform. On the other hand, the reason why there are few 
significant results in enterprise reform over the years is 
mainly because individual enterprises judge things as they 
stand, fall short of overall concepts concerning the 
comprehensive and coordinated reform, and make no fundamental 
change to their mechanisms. Enterprises are the bearers of the 
movement of capital, and if they do not follow the internal 
requirements of the law of value, establish a mechanism for 
enterprises to consciously pursue an increase in value and a 
modern enterprise system suitable for the changes in markets, 
and carry out comprehensive and coordinated reform with a 
greater view to revitalizing the entire state-owned economy, the 
problem of revitalizing enterprises cannot be solved. 
  Li Tieying said: Properly handling the relations between 
reform, development, and stability is an important prerequisite 
for doing our job well. We must take a new path to development 
and create new systems in reform. The deep-seated 
contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of 
economic development must be resolved by means of reform. 
Reform means a readjustment in the structure of interests and 
involves all kinds of old and new problems; it will impair 
stability if it is not handled well. The success of the BFLIC's 
trial reform lies in its consideration to reform, development, 
and stability. From the beginning, the corporation has 
incorporated the arrangements for the staff and workers into the 
reform program and has improved their quality and 
competitiveness in obtaining new jobs through training in light 
of market demands. It created new job vacancies to properly 
reassign staff and workers through readjusting the industrial 
structure. In addition, it considered a great deal of thorough 
and painstaking ideological work to be an important part of the 
reform. 
  Speaking on the problems that merit further study and 
attention in learning the BFLIC's experience in trial 
comprehensive and coordinated reform, Li Tieying stressed: 1) 
It is necessary to properly handle the problem of state-owned 
assets. The losses of state-owned assets currently are very 
grim, and the problem cannot be solved without reform. But how? 
Can we blaze a new trail for maintaining and increasing the 
value of state-owned assets by relying on the state economy's 
own strength, the redistribution of resources and essential 
factors, and the transformation of the mechanism through reform? 
The handling of state-owned assets is a very sensitive issue 
which requires a strong policy; it requires a profound study in 
the course of reform. 2) The problem concerning the compensated 
use of land in coordinated reform -- land belongs to the state, 
and the income resulting from the increase in its value should 
go to the state. 3) It is necessary to proceed from reality in 
doing everything. Each locality has its own economic structure 
and level of development, and the problems it is facing may be 
different from others' problems. While studying the BFLIC's 
ways of conducting trial reform, we must avoid copying 
everything indiscriminately without taking into account local 
conditions, for otherwise we would acquire the form instead of 
the essence. We should avoid doing things rashly on a mass 
scale, because this will not only achieve nothing but will also 
bungle the good opportunity for reform and development. The 
BFLIC's experience in trial comprehensive and coordinated reform 
is still preliminary; it should continue to probe further for 
constant improvement. 
  Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, 
also spoke at today's closing meeting. He said: The 
outstanding feature in the BFLIC's reform is that in the course 
of readjusting its industrial structure, it has consciously 
redistributed the essential factors of production by means of 
the mechanism of the market economy. In the course of 
readjustment, we must pay attention to and properly solve the 
problems of "brand, face, and position" and "yours, mine, and 
his," consider the overall situation of reform and development, 
break down the departmental selfishness, and reorganize in a 
timely manner low-efficiency enterprises by closing them down, 
suspending their operations, merging them with other 
enterprises, or switching their manufacture of products. We 
should emancipate our minds and find a new way for state 
enterprises to extricate themselves from their predicaments and 
improve their efficiency. 
  The meeting was presided over by He Guanghui, vice minister 
in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission. 
During the meeting, representatives of relevant local and 
central departments from around the country discussed 
enthusiastically and profoundly the BFLIC's reform experience 
and reached a consensus on its basic ideas and experience in the 
comprehensive and coordinated reform. The report entitled 
"Comprehensively and Precisely Master the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation's Experience and Promote State Enterprise 
Reform Comprehensively and in a Coordinated Manner" delivered by 
Liu Zhifeng, vice minister in charge of the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, systematically summarized the BFLIC's 
basic reform experience in its six aspects and in its three 
characteristics, highlighted six problems that all localities 
should note in drawing lessons from the BFLIC's experience, and 
drew the attention of participants in the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission for 
Economic Restructuring, said recently that establishing a modern 
enterprise system is vital to reinvigorate large and 
medium-sized state enterprises. 
  In his recent tour of south China's Guangdong Province, Li 
inspected a number of state-owned enterprises and talked with 
leading members of these enterprises about the question of how 
to conduct experiments in establishing a modern enterprise 
system. 
  Li said that Guangdong had explored the reforms of the asset 
system, social security system, maintaining and adding to the 
value of state assets and improvement of management in 
enterprises. 
  He said that the enterprises which are experimenting in 
establishing a modern enterprise system should focus their 
efforts on perfecting the system of legal status, determining 
investment orientation, setting the organization form of the 
legal status of the enterprises, and improving industrial 
financial and accounting system. 
  He stressed the need to strengthen the leadership of the 
experimental work and set up a responsibility system for the 
experiment. 
  He urged the enterprises to continue their investigations 
and 
summing up of experiences in the experiment, so as to lay a 
solid foundation for further reforms.

  [Text] A national meeting of commodity price bureau 
directors closed in Wuhan on 8 April. Chen Jinhua, minister of 
the State Planning Commission, pointed out at the meeting: 
Effective measures must be taken to curb excessive commodity 
price increases and to ensure an overall stable situation by 
strengthening regulation and control. 
  Chen Jinhua said: A conspicuous economic problem at present 
is worsening inflation. Market prices have increased rapidly, 
and the increases are particularly excessive for those things 
which have an important bearing on the people's daily life and 
the nation's economic development, such as basic daily 
necessities, basic services, and basic capital goods. 
  Chen Jinhua said: Recently, the State Council adopted a 
series of measures to stabilize commodity prices. Commodity 
price departments at all levels should resolutely implement the 
four measures formulated by the State Council --to set up a 
grain risk fund, to exercise effective supervision over the 
prices of the people's basic daily necessities and services, to 
enforce the rule of clearly marking commodity and service 
prices, and to carry out a general inspection of commodity 
prices. Resolute efforts should be made to successfully 
stabilize soon the prices of rice, nonstaple foods, and fuel for 
the people. 
  Chen Jinhua pointed out: Under the current state of market 
prices of most commodities, it is imperative for us to establish 
a perfect price regulation and control system during the course 
of deepening reforms. In the meantime, however, regulation and 
control must be exercised with new thinking and new methods 
which conform to the market economy. Commodity price 
departments at all levels should make active explorations, have 
the courage to do practical things, strive to establish as soon 
as possible a pricing system under the conditions of the 
socialist market economy, and ensure that price management will 
gradually be governed by regulations.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Enterprise Changes Sure To Expand Unions' </F>
Role"] 
  [Text] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is 
finishing a document that defines the unions' expanded role in 
the modern enterprise system. 
  Trade unions and individual workers are to be empowered with 
rights involving labour contracts, freedom to express opinions 
about the firms management, and representation on boards of 
directors and supervisors. 
  Entitled "Suggestions on the Trade Unions' Role and Workers' 
Democratic Management under the Modern Enterprise System," the 
document will be submitted to the State Council for approval 
this month. 
  The modern enterprise system, put forward by the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee last November calls on 
enterprises to operate in line with international practices. 
  The State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System 
launched a pilot project earlier this year to establish the 
system initially in 100 State-owned enterprises. Most of these 
State firms will be restructured into limited-liability 
companies. 
  On behalf of workers', ACFTU "warmly" supports the pilot 
project, said Wang Chidong, Deputy Director of the Grass-Roots 
Work Department of ACFTU. 
  In such a system, trade unions have an even bigger role to 
play, said Wang. 
  The workers should enjoy the freedom to attend and organize 
trade unions. 
  They are also entitled to sign labour contracts with the 
company on the basis of free will and equality, to express 
disagreement on management policies and criticize managers, and 
to enjoy reasonable pay, work hours, labour safety, professional

  In the 100 enterprises, trade unions are given authority to 
negotiate with the representatives of the board on labour 
disputes.

  [Text] Hefei, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has revoked licenses of 7,500 unqualified overseas-funded 
enterprises over the past 14 years, averaging 535 a year. 
  This figure accounts for 4.3 percent of the total 
overseas-funded enterprises in the country, according to a 
recent national work meeting on the management of registered 
foreign-funded enterprises in this capital of Anhui Province. 
  "In line with international conventions, we will fully 
support enterprises with favorable economic results and have to 
cancel or revoke licenses for those unable to resolve troubles 
so as to ensure healthy development of the whole range of 
foreign-funded enterprises," an official of the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce said. 
  China has 175,000 registered foreign-funded enterprises so 
far, most of which are profitable. The number of countries and 
regions making investment in the country rose from 122 in 1992 
to 146 last year. 
  According to the official, there are still a few enterprises 
which have gone through necessary formalities but have not made 
any investment on the mainland at all; are engaged in smuggling, 
speculation and profiteering; have promoted the sales of 
inferior equipment at a high price; have existed in name only; 
or fell into general debility. 
  Analyzing why such practices persist, the official said, 
"the 
main cause was that, for a long period of time, it was foreign 
business people that selected us as partners, and some places 
paid attention only to the numbers of foreign-funded projects 
and not the quality." 
  He stressed that this tendency must be checked and called on 
localities to study and solve the issue. 
  A survey shows that China approved of the establishment of 
85,000 overseas-funded enterprises last year, an increase of 180 
percent over the previous year. 
  Foreign business people have shown more interest in 
investing 
in coastal, interior and border areas including Jiangsu, Anhui, 
Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, Henan and Heilongjiang Provinces.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Qiu: "Light Industry To Open Door to Foreign </F>
Managers"] 
  [Text] The government this year will start allowing 
foreign managers to run Chinese light industrial enterprises 
independently so as to attract more overseas capital, technology 
and products, a senior official revealed. 
  The pursuit of foreign managers is intended to enhance light 
industry's production and exports, said the official, who works 
in the China National Council of Light Industry but wished not 
to be identified. 
  This year, light industry is expected to export $34.5 
billion 
worth of products. 
  The official said big export-oriented enterprises will be 
the 
first to be designated for foreigners to manage under contract. 
  The move is expected to bring in advanced technology from 
overseas that will help modernize these enterprises and expand 
their exports,the official explained. 
  Besides the contract management system, he said, overseas 
companies can also pour in money to convert State enterprises 
into joint ventures. 
  The China National Council of Light Industry is also 
planning 
management and technical training programmes in Sweden, Finland 
and other countries, the official said. 
  Besides managers, China will bring in technicians from these 
countries to help renovate enterprises' technology. 
  China is also ready to extend its policies on investment and 
co-operation to overseas enterprises, the official said. 
  The official said overseas investment is expected in 
capital- 
and technology-intensive industries but those that pollute 
heavily should be prohibited. 
  This year, the light industry council will seek more 
overseas 
capital, technology and skills for China's inland areas, the 
official said. 
  Last year inland areas used 180 percent more overseas 
investment than the previous year, while the growth rate in the 
thriving coastal regions was 52 percent. 
  The official said that besides direct overseas management, 
joint ventures in light industry are still a major force in 
exports, accounting for about 20 percent of the industry's total. 
  The council is co-operating more closely with big overseas 
companies, the official said. Early this year, for example, it 
signed a $350 million investment agreement with PepsiCo Inc, the 
American food and beverage giant. This followed the signing 
last year of a $150 million agreement with Coca-Cola Co. 
  Loans from international organizations and foreign 
governments will also be important in promoting light industry's 
co-operation, the official said.

<F P=106> [By Ren Ren: "BOC To Lend More Working Capital to Foreign </F>
Firms"] 
  [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign 
exchange bank, concentrated on lending working capital to 
foreign-funded ventures in the first quarter of this year to 
ensure their smooth operation. 
  From January through March, the bank's working capital loans 
in hard currency to foreign-funded firms accounted for 85 per 
cent of the bank's total foreign exchange credits to such firms 
in the first quarter. 
  Meanwhile, 99.6 percent of the bank's total loans in 
renminibi to foreign-funded firms are working capital credits, 
said an official with the bank, who declined to be identified. 
  In accordance with the State's policy of curbing the 
over-expansion of capital spending, the bank will keep strict 
control over lending for investment in fixed assets. 
  In the first quarter, the fixed-assets loans for 
foreign-funded ventures dipped slightly compared with the same 
period of last year, he said. 
  The official declined to give more details about the exact 
sizes of the working capital credits and the exact decline rate 
in the fixed-assets loans. 
  The official stressed that his bank will give full support 
to 
foreign-funded ventures. 
  He said more loans are expected to be granted in the second 
quarter than in the first and predicted that the amount lent to 
foreign-funded ventures this year will be more than last year. 
  But the rate of growth will not be too big, the official 
said, since the State will maintain its controls on credit in 
the face of soaring prices. 
  The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion worth of foreign 
exchange loans to foreign-funded ventures, 28 per cent more than 
in 1992. 
  As a major channel for foreign investment, the Bank of China 
has followed a credit policy that favours foreign-funded 
ventures. Since 1980, it has provided foreign-funded ventures 
with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange and 135.6 billion yuan 
$15.5 billion) in renminbi. 
  About half of all foreign-funded ventures in China have 
opened accounts with the bank, and a fifth of them have been 
granted loans. 
  Since the demand for loans is much higher than the bank's 
capacity, the official said, the bank will direct most of its 
limited capital into selected firms according to national 
industrial policy. 
  Most of the enterprises on the bank's preferred list are in 
energy, transportation and telecommunications. 
  Those with high profitability and credit worthiness will 
also 
be given priority. 
  While converting itself from being a State specialized bank 
to commercial operations, Guan said, the Bank of China will pay 
more attention to the efficiency of its loans. 
  "We will enhance the anti-risk sense to protect our bank's 
assets," he said.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Bank To Issue $7.5b in Bonds"] </F>
  [Text] The newly established State Development Bank, one 
of the country's three policy-oriented banks, has begun issuing 
financial bonds to pool capital. 
  The flotation began last Wednesday and by Monday a total of 
20 billion yuan ($2.3 biilion) worth of three- and five-year 
bonds will be issued to 10 financial institutions, said Yao 
Zhenyan, president of the bank. 
  Instructed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, 
these institutions will also buy 8 billion yuan ($920 million) 
in bonds next month. 
  The bank is planning to issue 65 billion yuan (S7.5 billion) 
in bonds this year. The rest will be sold in three batches in 
the second half of this year, Yao said. 
  The institutions buying the bonds are the Shanghai and 
Shenzhen branches of the People's Bank of China, the Industrial 
and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, 
the Construction Bank, the Communications Bank, the Everbright 
Bank, the Industrial Bank of the China International Trust &amp; 
Investment Corp and the Post Saving and Remitting Bureau. 
  The paperless bonds cannot be traded in the market or among 
banks, but they can be used as collateral when borrowing money 
from the central bank. 
  The issue of financial bonds is an important way to ensure 
that the bank, which went into operation on July 13, has enough 
capital to support the country's key construction projects. 
  More capital will come from the national treasury, which has 
promised 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) of registered capital 
over the next four years. 
  Relying on the financial bonds and State allocations, the 
bank this year is planning to supply 80 billion yuan ($9.2 
billion) in low-interest loans for infrastructural construction. 
  About 40 per cent of the loans is expected to be granted in 
the first half of this year, Yao said, adding that the money 
raised through the bonds will be channelled to projects within 
several days. 
  The bank's loans will be used for developing the country's 
key infrastructural projects and the basic but overburdened 
industries that have been hindering economic growth. 
  This year's beneficiaries include 345 large and medium-sized 
construction projects such as the giant Three Gorges Dam, the 
Beijing-Kowloon railway and some big power stations. 
  To raise more capital, Yao said, his bank is quite willing 
to 
co-operate with international financial sources. 
  At first, the bank will be responsible for the relending of 
some loans from foreign governments and international financial 
organizations. 
  It is also likely to issue bonds overseas if it gets the 
approval, of the State. 
  Yao said many overseas financial institutions have expressed 
their wishes to help the bank issue overseas bonds. 
  Furthermore, Yao said, the bank will also seek commercial 
loans from overseas banks. 
  He said the bank will set up some affiliates in foreign 
countries in the future. 
  Establishing the State Development Bank is an important part 
of the country's financial reform. It is aimed at ensuring the 
smooth flow of capital to key State projects and providing the 
central government with a powerful tool to rein in excessive 
investment in fixed assets.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The State Securities 
Council (SSC) announced here today that it was going to ban 
standardized futures contracts transactions in steel products 
and sugar. 
  According to a notice from the SSC, no transactions in 
standardized futures contracts for steel products and sugar will 
be permitted after October this year. 
  But transactions in standardized futures contracts with a 
delivery date before October 1994 will be allowed to continue 
till completion. 
  Transactions in non-standardized futures contracts for steel 
and sugar will be allowed to go on, but illegal operations will 
be forbidden. 
  The notice suggests that the Chinese Ministry of Coal 
Industry should issue a notice to stop listing standardized 
futures contracts for coal products in all coal transaction 
centers and wholesale markets. 
  The SSC notice says that no transaction centers have the 
right to list new futures trade items, without first getting 
approval from the China Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC). 
  It also forbids any financial departments to provide futures 
trade guarantee letters. The notice says that futures trade 
centers should not accept such letters of guarantee or take them 
as earnest money. 
  The SSC announces in the notice that the CSRC has the right 
to order futures transaction centers to raise the earnest money 
ratio whenever futures trade prices suffer sharp fluctuations. 
  According to incomplete statistics, there are now about 40 
futures trade centers in China, of which 30 are in operation.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "State Keeps Tight Hold on Telecoms"] </F>
  [Text] It has become a routine in China -- when a product 
becomes popular, local authorities and enterprises scramble to 
buy foreign production equipment. 
  In the 1980s, it was colour television sets and 
refrigerators. Now in the 1990s, it is programme-controlled 
telephone exchanges. 
  China is regarded as the last huge market for digital 
telephone exchanges, and foreign and domestic electronics 
manufacturers are all hungry for a piece of the pie. 
  But the Chinese Government is determined to avoid a 
repetition of what happened to colour TVs. 
  It is estimated China will need about 13 million lines of 
digital telephone exchanges in each of the next six years. 
  There are more than 120 manufacturers in the country, and 
their annual capacity exceeds 10 million lines. 
  Experts believe that capacity will reach 23 million lines by 
1996, of which 18 million will be for branch use. 
  Although capacity will soon exceed demand, many domestic 
firms are eager to set up new production lines. 
  Experts and government officials worry that excessive 
investment in foreign equipment wastes capital, and few 
manufacturers can maintain efficient production scales. 
  To curb the zeal of new producers, the government has worked 
out several regulations restricting such projects. 
  Only five large joint ventures will be allowed in China to 
produce digital telephone exchanges for branch use. 
  Three are already in operation. The foreign partners are 
Alcatel of Belgium, Siemens AG of Germany and NEC Corp of Japan. 
  China is negotiating with AT&amp;T of the United States and 
Northern Telecom of Canada to establish two other joint ventures. 
  Officials stipulate that foreign companies must bring 
advanced development and production technology if they are to 
co-operate with China. 
  Some foreign electronics giants anxious about losing the 
potentially massive market in China, are secretly looking for 
local co-operative partners, trying to set up joint ventures 
without approval from the central government. 
  Officials said that the government will adopt strict 
measures 
to stop such subterfuge. 
  A new regulation governing the use of foreign capital in 
making programme-controlled telephone exchanges will soon be 
published.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "China May Open Up its Power Industry"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese Government is considering allowing 
foreign investments in the manufacture of large electrical 
generators. 
  Westinghouse Electric Corp of America and Siemens AG of 
Germany reportedly desire to co-operate with Chinese 
manufacturers. 
  For years domestic production of large power generators has 
failed to meet demand. 
  China, which expects its economy to grow by 8 to 9 per cent 
over the next seven years, needs to add more than 12 million 
kilowatts of capacity each year. 
  Capacity is expected to increase from the present 181 
million 
kilowatts to at least 300 million kilowatts by the year 2000. 
  However, State planners predict that the manufacture of 
large 
power generators over the next seven years will be short of 
demand by a big margin. 
  Large generators representing more than 3.2 million 
kilowatts 
of capacity were imported last year. Imports this year will 
account for 4 million kilowatts. 
  Between 1990 and last year, generators of about 47.2 million 
kilowatts were installed. About 30 per cent, or 13.75 million 
kilowatts worth, were imported. 
  China now has the ability to turn out 9 million kilowatts of 
generators each year. Three-quarters are machines above 100,000 
kilowatts. 
  Power industry officials point out that insufficient 
production of generators jeopardizes the government's long-term 
economic goals. 
  One industry official said manufacturing large power 
generators with investment and advanced technology from overseas 
would benefit the country. The official said foreign-funded 
ventures are expected to fill the gap between production and 
demand. 
  Economists say the growth in power production should at 
least 
match that of the economy. That means a large number of big 
power plants must be built. 
  Production of generators above 300,000 kilowatts has been on 
the rise over the past several years. Stimulated by rising 
demand, production of small machines, or those below 25,000 
kilowatts, has also been increasing. 
  In 1991, some 230 small generators with combined capacity of 
1.36 million kilowatts were manufactured. In 1992, production 
increased to 256 generators with 1.4 million kilowatts. 
  Industry officials predict that production will continue to 
increase so that it will eventually surpass demand. 
  However, the official said more large generators will have 
to 
be imported to ensure enough new power plants are built to 
support the booming economy, the official said. 
  In China, large power generators are produced by plants 
controlled by the Ministry of Machinery Industry. They are to 
be used by the Ministry of Power Industry, which oversees 
construction of new power stations. 
  Foreign-funded power plants in China are usually equipped 
with imported generators. In large joint ventures, both the 
Chinese and foreign partners prefer imported machines. 
  By the end of l992, China had signed some $12 billion in 
power-related contracts with international banks and foreign 
governments, enterprises and businessmen. 
  Several pump-storage power plants are under construction, 
including projects in Guangzhou, Tianhuangping in Zhejiang 
Province and Shisanling in Beijing. Key equipment for the 
plants is to be imported. 
  Still, more pump storage power plants are planned.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China will give 
priority to the development of chain stores in order to boost 
its retail trade and better adapt its commercial activities to 
international standards. 
  This was recently stated by He Jihai, vice-president of the 
State Ministry of Internal Trade, at the national spring 
commodity fair held in Tianjin. 
  According to He, China will soon lift certain restrictions 
on 
its retail trade to encourage the growth of chain stores. 
  Foreign investors are welcome to set up and develop more 
chain stores in China in order to promote the reform and renewal 
of China's traditional ways of operation in commercial 
activities. 
  Commercial enterprises are also encouraged to take advantage 
of the new round of reforms in the transformation of operating 
mechanisms and to establish chain shops or chain commercial 
groups with Chinese characteristics but strictly in accordance 
with international standards through combination, transfer of 
assets and introduction of stock system. 
  Enterprises allowed to set up chain stores include 
restaurants, supermarkets, book stores, jewelry stores and 
pharmacies. 
  Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Trade show that China 
now has 100-plus chain stores, concentrated in large cities. 
Less than one-third of them have reached international 
standards.

  [Text] Nanjing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have proposed investing 7.8 billion yuan (896.55 million U.S. 
dollars) over 10 years in deepening and dredging the deep-water 
channel of the Chang Jiang river mouth from the current 7 meters 
to 12.5 meters. 
  Upon completion of the project, the channel may allow the 
passage of 100,000-ton common vessels in high tide and of 
50,000-ton container ships day and night, said Yan Kai and Dou 
Guoren, academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
Currently, it allows the passage of only 10-ton vessels in high 
tide. 
  The proposed project is believed to be significant toward 
making the Shanghai harbor a rising new hub of international 
transportation on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, and it 
will greatly enhance the economic development of the Chang Jiang 
river delta and the whole of the Chang Jiang river valley. 
  The State Planning Commission has approved the plan, saying 
it is "technically feasible and economically profitable." 
  The "river mouth," from Nanjing to Shanghai, is a 
cross-point 
of China's coastal areas with the vast Chang Jiang river valley 
areas. It is the shipping route for 200 million tons of goods a 
year. 
  There are more than 100 over-10,000-ton ports along the 
edges 
of the mouth, including Shanghai harbor, one of the world's ten 
100- million-ton harbors. 
  The current difficulty in the Chang Jiang river mouth costs 
several hundred million yuan each year, since ships have to 
unload part of the goods or wait for high tides in order to sail 
into or to enter harbors. 
  The two academicians said that the project will bring 4.05 
billion yuan in profits to the transporters, harbors and 
manufacturers in the first five years of construction; later, it 
will save them an additional 7.36 billion yuan. Ten years after 
the project is completed, 28.8 billion yuan will be saved. 
  The proposal was based on a key national research project on 
the Chang Jiang waterway, the results of which have been 
approved by the State Planning Commission. 
  The research was conducted by nearly 100 scientists from the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Waterways Bureau and 
the Nanjing Water Control Institute. 
  Studies on the evolution of the Chang Jiang river bed and 
physical and mathematical model verification measures were used 
to produce the proposal. 
  Experiments show that the project will neither affect the 
river's ability to drain floods, nor affect the water supply to 
cities along the river, despite an increase in the inflow of sea 
water. 
  Experts believe the project will be conducive to the 
comprehensive management of the Chang Jiang river mouth and 
urged that it be put into action soon.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (CNS) -- China saw a decrease of 
arable land last year by some nine million mu while some 4.53 
million mu were newly developed. The sharp drop of land under 
cultivation is now under control in some areas. 
  Director of the State Land Administration Mr. Zou Yuchuan 
stressed the importance of protecting arable land in a national 
meeting on legislation regarding land. Mr. Zou pointed out that 
a net cut of land under cultivation was put at some four million 
mu across the country last year, equivalent to the total of 
arable land in seven medium-sized counties. Should the 
situation not be reversed, the consequences would be very 
serious. He said that China had to guarantee at least one mu of 
arable land per person on average by the year 2050 or the food 
problem would by then become a crisis. There is to date 
cultivated land totalling 1.43 billion mu with per capita land 
measuring 1.2 mu. 
  The administration has suggested that planning for the use 
of 
land had to be worked out and strictly implemented. The 
appraisal and approval of land had to be unified in accordance 
with the law and administration of various kinds of development 
zones had to be strengthened. A protection area for farming 
fields had to be drawn up while policies on the administration 
of collective use of land for non-agricultural purposes had to 
be strengthened.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (CNS) -- According to the State 
Bureau of Oceanography, China has seen increasing damage of its 
resources in its coastal areas, posing a danger to the original 
coastal scenery and to the ocean ecology and leading to an 
adverse affect on tourism and economicdevelopment there. 
  It is reported that Xiamen, a coastal city in Fujian 
Province 
has seen excessive removal of sand along its coastline and 
unplanned construction of buildings and real estate development, 
with the result that a bathing beach near Xiamen University is 
suffering sand loss with the sand cover there becoming thinner 
from the original depth of more than 10 centimetres to less than 
one centimetre while 3.8 kilometres of beach there is now almost 
totally filled with rubbish and waste. 
  Such conditions are now also seen in Hainan with over 70,000 
mu of beach area in Lushui County being severely damaged by 
rampant mining of titanium, leaving many hillocks and hollows 
there. On February 19, a beach near the Xinhai forestry centre 
was found to have been damaged by illegal removal and selling of 
sand, and such destruction, if it continues, will endanger the 
whole coastline there, posing a safety problem to the nearby 
coastal road. 
  A circular recently issued by the State Bureau of 
Oceanography pointed out that the ocean environment and 
resources was the base for people's lives. Recovery of the 
damaged environment and resources are very difficult to redress 
and will pose a direct and potential threat to the economic 
development and people's livelihood there.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The Chang Jiang 
Valley has become China's most concentrated region for the auto 
industry. 
  In 1993 the Chinese mainland produced 1.31 million 
automobiles, including 300,000 sedans. One-third of that number 
was manufactured by plants in Shanghai and Jiangsu, Hubei, 
Jiangxi and Sichuan Provinces. 
  Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint-venture, the 
Nanjing 
General Automobile Plant, a Sino-Italian joint-venture, and the 
state-owned Yangzhou General Bus Plant have become the main 
producers of sedans, trucks and buses. 
  Shanghai Volkswagen turned out 100,000 "Santana" sedans last 
year. 
  Auto production is now the mainstay industry in Shanghai, 
Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi and Sichuan. 
  Many of these factories have enjoyed good economic returns 
in 
recent years, with profits exceeding 100 million yuan each. 
  The development of the technology-intensive auto industry 
has 
boosted the growth of related support businesses. Shanghai 
Volkswagen has 200 factories making parts for it which are 
involved in a dozen industrial sectors and are scattered along 
the Chang Jiang or in nearby areas. 
  Now 80 percent of the parts on a Santana sedan are made in 
these support factories. 
  Shanghai Volkswagen is expected to roll 200,000 Santanas off 
the line this year, double last year's figure. 
  The central government has placed priority on the auto 
industry and is determined to support its development for a long 
time to come. 
  Last year the output value of the 116 auto manufacturers on 
the mainland accounted for about three percent of the gross 
industrial output value in the country. 
  However, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said recently that "China's 
light-duty auto industry, due to its low technology and 
productivity, still has a long way to go before becoming a 
full- fledged producer." 
  Overseas auto corporations have realized the needs and 
potential of the Chinese market and are pouring hefty investment 
into the domestic manufacturers along the Chang Jiang. 
  The French Renault auto company has invested 100 million 
U.S. 
dollars jointly with a local partner in Hubei to produce 
mini-vans. The project is expected to start production this 
September and make 40,000 mini-vans annually. 
  Most of the Sino-foreign joint ventures have decided to 
increase production or develop new models. 
  Overseas auto parts makers are also trying to gain a 
foothold 
in China. A company from the United States has invested 160 
million U.S. dollars to set up 15 auto parts manufacturers. 
  Experts here said that since the auto industry involves many 
other industries, the rapid expansion of Sino-foreign joint 
ventures and state-owned auto plants is bound to edge out those 
smaller, less competitive local counterparts.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai today 
started to construct its international textile town--the first 
textile new and high technology development zone in China. 
  Located in Qingpu County of Shanghai City, the town is 
planned to occupy 2.13 hectares. 
  Wu Wenying, president of the China National Textile Council, 
said here today that the construction of the town is a new 
exploration and will serve as a guide for technological progress 
and readjustment of the structure of the textile industry in the 
country. 
  She said that the textile industry is one of the traditional 
industries in China. At present, its output value accounts for 
14.4 percent of the total output value in the country. 
  But, she noted, China's textile industry is also facing 
development difficulties. 
  The construction of the textile town is aimed at setting up 
an international commodity-oriented industrial town with new and 
high technology. 
  Now the town has signed contracts with its counterparts in 
Germany, the United States and the Republic of Korea for 
projects with a total investment of 180 million U.S. dollars.

bonds to rank second. Next were International Securities Corp 
and Haitong Securities Corp. 
  More than half of the 4 billion yuan ($460 million) in bonds 
have already been sold. 
  The rapid sales of two-year bonds should stimulate sales of 
three-year treasury bonds, sources said. 
  According to statistics from the city's major financial 
institutions, about 770 million yuan ($80 million) in three-year 
bonds have been sold so far.

  [Text] Hangzhou, 14 April (XINHUA)--Hangzhou city's public 
security organ held a public meeting to deal with 49 hoodlums 
who were arrested recently. 
  The number of Chinese and foreign tourists visiting Hangzhou 
has gradually increased during this sightseeing season. In 
light of the increasing number of hoodlums in the city, 
Hangzhou's public security organ launched a drive to crack down 
on them in March. Over the past 40 days and more, the city has 
tracked down 132 cliques and arrested 692 gangsters. After 
cracking down on these evil doers, public order in scenic spots, 
amusement parks, and fairs has markedly improved. 
  It was learned that based on investigations, the public 
security organ has uncovered 796 criminal cases including 301 
major cases. Public security personnel also confiscated 14 guns, 
227 knives, and other weapons used for criminal purposes, 
eliminating the hidden dangers that threaten public security and 
order to a great extent.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou City 
Copyrights Bureau destroyed in public 63,000 pirated compact 
discs [CD's], laser discs, and video cassettes on 21 April. 
  According to an official in charge of the Guangdong 
Provincial Copyrights Bureau, a joint campaign--launched by 
local copyright bureaus in cooperation with public security, 
industrial and commercial administration, press and publication 
administration, radio and television, and cultural departments 
-- targetting pirated CD's in Guangdong got underway at 1300 on 
19 April. Thanks to careful preparations, the operation was 
successful. According to incomplete statistics, as of 1200 on 
20 April, 1,657 vendors across the province were inspected, and 
140,000 illegal CDs, 1,322 illegal laser discs, and 85,000 
illegal video cassettes were seized. The campaign was launched 
with greater momentum in such prime target areas as Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In connection with the operation, 
Guangzhou unfolded a city-wide campaign named "Action Week for 
Implementing the Copyright Law and Protecting Intellectual 
Property" on 19 April. 
  The official said: Since joining the "Berne Convention for 
the Protection of Literary and Artistic works," the "Universal 
Copyright Convention," and the "Convention for the Protection of 
Phonograms," China has brought its copyright protection in line 
with the international copyrights protection system. The 
departments concerned in Guangdong take the protection of 
intellectual property rights seriously. Last year they launched 
six raids against illegal publications. They also unfolded a 
concentrated campaign to crack down on illegal audio-visual 
products toward the end of last year. 
  At present, localities in Guangdong are continuing the 
crackdown in light of their respective local conditions. 
Relevant provincial authorities are formulating a series of 
measures to improve regular administration over the processing, 
duplication, wholesale, and marketing of audio-visual products. 
It has been learned that Guangdong will reorganize the 16 CD 
manufacturers in the province and place them under the 
jurisdiction of press and publication departments. The 
provincial copyrights bureau has formulated procedures for 
copyrights examination and registration in the manufacture of 
CDs. In the future, a system of "certificate first and license 
later" -- that is, an operation permit from relevant authorities 
must be obtained before a business license can be issued--will 
be introduced in the wholesaling and retailing of audio- visual 
products. Customs will also crack down harder on smuggling of 
audio-visual products to stop illegal products from entering 
China.

from China's five autonomous regions are making active trades at 
the ongoing '94 Spring Chinese Export Commodities Fair held in 
Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province. 
  The Guangzhou fair, which opened on the morning of April 15, 
is held biannually, in spring and autumn. This is the 75th 
session. Some 2,800 enterprises on the Chinese Mainland have 
brought products to the fair. 
  Trade delegation from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
made successful deals worth 39 million U.S. dollars in the first 
five days of the fair, accounting for 80 percent of the 
delegation's early-set target. 
  The trade mission from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is 
making full use of the autonomous region's advantages to 
actively open up markets in Muslim countries, while maintaining 
its existing markets in Hong Kong and the United States. 
  Xinjiang chalked up a business volume of 16.48 million U.S. 
dollars in the first five days alone, with its local products 
such as Hami melons showing sharp increases compared with 
corresponding figures of previous spring sessions. 
  Chinese caterpillar fungus, which is a local product found 
only in Tibet, has won favor from businessmen from Singapore, 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Besides these, Tibetan carpets and 
highland barley juice from Tibet are also in great demand at the 
fair. 
  Trading officials from Tibet told reporters that they could 
not only do businesses at the fair, but also make new friends 
through the fair. 
  Also, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region would not like to 
be left behind. Trading officials from the autonomous region 
have made active efforts to sell local products, such as rosin 
and talcum. In the first five days, the trading delegation 
clinched a business volume of 74 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 24 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- A recent 
month-long cleanup by the Shenzhen authorities to rid the city 
from people without legal identity documents, residency, or 
legitimate occupations ("three without's" for short) have 
uncovered and sent some 230,000 "three without's" people back 
where they came from. 
  The city also tracked down large numbers of wanted criminals 
and uncovered means of crime such as caches of guns, ammunition, 
and drugs, and stolen property. 
  Huang Zhenfen, "three without's" office director and the 
city 
public security bureau deputy director, made the above 
statements in an interview with this correspondent. 
  Huang said the city deployed some 90,000 people from the 
police and other sectors for the operation, in which the 
authorities dismantled some 60,000 shacks built on hillsides, 
along the road, and on the waterfront by "three without's" 
people, smashed 17 rings responsible for bringing in these 
"three without's" people and 33 places where forged documents 
were made and sold, solved some 50,000 cases, arrested some 
1,200 criminals, and investigated and dealt with some 4,000 
people who had violated security regulations, 
  Huang said the sweep also seized large quantities of means 
of 
crime and stolen property, among which were 13 guns, 241 rounds 
of ammunition, 168 kg of explosives, some 1,200 detonators, 190 
g of heroin, 39 motorbikes, and some 1.1 million renminbi. 
  Huang Zhenfen said the operation against the "three 
without's" people is a long-term and arduous job, and they will 
firmly persist in tightening management of temporary populations 
within the zone, safeguard law and order, improve the investment 
and living environment, and promote healthy social and economic 
development.

  [Text] Chengdu, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- While inspecting 
Sichuan, Qiao Shi, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, said emphatically: We should 
unswervingly implement measures adopted by the party Central 
Committee to deepen the reform and be sober-minded and calm when 
approaching and solving specific problems we encounter in our 
practical work. 
  Comrade Qiao Shi inspected Sichuan 13-18 April accompanied 
successively by Comrades Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan 
provincial party committee; Governor Xiao Yang; Yang Xizong, 
chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee; 
and Song Baorui, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee. Qiao Shi inspected large and medium state-owned 
enterprises and village and town enterprises, and heard work 
reports from the Sichuan provincial party committee and the 
Chengdu city party committee. 
  Because this is an important year for the deepening of 
reform 
in our country, Qiao Shi paid close attention to progress in 
implementing reform measures and specific problems in practical 
work. He said: Since the last quarter of 1993, we have been 
adopting more and stronger reform measures to meet the urgent 
need of our situation -- the need to push forward the socialist 
modernization drive. We should seize international and domestic 
opportunities that are very favorable to our country's 
construction as we conscientiously implement the guidelines of 
the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and unswervingly implement 
reform measures which we have adopted, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Everyone has noticed that these reform 
measures have played an important role, reaped initial 
successes, and received a good response internationally and 
domestically. Of course, a country as big as ours will 
definitely face some problems when it carries out extensive, 
in-depth reform. We should be sober-minded and calm when facing 
these problems. Problems which can be solved quickly should be 
solved as soon as possible; problems which cannot be solved at 
once should be solved gradually following active efforts to 
create the necessary conditions. 
  Qiao Shi pointed out: We should earnestly strengthen party 
leadership in the course of implementing reform measures. 
Leaders and cadres at all levels should be honest and observe 
self- discipline, oppose corruption, and work diligently in the 
interests of the people. They should improve their work style 
and do solid work. They should reach out to the grass roots and 
masses, conduct detailed investigation and study, be adept at 
discerning public sentiment, show concern about the people's 
work and well-being, lead the masses in overcoming difficulties 
and problems, and push forward all undertakings. 
  On enterprise reform, particularly that which concerns large 
and medium state-owned enterprises, Qiao Shi said emphatically: 
Enterprises must be market-oriented. They must invigorate their 
operational mechanisms, improve product quality and economic 
efficiency, and sharpen their competitiveness. They should 
absorb new technologies from abroad and from other places in the 
country to effectively upgrade their technologies. We should 
create a favorable environment for enterprise reform and 
development. We should reduce enterprises' burdens through the 
gradual establishment of a social security system, so as to 
facilitate efforts to attract investments and skilled personnel. 
  Qiao Shi said emphatically: We should continue to strengthen 
our leadership in agricultural and rural work, and solve, in a 
practical manner, problems that have cropped up during 
agricultural development. We should gradually increase the 
comparative returns accruing to peasants from growing grain, 
increase peasants' incomes, and ensure steady growth in the 
production of grain, cotton, and edible oils. At the same time, 
we should also strive to diversify economic undertakings in line 
with the concept of agricultural diversification. A large 
country like ours which has a large population has to resort to 
macroeconomic regulation and control to achieve long-term and 
steady agricultural development. Our vast rural areas will be 
more prosperous and developed if we actively develop village and 
town enterprises and work hard to strengthen the construction of 
small cities and towns on this basis. On the issue of utilizing 
surplus rural labor, Qiao Shi said: Besides exporting labor 
services and developing village and town enterprises, we should 
use a variety of methods to construct infrastructural 
facilities, such as repairing roads and water conservancy 
facilities, so that more surplus workers can play their roles. 
Qiao Shi showed great interest in poverty relief work. He 
said: The central authorities have decided to suitably grant 
more preferential treatment to the central and western regions 
in their policy to aid the poor, and this decision will be 
implemented. 
  Concerning the work of the people's congresses, Qiao Shi 
said: The more we deepen the reform and open up wider to the 
outside world, the more it is necessary for us to strengthen the 
construction of socialist democracy and the legal system. We 
should fully enhance the functions of people's congresses at all 
levels and strengthen the construction of grass-roots people's 
congresses in particular. People's congress deputies enjoy the 
whole society's support and attract its attention when they 
exercise their power in accordance with the law. Local people's 
congresses should earnestly sum up and gradually spread the good 
experiences they gained while carrying out legislative and 
supervisory work. 
  During his inspection, Qiao Shi visited the Sichuan 
provincial museum and other cultural establishments. He said: 
In the course of socialist modernization, we should draw on 
what is good in foreign cultures and carry forward and promote 
our country's splendid national culture; we should create a new 
and more splendid culture on this basis. 
  Qiao Shi said: Sichuan has its own superiorities, as well as 
qualities unmatched by other localities. It has made gratifying 
achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization in recent 
years. I believe under the leadership of its provincial party 
committee and government and through the industrious and 
innovative work of its vast number of cadres and people, Sichuan 
will make even greater progress in all its undertakings.

  [Text] While carrying out an inspection work in our 
province, Ren Jianxin, member of the Central Secretariat, 
secretary of the Central Commission of Political Science and 
Law, and president of the Supreme People's Court, stressed: 
Party organizations and governments at all levels must 
correctly understand and handle well relations between reform, 
development, and stability. Proceeding from the general 
situation of maintaining stability, they must properly solve 
various social contradictions. 
  According to a report by our staff reporter Li Jie, while 
carrying out an inspection tour in Chengdu on 18-20 April, Ren 
Jianxin listened to work reports made by provincial CPC 
committee, provincial government, Chendu, and provincial higher 
people's court officials. He also held discussions with 
delegates attending provincial political and judicial work 
meetings. Ren Jianxin fully affirmed the achievements made by 
our province last year. He said: Like various places in the 
country, the present political and economic situation in Sichuan 
is favorable. The overall situation of seizing on the fine 
opportunity, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability advocated by the CPC 
Central Committee has become a consensus of the entire party and 
people of the whole country. This year more important reform 
measures are being smoothly implemented. This is a crucial year 
for deepening reform and establishing a socialist market system. 
Deepening structural reform will touch upon and adjust 
interests of various quarters. Some new contradictions and 
problems will occur. Therefore, party organizations and 
government at all levels must correctly understand and handle 
well relations between reform, development, and stability. We 
must grasp things with two hands. We must see the favorable 
situation, and the existing problems as well. We must 
understand the importance of maintaining stability, and solve 
various social contradictions in their embryonic stage. 
  While talking about proper handling of various 
contradictions, Ren Jianxin emphasized: Leading comrades at all 
levels must go deep into the reality and grass-roots units, and 
listen to the voice of the masses to solve various problems 
related to immediate interests of the masses at all levels. It 
is necessary to exercise control over the prices of daily 
necessities needed by the masses in their daily livelihood, curb 
price hikes, deal severe blows to various kinds of criminal 
activities, and persist in the antipornography struggle, and the 
drive of eliminating the six vices to ensure that the masses 
live and work in peace and contentment. It is necessary to 
continue to profoundly carry out the struggle of opposing 
corruption, and firmly grasp the work of investigating and 
handling big and important cases.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Regional News Hookup" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Recently, the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Government approved and relayed a circular, issued by the 
regional radio-TV department and other relevant departments, 
which called on all areas to implement the State Council's 
regulations on control of ground facilities for receiving 
satellite TV broadcasts. 
  The circular said: In October last year, the State Council 
promulgated the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for 
Receiving Satellite TV Broadcasts. The Ministry of Radio, Film, 
and Television recently promulgated the Rules for Implementing 
the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for Receiving 
Satellite TV Broadcasts. This is of great significance for 
placing the production, sale, and use of ground facilities for 
receiving satellite TV broadcasts under control in accordance 
with the law; ensuring orderly development; promoting the 
building of a socialist spiritual civilization; and maintaining 
social stability. 
  According with the regulations and implementation rules, and 
in light of the situation in our region in which the 
installation of ground facilities is in a chaotic state; 
development of such facilities is being promoted recklessly 
without out a plan; and the contents of TV programs is out of 
control, the following five requirements have been set to 
strengthen control over ground facilities for receiving 
satellite TV broadcasts in our region. All prefectural 
administrations, the Lhasa City People's Government, the 
people's governments of various counties and cities, and various 
commissions and offices under the regional government should 
earnestly implement them. 
  1. You must vigorously publicize the regulations' 
guidelines. Under the leadership of the local governments, radio 
and television administrations in all prefectures and cities, 
should, together with public security, state security, 
industrial, and commercial departments, thoroughly understand 
the documents and earnestly implement them in light of local 
conditions. 
  2. You should register and check local cable TV systems and 
ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts. If 
problems are discovered in the course of inspection, you should 
handle them in accordance with the relevant documents. 
  3. You should rectify the situation after carrying out a 
checkup. Radio and television administrations of all 
prefectures and cities must carry out a strict checkup of 
permits. Old ones should be changed. If ground facilities for 
receiving satellite TV broadcasts set up by individuals prior to 
October last year must be preserved because of special 
circumstances, they must be reported to the relevant radio and 
television department before 5 May in order to obtain permits 
according to procedures. Units which obtained permits prior to 
5 October last year to receive overseas TV programs must be 
urged to submit their permits for reexamination by a radio and 
television department prior to 5 April. Units and individuals 
that have set up and used ground facilities for receiving 
satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits according 
to procedures should report to the departments concerned 
according to provisions stated in the rules for implementing the 
regulations. Units and individuals whose facilities are found 
to meet the set requirements must obtain a permit before 5 May. 
Units which have set up two ground facilities for receiving 
satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits to receive 
overseas TV programs must dismantle the antenna for receiving 
overseas TV programs. Units which have installed only one 
satellite antenna must readjust their antenna to receive only 
domestic programs. Measures for technological safety should be 
adopted in accordance with regulations and implementation rules 
to deal with units which are authorized to receive overseas TV 
programs. 
  4. Efforts will be made to establish cable TV stations. 
  5. Problems should be handled in accordance with the 
provisions contained in the regulations and with the procedures 
and functions set by the implementation rules.

  [Text] A large-scale mobilisation of troops is taking 
place in Tibet, according to reports from the region. The troop 
movements, the largest reported from the area since 1989, 
appeared to be concentrated around the Tibetan border with India. 
  The Tibetan government-in-exile reported yesterday that 
30,000 soldiers in three divisions of the People's Liberation 
Army had been moved from inland China into Tibet. One division 
had moved from Lanzhou in Xinjiang and two from Chengdu in 
Sichuan. The influx would nearly double the normal troop 
garrison in Tibet, estimated at around 50,000 four years ago. 
  According to the reports, the movement began in late March, 
matching reports from tourists in Yunnan Province that a large 
contingent of troops accompanied by helicopters had been seen 
around April 1 moving towards southern Tibet from Dali in 
northern Yunnan. 
  Western government sources confirmed that there were 
large-scale troop movements going on in Tibet. 
  There has been no visible troop activity in the Tibetan 
capital Lhasa and troop movements appeared to be focused on the 
sensitive border areas of Drayul and Dromo which face India's 
northeast frontier in Arunachal Pradesh, according to the 
government-in-exile. 
  In Lhasa, officials were said to have been compiling lists 
of 
military reservists and of people under the age of 40 who have 
done military service. 
  Procedures at road checkpoints have been tightened and one 
Tibetan arriving in India said that, from early this month, 
police checkpoints on the road from Lhasa to the border have 
been taken over by the military. 
  Increased security controls are expected in China in the 
run-up to the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings 
on June 4 and to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on 
China's most favoured nation trading privilege in less than five 
weeks.

  [Text] Delegates attending a regional conference on 
propaganda and ideological work have in the past few days 
enthusiastically discussed party Secretary Chen Kuiyuan's speech 
at the conference. His speech was entitled "Stabilize the 
Situation [wen ding ju shi] and Strengthen Our Propaganda and 
Ideological Work." They have also expressed many opinions and 
made many suggestions on the region's propaganda and ideological 
work for this year. 
  During their discussions, delegates unanimously held: This 
is a year of crucial importance for our country in the course of 
reform and development. Development and stability are two major 
tasks in the region's work. To carry out the region's various 
reform tasks for this year, it is necessary to correctly handle 
the relationship between reform, development, and stability. To 
implement reform in an all-round way, we must have a stable 
social environment and favorable public opinion. 
  They further pointed out: Ours is a region where minority 
nationalities live in compact communities. Strengthening the 
unity of various nationalities and maintaining the unification 
of the motherland accord with the fundamental interests and 
common aspirations of all nationalities throughout the region. 
The unity of various nationalities is of fundamental importance 
for the region's social and economic development. Practice has 
proved that whenever our work is effectively performed among 
various nationalities, our economy develops rapidly in a stable 
situation. Reform and development will become empty talk without 
a stable social and political environment. For this reason, we 
who are engaged in propaganda and ideological work should regard 
maintaining social stability as our own duty. In propaganda and 
ideological work, we should always give priority to the struggle 
against splittism, maintaining the unification of the 
motherland, strengthening the unity of various nationalities, 
and preserving social stability. We should rid ourselves of the 
past practice of doing propaganda and ideological work off and 
on. We should always do solid work in this regard. We should 
constantly keep a clear head and should not, to the slightest 
degree, slacken our efforts to publicize the importance of 
stabilizing the situation [dui wen ding ju shi de xuan chuan]. 
In propaganda, we should keep to the central theme of our 
society and carry forward our national spirit and the spirit of 
the times. We should arm the party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
should educate people in the theory and make it take root in the 
hearts of the people of various nationalities across the region 
so that it will become the basic guiding principles for all of 
our work. 
  Meanwhile, we should comprehensively and accurately 
publicize 
the party's basic theory and line and its principles and 
policies; we should publicize the creative spirit and heroic 
deeds demonstrated by the masses of people in the course of 
reform and construction; and we should help people emancipate 
their minds, change their ideas, do pioneering work, and make 
progress. We should focus our attention on doing a good job in 
reform and opening up, establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy. 
  Delegates said: In short, propaganda and ideological work 
is, 
as Comrade Jiang Zemin put it, to arm our people with scientific 
theories, guide them with correct publicity, inculcate them with 
high ideals, and encourage them with fine works of literature 
and art. 
  Delegates held: Propaganda and ideological work is 
systematic 
work. This work cannot be done by propaganda and ideological 
departments alone. Party committees and governments at various 
levels should further enhance their awareness of propaganda and 
ideological work and mentally overcome the practice of 
concentrating on economic work to the neglect of propaganda and 
ideological work. We must effectively carry out propaganda and 
ideological work as we do economic work. Propaganda and 
ideological departments should live up to the expectations of 
the party and the people by extensively carrying out propaganda 
and ideological work in order to mold favorable public opinion 
for our region's social stability, reform, and opening to the 
outside world.

  [Text] Changchun, April 24 (XINHUA)--The No. 1 Automobile 
Conglomerate, one of China's leading producers of motor 
vehicles, has achieved great success on the market due to its 
efforts in producing better cars in line with market demand. 
  According to officials with the company, in the first 
quarter 
of this year, it sold 41,000 automobiles of various kinds, and 
earned 4.24 billion yuan in return, both showing marked 
increases compared with the corresponding figures for the same 
period of last year. 
  As one of China's oldest manufacturers of motor vehicles, 
the 
conglomerate, headquartered in Changchun, the provincial capital 
of northeast China's Jilin Province, has grown into China's 
largest auto producer and is now able to turn out lorries, sedan 
cars, light-duty trucks, minivans, and buses in more than 100 
specifications. 
  Before 1978, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant used to produce 
only a few kinds of automobiles, and concentrated on the 
production of "Liberation" brand trucks for about 30 years 
without changes. 
  In the middle 1980s, the central government decided to carry 
out structural adjustment of the auto industry step by step, and 
issued industrial policies to encourage the production of 
different light-duty trucks and sedan cars. 
  In 1986, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant was listed as a 
production center of light-duty trucks, and the next year, it 
was made one of China's three major production bases of sedan 
cars. 
  Enjoying preferential policies concerning loans and 
fund-raising, the plant got 300 hectares of land around the old 
factory site to build two new workshops for producing light-duty 
trucks and sedan cars. 
  Besides importing sophisticated auto-making technology from 
Japan and the United States, the plant merged four other 
factories in Changchun and Jilin cities, and soon upgraded its 
light-duty trucks which are believed to have met the world's 
advanced standards. 
  A large number of light-duty trucks, new versions of 
"Liberation" vehicles produced with low costs and high quality, 
have been put onto the market since the beginning of this year 
and they are selling like hot cakes. 
  At the same time, the plant has also started development on 
28 types of other light-duty trucks. 
  Officials with the company said that the plant would turn 
out 
50,000 light-duty trucks this year. 
  In the meantime, construction of the sedan car production 
center has also made strides. At present, the No. 1 Automobile 
Conglomerate is able to produce three categories of sedan 
cars--Red Flag, Audi and Jieda. 
  Construction of the Sino-German joint venture plant between 
the No. 1 Automobile Company and the Volkswagen company of 
Germany is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and 
its workshops will produce 150,000 sedan cars a year. 
  Besides this production center of sedan cars in Changchun, 
China has got two other key production bases of sedan cars--one 
in Shanghai and the other in Shiyan city, central China's Hubei 
Province, in addition to three other centers in Beijing, Tianjin 
and Guangzhou for producing Beijing jeeps, Xiali cars and 
Peugeot cars.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Wang Sumei (3076 4790 2734): "Gu Jinchi, </F>
secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, conducts 
investigations and study in the southern areas of Liaoning 
Province"] 
  [Excerpts] Accompanied by Xu Wencai, standing committee 
member and secretary general of the provincial party committee, 
Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
conducted five-day investigation and study activities in 
Haicheng, Wafangdian, Pulandian, and Dalian from 30 March. 
After hearing the reports by various cities, districts, towns, 
and the provincial department for foreign trade and economic 
cooperation and visiting 10-odd production enterprises, markets, 
and peasant households, Comrade Gu Jinchi said pleasantly: "The 
areas in the southern part of the province have clear targets 
for developing agriculture, town and township enterprises, and 
the export-oriented economy; early entered the orbit of 
sustained, stable, and fast development; and made positive 
contributions to and provided extremely good experiences for the 
province's economic development." Simultaneously, he made an 
important speech on the current economic work, the current 
social situation, and party building. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Modernize Agriculture and To Urbanize the </H5>
Rural Areas 
  Comrade Gu Jinchi first stopped in Haicheng, one of the "100 
economically powerful counties" in the country. As soon as he 
arrived in Haicheng, he did not give a thought to his rest but 
asked the leading comrades of Anshan and Haicheng about the 
situations. The first question he asked was agricultural 
production. He said: "Liaoning is a large industrial province. 
Last year, the province reaped a bumper grain harvest and had 
grain and vegetables enough and to spare. The central 
authorities highly assessed this. On the basis of ensuring 
stable growing areas, this year, we should reap another grain, 
oil-bearing crop, and cotton harvests. This is a major issue 
which we should pay attention to. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Combine Various Sectors of the Economy </H5>
and To Accelerate the Rejuvenation of the Economy 
  Inspired by the spring wind of reform over the past years, 
the southern areas of the province have rapidly developed 
various sectors of the economy, including the individual, 
private, and collective ones, persistently with the public 
ownership constituting the mainstay. Last year, the total 
output value of the town and township enterprises in Haicheng 
reached 13.7 billion yuan, and the profits realized by these 
enterprises reached 1.4 billion yuan. Town and township 
enterprises account for two thirds of the economic sphere. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  To Develop Economy and Trade On a Large Scale, We Should </H5>
First Mobilize the Forces of All Fronts 
  On the morning of 2 April, Comrade Gu Jinchi heard the work 
reports of the Dalian city party committee and government and 
fully affirmed the work done by the city. He maintained: Last 
year, Dalian city made great achievements in its work. The 1994 
work ideas and priorities conform to the reality of the city. 
He hoped that according to the defined targets, the city will 
grasp favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand the scale 
of opening up, and further play a leading role in opening the 
province to the outside world. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  We Should Conscientiously Strengthen Party Building </H5>
  Wherever he went, he laid special stress on strengthening 
party building. He pointed out: we should pay attention to 
accumulating the experiences in bringing into play the party's 
role as a political core in the course of developing the 
socialist market economy. We should cultivate a group of young 
party-member specialized talents; select, according to the 
standards for "having ideals, education, morality, and a sense 
of discipline," young cadres with both ability and political 
integrity; and transfer them to the leading bodies at various 
levels. We should persist in the mass line when selecting and 
promoting cadres. Some individual leaders select persons 
according to their own tastes. So, they often make mistakes. 
The leading bodies at various levels should persist in the 
principle of democratic centralism, strengthen unity, closely 
cooperate with one another, and make concerted efforts to 
achieve their work. 
  Comrade Gu Jinchi said: We should realistically strengthen 
the construction of the grass-roots party organizations and pay 
attention to recruiting young outstanding party members from the 
forefront of production. The party organizations at various 
levels should proceed from the new situation and the new tasks 
and achieve the construction of ideas, organizations, and work 
style. Party-member cadres should take the lead in carrying 
forward the fine traditions of the party, establish close 
contacts with the masses, be the first to carry out the reform 
and open policies and develop the economy, and take the lead in 
guiding the masses to seek wealth.

  [Text] Panjin city has adopted measures to help staff 
members and workers overcome their living difficulties to 
safeguard social stability. Since the beginning of 1993, there 
have been more than 4,000 households that are encountering 
living difficulties in Panjin city. The city party committee 
and the city people's government have continuously paid 
attention to successfully dealing with the problems encountered 
by staff members and workers in life and employment. They have 
issued the certificate to staff members and workers whose per 
capita income is under 60 yuan and who may enjoy the social 
relief in various fields only by presenting this certificate. 
Since the beginning of 1993, the city has successively raised 
almost 1 million yuan of funds that have been used for subsidies 
and relief to over 1,700 staff members and workers who are faced 
with living difficulties. By increasing the variety of new 
products and implementing the policies on preferential 
treatment, the city has also reinforced the insurance system for 
unemployment and retirement in an effort to fundamentally deal 
with the living problems of staff members and workers. In 1993, 
the city opens more than 100 economic entities and enterprises 
that began the production and operation of more than 30 new 
projects and accommodated more than 6,800 lay-off staff members 
and workers as well as their jobless sons and daughters. The 
city has enforced the policies on preferential treatment among 
the staff members and workers who were laid off for a long time 
by encouraging them to open self-employed businesses and by 
giving consideration to them in the fields of workshops, funds, 
and industrial and commercial taxes. Meanwhile, the city has 
also enhanced the insurance system in unemployment and 
retirement. The per capita relief and retirement payments for 
all jobless personnel and retired staff members and workers 
across the city are respectively 90 yuan and 130 yuan each 
month. The city has invested 2.36 million yuan in building over 
300 production bases and organizations for the unemployed staff 
members and workers to provide for and help themselves by 
engaging in production. The number of enterprises that have 
suspended production or are in a state of semi-suspension 
throughout the city went from 132 in the past to 14 at present 
and the number of laid-off staff members and workers showed a 60 
percent decrease.

  [Excerpts] At a recent provincial meeting promoting the 
maintenance of good social order and commending those who boldly 
do what is right, Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: The 
entire party and the whole society must vigorously support and 
praise residents who are ready to take up the cudgel for the 
just cause of fighting against acts which violate the law, so 
that this practice can become a new symbol of our era. He 
added: Our purpose of safeguarding social order is to maintain 
social stability to ensure the smooth development of the cause 
of reform and opening up. 
  We must profoundly understand the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability. In according with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's ideas of doing two types of work simultaneously 
and attaching equal importance to both, we must grasp economic 
construction and reform and opening up with one hand, and grasp 
improvement of judicial system and cracking down on various 
criminal activities with the other. To do well in safeguarding 
social order, it is insufficient to rely on the strength of 
judicial organs alone. We must persist in the mass line and 
fully arouse the enthusiasm of the masses in safeguarding social 
order, and exploring a new way for improving social order in 
light of the development of the situation. [passage omitted] 
  Tian Chengping also called on CPC committees and governments 
at all levels to attach importance to the activities of 
publicizing the act of boldly doing what is right. They must 
strengthen leadership, make well-conceived arrangements, and 
take strong measures. These activities should be included in 
the general plan for the building of the socialist spiritual 
civilization and integrated with the efforts to inherit and 
carry forward Qinghai's spirit of striking deep roots on the 
plateau, working hard, exploring the way forward, and being 
selflessly devoted. We must go all out to make Qinghai strong 
and create its glorious future.

  [Excerpt] Our province's exports have increased gradually. 
By the end of this March, export volume of the whole province 
reached approximately $25 million, which accounted for 23.65 
percent of the total export volume for the whole year, and 
registered an increase of 30.25 percent over the same period 
last year. 
  This year the provincial economic and foreign trade 
department and various specialized companies have firmly grasped 
the fine opportunity of speeding up the pace of transforming 
operational mechanisms, unifying foreign exchange rates, and 
abolishing foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over 
foreign exchange to the state, to solve new problems arising in 
the foreign trade system through deepening reforms. They have 
also overcome various unfavorable factors such as an 
insufficient supply of goods and increases in export costs and 
loan interest rates. They have devoted their main efforts to 
tapping internal potential and enhancing economic efficiency.

  [Text] Xian, 25 Mar (XINHUA)--Song Ping concluded his 
17-day inspection of Shaanxi yesterday. During his inspection 
tour, Song Ping stressed: We must regard agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy. After we ensure grain and 
cotton acreages and increase their total output, we must adjust 
the agricultural production structure in rural areas and raise 
peasants' income level. 
  From 8 to 24 March, accompanied by Zhang Boxing, secretary 
of 
the Shaanxi Provincial CPC Party Committee; Cheng Andong, member 
of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee and 
secretary of the Xian city party committee; and Li Huanzheng, 
member of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee 
and secretary of the provincial party committee's Commission for 
Discipline Inspection, Song Ping visited factories, rural areas, 
and schools, and called on workers, peasants, experts, 
professors, and veteran comrades to acquire a better 
understanding of industrial and agricultural production, and the 
development of cultural and educational undertakings. Wherever 
he went, he held talks with local cadres and people and 
encouraged them to make greater progress. 
  Song Ping has worked in Shaanxi for 15 years. Song Ping 
said: Under the party's correct leadership, the provincial party 
committee and government have done a large amount of work. 
Shaanxi has developed rapidly and the major changes it has 
undergone are gratifying. Shaanxi has many strong points and 
should seize the opportunity to deepen reform and quicken 
development. 
  During his talks with grass-roots cadres, Song Ping said: 
Cadres should concentrate their efforts on mobilizing peasants 
to improve their living standards, vigorously develop village 
and town enterprises, and develop industry to assist in 
agricultural development. Cadres should work diligently at 
their posts, be honest in performing their official duties, and 
serve the people wholeheartedly. They should go down to the 
grass-roots units and establish close contact with people in an 
effort to communicate with units of lower levels and to resolve 
the masses' problems. Weinan prefecture carries out a very good 
measure requiring leading cadres to report their major decisions 
to the masses for approval. In this way, cadres are under the 
supervision of the party and the masses. Weinan must continue 
this measure. It is very important for us to build good 
grass-roots party and political power organs and to play the 
exemplary role of a party member. Only when we build good 
grass-roots party and political power organs, can we carry out 
the party's decisions and policies. While we are paying 
attention to material civilization construction, we must make 
great efforts to promote spiritual civilization construction, 
collectivism, patriotism, and socialism. We should do a good 
job in family planning and in promoting the overall development 
of the rural economy. Song Ping hoped party committee and 
government cadres at all levels would work hand in hand and make 
concerted efforts to build a better Shaanxi.

<F P=106> ["Report on the Implementation of Xingjiang's Budget for </F>
1993 and its Draft Budget for 1994" delivered by Gong Jinniu, 
director of Regional Finance Department, to the Second Session 
of the Eighth Xinjiang Regional People's Congress on 24 February 
1994"] 
  [Text] Deputies: 
  Being entrusted by the people's government of the autonomous 
region, I now submit the report on the implementation of the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's budget for 1993 and its draft 
budget for 1994 for your examination and approval. 
<H5>  1.Implementation of the Autonomous Region's Budget for 1993 </H5>
  In 1993, guided by the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the autonomous region earnestly implemented the 
series of important measures of the party central committee and 
the State Council for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control, earnestly carried out the resolutions of the first 
session of the eighth regional people's congress, and deepened 
reform in various areas, and further opened to the outside 
world, thus achieving new progress in developing the economy and 
other undertakings. On this basis, the budget was implemented 
well, and revenue income was considerably more than that 
received in 1992. Basically, expenditures were able to meet the 
needs for economic and social development. 
  The 1993 budget, approved at the first session of the eighth 
regional people's congress, is as follows: revenue 2.772 
billion yuan; expenditure 4.554 billion yuan. In the course of 
implementing the budget, it was partially readjusted with the 
approval of the fourth meeting of the standing committee of the 
eighth regional people's congress last September. After this, 
the central authority readjusted the revenue and expenditure 
figures in the region's budget. The readjusted budget is as 
follows: revenue 2.83 billion yuan and expenditure 6.634 
billion yuan. 
  The autonomous region's 1993 revenues and expenditures are 
expected to be as follows: revenue is expected to reach 3.47 
billion yuan, or 122.61 percent of the fiscal budget (the 
readjusted budget, same below) of 2.83 billion yuan, 
representing 640 million yuan more than the budgeted figure or 
an increase of 863 million yuan or 33.08 percent over 1992; 
expenditure is expected to amount to 6.446 billion yuan 
(including 229 million for workers' pay raises readjusted in the 
fourth quarter of 1993; this amount was listed under other 
categories of expenditures), or 97.17 percent of the fiscal 
budget of 6.634 billion yuan, representing an increase of 837 
million or 14.92 percent over 1992 (an increase of 608 million 
or 10.84 percent after deducting the amount to pay for workers' 
wage increases). 
  The main revenue figures are expected to be as follows: 
Industrial and business tax revenues are expected to total 3.146 
billion yuan, which is 123.37 percent of the budgeted figure, 
surpassing the budgeted figure by 596 million yuan and 
representing an increase of 819 million yuan or 35.19 percent 
over 1992; taxes from agriculture, animal husbandry, special 
agricultural and forestry products, the using of arable land, 
and contracts will be 136 million yuan, up 3.86 percent over the 
previous year; after profits are set against losses, 
enterprises' income will be 54 million yuan from canceled 
stocks, which is 52 million yuan short of the budgeted figure 
and represents 18 million yuan of fewer stocks canceled compared 
with 1992. Actual revenue from grain will be 42 million yuan 
less than the budgeted figure after deducting 59 million of 
losses in 1993 (used as grain price subsidies for workers of 
enterprises and institutions). In 1993, the autonomous region's 
revenues rose by a large margin, surpassing the previous year's 
figure by 863 million yuan. The main reasons are: first, the 
region earnestly implemented the CPC Central Committee's 
Document No. 6 and strengthened overall regulation and control 
over its economy. Production expanded, the market was brisk, 
and revenue sources increased. Business tax increased by 260 
million yuan (not including the income from raised tax rates) 
due to the expansion of commodity circulation and the increase 
in retail sales; second, the region strengthened tax collection 
and management, resolutely put a stop to new tax exemptions and 
reductions, and recovered back taxes; and third, the central 
authorities raised the tax rate for Xinjiang's petroleum 
products, started levying a crude oil tax, changed the rules for 
collecting taxes from processed crude oil products, and raised 
the tax rate for retail businesses. These policies will result 
in a tax income increase of 280 million yuan. 
  The main expenditures are expected to break down as 
follows: Capital construction expenditures, 650 million yuan, 
an increase of 26 million yuan or 4.1 percent over 1992; 
expenditures for tapping the potential of and transforming 
enterprises, 158 million yuan, up 37.01 percent over the 
previous year; expenses for three scientific and technological 
projects, 41 million yuan, up 23.23 percent over 1992; expenses 
for support of rural production, 304 million yuan, up 3.89 
percent over 1992; expenses for agricultural, animal husbandry, 
forestry, water conservation, and weather departments, 370 
million yuan, up 7.07 percent over the previous year; expenses 
for education, culture, and public health, 1.775 billion yuan, 
an increase of 15.92 percent over 1992, of which education 
expenditure, 1.70 billion yuan, up 14.26 percent over 1992; 
expenses for science and technology, 63 million yuan, up 13.62 
percent over 1992; administrative expenses, 1.1 billion yuan, an 
increase of 20.46 percent over the previous year; expenditures 
for public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs, 337 
million yuan, up 25.21 percent over 1992. The above expenses do 
not include the expenditure for pay raises effective since the 
fourth quarter of last year. The expenditure was listed under 
another category. 
  In 1993, expenses for various undertakings, especially 
administrative expenditures, in the autonomous region rose 
considerably, and expenses for production and construction 
projects also rose to varying degrees. The increase in the 
administrative expenses and expenses for other undertakings was 
caused by the increase in pay for personnel. Price rises also 
contributed to the increase in the expenses for various 
undertakings. Last year, despite serious financial 
difficulties, we basically ensured wage payments for workers of 
administrative departments and institutions and also ensured the 
funds for the development of the economy and other undertakings 
as set in the budget. This is the result of the joint efforts 
of various localities and departments and is also the result of 
assistance from the central authorities. Last year, the central 
authorities loaned our region 200 million yuan to help alleviate 
our shortage of funds. 
  Next I would like to report on the execution of the 1993 
budget at the autonomous regional level. Total revenues are 
expected to be [as published] 365 million yuan, 168 million yuan 
more than budgetary target and 135 million yuan or 58.61 percent 
more than 1992 revenues. Of the total revenues, industrial and 
commercial taxes amounted to 347 million yuan, 157 million yuan 
more than the budgetary target and 167 million yuan more than 
the 1992 figure. The net revenues from state-owned enterprises 
of the autonomous regional level amounted to 69 million yuan, 
which included income tax, regulatory tax, and profit delivery 
after deduction of subsidies to those enterprises which suffered 
business losses; and the figure was 30 million yuan less than 
the budgetary target. The total expenditures are expected to be 
1.825 billion yuan (including 45 billion yuan for wage increases 
for regional- level organizations in three months of 1993), 
fulfilling 77.27 percent of the fiscal budget and up 167 million 
yuan or 10.05 percent from 1992 figure (the slow progress of the 
expenditure was because there were more carry-overs of special 
central fundings and they were used in wage payments in various 
localities). 
  The above is the situation of the budget's execution. After 
the final accounts are completed, there will be some changes in 
figures and another report will be delivered then. 
  To fulfill the 1993 budget targets, all localities and 
departments continued to strengthen their leadership over fiscal 
work, made great efforts to increase revenues and reduce 
expenditures, and concentrated on the following aspects of work: 
  (1) Great efforts were made to support the development of 
production and cultivate financial resources. In the second 
half of 1993, finance departments at all levels made rational 
distribution of funds, basically ensured funds for productive 
undertakings, increased investment in agriculture and animal 
husbandry through various channels, and ensured timely 
availability of funds for the purchase of agricultural products. 
They used circulation funds in supporting the technological 
transformation of enterprises and thus helped enterprises to 
promote production. They took a further step to support the 
development of border towns and the county-level economy. They 
serviced the World Bank's loans on time, and all projects 
undertaken with the loans are proceeding smoothly, gradually 
yielding economic and social benefits. 
  (2) Efforts were made to improve the collection and 
management of revenues. All local authorities screened tax 
reductions and exemptions they had previously approved, as well 
as local provisions on the two funds [construction funds for key 
energy and communications projects and budgetary regulatory 
funds]. They abolished some improper policies and stopped 
approving requests for tax reduction or exemption on grounds of 
temporary difficulties. So, the situation of approving 
unwarranted tax reductions and tax exemptions at will were by 
and large brought under control. They also corrected the 
practice of some enterprises paying a fixed amount of turnover 
tax by contract and thus upheld the dignity of the tax law. At 
the same time, they improved the collection and management of 
agricultural and animal husbandry taxes and overfulfilled their 
treasury bond sales task. 
  (3) Funds were distributed in a rational way to ensure 
funding for key expenditures. They adhered to the principle of 
ensuring funding for wages, basic administrative expenses, and 
winter needs, and gave first priority to funding the wages and 
operating expenses of administrative organizations and 
institutions. They also ensured funds for maintaining social 
stability, combating natural disasters and providing relief, and 
preventing and controlling diseases. At the same time, they 
attached importance to saving administrative operating expenses, 
and in the second half of the year stopped approving most 
requests of administrative institutions for buying controlled 
commodities. 
  (4) They did a good preparatory work for the reform of the 
fiscal and taxation systems in support of economic 
restructuring. Following the unified arrangements made by the 
Party Central Committee and the State Council, they seriously 
prepared for the implementation of the revenue-sharing system -- 
an objective of the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. 
The fiscal departments at various levels earnestly implemented 
"Regulations on Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," helped enterprises exercise 
their autonomy, and seriously did a good job in signing the 
third round of contracts with enterprises. They achieved very 
good results in deepening the reform of the commodity 
distribution system and in reforming the grain management 
system, and did a great deal of work in improving the 
reappraisal of the assets of administrative institutions. They 
made positive efforts to appraise assets, define property 
rights, and register property rights. They began, as scheduled, 
the implementation of "general principles of financial affairs 
of enterprises," "rules for enterprise accounting," and the 
accounting systems for various professions and trades on 1 July 
1993. As a result, those major reforms were carried out 
smoothly. 
  (5) Efforts were made to rectify fiscal and taxation order 
and enforce financial and economic discipline. They seriously 
conducted a general inspection of taxation and financial work 
and achieved certain success. They generally screened the 
circulation funds and improved their management. They adopted 
effective measures and basically stopped unwarranted pooling of 
funds, arbitrary imposition of fines and exaction of fees, and 
unauthorized requisition of donations. Those measures have 
played an important role in reducing the unreasonable burdens of 
enterprises and the people. 
  While achievements were the main feature of the autonomous 
region's fiscal work in 1993, it also had many difficulties and 
problems. The major problems were as follows: The problem of 
low growth and low efficiency among enterprises was not 
fundamentally solved. The losses suffered by industrial 
enterprises covered by the budget continued to increase and most 
enterprises lacked the basis for further development, impeding 
revenue increases. The net increase of income of most 
prefectures and counties was far from being sufficient for 
defraying the increase of expenditures, because the revenue base 
was small, the expenditure base was large, and the increase of 
revenues was uneven among various localities. Moreover, it is 
difficult to reduce present expenditures because a large portion 
is wages; and so, the financial situation is becoming worse. 
With increasing debts and financial deficits, the financial 
difficulties are becoming greater and greater at all levels. 
Because of deficits, more special-purpose funds have been 
diverted to other-than-intended purposes, causing difficulties 
in fund distribution and frequent delay in wage payments. While 
these are financial problems, they are also a comprehensive 
reflection of social and economic problems. 
<H5>  2.Draft budget of the autonomous region for 1994 </H5>
  The autonomous region's budget for 1994 is projected in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Sixth (enlarged) Plenary 
Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, as well 
as the guidelines of the national economic work conference and 
financial work conference. The guiding principles for budget 
projection are to actively and properly promote the 
revenue-sharing system during the reform of the fiscal system 
and other relevant reforms and continue to strengthen and 
improve overall fiscal regulation and control; by promoting 
production and enhancing economic efficiency, to vigorously 
cultivate financial resources, continue to manage taxation 
according to law, step up tax collection, and strive to achieve 
a steady revenue growth; and in accordance with the principle of 
"feeding the people and building the region simultaneously," to 
give first priority to paying wages while making overall 
arrangements for other expenditures, so as to ensure a social 
and political stability, ensure a smooth proceeding of reform 
and opening up, and bring about a rapid and highly effective 
economic development in the autonomous region. 
  Following the central authorities' unified plan and the 
State 
Council's "decision on implementation of the revenue-sharing 
fiscal system," Xinjiang began the revenue-sharing fiscal system 
on 1 January 1994. The revenue-sharing system is implemented on 
the basis of the reform of the taxation system. The reform of 
the taxation system mainly involved the reform of the turnover 
tax. The new turnover tax system is mainly based on the 
value-added tax, supplemented by the consumption tax and the 
business tax. Under the new revenue-sharing system, the central 
government receives all revenues from the consumption tax and 75 
percent of the revenues from the value-added tax; while the 
local government receives 25 percent of the revenues from the 
value-added tax and all the revenues from the business tax. 
Other tax revenues are shared roughly according to old 
proportions. The tax revenues delivered to the central 
government will be based on the 1993 figure. If more revenues 
are delivered than in the previous year, the central government 
will keep a larger share of the increased portion while 
returning the rest to the local government. 
  Our 1994 budget is projected in accordance with the 
aforesaid 
guiding principles, the quotas set for Xinjiang by the national 
financial work conference, the autonomous regional economic and 
social development plan for 1994, and the requirements of the 
revenue-sharing system. Our targets are: revenues, 2.448 
billion yuan, up 9.86 percent or 220 million yuan from the 
comparable, readjusted 1993 revenues of 2.227 billion yuan; 
expenditures, 6.615 billion yuan, an increase of 27.21 percent 
or 1.415 billion yuan over the 1993 base figure (excluding the 
spendings defrayed by special central fundings and the spendings 
on wage increase in the fourth quarter) if calculated in terms 
of comparable items. 
  (1) The autonomous region's major revenue targets in 1994 
are: industrial and commercial taxes, 2.064 billion yuan; five 
agricultural taxes, 212 million yuan; enterprise income tax, 408 
million yuan; subsidies [source not further clarified] for 
state- owned enterprises which suffer losses, 394 million yuan; 
and other incomes, 60 million yuan. 
  In arranging the above revenue targets, we have taken into 
consideration such favorable factors as increased production and 
commodity circulation. At the same time, we have also 
considered some policies which will decrease the revenues. 
According to our estimate, we expect to increase the business 
tax revenue by approximately 100 million yuan this year. We 
also expect to increase the resource tax by approximately 100 
million yuan due to increased crude oil output, and collect some 
30 million yuan more in agricultural tax due to higher prices of 
agricultural products. This shows that the 1994 budget is 
properly projected. 
  (2) Major expenditure targets are: capital construction, 400 
million yuan; enterprise transformation, 93 million yuan; 
support for agricultural production, 217 million yuan; operating 
expenses of agricultural, animal husbandry, forestry, water, and 
gas departments, 442 million yuan; operating expenses for 
cultural, education and public health departments, 2.456 billion 
yuan -- of which the education department will receive 1.534 
billion yuan; operation expenses for science undertakings, 80 
million yuan; administrative expenses, 1.345 billion yuan; and 
expenses for the work of public security, the procuratorate and 
the judiciary, 451 million yuan. 
  The additional expenditures 
for 1994 include the additional budget of 915 million yuan for 
wage reform (assessed on the basis of wage increases for 12 
months)--which has been incorporated with allotments for various 
administrative projects--and 500 million yuan for hiring 
additional personnel. This year's allotments for various 
administrative projects have grown by a fairly large percentage, 
primarily because of higher wages. 
  (3) Views about arrangements for the regional treasury's 
receipts and payments in 1994: 
  1. The regional treasury's receipts in 1994 will be 1.7 
million yuan in the red. Among the receipts will be 115 million 
yuan from business taxes, 130 million yuan from state 
enterprises' income taxes, and 290 million yuan for subsidizing 
state enterprises' losses, which are permitted by policy. 
  2. The regional treasury's budgetary payments in 1993 will 
be 
1.631 billion yuan (certain budgets will be allotted to local 
authorities). This includes 1.437 billion yuan of basic 
expenditures--same as those in 1993--154 million yuan for wage 
increase, 20 million yuan for law enforcement, and 20 million 
yuan for enterprises' technological upgrading. 
  3. The amount of money available for the region's use in 
1994 
will be 1.524 billion yuan after the subsidies for lower 
authorities have been deducted from the region's revenues, which 
also include the central government's regular subsidies and tax 
refunds; but because of the 1.631 billion yuan of budgetary 
expenses, there will be a deficit of 107 million yuan. 
  It must be pointed out here that the region's expenditures 
for 1994 are based on the basic budgets in early 1993, plus 154 
million yuan for wage increase and an additional 40 million yuan 
for law enforcement and technological upgrading, and not on the 
basis of budgetary expenditures in 1993. Budgets for certain 
essential expenses in 1994 are not arranged. 
<H5>  3.Strive To Accomplish the Autonomous Region's 1994 </H5>
Budgetary Plans by Implementing Measures for Increasing Revenues 
and Conserving Expenditures 
  To accomplish the region's budgetary plans for 1994, 
safeguard the region's social and political stability, and 
expedite the region's economic growth and development of other 
causes, we must follow through with the guidelines laid down by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
the Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fourth Xinjiang 
Regional Party Committee. Surrounding the general 
requirement--"seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and 
maintaining stability"--we must give priority to accomplishing 
the following projects: 
  (1) We must speed up the pace of reform. This is the first 
year for carrying out the reform of establishing separated 
central and local taxation systems, we must positively and 
reliably carry out this and other relevant fiscal and tax reform 
projects according to the central authorities' consolidated 
plan. We must positively and reliably reform state enterprises' 
profit-sharing system, properly distribute their profits, and 
see to it that they change their operating mechanisms. We must 
manage state-owned assets more efficiently, continue to 
reappraise enterprises' stocks and assets, and determine their 
property rights, and make sure that the state's assets and 
interests are not violated. 
  (2) We must broaden the sources of financial incomes through 
supporting the development of production. All localities and 
departments must continue to attach great importance to 
supporting agricultural production and animal husbandry. They 
should do their best to increase investments in agriculture and 
animal husbandry as well as in the development of agricultural 
projects which yield a high output of quality products, and 
actively support the development of secondary and tertiary 
industries in rural areas, especially the development of village 
and town enterprises. We must continue to attach importance to 
enterprises' technological upgrading and assist them to improve 
their production technology, operations, and management so that 
they can become more competitive in the market. We must 
energetically support the development of local trade and border 
trade. All localities should give full scope to their 
resources so that their rich resources can be turned into 
economic strength and financial resources. 
  (3) We must ensure a sustained and steady increase of 
taxes through tightening tax collection and management. All 
localities and departments must earnestly implement the "Tax 
Collection and Management Law," we must do our work strictly in 
accordance with regulations, and collect taxes according to the 
established tax rates. While exercising strict control over tax 
deductions and exemptions, we must make great efforts in 
screening delinquent tax payments. In accordance with the tax 
law, we must strictly handle individuals and units which have 
evaded or contested tax payments, and we must make sure that all 
small tax loopholes are plugged and all taxes are delivered to 
the treasury in full. 
  (4) We must intensify control over our budgets and spend 
money rationally. To uphold the solemnity of budgets, all 
localities and departments must carry out their projects 
according to budget availability, and uphold the principle that 
receipts and payments are uniformly controlled, and that large 
receipts and payments must be collectively decided. Considering 
the current financial difficulties and financial capabilities, 
and in accordance with the principle of making overall plans and 
taking all factors into consideration, all localities and 
departments must rationally spend their funds according to 
urgency and priority. Payment of workers' wages must have 
precedence over various other expenditures, and expenses for 
combating disasters, relief services, and medical services must 
be ensured. We must tighten the management of nonappropriated 
funds, continue to audit the receipt and payment of all units' 
nonappropriated funds, and encourage all units to make up 
insufficient budgets with their nonappropriated funds. 
  (5) We must adopt strict measures for increasing revenues 
and conserving expenditures and count on society to tide over 
financial difficulties with concerted efforts. We must heighten 
our sense of reform, properly solve our needs this year with 
unconventional methods, and firmly stop unwarranted projects 
that increase spending and reduce income. To ensure a sustained 
growth of revenues, all localities and departments must 
energetically develop production, and make positive efforts to 
achieve higher economic returns and explore financial resources. 
Meanwhile, we must strictly control expenditures. We must 
strictly control the size of capital construction projects, stop 
authorizing new construction projects and all types of office 
buildings, auditoriums, guesthouses, and activity centers. We 
must adopt specific measures to curtail expenses for meetings, 
strictly control establishment of additional organs and 
expansion of authorized staff sizes, and correct the impropriety 
of giving out unwarranted cash awards and allowances. We must 
tighten management of budgets for public-funded medical services 
to stop waste while making sure that sick people will receive 
medical attention. Administrative units and institutions 
throughout Xinjiang must have special bank accounts to ensure 
the availability of money for wages. Effective measures must be 
taken to stop certain wasteful practices to which the masses 
have responded strongly. We must firmly stop the improper 
tendency of purchasing luxury cars, and firmly stop the use of 
public funds for housing renovations that exceed established 
standards. 
  We are confronted with a very grim financial situation this 
year. To tide over the difficulties, we must adopt some strict 
measures for increasing revenues and conserving expenditures, 
but this certainly will affect the interests of some departments 
and units. So that the measures for increasing revenues and 
conserving expenditures can be effectively carried out, we need 
the understanding and support of all social quarters. Leading 
cadres at all levels, in particular, must set personal examples 
in this regard. 
  Fellow deputies, Xinjiang's financial problems have become 
even worse this year. To alleviate the problems, society as a 
whole must continue to support financial retrenchment projects; 
have a clear view on the financial situation; understand the 
need to lead a plain life, work diligently and thriftily, 
consider the overall needs, help one another, and tighten our 
belts; and give financial departments the support they need in 
attaining their goals. Under the correct guidance of the 
regional party committee, and with the supervision and support 
of people's congresses in Xinjiang, we must count on people of 
all nationalities in our region, earnestly follow the guidelines 
laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and those by the Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of 
the Fourth Xinjiang Regional Party Committee, stop empty talk, 
and work earnestly and practically to accomplish all budgetary 
assignments of our autonomous region this year.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Zhirong (1728 2784 2837), member of the Department </F>
of International Politics at Beijing University: "Xinjiang 
Comes Under the Onslaught of Various Foreign Forces"--first 
paragraph is TANGTAI introduction] 
  [Text] Muslim fundamentalism, which began emerging in the 
1990's after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, is now 
rocking both the East and the West, as well as China's Xinjiang 
region. The Organization of East Turkistan has staged a 
comeback and has demanded the independence of Xinjiang. The 
United States has also made some new moves along the Chinese 
border. Xinjiang is tumultuous. 
  According to a report carried by China's RENMIN GONGAN BAO 
on 
25 January 1994, in Urumqi, Xinjiang's regional capital, public 
security police found many reactionary slogans from outside the 
border, and the main idea of them was: "No communist party, no 
Han people; we want only Muslims and independence." In recent 
years, similar anticommunist and anti-Han slogans could often be 
found in Xinjiang. This is a reflection of the attempts by some 
major powers to strengthen penetration into China's frontier 
regions, where ethnic minorities live, since the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union. 
  Since the threat from the Soviet Union disappeared, Iran, 
Turkey, and other big powers in Central Asia have become very 
ambitious; they want to use their religious and cultural 
influences to control the regions of Central Asia, whereas the 
United States also wants to use its world-class hegemonic 
strength to fill the political vacuum in Central Asia. The 
Republic of Kazakhstan, which has just become independent and 
possesses nuclear weapons, also wants to ask the Chinese 
Government to return its territories and people. Under such 
complicated circumstances, China's Xinjiang region is enduring 
both open strifes and veiled struggles among various foreign 
forces. 
<H5>  Iran and Turkey Step Up Offensives Against Xinjiang </H5>
  The rejuvenation of Islamic fundamentalism takes place 
mainly 
in Central Asia. The disintegration of the Soviet Union enabled 
Islam, which was suppressed for several decades in Central Asian 
nations, to rapidly grow. The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in 
Central Asia has affected the security of China's frontier 
regions. 
  China has 17 million Muslims, of whom over 6 million live in 
Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia. They have close 
historical, ethnic, and religious links to Central Asia. After 
the liberation of Xinjiang, the activists who had fought for 
Xinjiang's independence fled to Central Asia, waited for a 
chance to come back, and continued to carry out pro-independence 
activities. 
  The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in Central Asia is 
inseparable from the efforts by the major Muslim countries, such 
as Turkey and Iran, to expand their influence in the former 
Soviet republics and the six countries in Central Asia. 
Historically, Turkey has been linguistically and culturally 
linked to Central Asian nations such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Kazakhstan. It preaches "Greater Turkism" in Central Asia 
and attempts to establish a federation spanning from Turkey to 
Xinjiang. 
  Iran also has religious links to Central Asian nations such 
as Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, and has many Shiites. Iran thinks 
that since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a vacuum has 
emerged in Central Asia which ought to be filled by 
fundamentalism. For this reason, Iran has sent government 
officials and religious scholars there, with their Koran, to 
launch diplomatic and cultural offensives against Central Asia. 
China's Xinjiang has naturally felt the repercussions of the 
Muslim offensive. 
<H5>  East Turkey Group Once Again Becomes Active </H5>
  In the 1930's and 1940's, Xinjiang had a force for 
independence. A short-lived East Turkistan Republic was founded 
in 1933. At the end of the 1940's a group of Muslims who 
advocated Xinjiang's independence and were led by Aisha [5337 
3097] attempted to grasp the political power of Xinjiang 
Province; they also preached Turkism. After the liberation of 
the whole country, the Aisha group fled to the Republic of 
Turkey and carried out pro-independence activities outside the 
border. 
  Since the great changes in the Soviet Union and East Europe, 
the Aisha group has become more active in carrying out 
pro-independence activities. They strengthened ideological 
propaganda toward the Xinjiang region, established publication 
organs, and compiled books and magazines, which they secretly 
brought to Xinjiang to preach the theory of "independence" among 
Xinjiang youths. In west Asia and Turkey, the activists 
advocating Xinjiang independence also took the opportunities 
arising from pilgrimages, tours, and homecoming trips to enter 
and leave Xinjiang and support the masses in confrontation with 
the government, so as to "drive the Han people out." When Usupu 
Aisha Alpertgene [you su pu ai sha a er pa te jin 1429 4790 2528 
5337 3097 7093 1422 1584 3676 6855], leader of the former East 
Turkistan, expounded on the Koran in Istanbul at the age of over 
90, he often advocated that Xinjiang's Muslims should stand up 
for resistance. Shortly before he died, he handed to Turkish 
prime minister Ozal a banner symbolizing independence. 
  Aisha also fostered links with activists advocating the 
independence of Tibet, and published articles in TIBET REVIEW, 
which was headed by the Dalai Lama. The articles encouraged the 
followers of the Dalai Lama and Aisha to unite for the cause of 
confronting the Han people and realizing the independence of 
Xinjiang and Tibet. 
  Kazakhstan's Influence Quietly Taking Shape 
  The Republic of Kazakhstan, a former republic in the Soviet 
Union, is a big country in Central Asia. After its 
independence, nationalism in the country has increased. Last 
year, in Alma Ata, its capital, a grand world meeting of 
representatives of Kazakhs was held to preach greater Kazakh 
nationalism and unity of Kazakhs. 
  China shares 1,724 km of borders with Kazakhstan. Within 
China there are 1.12 million Kazakhs, among whom 99 percent live 
in Xinjiang, with a small number in Gansu and Qinghai. They are 
linguistically and culturally linked to Kazakhstan. 
  Last year, a delegation of Chinese scholars visited 
Kazakhstan. Several Kazakh writers talked lavishly about greater 
Kazakh nationalism to the Chinese scholars. They thought that 
Kazakhstan may abandon territorial claims from China, but the 
Chinese Government must let the Kazakhs living in Xinjiang 
return to their mother nation of Kazakhstan. Although the 
Sino-Kazakh border was already fixed in the Qing dynasty, most 
boundary tablets have collapsed or become blurred over the 
years. Kazakhstan has used this as an excuse to raise several 
territorial claims from China, but the Chinese Government has 
always suspected that those claims are attempts to swallow up 
the areas inhabited by the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. 
<H5>  Kazakhstan's Nuclear Weapons Pose a Threat to China </H5>
  In addition, the Republic of Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons 
also pose a threat to the security of northwest China. The 
Soviet Union built nuclear weapons factories in Kazakhstan. 
Brezhnev once threatened to use the nuclear weapons there to 
perform a surgery on the bases in northwest China. It cannot 
but make people worry that once nuclear proliferation occurs and 
nuclear weapons fall into the hands of the fundamentalists, 
China's national security will be threatened. 
  The disintegration of the Soviet Union has caused a power 
vacuum in Central Asia, and this is a stimulus for the 
rejuvenation of Islam. The United States wants to fill the 
vacuum, so as to offset the influences of Iran and 
fundamentalism. 
  Early last year, former U.S. Secretary of State Baker twice 
visited Central Asia as Iran launched a large-scale diplomatic 
offensive in Central Asia. He said he hoped that the nations 
there could establish governments after the Western model; 
otherwise, the United States would not establish diplomatic 
relations with them. The United States also carried out 
penetrations through the pro-U.S. moderate Islamic countries 
such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to resist Iran and restrain the 
swelling fundamentalism. 
<H5>  The United States Fills Vacuum, Posing Threats to Chinese </H5>
Frontier Regions 
  The United States is stepping up efforts to fill the power 
vacuum in Central Asia, and in so doing, it tries to kill two 
birds with one stone. First, as mentioned above, to check Iran 
and fundamentalism; and second, in the areas north and west of 
China, to strengthen the mechanisms restraining China. In fact, 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the most powerful 
ideological enemy left to the United States is China. China has 
become the main target of the "peaceful evolution" which is 
being carried out by the United States. It seems that it is not 
strange to see the United States launching a thorough 
encirclement against China's border security. 
  Since 1987 the United States has harbored the intention to 
intervene in China's southwest frontier and Tibet, and the U.S. 
Congress has more than once deliberated a "Tibet Human Rights 
Bill," to support the Dalai Lama's activities for Tibetan 
independence. The Voice of America has newly launched a 
Tibetan-language broadcast, and people believe that this is to 
coordinate with the relevant policy of the United States. 
  In April 1993 the U.S. and Russian sides conducted the first 
air exercise in Siberia since World War II. U.S. planes 
appeared for the first time in the areas north of China, causing 
concern in China. Yeltsin tried to join the NATO grouping. 
Will there be a scenario in which the United States and Russia 
join forces in the areas north of China to jointly deal with 
China's defense in the north? 
  What is more important is that Mongolia has shown some signs 
that it is becoming an arena for competition among the major 
powers in the international community. Against such a 
background, will Xinjiang, which is under the influence of the 
rapid changes in the situation of Central Asia, become another 
"arena"?

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS] in a letter formally informed the Strait Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] on 22 April about the details of the Chientao 
[Qiandao] Lake tragedy. The SEF and the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC] held an urgent meeting to discuss the letter. 
They decided that the investigation results provided by 
Communist China were not acceptable because they failed to 
provide reasonable answers to some doubts raised by the victims' 
families and our relevant departments. 
  The MAC authorized the SEF to reply in a letter today to 
express the hope that the mainland authorities will send us all 
information, including records of the investigation, and to once 
again express a strong demand that a special meeting between the 
SEF and the ARATS be held in Hong Kong on 27 April as scheduled. 
  The MAC also said: If Communist China does not provide a 
reasonable explanation, the MAC will when necessary release the 
report compiled by our investigating group and compare it with 
the one compiled by Communist China. Here is Liu Yu-mei's 
report: 
  [Begin recording] After newspapers in Hong Kong carried 
detailed stories about the Chientao Lake incident, the ARATS 
informed the SEF in a written message on 22 April and provided a 
relatively concrete report. In the letter, the SEF said: Wu 
Li-hong [Wu Lihong], Hu Chih-han [Hu Zhihan], and Yu Ai-chun [Yu 
Aijun] plotted as early as last year to rob tourists on Chientao 
Lake by using a motorboat. On 31 March, they climbed aboard the 
Haijui [Hairui] tourist boat and committed the crimes of 
robbery, murder, and arson which caused 32 deaths. 
  The letter pointed out: After a 17-day investigation, the 
case was brought to light. The police retrieved $5,250, 154,000 
new Taiwan dollars, a video camera, six cameras, eight rings, 
one jade bracelet, and two Rolex watches. 
  The SEF was not satisfied with the report. SEF Deputy 
Secretary General Shih Chi-ping said that the information 
revealed by the ARATS was only partial in nature. He expressed 
his hope that the mainland will provide more detailed facts and 
that it will promptly answer in clear terms whether the two 
parties will hold special cross-strait consultations on this 
case. 
  [Shih] It is our hope that the ARATS will provide us with 
more detailed information so that we can have a better 
understanding of this case. We also hope that they will give us 
a clear answer as soon as possible concerning the request stated 
in our previous letter. 
  [Liu] Shih Chi-ping said that the MAC and the SEF will 
respond to the ARATS' letter in the near future. This is Liu 
Yu-mei reporting from the SEF. [end recording]

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA)--Taiwan will soon send a 
delegation to the capital of Zhejiang Province to learn more 
about Mainland China's investigation into the March 31 Qiandao 
Lake incident, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered and 
robbed, Li Ching-ping, deputy director-general of the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday [25 February]. 
  Li said that the delegation, to leave sometime this week, 
will be comprised of SEF officials, retired police detectives, 
and relatives of the victims. SEF is Taiwan's non-official 
conduit for mainland- Taiwan relations. 
  This will be the first time Taiwan has sent a group to learn 
more about a criminal case on the mainland since the opening of 
cross- strait civilian exchanges, sources said. 
  Beijing announced on April 17 that it arrested three men 
suspected of committing the "heinous murder, robbery and arson." 
  Although Beijing has closed the probe of the case, it is 
still unable to answer some questions posed by the victims' 
relatives. 
  Li called on Beijing to release autopsy reports made after 
the incident and said the Taiwan delegation will give the 
mainland time to prepare such reports if it has not done so 
already. 
  Li added that a time and venue have not been picked for a 
proposed special meeting between SEF and its mainland 
counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS) to discuss travel safety in the wake of the boat 
incident. 
  Li said that SEF has asked ARATS to suggest a suitable time 
and venue for the meeting. 
  SEF proposed to hold the meeting April 27-28 in either Hong 
Kong or Taipei.

  [Text] About eight to 10 renegade soldiers of the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] were involved in the mass murder of 24 
Taiwan tourists last month and the three mainland civilians 
arrested were just scapegoats, lawmakers quoted Taiwan's top 
intelligence officials as saying. Lawmaker Chen Shui-pien 
quoted National Security Bureau Director (Yin Chung-wen) as 
saying that their intelligence sources in the Mainland showed 
that PLA soldiers were behind the Chientao [Qiandao] lake murder. 
  From the beginning of the incident, the National Security 
Bureau sources indicated that it was a premeditated robbery and 
murder case, not an accident as earlier claimed by Chechiang 
[Zhejiang] authorities, the lawmaker said. Mainland authorities 
on Sunday [17 April] announced the arrest of three civilian 
suspects, all natives of Chechiang, on charges of murder, 
robbery, and arson but they gave few details about them or the 
evidence against the suspects. In Peking [Beijing] on Wednesday 
[20 April], an Mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman categorically 
denied Taiwan's allegation of army involvement in this pleasure 
boat arson.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 25 KYODO--Taiwan has dispatched a 
pair of police patrol boats to the Spratly Islands in the South 
China Sea to protect Taiwanese fishing vessels and reassert its 
claim over the disputed islands, Taiwan's UNITED DAILY NEWS 
[LIEN HO PAO] reported Monday [25 April]. 
  According to the influential daily, the vessels with 30 
police officers with machine guns departed Taiwan on April 16 
and landed on the Taiping Island, the group's largest island, 
where the Taiwanese contingent is stationed. 
  The islands are claimed by six different nations, including 
China which concluded an oil exploration and development 
contract with a U.S. oil corporation in 1992. 
  Taiwan police said the dispatch aimed at of checking the 
safety of a route to the island in the wake of seizure of 
Taiwanese vessels by the Philippines and Vietnam, according to 
the daily. 
  The fishing vessels have also reported several incidents of 
being pursued by pirates, the police said. 
  In addition to Taiwan, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines, 
Malaysia and Brunei also claim sovereignty over the Spratly 
Islands.

  [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- A Taipei prosecutor on 
Friday [22 April] indicted seven retired middle-ranking military 
officers for either illegally obtaining or leaking top military 
secrets to arms dealers, as the worst military scandal in 
Taiwan's history continued to unravel. 
  The move brought to 11 the number of people charged for 
their 
complicity in the military scandal in which two officers each 
were indicted in February and April. Three other officers and 
four civilians also have been arrested for their roles in the 
scandal, which started to unfold after the mysterious death of 
Naval Capt. Yin Ching-feng in December. 
  Investigators say Yin was killed because he threatened to 
expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired 
military officers representing European companies paid 
active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts. 
  The investigators have been helped in tracking down other 
arms dealers and officers involved in the scandal by information 
gleaned from classified Navy documents they uncovered during a 
Christmas Eve raid on the home of Chang Chia-cheng, an arms 
dealer and former Army colonel who has also been indicted. 
  The classified information, covering the six French-built 
Lafayette frigates and the two Swordfish submarines the 
Netherlands has constructed for Taiwan, was allegedly leaked by 
active-duty officers. The two projects are part of the Navy's 
military buildup. 
  In addition to Chang, who allegedly bribed officers to 
obtain 
the secrets, Liang Kang-hsien, who was suspected of leaking 
military secrets before he retired as an Air Force major, and 
Liu Shu, a retired Navy captain, have also been indicted. The 
three could be sentenced to death if found guilty. 
  Four other people indicted by the prosecutor include Tien 
Ching- wen and three arms dealers--Wu Yu-cheng, Li Hung-wei, and 
Wu Pao- tai. They face a punishment of up to seven years in 
jail if found guilty.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Five navy admirals have 
denied being members of mysterious, decades-old secret society, 
according to the task force formed to investigate the murder of 
Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng and the arms-purchasing scandal 
surrounding his death. 
  Military authorities discovered the activity of the 
underground society in the probe into the death of Yin, which 
began last December. Some suspected members of the organization 
are believed to have been deeply involved in the scandal, but 
the five unnamed admirals have not been charged with any crime. 
  Vice Admiral Shih Tzuo-nhing, the convenor of the ad-hoc 
investigative group, told the Legislative Yuan Saturday [23 
April] morning that the military prosecutor had interviewed 41 
Navy sailors and officers who are suspected of being members of 
the "Ching Pang," or "Blue Gang," and 16 had admitted to the 
links. 
  The Blue Gang reportedly had its start in the early Ching 
Dynasty, which ran from 1644 to 1911, and while little is known 
about the group's activities, it did play a prominent role in 
the establishment of central government powers over the warlords 
in the 1920's and 30's. 
  Investigators said Yin was killed because he threatened to 
expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired 
military officers representing European companies paid 
active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts. 
  Shih stressed he remains confident that the case will be 
cracked even though there is a lack of substantial evidence.

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA)--Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang 
[KMT] approved a package of ground-breaking constitution reform 
proposals Sunday [24 April], paving the way for some key changes 
in Taiwan politics. 
  One of the major reforms was a measure which allows direct 
presidential and vice presidential elections in 1996. 
Previously, Taiwan voters elected National Assembly members, 
who in turn voted for the president. 
  The package was approved by an overwhelming majority during 
a 
special plenary session of the KMT's 214-member central 
committee. 
  The central committee passed all proposals drafted by the 
party's constitutional reform research task force except one 
that would have restricted parliamentary speech by subjecting 
legislators to libel laws. 
  The central committee also added another provision to the 
reform proposals: that Republic of China [ROC] passport holders 
living abroad would have the right to vote in future direct 
elections for the president and vice president. The provision, 
which was not in the party's original reform proposals, was 
proposed by former Premier Li Huan during the session and put to 
a vote. 
  Li's proposal garnered 108 votes, one vote more than the 
minimum required for it to be incorporated into the party's 
final amendment proposals. 
  The KMT reform package will be further discussed by the 
National Assembly when it begins a three-month constitutional 
reform session later this week. 
  The approved package also extends the terms of legislators 
from three to four years, allows the president to appoint and 
dismiss senior government officials without the approval of the 
premier, and creates the post of speaker and vice speaker in the 
National Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter from Beijing: "Jiang Zemin, Li </F>
Peng Make Written Instructions on Qiandao Lake Incident"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--In accordance with 
the written instructions of President Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and of Premier Li Peng 
on "never concealing the truth of the Qiandao Lake incident," 
"seriously and swiftly trying the case in public according to 
the law," and "allowing relatives of the victims in Taiwan and 
overseas reporters--including those from Hong Kong and 
Taiwan--to attend the public trial as visitors," an 
authoritative source here disclosed that the relevant central 
and Zhejiang departments are stepping up efforts to try and hear 
the case as quickly as possible. 
  RENMIN RIBAO and XINHUA already have sent reporting teams to 
Qiandao Lake to cover the story. In light of the requirement to 
"seek truth from facts," they will cover the news jointly and 
will present the truth of the matter to the public at home and 
abroad. 
  During an interview given to a reporter, an official in 
charge of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Straits [ARATS] said that ARATS had already send a message to 
the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], giving a detailed account 
of the Qiandao Lake incident. Throughout the handling of the 
Qiandao Lake incident, the official said, ARATS has played a 
role of offering information to the SEF and of passing on the 
SEF's messages to the relevant mainland departments. ARATS 
already has proposed the SEF that the two organizations will 
hold a routine meeting as quickly as possible to discuss the 
question of protecting the lives and property of compatriots on 
both sides of the strait. As ARATS is not authorized to handle 
the question of compensating the victims of the Qiandao Lake 
incident, he said, Taiwan's travel agency and the victims' 
relatives should consult with the mainland insurance company and 
travel agency on the matter.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA)--The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] today sent a letter 
to Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] to exchange views 
on the incidents that caused the loss of lives and property of 
mainland and Taiwan compatriots. 
  The letter noted: On 12 April, a person in charge of the 
ARATS said the ARATS agreed in principle that after the ARATS 
and SEF have made the necessary preparations, both sides can 
exchange views on the incidents--incidents that caused the loss 
of lives and property of mainland and Taiwan compatriots--that 
had occurred in the course of cross-strait contacts and 
exchanges over the past two years. The ARATS believes at 
present that both sides should decide on the topics and contents 
for their exchange of views through consultations before 
considering the level of personnel, the time, and the place [for 
a meeting]. If both sides cannot reach a consensus on the 
topics and contents, they will not be able to find common ground 
when they exchange views. That is not the type of negotiations 
sought by any of our compatriots on either side of the Taiwan 
Strait. 
  The ARATS believes that the contents for the exchange of 
views should include the following: 1) Both sides should 
exchange views on the issue of cross-strait tourism contacts, 
including the safety of mainland and Taiwan compatriots when 
they are traveling. It was as early as the end of August 1993 
when the ARATS and the SEF held their first working negotiations 
on the implementation of the Wang-Gu meeting that the ARATS 
proposed in the "timetable for negotiations on the 
implementation of the relevant agreements reached during the 
Wang-Gu meeting" that both the ARATS and the SEF hold special 
negotiations on the issue of "improving cross-strait tourism 
contacts." However, to date, the ARATS still has not received a 
reply from the SEF. 2) The ARATS has always called for carrying 
out all the negotiations on routine, economic, scientific, and 
technological topics stipulated by the "common agreements 
reached during the Wang-Gu meeting," and it has more than once 
suggested to the SEF that the negotiation on "the rights and 
interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland 
and relevant issues" be started as soon as possible. The ARATS 
believes that the personal safety of Taiwan businessmen who have 
invested on the mainland as well as the safety of their property 
is protected by the laws. If the SEF thinks it necessary, both 
sides may exchange views [on the topic] when they negotiate "the 
rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the 
mainland and relevant issues." 3) The ARATS has repeatedly 
demanded that the ARATS and the SEF hold consultations on the 
issue of the Taiwan military's killing and wounding in recent 
years mainland fishermen operating in coastal areas and the 
resulting serious losses of lives and property. After the ARATS 
was established, it has continued pointing out to the SEF such 
inhuman acts which hurt the feelings of our compatriots on both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait and damage the cross-strait 
harmonious atmosphere, in the hope that Taiwan's relevant 
departments will attach importance to the issue, compensate 
[victims for their] losses, find out who is responsible, and 
sternly punish the killers. Meanwhile, it has called for 
putting an end once and for all to such violence through 
ARATS-SEF consultations. However, to date, the ARATS still has 
not received a reply from the SEF. 
  The letter clearly and definitely pointed out that the 
delays 
and failure to begin negotiations on the aforementioned rights 
and interests of mainland and Taiwan compatriots in their 
contacts and exchanges, including the issue of their personal 
safety, are not the responsibility of our side. 
  The letter noted: The present ARATS-SEF contacts and the 
methods of their cooperation should be conducted strictly in 
accordance with the "ARATS-SEF agreement on the system for their 
contact and talks" signed last year. After the "Qiandao Lake 
incident" took place, the ARATS briefed the SEF on the 
situation, gave answers to several questions raised by the 
latter, and responded to its several requests in accordance with 
the agreement. However, the SEF repeatedly made requests that 
exceeded the scope of the ARATS-SEF agreement mentioned above. 
Although the ARATS pointed this out, the SEF still insisted on 
its requests. This is a practice that does not respect the 
ARATS-SEF agreement. It is our sincerest hope that ARATS-SEF 
contacts and cooperation can be carried out in accordance with 
the existing agreement. 
  The letter pointed out: As far as the "Qiandao Lake 
incident" is concerned, the pressing matter of the moment is to 
investigate and deal with the case according to the law. 
Meanwhile, to show further goodwill, the ARATS took the 
initiative in inviting the SEF and relevant experts to visit 
Zhejiang and to make arrangements for the experts to give a 
briefing on the specific state of the case and to answer 
questions. If the SEF was willing to understand the details of 
the case and truly showed understanding and sympathy for the 
feelings of the victims' families, why did it set preconditions? 
This is hard for people to understand. The ARATS reiterates its 
invitation mentioned above and hopes that the SEF soon will 
propose its name list and itinerary. It has been learned from 
the relevant department that three suspects were arrested and 
that they will soon stand trial in accordance with judicial 
procedures.

<F P=106> [By Shiny Li] </F>
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten has issued his sternest 
warning yet to the United States not to tamper with China's 
trading privileges as a lever to bolster human rights. 
Repeating the ramifications for Hong Kong of a Sino-U.S. trade 
war, Mr Patten said the withdrawal of China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) status could undermine the effective 
implementation of the Joint Declaration. The Sino-British Joint 
Declaration sets out the conditions under which Hong Kong will 
revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr Patten warned that if 
China's U.S. trading privileges were withdrawn, the crippling 
effects for Hong Kong would undermine the "one country, two 
systems" concept under which the territory would operate after 
the transfer of sovereignty. 
  It was the first time that Mr Patten had linked economics to 
politics, having strenuously urged China not to do so during the 
current Sino-British stalemate. "It's (the implementation of 
the Joint Declaration) which will be the principal task for 
Britain and China in Hong Kong until ]997 and afterwards," Mr 
Patten said. "(The withdrawal of China's MFN status) would be a 
body blow to confidence in Hong Kong at a crucial time. It 
would put at risk all that we are trying to do to secure Hong 
Kong's future," Mr Patten told the American Chamber of Commerce, 
adding that the territory's economic growth would be cut by more 
than half and unemployment trebled. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has stated that the renewal of 
China's preferential trade status hinged on whether it could 
demonstrate a marked improvement in its human rights record. 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned yesterday 
that China still had time to make sufficient progress on human 
rights by early June to justify maintaining its MFN status. 
  The Governor yesterday dispatched his deputy, Chief 
Secretary 
Anson Chan, to the U.S. to lobby the Clinton administration to 
renew China's trading privileges. Mr Patten himself spearheaded 
the campaign in Washington last year. His strongly-worded 
warning yesterday, on the eve of Mrs Chan's visit, appeared to 
mark the start of Hong Kong's annual lobbying campaign to 
preserve China's trading privileges. A high-powered Hong Kong 
Chinese business delegation has been in Washington this week to 
press for MFN renewal, and the American Chamber of Commerce -- 
the biggest outside the United States -- plans to do likewise in 
the coming weeks. 
  Mr Patten insisted that Hong Kong people were concerned 
about 
human rights and the conduct of China in jailing MING PAO 
reporter Xi Yang for allegedly stealing state secrets. But 
curtailing trading privileges was not the answer, he said. 
"It's possible to have a serious dialogue, for example, as 
Australia is doing with China, without mixing up trade and 
politics," Mr Patten said. 
  U.S. investment in Hong Kong was worth more than $1.2 
billion, Mr Patten said. Arguing that free trade leads to 
greater human rights -- and noting that Libya and Iran had MFN 
status -- he said that it would be China's masses who would be 
paying the price of a Sino-U.S. trade war. "The people who are 
performing the Chinese economic miracle are above all the 
ordinary people, the entrepreneurs, the small businesses, the 
investors," Mr Patten said.

  [Text] A "radical democratic party" is needed in Hong Kong 
as 1997 approaches because the dominant liberal bloc is likely 
to soften its stance towards China, says prominent dissident Lau 
Shan-ching. Mr Lau envisaged that the radical democratic party, 
which would confront the future sovereign power, would become an 
anti- government force after the changeover. The dissident, who 
was jailed for 10 years in China for "counter-revolutionary 
activities", said the radical faction believed China was a 
totalitarian state. Mr Lau did not say who might join the party, 
but that he would devote himself to setting it up. 
  He said the newly-announced Democratic Party would be 
nothing 
but a bloc put together for election purposes and its weakness 
would gradually be exposed as 1997 approached. The party would 
not be able to endure political pressure from Beijing and would 
backtrack on its opposition to China. Mr Lau cited as evidence 
the case of Law Cheung-kwok, former vice-chairman of the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. He had been 
widely attacked by the liberals for supporting the dismantling 
of the three-tier election structure in 1997 in the recent 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference after being 
appointed as a local delegate. "They are very naive if they 
think that their relationship with China can be mended because 
of the new composition of the party or the middleman role played 
by (Meeting Point chairman Anthony) Cheung Bing-leung." 
  The emergence of a radical party was a natural development 
in 
the worsening political climate, and Mr Lau believed people 
would accept this line. Mr Lau said United Democrats and 
Meeting Point had never played a leadership role in Hong Kong's 
democratic movement. "They are only eyeing their own political 
interests. They are not genuine democrats," he said. "If they 
are so, why don't they seek full democracy by 1995?"

  [Text] Chief Secretary Anson Chan left for the United 
States last night on a week-long visit to lobby for the renewal 
of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status. Mrs Chan, on her 
first official visit to the U.S. since becoming Chief Secretary, 
said again that if trade sanctions were slapped on China, Hong 
Kong would be the loser. "We have done some assessment of the 
harm to our economy that this might do and our assessments 
indicate that if MFN was withdrawn then our economic growth will 
be halved and our unemployment rate will be trebled," she said. 
  The United States has already indicated that it could impose 
limited trade sanctions on China unless its record on human 
rights improves by June. During her visit, Mrs Chan is 
scheduled to meet senior U.S. officials including Acting 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen. She is also seeking a meeting with U.S. Vice-President 
Al Gore. 
  Mrs Chan dismissed claims that by fighting for China's 
renewed MFN status, Hong Kong was disregarding human rights. 
"There are probably no people anywhere on this earth who are 
more concerned with human rights than people in Hong Kong, 
particularly with the reversion of sovereignty of power to China 
in about three years' time," she said. Mrs Chan repeated the 
Hong Kong government's view that improving China's economy would 
help improve the human rights cause. "We see for ourselves, for 
example in Guangdong, that because they enjoy economic growth 
they now have more choices. They are far freer, I would say, 
than people elsewhere in the interior of China. Obviously 
that's the way to go." Mrs Chan said an alternative way to 
achieve an improvement in China's human rights record was to 
keep discussing and pushing the human rights question while 
maintaining trade relations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hong Kong Deputies to NPC, Members of </F>
CPPCC National Committee, Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, and 
Members of Preparatory Working Committee Invited To Visit PLA 
Training Camp in Guangdong"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government will arrange the visit of 
nearly 200 Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress 
[NPC], members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, Hong Kong affairs 
advisers, and members of the Preparatory Working Committee to 
Guangzhou in order to inspect the training and study in People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] units. Those being invited to visit the 
barracks said that this would enable Hong Kong people to 
increase their understanding of the PLA. 
  Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee last year 
expressed their hope to inspecting the training of the PLA 
troops. Yesterday, the Hong Kong NPC deputies, CPPCC National 
Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and Preparatory 
Working Committee members were notified by the XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch that a visit would be arranged to the PLA troops' 
military training in Guangzhou on 30 April. According to the 
arrangement, the visiting delegation will travel to Guangzhou by 
train on the morning of 30 April. They will inspect the 
training of the PLA troops that afternoon and will see dancing 
and singing performances put on by the PLA units. Next day, 
they will see the military performances and will then return to 
Hong Kong in the afternoon. The delegation will be received by 
the Guangzhou Military Region. This is aimed at enabling the 
visitors to better understand the training, living, and study 
conditions of the PLA troops. 
  Some people being invited on this visit said that it would 
be 
a good opportunity to come into direct contact with the PLA 
personnel and this will be a good beginning for Hong Kong people 
to have a better understanding of the PLA so that they can 
dispel their misgivings. 
  Cheng Yiu-tong, a deputy to the NPC, said that Hong Kong 
people did not know much about the PLA troops. This time, the 
visit arranged by the Chinese Government will increase the 
transparency of things and the authorities are also showing an 
open-minded attitude. This will help Hong Kong people to better 
understand about the lives of the troops, remove their 
misgivings about the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after 
1997, and gradually establish their trust in the troops. 
  Liu Yiu-chu, another deputy to the NPC, said that between 
now 
and 1997, it is necessary to cause Hong Kong people and the PLA 
personnel to have closer contacts and exchange opinions so that 
the military personnel will better understand the mentality and 
values of Hong Kong people as well as the legal system and 
procedures in Hong Kong. This will ensure that the troops will 
properly abide by the local laws after they are sent to Hong 
Kong. 
  Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee believe 
that Xu Huizi, deputy general chief of staff of the PLA, may 
also participate in this activity. Xu once indicated that, 
after 1997, the troops stationed in Hong Kong will be dispatched 
from the Guangzhou Military Region. At present, the PLA troops 
are receiving training in Guangzhou. They also study English, 
Hong Kong laws, and the lifestyle in Hong Kong.

  [Text] China has put Taiwan's air links with the rest of 
the world in question by trying to limit transit routes through 
Hong Kong. This emerged during Sino-British talks on Hong 
Kong's aviation agreements. 
  Taiwan's post-1997 aviation links with Hong Kong have been 
at 
stake in the course of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
(JLG) talks on renewing Hong Kong's aviation agreements with 
individual countries. Talks on air service agreements (ASAs) 
have made little progress at the JLG because of Britain's 
refusal to disclose details of agreements with foreign airlines 
which fly from Hong Kong to Taiwan. 
  Before 1984, all 24 ASAs in Hong Kong were an extension of 
Britain's agreements with other countries. The main purpose of 
the JLG negotiations is to take Hong Kong's aviation routes out 
of the original UK agreements, officially known as a "separation 
programme." This programme does not cover air services of Hong 
Kong airlines running flights to Taiwan, which is a separate 
issue. Direct flights from Hong Kong to Taiwan are handled by 
Cathay Pacific and China Airlines under commercial arrangements. 
The Hong Kong Government promised the Taiwan Government that 
the continuation of these services would be discussed by the JLG 
before the end of this year. At the moment, most foreign 
airlines' ASAs with Hong Kong contain the right to run flights 
between Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  This is a point of contention with China. 
  It is reliably understood that China has refused to approve 
seven ASAs unless the following conditions are met: 
  -- The Government must disclose details of agreements which 
allow foreign airlines to fly between Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  -- China wants to know what privileges have been demanded 
and gained by Britain from the governments where the airlines 
originate in exchange for the right to fly between Hong Kong and 
Taiwan. 
  -- Countries currently enjoying the right of transit to 
Taiwan will have to renegotiate directly with the Chinese 
Government to continue this practice after 1997. 
  All Beijing's demands have been rejected by Britain on the 
grounds that the Joint Declaration guarantees that only Hong 
Kong's Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, not 
China, has the right to conclude ASAs with third countries, 
excluding aviation routes through mainland China. 
  The Hong Kong government has told China that Hong Kong will 
suffer economically if foreign airlines lose their right to fly 
between Taiwan and Hong Kong. These foreign airlines, the 
government fears, will then demand a unilateral increase in 
flights to Hong Kong to compensate for the loss of flights to 
Taiwan. The seven ASAs China is now delaying cover airlines in 
Germany, Italy, Singapore, Korea, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia. 
  It is understood that China overlooked the Taiwan factor 
until 1990 when Taiwan's China Airlines started using Amsterdam 
as its aviation base in Europe. Government representatives are 
now in Europe for more talks about separating Hong Kong's ASAs 
from those of Britain's. 
  Out of 24 ASAs, those signed with Kuwait, Lebanon, Portugal, 
and Kenya have not been in operation for a long time. The 
government has decided to put them aside temporarily.

<F P=106> [Report by Ray Heath] </F>
  [Text] Profits of Hong Kong companies are under threat 
with an expected squeeze in the second half of this year, thanks 
partly to rising interest rates, and the effect of soaring 
property prices. The immediate outlook for the business 
environment also is poor, according to the latest report on the 
territory issued by the Politieal and Economic Risk Consultaney 
(PERC), although the consultancy added that it was not yet time 
to start sounding alarm bells. 
  The PERC's assessment of increased risk factor in the 
territory is the result of the surge in property prices and 
rents, which have both companies and households complaining. 
  The territory also faces the consequences of the precarious 
state of China's economy and the negative implications this has 
for Hong Kong trade and investment with the mainland, says the 
consultancy. 
  Adding to the overall uncertainty which is raising the risk 
factor of Hong Kong are concerns over strategies on the 
mainland. The PERC says a possible problem is the pressure for a 
slowing of the economy in Guangdong and a crackdown on its 
free-wheeling ways. "Implementation of the currency, tax, and 
banking reform measures announced late last year is going very 
badly from Beijing's perspective, due to stiff provincial 
resistance with Guangdong leading the way," the PERC say. It 
said Beijing could look like an emperor with no clothes if the 
efforts to pull power back to the political centre are 
frustrated by the provinces. 
  This means two distinct risks for the territory this year. 
One is a "slipping of economic gears" which could cause market 
players to adopt a much less aggressive posture on investment. 
The second is problems resulting from a crackdown on Guangdong 
by Beijing authorities. 
  "Either way the territory's trade and investment in the 
mainland would be seriously disrupted, as would the activities 
of the mainland companies in Hong Kong," the PERC says. "This 
would detract from Hong Kong's international reputation, at 
least in the short term." 
  Hong Kong's domestic economic risks have risen sharply this 
year with soaring property prices pushing costs levels up 
sharply. "Profit margins are starting to be eroded as much of 
the cream from the economic boom of the past two years is being 
siphoned off into the pockets of the landlords," concludes the 
PERC. It says that costs are threatening the territory's 
viability as a base for some businesses. 
  Investor confidence is also being hit by the rise in 
interest 
rates, which could dampen the prospects for growth in banking, 
fund management and broking, which have been among the most 
buoyant industries in Hong Kong, the consultancy says. 
  It expects interest rates in Hong Kong to rise by a further 
half to one percentage point this year, depending on United 
States policies. The rise by itself will not be enough to lead 
to a consolidation in property or to end the territory's 
economic boom, it says, but taken with other bad news emerging, 
its effects could be felt. "The cumulative effect could lead to 
a much more profound change in Hong Kong's business mood than 
the relatively modest interest rate rise would suggest," the 
report says. 
  Although the PERC forecasts an unchanged gross domestic 
growth rate of 5.5 percent this year and next, it argues that 
the official statistics do not reflect the real position of 
trade as much of the real economy is in China and not captured 
by official statistics. "Just as the Government's figures 
understated the extent to which Hong Kong has been benefitting 
from China's boom, the same numbers will also down-play the 
negative impact of a hard landing for China's economy -- an 
event that is looking increasingly possible," the report warns.

problem in Hong Kong. 
  He made the above remark when commenting on the Sino-British 
Committee's land approval plan for this year at the inauguration 
of of a new term of officials of the (Shunde) Association. 
  He said: The drastic increase in Hong Kong's housing prices 
is not the problem of land supply alone. China has basically 
consented to this year's land approval plan, which includes a 
marked increase in the portion of land for commercial and 
residential use. 
  He said: The increased land supply is only the first step. 
The Hong Kong Government should work out specific overall 
arrangements for properly using land approved for use in the 
future. 
  He added: In fact, many lots to be used for building 
residential and public housing do not require examination and 
approval by the Sino-British Land Committee. It is the 
responsibility of the British Hong Kong Government to solve the 
housing problem in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Report by David Healy in London] </F>
  [Text] Two senior opposition Labour Members of Parliament 
have launched outspoken attacks on Governor Chris Patten, in the 
most serious sign yet that the all-party consensus in support of 
his policies is starting to crumble. In an extraordinary 
anti-Patten outburst in the House of Commons, Labour MP Andrew 
Faulds challenged House of Commons leader Tony Newton to arrange 
a debate on Hong Kong. Mr Faulds said it was needed to "comment 
on the misguided and damaging conduct of the Governor of Hong 
Kong, and to examine the latest report on China from the Foreign 
Affairs Committee which is full of lunacies and produced by a 
committee of ignoramuses". But Mr Newton rejected the request. 
  Then, during a recent visit to Beijing as part of a British 
trade delegation, Manchester MP Ken Eastham told Chinese 
officials: "Mr Patten, who was rejected by voters in Bath and 
imposed on Hong Kong by the (British) Government, is a fine one 
to talk about democracy. "Why was there no talk about democracy 
during the past decade when Britain was in charge?" The trip 
was organised by Chinese Consul- General in Manchester Xiao 
Houde as part of a concerted campaign to undermine support for 
Mr Patten among members of the Labour Party. 
  Both parliamentarians have been privately disowned by their 
party leaders but other Labour MPs say they only reflected what 
many of their colleagues privately believe. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Patten is finally cutting his links with the 
city of Bath, which he represented for 13 years until losing his 
seat in the 1992 general election. He has put his four-bedroom 
home up for sale with an estate agent for 135,000 (HK$1.53 
million).

<F P=106> ["Inside Politics" column, by Danny Gittings: "Britain </F>
Finally Returning China's Shots on Accord"] 
  [Text] After years of China repeatedly accusing Britain of 
breaking the Joint Declaration, London is beginning to respond 
with charges of its own. Governor Chris Patten last week came 
closer than ever to hinting that China was potentially in breach 
of the Sino-British accord, although he stopped short of saying 
so directly. But in contrast to Mr Patten, the recent report 
from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee pulls no 
punches. "We conclude that Articles 18 and 158 of the Basic Law 
are grave potential threats to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR 
[special administrative region] after 1997 and to the 
implementation of the Joint Declaration," it says. 
  Both clauses drew fire during the drafting of the Basic Law. 
Article 18 effectively gives Beijing, through the rubber-stamp 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the power 
to do what it wants in Hong Kong after 1997 by declaring a 
"state of emergency". Article 158 undermines the Joint 
Declaration's promise that the proposed Court of Final Appeal 
will have the power "of final adjudication", by giving the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress the right 
to interpret the Basic Law, and even issue rulings that the 
[sentence incomplete as published] 
  Despite quiet lobbying during the drafting process, Britain 
failed to have both provisions scrapped, and subsequently tried 
to paper over the shortcomings of the Basic Law. "The 
Government of the United Kingdom had satisfied itself that the 
Basic Law was, on the whole, consistent with the basic 
principles enshrined in the Joint Declaration," a British 
spokesman told a United Nations Human Rights Commission hearing 
in 1991. The most the Foreign Office would admit was that there 
were a few articles in the Basic Law it "would have preferred to 
see drafted differently". 
  But that was before Mr Patten's arrival, when a U-turn in 
British policy towards political reform in the territory 
prompted a torrent of accusations from Beijing that London was 
breaching the Joint Declaration. Now there are signs Britain is 
prepared to respond in kind. Whitehall officials claimed in 
evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee that any significant 
foot-dragging by Beijing in the Joint Liaison Group amounted to 
a failure to "fulfil the terms of the (Joint) Declaration". 
Foreign Office Deputy Legal Adviser Kevin Chamberlain went one 
step further suggesting China's record of abiding by 
international agreements was "very mixed" -- although he later 
retracted the remark in a clear attempt to avoid angering 
Beijing. 
  Mr Patten also chose his words with care, when answering 
questions on the issue in the Legislative Council last week. 
But he did concede what no governor had made so plain before: 
that Articles 18 and 158 were potentially in breach of the 
Sino-British accord. "If Articles 18 or 158 of the Basic Law 
were used to undermine the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, that would be in contravention of the 
Joint Declaration," he said. Resorting to diplomatic 
doublespeak, Mr Patten then insisted there was no danger of 
that, adding somewhat tenuously that since Beijing had promised 
to stick to the terms of the Sino-British accord, the offending 
articles would never be used in the wrong way. But, even 
accepting such a circular argument, the Governor's remarks were 
the first clear statement that China had put in place powers 
which could be used to break the Joint Declaration. 
  Now that Britain has overcome this psychological hurdle, 
perhaps it is time to study China's record on other Hong 
Kong-related accords. The Memorandum of Understanding over the 
new airport is a case in point. In 1992, then Secretary for 
Economic Services Anson Chan Fang On-sang warned Beijing that it 
had only 30 days to respond to Britain's airport funding 
proposals under the terms of that accord. Beijing told her to 
shut up, claiming, implausibly, that the month-long consultation 
timetable, unequivocally laid down in the memorandum, applied to 
specific airport contracts only, rather than the overall funding 
package. Two years on, despite the lack of agreement on the 
airport, no one has dared repeat that charge. But, in the light 
of Britain's latest shift of policy, now may be the right time. 
Mrs Chan, now Chief Secretary, will be in Washington this week. 
It will be interesting to hear her response to any questions on 
China's record of abiding by international agreements about Hong 
Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The total revenue 
from land sales this year was estimated to be 18.385 billion 
H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars (2.357 billion U.S. dollars), a 
government official announced today. 
  This compared to the actual revenue from last year's land 
sales of 17.964 billion H.K. dollars (2.303 billion U.S. 
dollars), principal government land agent Jim Hughes said in a 
news release. 
  He said that the government's land sales program for 1994/95 
would consist of 28.21 hectares of land involving 40 sites which 
are expected to produce between 8,000 and 10,000 flats. 
  The official announcement was made following the agreement 
made by the Sino-British Land Commission earlier this week that 
the land disposal program for the 1994/95 financial year should 
amount to 117.27 hectares.

  [Text] The academic, writer and political commentator Tsim 
Tak-lung says disenchantment with Hong Kong's future under 
Chinese rule is the main reason behind his departure for North 
America. Although Mr Tsim, 47, had pledged to leave the 
territory as soon as the Daya Bay nuclear plant was completed, 
he said political uncertainties now topped his list of fears. 
  The controversial director of the Chinese University Press 
said he had no confidence in China's promise to run Hong Kong on 
a onecountry-two-systems basis. These fears were compounded by 
the location of a Chinese-operated nuclear reactor on his 
doorstep. Mr Tsim declared when the plant was planned that he 
would not stomach its presence and that he would quit Hong Kong 
when the station became fully operational. 
  He revealed he will be writing and doing consultancy work in 
New York -- a city he has always wanted to live in. Having 
lived in Britain for some time he was now "excited" about 
relocating to North America. 
  Born in China, Mr Tsim has studied in both Hong Kong and 
Britain, gaining a postgraduate diploma in advanced government 
studies from Manchester University. He first joined the staff 
of the Chinese University in 1977 for a two-year stint before 
rejoining as the press director in 1983. He is a past winner of 
the award for Hong Kong's most outstanding young person.

  [Text] Macao, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A symposium on the 
transformation of Macao's industries was held here today. 
  Sponsored by the Macao Institute of Engineers, the symposium 
invited experts and entrepreneurs from China's mainland, 
Portugal, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to explore ways for 
Macao's industrial transformation from the aspects of industrial 
and enterprise management. 
  The symposium was also aimed at enhancing scientific and 
technological exchanges and cooperation between Macao and other 
places in the world, according to the symposium sponsor. 
  Considering the fact that Macao will revert to the Chinese 
sovereignty in 1999, an official from the Macao Institute of 
Engineers said, it is necessary to seek ways for industrial 
transformation and development of multi-facet industries to 
maintain Macao's prosperity and stability. 
  He also said it is important to develop technology-incentive 
industries in Macao, by making best use of its relations with 
Portugal and other European countries and neighboring Asian 
countries, to expand Macao's export market and raise its 
international competitiveness.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing Municipal 
Government has helped open a department to help individual 
businessmen with the formalities of arranging business trips 
abroad. 
  The number of people travelling overseas not on behalf of 
the 
country has in recent years grown at the rate of about 30 
percent per year. Last year alone saw more than 40,000 such 
applicants. 
  Formerly, employees of private enterprises and individual 
businessmen needing to go abroad for business activities had to 
apply for exit permits under the guise of visiting relatives and 
friends, or travelling for pleasure, for lack of clear 
government stipulations. 
  So the exit permits help office has been set up to better 
meet the growing need of applicants and to make it more 
convenient for individual or private businessmen, and thus to 
promote prosperity. 
  The new department will provide consultations, necessary 
training and handle other formalities for owners of private 
businesses, individual laborers, managers of township 
enterprises and employees of non-public enterprises to make 
overseas business tours. 
  The new department operates under the leadership of the 
Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce. 
  Beijing now has 4,110 privately-owned firms and 230,000 
individual businessmen.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Linxiang (1728 2651 4382) and </F>
correspondent Guang Hua (0342 5478) and Zhong He (6988 7729): 
"Try by All Possible Means To Promote Economic Development and 
Spare No Efforts To Improve People's Living"] 
  [Excerpts] Under the new situation in which the whole 
region is conscientiously implementing the 20-character policy 
of the central authorities and the eighth enlarged plenary 
session of fifth regional party committee, Wang Qun, secretary 
of the regional party committee, travelled a long way to Baotou 
city, Bayannur League, and Ih Ju League to conduct investigation 
and study and to jointly discuss ways to promote the region's 
reform, development, and stability along with the masses of 
local cadres at all levels. [passage omitted] 
  While touching on how to explore ways to promote Inner 
Mongolia region's economic development and to resolve financial 
difficulties, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: The broad masses of 
cadres have created many good ways and methods in the course of 
practice, playing an exemplary role in promoting great 
development in all localities across the region. He stressed: 
In developing agriculture and animal husbandry, it is necessary 
to resolutely manage things in line with the market economic 
law, serve the market, readjust the structure in line with local 
conditions, and actively develop good quality grain, oil-bearing 
crops, sugar, fruits, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, and 
other brand-name, special, and quality products. After 
analyzing the present situation and potential for developing 
Inner Mongolia's agricultural and animal husbandry, Comrade Wang 
Qun said: Agriculture and animal husbandry are our region's 
basic industries and the best and most important industries 
among all. In agriculture and animal husbandry, we should seek 
extraordinary development and advance by leaps and bounds. This 
conforms to the policy stressed repeatedly by the party Central 
Committee on stabilizing and promoting agriculture and is the 
fundamental way for making the people rich and the banners and 
counties prosperous, as well as the reliable guarantee for 
resolving financial difficulties. Our region is rich in land 
resources with great potential for development. We still have 
30 million mu of cultivated land awaiting development. The 
existing cultivated lands and the unreclaimed lands all have 
great potentials for increasing production. Our region has 1.35 
billion mu of grassland, but each mu of grassland can only 
produce one jin of meat, showing that the potential for 
development is very great. Our region has a very good 
foundation for agricultural and animal husbandry development and 
high quality scientific and technical workers and managerial 
personnel. With these land and water resources, as well as the 
technology and labor forces, it is absolutely possible for us to 
realize an extraordinary development in agriculture and animal 
husbandry. [passage omitted] 
  In studying ways to resolve the current financial 
difficulties along with grass-roots cadres, Comrade Wang Qun 
believed that the financial issue is actually an economic 
development issue. It is necessary to resolve it by using the 
new ideas of reform and development and by broadening the 
sources of income and reducing expenditures. [passage omitted] 
  On the issue of strengthening tax revenue collection and 
management, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: At present, the masses 
of cadres at all levels, the party and government organs at all 
levels, and the tax departments should strengthen propaganda on 
the new tax system, make the broad masses of cadres clearly 
understand the new tax system of our country and the relevant 
stipulations of the autonomous region, and strengthen the sense 
of responsibility and enthusiasm in tax revenue collection and 
management. Government leaders at all levels should personally 
attend to tax revenue and successfully carry out tax collection 
and management. It is necessary to increase the number of 
temporary tax collectors in an effort to strengthen the tax 
collection force and to guarantee that all sorts of taxes are 
collected in full and in a timely manner. 
  Comrade Wang Qun also put forward specific demands on 
maintaining stability, doing a good job in pricing, 
nationalities, and religious work, and strengthening party 
building and spiritual civilization. He expressed hope that 
party committees and governments at all levels and all party 
leading cadres at all levels would always keep a sober mind, 
carry out these aspects of work in a down-to-earth manner, and 
further consolidate and develop a political situation of 
stability and unity in Inner Mongolia.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123)] </F>
  [Text] Tianjin, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- During an inspection of 
Tianjin's experimentation with comprehensive coordinated reform 
in the city, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and state councillor and concurrently minister 
in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, 
pointed out: Key economic cities should proceed from the local 
conditions, seize the opportunity, and make the most of their 
strengths to deepen reform, open up wider, and promote 
development. 
  He said: This year will be a crucial year for China's 
economic structural reform. State-launched reforms of the 
financial, banking, taxation, foreign exchange, and foreign 
trade systems have proceeded smoothly. As long as we firmly 
grasp the overall interests of "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability," and as long as we translate the 
guideline of "combining comprehensive coordinated reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas" into concrete actions, we will 
surely be able to smoothly achieve the various reform targets 
this year. In the course of implementation, all localities 
should pay attention to the following four areas: 
  1) It is necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of 
various reform programs introduced by the central authorities by 
subordinating local to national interests and working hard to 
gradually establish a socialist market economic system; 2) It is 
necessary to go all-out to change the operating mechanisms of 
enterprises to gradually establish a modern enterprise system; 
3) It is necessary, in line with the spirit of the "decision" 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, to earnestly implement the reform of macroeconomic 
regulation and control formulated by the central authorities 
under unified plans, and to study and formulate other reforms in 
light of the realities of each locality to facilitate sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development; 4) It is necessary to 
properly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability. 
  On 31 March and 1 April, Li Tieying and Vice Minister He 
Guanghui of the State Economic Restructuring Commission 
inspected the Tianjin Stock Exchange, the Lisheng Pharmaceutical 
Plant, and the Lida Group International Emporium in the company 
of Tianjin party Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor Zhang Lichang, 
and they heard briefings by the municipal party committee and 
the municipal government on Tianjin's experimentation with 
comprehensive coordinated reform. 
  After hearing the briefings, Li Tieying said: Following the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the 
Tianjin municipal party committee and government took the 
initiative to explore ways to establish a socialist market 
economic system, and they put forward a number of pilot projects 
for comprehensive coordinated reform. They have attached great 
importance to the pilot projects, thus fostering sound ideas and 
adopting effective measures in formulating and implementing 
pilot and special projects. After seriously studying Tianjin's 
pilot projects, the State Economic Restructuring Commission and 
other relevant State Council departments on 15 January 1994 
approved Tianjin as the city designated by the state for 
experimenting with the comprehensive coordinated reform of the 
economic structure. As one of China's three municipalities 
directly under the central government, Tianjin is the economic 
center of the Bohai Rim economic zone, as well as a major 
economic, trade, and port city in northern China. The 
municipality's reform and development have a vital bearing on 
the country as a whole. 
  Discussing areas to which Tianjing as a key economic city 
must pay close attention in the next-phase reform, Li Tieying 
said: First, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of 
readjusting the structure of industries and to energetically 
develop tertiary industry, which is very important for bringing 
into play the key economic city's functions. An underdeveloped 
tertiary industry will inevitably make the municipality 
dependent on industrial enterprises for financial revenues and 
aggravate the predicament of enterprises, while a developed 
tertiary industry can provide the municipality with more 
financial revenues and give old enterprises a chance to 
recuperate and build up their strength. Second, it is necessary 
to cultivate new economic growth points. In seeking 
development, village and township enterprises should implement a 
shareholding cooperative system, and a small number of qualified 
enterprises may try out stock systems. This will be a general 
trend of economic development. The expansion of nonstate 
economic sectors is an objective demand of the socialist market 
economy. Therefore, we should encourage the healthy development 
of individual, privately owned, and foreign-funded economic 
sectors. Third, it is necessary to attach importance to 
maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets, and 
to readjusting the structure of state-owned assets. The 
transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises is 
essential for invigorating the state sector of the economy. 
However, the transaction must be conducted according to 
standards and must avoid the losses of state-owned assets during 
the entire process from the assessment of assets to the transfer 
of property rights. The transfer of state-owned enterprises' 
property rights should be approved by the investment 
organization authorized by the state, while the transfer of 
property rights of enterprises owned by the central government 
should be approved by the investment organization designated by 
the central government. A government system of assessing assets 
and approving the transfer of property rights in accordance with 
the principle of unified state ownership and supervision by 
governments at different levels should be established to avoid 
confusion.

  [Excerpts] The municipal party committee and government 
held a rural work conference on the morning of 12 April to relay 
the guidelines of the central rural work conference and to 
arrange Tianjin's agriculture and rural work. They called for 
efforts to thoroughly study and implement the guidelines of the 
central rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's 
reality in agriculture and rural work, further unify thinking, 
enhance understanding, conscientiously strengthen party 
leadership over agriculture and rural work, and strive to 
fulfill the basic tasks of agriculture and rural work. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and 
Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee 
and mayor of Tianjin, gave important speeches. Li Jianguo, 
deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, attended. Li 
Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and 
executive vice mayor of Tianjin, presided over the conference. 
Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's congress standing 
committee; and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the municipal committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; 
attended. 
  Also attending were municipal leading comrades Yang Zhihua, 
Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng 
Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Pan Yiqing, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang 
Gonghui, Li Changxing, and Huang Yanzhi. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin has attached 
importance to and scored notable achievements in agriculture and 
rural work for many years. Central leading comrades have 
affirmed on many occasions its bumper grain harvests for 10 
years in a row and, in particular, its good job in carrying out 
the "vegetable basket" project. The good development trend in 
rural economy, the increase in peasants' income every year, and 
the stable rural situation have constituted an important 
contribution to Tianjin's economic development. However, we 
should also note that the economic development rate, the level 
and economic efficiency of agricultural productive forces, and 
the increase in peasants' income are not high enough. By 
conscientiously studying and implementing the guidelines of the 
central rural work conference, we should enhance our 
understanding of the importance to strengthen agriculture and 
rural work in the new situation. The current priorities are as 
follows: First, we should enhance the understanding of the 
position of agriculture as the foundation. Although Tianjin is a 
large industrial and commercial city developing the 
suburban-type rural economy, it should firmly embrace the idea 
of taking agriculture as the foundation. The rural economy is 
an important growing point of the economy of the entire 
municipality and an important force to realize sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development. The healthy development of 
agriculture and rural economy is the foundation not only for the 
national economy but also for reform, development, and 
stability. Second, we should enhance the understanding of the 
importance of successful production of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops. In the new situation in establishing the 
socialist market economy system, we should understand the 
extremely important production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops from a strategic and political perspective and, proceeding 
from reality, strive to improve the self-sufficiency rate of 
grain and gain the initiative in the overall planning for the 
economic work of the entire municipality. Third, we should 
further enhance the understanding of the importance of a 
successful "vegetable basket" project. In Tianjin's suburban- 
type agriculture, the key link is the production and supplies 
for the "vegetable basket." We should pay close attention to it 
under all circumstances and make it still better. Fourth, we 
should further enhance the understanding of the importance to 
restructure agriculture on the premise that the production of 
grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is stabilized. The 
production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is the 
prerequisite for restructuring agriculture and restructuring 
rural production. We should pay particular attention to 
comprehensive agricultural development and transformation of 
low- and medium-yielding farmland, through which to improve the 
basic conditions for agricultural production, so that there will 
be more room for agricultural production. Fifth, we should 
further enhance the understanding of the importance to rely on 
agricultural development to increase peasants' income. By 
improving the production level of farming and livestock breeding 
and operating on as large a scale as possible, we should raise 
the output rate of land and fund input and continuously increase 
peasants' income. [passage omitted] 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: The major policies, targets, tasks, 
and policy measures for Tianjin's agriculture and rural work 
have been clarified. The key to the next step of work is to 
further strengthen party leadership over agriculture and rural 
work, pay close attention to implementation, and, through 
fruitful work, achieve real results in meeting the requirements 
of the central authorities and the municipal party committee for 
greatly strengthening agriculture and rural work. We should 
make sure that our understanding and work are in place; the 
system of responsibility for work targets is conscientiously 
carried out; leadership force is further replenished; functions 
are transformed and work styles improved; and all trades and 
professions render great support to agriculture. 
  Zhang Lichang spoke on specific opinions on current 
agricultural production and relevant issues. He pointed out: 
Stabilizing and developing grain and cotton production is a 
major issue concerning urban and rural economic development and 
social stability. The current serious drought has resulted in 
reduction of the areas sown to grain and cotton, and the prices 
of the means of agricultural production have increased. All 
districts, counties, and relevant departments should 
conscientiously study this issue and exert great efforts to make 
this year's grain and cotton production successful. We should 
adopt every possible means to stabilize the areas sown to grain 
and cotton. We should strive to increase the areas sown to 
grain, raise the multiple crop index, and plant the areas that 
can be planted in spring. We should make great efforts to 
increase per- unit yields, continue the grain increase 
demonstration project and the dissemination of the 500,000-mu 
paddy rice high-yielding cultivation technology this year, and 
achieve success in the cultivation and supplied of fine seeds. 
We should institute the system whereby district and county 
heads are responsible for management of targets. All districts 
and counties should assign grain and cotton production tasks to 
townships, villages, and households and hold the responsibility 
for them. On the premise that their total grain supply and 
demand are kept basically in balance, they should develop and 
utilize land resources to develop good-quality, high-yield, and 
high-efficient cash crops and ensure rural self-sufficiency in 
grain supplies. All-out efforts should be made to combat 
drought to ensure wheat fields and spring sowing. All cadres of 
agricultural departments should overcome difficulties, 
concentrate efforts on this work, and make it successful. All 
trades and professions in Tianjin should actively support the 
antidrought work to ensure wheat production and support spring 
farming. We should deepen the reform of the grain purchasing 
and marketing system and establish the grain reserve system and 
risk fund. In addition to the portion to be consumed by 
peasants themselves, some of the grain produced in Tianjin 
should be supplied to its urban areas. Departments concerned 
should purchase this part of grain on a priority basis in line 
with state's regulations and policies, and they are not allowed 
to increase or lower the purchasing price at will. Grain 
departments should coordinate well with major grain producing 
areas, sign contracts with them, and ensure fulfillment of the 
contracts. They should play the major role in the supplies of 
grain. In line with state requirements and the actual demand of 
Tianjin, grain departments, in addition to ensuring normal grain 
supplies, should stabilize grain stock while ensuring a certain 
amount of circulating grain. Meanwhile, they should increase 
the reserve of edible oil to a proper extent through various 
channels. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 12 April, the municipal 
party committee and government held a meeting of district, 
county, and bureau leading cadres to sum up the work done in the 
first quarter of this year and to arrange the work for the 
second. The meeting stressed: The people from higher levels 
downward across the municipality should further be mobilized, 
clearly understand the situation, be inspired with enthusiasm, 
enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of responsibility, 
firmly attend to the work of the second quarter of the year 
which is the key season of the whole year, make consistent 
efforts, go all out to grasp the fulfillment of the work, 
comprehensively speed up the progress of the work in all 
aspects, maintain a good development trend, comprehensively 
fulfill the 1994 targets and tasks, and fight for making key 
breakthroughs and development. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee; and 
Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee 
and mayor of the municipality, made important speeches at the 
meeting. 
  The meeting was chaired by Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of 
the municipal party committee. Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of 
the municipal party committee and executive vice mayor of the 
municipal government; Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal 
people's congress standing committee; and Liu Jinfeng, chairman 
of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference were present at the meeting. 
  Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang pointed out in their speeches: 
Since the beginning of this year, the party committees and 
governments at various levels as well as all people of the 
municipality have taken Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic 
line of the party as guidance, done solid work and gone all out 
to do pioneering work according to the arrangements made at the 
second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee and the overall work situation of the party as a 
whole, and maintained a good work development trend. The 
economic operation situation is good. When comparing the first 
quarter of this year with the same period of last year, the 
gross domestic product of the municipality increased by 12.4 
percent when calculated in terms of comparable prices, the total 
output value realized by the industries at or above the township 
level increased by 14.6 percent, the foreign export trade volume 
increased by 23.2 percent, the amount of foreign capital used 
according to agreements increased by 55.4 percent, the total 
volume of retail sales of commodities increased by 30.3 percent, 
and the revenues increased by 24.6 percent. Faster progress was 
made in deepening reform of enterprises, readjusting and 
transforming old enterprises with foreign capital, renovation of 
dangerous, shabby, one-story houses, and construction of the new 
coastal area. Sixty-six key projects are under smooth 
construction. The tendency to increase the amount of foreign 
capital for use has been strengthened. Markets are being set up 
with high starting points. The construction of the spiritual 
civilization has been strengthened. The preparatory work for 
the 43d world table tennis event is positively being carried 
out. An upsurge of learning from advanced models has started. 
The anticorruption struggle has continuously and deeply been 
waged. The broad masses of cadres and people are inspired with 
enthusiasm and satisfaction. A municipal situation 
characterized by a developed economy, political stability, 
social progress, stability, and unity has further been 
consolidated and developed. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang 
pointed out: The second season is an important key period as 
well as a golden season. Therefore, we must accelerate the 
progress of the work in all aspects, ensure that the semi-annual 
goals are exceeded by the end of the second quarter, also strive 
to fulfill the tasks in a faster and better way, and lay a solid 
foundation for comprehensively fulfilling the annual tasks. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in his speech that we should profoundly 
understand the work situation of the whole party, upgrade the 
awareness of going into action under the overall situation, and 
positively and comprehensively promote the work in all aspects 
under this overall situation. To this end, he set forth four 
requirements: First, we must ceaselessly deepen our 
understanding to clearly understand and be submitted to the 
overall situation. We should firmly foster the idea about the 
overall situation, further enhance the awareness of grasping the 
favorable opportunities, and persist in the quintessence of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Second, 
there must be new ideas and methods for development. We should 
actually shift the focus of economic construction onto the orbit 
of relying on scientific and technological progress, upgrading 
the quality of laborers, and increasing economic results as well 
as the orbit of relying on science and technology to make 
development so as to maintain sustained, fast, and sound 
development of the national economy. 
  Third, we should 
accurately handle the relations among reform, development, and 
stability. We should further foster the ideology of relying on 
reform to promote development and concentrate greater energy on 
deepening reform. Simultaneously, we should regard the 
maintenance of stability as a great matter relating to the 
overall situation and realistically attend to it. Fourth, we 
should persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach 
and being sure that both hands are tough" and ensure faster 
economic development and comprehensive social progress. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: To develop the work in all aspects 
in a faster and better manner in the new situation, the leading 
cadres at various levels must further grasp the major tasks as 
follows: First, closely in line with the overall party work 
situation, we should unswervingly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
should conscientiously study original works and systematically 
conduct the study on special topics on the basis of thoroughly 
reading the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping." Persistently according to the principle of linking 
theory with practice, we should ensure that we apply and arm our 
heads with what we have studied and use what we have studied to 
guide and promote our work. Meanwhile, we should organize the 
broad masses of cadres to deeply study the theory on and the 
basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. Second, we 
should conscientiously carry out the system of responsibility 
for the fulfillment of the fixed tasks to ensure the fulfillment 
of all tasks. According to the requirements for reality, 
firmness, and perfectness, we should divide tasks and assign 
them to individuals. We should strive to make the targets more 
advanced and to integrate contents of the targets further, 
embody the overall work situation and general work levels, 
strictly make assessment, and ensure both reward and 
penalization. We should improve, as soon as possible, where we 
lagged behind in the first quarter of the year. We should 
strengthen mid-term promotion and pay firm attention to 
supervision, examination, and implementation. Third, we should 
realistically improve our work style and exert efforts to firmly 
grasp the fulfillment of the tasks. Recently, the central 
leading comrades made a series of important instructions on 
improving the work style which hit the mark and are to the 
point. We must implement the instructions one by one. By 
summing up the work done in the first quarter, the leading 
bodies at various levels should conscientiously examine the 
existing problems in work style. Some of them should especially 
convene democratic meetings to solve the problems in this 
aspect. We should emphasize "working solidly," telling the 
truth, think out real methods, do concrete deeds, and seek real 
efficiency. Fourth, we should further change the government 
functions and try every possible means to do solid deeds for 
enterprises. On the basis of persistently doing concrete deeds 
for the people, this year, in changing the government functions, 
we should focus our efforts on trying every possible means to do 
concrete deeds for enterprises. To do solid deeds for 
enterprises, we should have initiative, be concerned with and 
cherish enterprises, and regard the things of enterprises as our 
own. All departments should regard the difficulties and 
problems reflected by the enterprises as a key task that should 
first be handled for enterprises. Gao Dezhan urged that the 
leading cadres at various levels should have a good mental state 
and a solid work style, guide the broad masses of cadres and 
people in the municipality, work with one heart and soul in an 
arduous manner, and strive to comprehensively fulfill all 
targets and tasks of this year and make key breakthroughs and 
development in all work. [passage omitted] 
  Municipal leaders, including Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Song 
Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Pan Yiqing, 
Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang Gonghui, Li Changxing, Huang Yanzhi, and 
Zhang Guanwen were present at the meeting as well as over 700 
people such as principal responsible comrades of various 
departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, and 
bureaus.

  [Text] Coming to the issue of ties with Vietnam, Wu Jianmin 
reiterated China's sovereignty over the Nansha [Spratly] 
Islands. The spokesman said China's stand on the islands and 
their adjacent waters enjoys the international legal basis; and 
Vietnam, which had carried out a number of illegal oil and gas 
explorations there in recent years, has infringed on China's 
sovereignty. Wu Jianmin said Beijing has repeatedly stated its 
position to Hanoi. He said while bilateral ties in general have 
been developing steadily, China hopes negotiations on 
territorial disputes will make progress on basic principles 
already reached between the two sides.

  [Text] Red Cross officials leave Beijing today after 
failing to reach agreement with China over access to prisons. 
There had been some expectation that China would make 
concessions ahead of the United States decision on the renewal 
of trade benefits in June. However, Angelo Gnadinger, who headed 
the Red Cross delegation of three, said last night there 
remained "more to be done". "We have not finished all the work. 
We are just in the midst of it," he said. 
  Three meetings were held during the week with Chinese 
officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China gave no 
indications when another meeting might be held, but did not rule 
out further talks in May, Gnadinger said. 
  Sources at the Red Cross had thought that China might seek a 
"quick solution" in light of the U.S. decision on renewing Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) status in June. China is understood to 
want to limit the definition of prisoners to those convicted of 
crimes, a sticking point with the Red Cross, which seeks to 
visit "all detainees". 
  Improving conditions for prisoners "such as allowing access 
to prisons by international humanitarian and human rights 
organisations" is one condition of Bill Clinton's presidential 
executive order governing the renewal of MFN.

  [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China said here 
today that despite the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the 
World Trade Talks and the signing of the final act, "The results 
are far from satisfactory." 
  "Many of the developing countries' requirements have not 
been 
met and the world must continue to address the remaining 
issues," said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of China's central 
bank, the People's Bank of China. 
  Speaking at the 50th meeting of the group of 24 ministers, 
part of the spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF, Chen 
said much work remained to be done to implement the concluded 
trade agreements. 
  Chen stressed that while trade protectionism in the 
developed 
countries has increased rather than decreased, the developing 
countries have adopted measures to liberalize trade and open up 
domestic markets. 
  "The developed countries should further open their markets 
and eliminate various forms of subsidies as well as non-trade 
barriers," Chen said. 
  "We earnestly oppose the use of so-called social barriers on 
part of developed countries as an excuse to restrict the exports 
of developing countries," he stressed.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting United States 
Defense Secretary William Perry said here Friday [22 April] that 
the U.S. should solve the nuclear development issue in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "with greater 
patience and extensive diplomatic efforts." 
  Perry, who arrived here on Thursday from South Korea, told a 
press conference that the United States places great hope in 
China in efforts to persuade the DPRK to relinquish its nuclear 
development program. 
  Perry said that if the DPRK's attitude does not soften 
despite diplomatic efforts, the U.S. and allies such as Japan 
and South Korea will impose sanctions against the DPRK. 
  Perry did not rule out possible military pressure on the 
DPRK, but he believes that would run the risk of bringing about 
a large-scale war. 
  If the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions against the 
DPRK, 
they will be "moderate and step-by-step ones," Perry said. 
  The U.S. defense secretary noted that if the DPRK fulfills 
its international duty on the nuclear issue, the United States 
is ready to discuss the issue of the normalization of political 
and economic relations.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- United States Defense 
Secretary William Perry reiterated here on Friday [22 April] 
that there is no military confrontation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Perry, who flew here on Thursday from South Korea for his 
first official visit to Japan, made this remark during talks 
with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is expected to 
succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. 
  Speaking of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Perry 
said, "I don't believe there is a sign of military confrontation 
there." 
  Remarking on the nuclear development issue in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), he said the U.S. and Japan 
agreed that "a solution through diplomacy is important." 
  They also agreed that Japan and the United States should 
keep 
in close contact with each other in dealing with the nuclear 
issue, and that the solidarity of Japan, the U.S. and South 
Korea should be reinforced. 
  Hata said that winning cooperation from China is "extremely 
important" in dealing with the nuclear question. 
  Perry also met with Japanese Defense Minister Kazuo Aichi on 
Friday. 
  Perry left Tokyo for home later Friday evening.

  [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher told American television viewers today 
the progress of Serbian withdrawal from around Gorazde is 
"encouraging." 
  Speaking at the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) "This 
Week With David Brinkley," Christopher said latest reports from 
the scene indicate that the withdrawal is taking place. 
  The ultimatum issued by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) on Friday [22 April] seems to be working, he 
said, adding that "We've been disappointed before, but so far 
today, it's encouraging." 
  NATO ordered the Bosnian Serbs to immediately stop their 
assault and pull out their heavy weapons before 12:01 A.M. local 
time today from a two miles radius from the center of Gorazde. 
  It also demanded that the Serbs allow United Nations 
peacekeepers and medical personnel into Gorazde, one of the six 
U.N.-designated "safe areas" for Muslim refugees. 
  Had the Serbs failed to respond, the ultimatum threatened, 
they would risk NATO air strikes. 
  The United States is "very carefully" monitoring the 
situation at the enclave, which had been under intensive Serb 
attacks in recent weeks, Christopher said. 
  Before making the remarks, the U.S. state secretary talked 
several times this morning with the chairman of the U.S. joint 
chiefs of staff and received reports from Bosnia. 
  Despite small arms fire, there has been no shelling in 
Gorazde today. Some 140 U.N. peacekeepers are already in the 
city and about 500 more are expected to arrive this afternoon. 
  British and French helicopters, meanwhile, are evacuating 
the 
wounded from the former Yugoslav Republic. And they hope to 
bring out between 200 to 300 people today.

  [Text] Washington, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today plans to launch the most expensive spy satellite it ever 
made from Cape Canaveral, Florida, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported. 
  Quoting Pentagon officials and private analysts, THE TIMES 
said the primary mission of 1.5 billion dollars new spy 
satellite is to eavesdrop on Russia. 
  The satellite is expected to be put into orbit by the 300 
million dollars Titan IV Rocket at 12:40 eastern daylight time. 
  John Pike, the director of space policy at the Federation of 
American Scientists, said the satellite weighing five tons and 
was equipped with a dish antenna 152 meters in diameter to 
intercept the telecommunications of Russian military, 
intelligence and political officials. 
  The spy satellite was built and will be operated by the 
National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and 
most secretive intelligence service, whose existence the 
government did not acknowledge until 1992, THE TIMES said. 
  The data collected by the satellite would then be collected 
and analyzed by the National Security Agency, using a global 
network of ground stations and an array of supercomputers, the 
paper said.

  [Text] Washington, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon died of a major stroke at 2108 (EST) 
today at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center at the age of 
81, reports reaching here said. 
  Nixon suffered a major stroke at his New Jersey home at 
around supper time on April 18, and he was soon rushed to the 
hospital. 
  Beginning Thursday [21 April] afternoon, Nixon lapsed into a 
very deep coma. 
  The life-long Republican was born in California on 9 January 
1913 and was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in 1946 and to the U.S. Senate in 1950. He was elected vice 
president as running-mate to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 
re-elected vice president in 1956. 
  In 1968, Nixon was elected president of the United States 
over Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent George Wallace and 
on 20 January 1969, he was sworn in as the 37th president of the 
country. 
  In November 1972 he was re-elected U.S. president until 9 
August 1974, when he was forced to resign in culmination of the 
Watergate scandal, thus becoming the only president in U.S. 
history to resign to avoid impeachment. 
  The former U.S. leader visited China in February 1972 and at 
the end of his visit, the Chinese and U.S. Governments issued 
the famous "Shanghai Communique," opening the door to Sino-U.S. 
exchanges. He later visited China five more times as an old 
friend of the Chinese people. 
  Beginning this evening, flags in the capital Washington and 
the rest of the United States will fly at half-mast for 30 days 
to mourn Nixon's death.

(0719 2885 2504)] 
  [Text] Tashkent, 20 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the morning of 20 
April, the Chkalov Aircraft Production Corporation, which is 
located in the eastern suburban area of Tashkent, was permeated 
with a joyful atmosphere of Sino-Uzbek friendship and 
cooperation. On the last day of his visit in Uzbekistan, 
Chinese Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov, visited this plant. 
  At 0930, the state guest motorcade drove in the aircraft 
plant surrounded by green trees. When Premier Li Peng got out 
of the limousine, he was welcomed by Uzbek girls wearing ethnic 
dresses. Carrying trays with both hands, the girls offered the 
guests bread and salt according to local custom. Young boys 
played drums and trumpets to express their warmest welcome to 
the distinguished Chinese guests. 
  In the assembling workshop full of thundering machines, 
(Kuchelov), chief engineer of this plant, briefed Premier Li 
Peng in detail on the situation and production technological 
process in the 62-year-old aircraft production corporation. As 
he listened to the briefing, Premier Li Peng watched various 
equipment and components with keen interest. He frequently went 
near working tables, shaking hands and exchanging greetings in 
Russian with workers. 
  (Kuchelov) said: The Chkalov Aircraft Production Corporation 
mainly manufactures cargo planes and assembles passenger planes 
for civilian use. The plant is named after Chkalov, a 
test-flight pilot serving in the early days of the plant. After 
completing several arduous tasks, he died in a test-flight 
mission. This plant is named after him and his statue stands in 
the central part of the plant yard. 
  Stopping in front of a large plane soon to be completed, Li 
Peng inquired in detail about the plane's functions. (Kuchelov) 
said: It is the latest IL-76MF cargo plane with a carrying 
capacity of 210-tonnes; it will be tested this year. It is 
expected to leave the plant in 1996. He added: "I hope we will 
manufacture this kind of plane for China in the near future." 
  After they walked out of the workshop, Li Peng and Karimov 
mounted a just-completed IL-76TD cargo plane with a carrying 
capacity of 40-tonnes. The host said happily: Last year, this 
plant produced 7 planes of this kind and delivered them to China 
this February. Li Peng walked into the specious cargo bay and 
closely watched the technical demonstration of the opening of 
the cabin doors. 
  Assembling workshop director (Lafemov), who has worked as a 
technician in China for two years, told reporters: After its 
independence, Uzbekistan established direct ties with China; now 
the prospects for cooperation between the two countries in 
producing aircraft are even brighter. 
  Afterwards, Li Peng briskly mounted an IL-114 small 
passenger 
plane next to the IL-76TD. According to the briefing, this is a 
comfortable passenger plane with a capacity of 54 persons. It 
can fly non-stop for 1,000 km, a perfect plane for domestic 
flights. 
  Beside this passenger plane, (Kuchelov), on behalf of all 
employees of the plant, presented two plane models to Premier Li 
Peng. One was a model of the IL-76TD heavy airfreighter with 
Chinese characters "China Lienhe Airline" on it, and the other 
one is a model of the IL-114 passenger plane. 
  As the nearly one-hour visit drew to an end, Li Peng told 
reporters what he thought of this tour. He said that what 
impressed him most was the plant's broad scale, long history, 
and variety of products. He was glad that China has begun 
cooperation with this plant. 
  At the end of the visit, President Islam Karimov said: 
"Premier Li Peng's visit is not only of political but also of 
great economic significance. Today's tour manifests promising 
prospects for cooperation between Uzbekistan and China."

  [Text] Ashgabat, 20 April (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng arrived in Ashgabat -- the second leg of his 
five-Asian-nation tour -- from Tashkent on a special plane this 
afternoon and began his three-day official visit to Turkmenistan. 
  Today, a wide expanse of clear, sunlit sky was visible over 
Ashgabat, where spring was in the air. Slogans such as "Welcome 
Chinese Premier Li Peng" and "Long live Turkmen-Chinese 
friendship" written in Chinese on large streamers were hung over 
the downtown's main streets and at the capital's airport. 
  A Boeing 767 special aircraft carrying Premier Li Peng and 
his party landed at the capital's airport at 1750 (2050 Beijing 
time). When Premier Li Peng began to walk down the steps from 
his plane, President S.A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan, who was 
waiting there, walked forward to him. They cordially shook 
hands while exchanging greetings. Amid welcoming music, three 
Turkmen girls in their national costumes presented Premier Li 
Peng with bread, which symbolizes friendship. Several innocent 
and lively boys presented Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, 
with flowers. 
  President Niyazov presided over a grand ceremony. A military 
band played the national anthems of China and Turkmenistan as Li 
Peng, accompanied by Niyazov, reviewed the honor guard. 
  Later, Niyazov accompanied Li Peng in cars to the state 
guesthouse, which is located in a botanical garden. Patrol 
police and mounted police on large horses stood at attention and 
saluted when the convoy of state guests passed by. 
  At the guesthouse, Li Peng and Niyazov had short but cordial 
and friendly talks. Niyazov expressed his warm welcome to Li 
Peng's visit. He said: The people of Turkmenistan have been 
looking forward to Premier Li Peng's visit for a long time. 
They have great respect for China's civilization in the past 
and rapid economic growth of today. Li Peng expressed his 
thanks for the warm reception by President Niyazov as well as by 
the government and the people of Turkmenistan. 
  The two leaders expressed their hopes that in the next two 
days they can extensively exchange their opinions on a series of 
issues, including developing bilateral relations. 
  Premier Li Peng issued written remarks upon his arrival at 
the airport. He said: China and Turkmenistan are friendly 
neighbors. The peoples of the two countries have shared 
centuries-old friendly contacts since the "Silk Road" linked the 
two peoples 2,000 years ago. Since China and Turkmenistan 
established diplomatic relations, their traditional friendship 
has gained fresh growth. 
  He said: China attaches great importance to its relations 
with Turkmenistan, and such ties enjoy good prospects for 
further growth. He continued: "I am convinced that my visit will 
further promote friendly cooperation between China and 
Turkmenistan." 
  Those arriving at the airport on the same plane were Premier 
Li Peng's delegation including Ismail Amat, State Councillor and 
minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs 
Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of Foreign 
Affairs.

  [Text] Ashgabat, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng today met with around 600 leading Turkmens at 
the presidential palace, where he made an off-hand speech on 
China's friendly relations with Turkmenistan and other Central 
Asian nations. 
  Li Peng praised the "wise and correct" policies of the 
Turkmenistan Government in handling domestic affairs, developing 
the economy and seeking friendly relations with foreign 
countries, especially with its neighbors. 
  He also expressed an appreciation for Turkmenistan's policy 
on nationalities and religion. Li said China is also a country 
with many ethnic nationalities who treat each other equally, 
live together harmoniously and seek common development. 
  Referring to talks held in the past two days, Li said the 
two 
nations share identical or similar views on many issues. 
  China is ready to expand friendly cooperation with 
Turkmenistan in all fields, including the building of a modern 
'Silk-Road' linking China and Central Asia by railways, he said. 
  "Such ties will also serve to enhance the contact between 
Asia and Europe in general," he said, calling the `New 
Silk-Road' "not only a broad way for economic cooperation, but 
also a brilliant path towards friendship." 
  President S.A. Niyazov said the leaders of Turkmenistan and 
China are determined to develop bilateral ties overall. 
  Addressing the leading Chinese entrepreneurs traveling with 
Li Peng, Niyazov said "The door of Turkmenistan always remains 
open for you and we would like to see expansion of cooperation 
between the business circles of our two countries." 
  He added that the agreement signed on bilateral cooperation 
during Li Peng's visit will serve to consolidate the basis for a 
long-term cooperative relationship.

  [Text] Paris, April 21 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur said here today that his recent visit to China 
was a "complete success" despite some "distorting" reports by 
certain French journalists. 
  Speaking on the Television France 1 this evening, Balladur 
stressed that China is a country with which "good relations 
should be maintained." 
  However, he added that before his visit to China earlier 
this 
month, relations between France and China "had not been very 
good." 
  But political dialogues with the Chinese leaders were 
resumed 
during his visit, he said, adding that his visit was thus "a 
success from this point of view." 
  He expressed indignation at certain French journalists who 
gave a distorting picture of his visit. 
  The French prime minister visited China from April 7 to 11.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (AFP)--China revealed Monday that 
one person was killed and a dozen injured in the "accident" 
earlier this month that postponed the launch of the country's 
first geo- stationary satellite. The death occurred after a 
fire broke out during testing of the new "Fengyun 2" satellite 
April 2 at China's Xichang launch centre in the western province 
of Sichuan, a China Aerospace Corp. spokesman said. "One 
technician was killed and around 12 were injured," he added. 
  Previous reports of the incident had merely mentioned an 
"accidental event," without detailing the extent of damage or 
number of casualties. The satellite and the workshop in which 
it was housed were both badly damaged in the fire, the spokesman 
said. The satellite had been scheduled for launching in June 
aboard a Long March-3 rocket. A new launch date has yet to be 
fixed. 
  China has launched three metereological satellites since 
1988 
but the Fengyun-2 is to be the first "geo-stationary" model, 
orbitting 36,000 kilometers (22,500 miles) from the earth and 
monitoring one third of its surface. 
  China is extremely sensitive about its satellite launch 
programme which has suffered several setbacks since its 
inception in 1970, including an aborted attempt to send the 
Australian Optus-B2 satellite into orbit in December 1992 aboard 
a Long March 2E rocket. China pinned the blame for that failure 
on the US-made satellite, but some foreign experts have called 
into question the construction and relatively simple technology 
of the Chinese rockets. 
  In October last year, China and the United States got 
involved in a row over a Chinese satellite that had got lost in 
orbit and which the Americans claimed had plunged into the 
Pacific. China, while admitting the satellite was lost, 
repeatedly denied that it had fallen to earth. 
  A total of five Chinese satellites have been scheduled for 
launch this year.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- Work teams of personnel 
transferred by the State Council from the relevant departments 
to conduct a general inspection of commodity prices and 
investments in fixed assets will soon depart for various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. A general 
meeting of personnel of these two work teams was held today, 
during which Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made a mobilization speech. 
  He said: The current economic situation in China is 
generally good, with the national economy maintaining rapid and 
sustained growth momentum. However, a number of contradictions 
and problems remain in the economic life, and the most prominent 
one is the excessive rise of market prices and escalating 
inflationary pressures. The causes of inflation and price rises 
are many. An overextended scale and chaotic management of 
investments in fixed assets and failure to exercise 
macroeconomic control and regulation over market prices 
following the lifting of price control are two very important 
factors. To step up the effort to solve problems existing in 
the investment of fixed assets and in price control is a top 
priority task for curbing inflation and checking excessive price 
rises. 
  He said: The purpose of organizing the two work teams to 
conduct general price and investment inspections in various 
localities is to help them more effectively and comprehensively 
implement the principles, policies, and measures formulated by 
the party Central Committee and the State Council. To ensure 
the success of the inspections is of great importance for 
implementing the central authorities' guidelines on the overall 
interests of this year's work, and for the accomplishment of the 
various tasks in reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Outlining the requirements for the general inspections, the 
vice premier pointed out: Attention must be paid to the key 
areas as well as inspection in general in both prices and fixed 
asset investments. In order to obtain a thorough grasp of the 
situation, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive checks in 
line with the guidelines and requirements of the State Council's 
relevant documents. The key areas of the general price 
inspection are, first of all, wanton price hikes and frauds 
against customers on basic daily necessities, grain and edible 
oil in particular; second, activities of monopolizing various 
trades to drive up prices and to obtain staggering profits from 
major capital goods such as rolled steel, electricity, coal, 
petroleum, and chemical fertilizers; and third, unauthorized 
increases in public utility and service charges and collection 
of fees without authorization. The general investment 
inspection should be focused on strictly controlling newly 
launched projects. Meanwhile, attention must be focused on the 
source of funds for construction and on concentrating funds to 
ensure key projects, including screening and inventory of 
projects under construction as well as progress in suspending 
and postponing projects; on the availability of funds for key 
construction; and on the sources of self-collected funds and 
whether such sources are legitimate. 
  He said: In conducting general inspections, the work teams 
should go down to the grass roots to analyze typical cases, 
obtain firsthand information, and solve deep-level problems. 
They should reflect on things as they really are without 
covering up or hiding contradictions and problems. They should 
perform duties honestly, seek no personal privileges, and 
observe party and state discipline. They should set a good 
example in fighting corruption and promoting clean government, 
and should work concertedly to ensure the success of inspection. 
The State Council has instructed the State Planning Commission 
to work together with the relevant departments in conducting the 
general inspections. 
  It is understood that the leading group on general price 
inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of 
the State Planning Commission; deputy leader Luo Zhiling, vice 
minister in charge of the planning commission; and members who 
are senior officials from the planning commission, the 
Ministries of Supervision and Finance, the People's Bank, and 
the taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, 
and technology supervision departments. The leading group on 
the investment inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua, 
minister in charge of the planning commission; deputy leader Guo 
Shuyan, vice minister in charge of the planning commission; and 
members who are senior officials of the planning commission, the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance, 
the People's Bank, the Ministry of Supervision, the National 
Development Bank, and the State Statistics Bureau.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the 
Nanchang new and high-tech development zone in this capital of 
Jiangxi Province is going full steam ahead. 
  One of the state's new- and high-tech development zones, the 
zone located in the eastern suburbs of Nanchang covers 6.8 sq km. 
  Three sq km are being developed in the first phase. 
  A local official said that the zone has already spent 80 
million yuan on building infrastructure facilities. In 
addition, so far, construction of workshops with a combined 
floor space of 76,000 sq m has been completed. 
  Altogether, 179 enterprises, including 37 overseas-funded 
ones, have been set up in the zone. 
  The official attributed the good results to the preferential 
policy of granting more autonomy to the zone and encouraging the 
development of high-tech industries.

  [Text] The case of the state-owned Guiyang Die-Casting 
Plant application for bankruptcy, which had been followed all 
along by the residents of the city with great interest, was 
wound up by the Guiyang City Intermediate People's Court after 
four months of intensive hearings, and the plant was formerly 
declared bankrupt on 15 April. This is the first state-owned 
enterprise under the jurisdiction of the city government, which 
has publicly announced its bankruptcy to society. 
  The plant was heavily in debt due to sustained 
mismanagement. 
It was informed that the plant had just 2.7 million yuan or so 
in assets at its disposal but its debts mounted to over 4 
million yuan. It was unable to repay debts which had become due. 
By 15 April, 56 creditor units from Guizhou Province and other 
parts of the country had applied to the intermediate people's 
court for creditor's rights, of which 45 were granted those 
rights. 
  Yesterday, in accordance with the relevant legal procedures, 
the court appointed 14 working personnel from 14 units, such as 
the Guiyang City Financial and Auditing Bureau, to form an 
enterprise bankruptcy liquidation group to clear the plant's 
accounts.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Premier Lien Chan expressed his opinions on the 
Chientao Hu [Qiandao Hu] incident at the Legislative Yuan on 22 
April. He said: Introspection is a motivating force for social 
progress. In handling the Chientao Hu case, the government was 
not overly emotional and did not try to turn it into a political 
event. What the government wanted was to find out the truth and 
make the truth public. 
  Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, 
said: Communist China can reduce the damage done to cross-strait 
relations only by conducting a thoroughgoing investigation of 
the Chientao Hu tragedy. 
  Lien Chan said: The government believes that there is 
nothing more important than human life and that we should not 
conduct investigations into the Chientao Hu case in a 
perfunctory way. A modern country should handle things in a 
modern way. Therefore, after the Chientao Hu tragedy occurred, 
the government issued a forceful statement urging Communist 
China to conduct a thoroughgoing investigation. During this 
period, outsiders expressed their general opinions as well as 
specific positions on this case. However, the government still 
maintains a careful, positive, and conscientious--not simply 
accusatory--attitude toward the incident. 
  He said that, right from the very beginning, the government 
has maintained an extremely correct attitude. In response to 
the questions raised by people entertaining particular stands, 
he said: We cannot be ambiguous about this incident or shift our 
focus somewhere else. Shifting focus is a very serious matter 
which will affect the future of the country. 
  Huang Kun-hui said: What we needed was to get the truth 
out. But Communist China tried to cover up the incident by 
embargoing news reports and fabricating information. They did 
not treat the victims' families in a reasonable way. All of 
these actions, of course, led to dissatisfaction on our part. 
As for the 1990 tragedy in which illegal mainland immigrants 
died of suffocation on a boat while being repatriated, direct 
responsibility did not lie with our side. However, we did 
conduct an investigation and we told the mainland of the 
occurrence of the incident on our own initiative. In addition, 
we did pay a reasonable amount of compensation. In order to 
prevent such an accident occurring again, we later signed a 
repatriation agreement with the Mainland on Chinmen Island. 
  Meanwhile, Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the SEF, said on 22 
April: 
If Communist China makes public the Chientao Hu tragedy as soon 
as possible without any cover-up, gives reasonable compensation 
to the victims' families, and provides reasonable explanations 
for the people of the whole country, then the communications 
between the two sides can be reopened. Ku Chen-fu said that it 
is necessary for all of us to judge whether or not the 
information revealed by Communist China is correct. Ku Chen-fu 
also urged Communist China not to [word indistinct] or 
procrastinate.

  [Text] Suggestions that conditions be placed on MFN (most 
favoured nation) trading status for China have been dismissed as 
impractical by Director-General of Trade Tony Miller. 
  Mr Miller, responding to questions at the launch of the 
Trade 
Department's Customer Liaison Group yesterday, renewed his call 
to the United States Government for unconditional renewal. He 
said: "I do not think customs officers in America would be able 
to distinguish goods that were made at a state-owned factory or 
other factories. Partial renewal of MFN is not practical. I do 
not think it will help Hong Kong, it will create uncertainty and 
would be just as damaging as withdrawing MFN." His comments 
came on the eve of Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang's 
visit to the U.S. to lobby for MFN. 
  Earlier, Mr Miller launched the 30-member liaison group, 
which aims to improve communications between traders and 
officials. He said: "A new feature of this year's performance 
pledge is the enhancement of customer input. The setting up of

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (CNS) -- According to the Beijing 
Municipal Statistical Bureau, prices in the municipality 
increased by 23.1 percent from January to February and the rise 
continued in March and in April with the price of rice rising 
because of shortage of supply. In February, the consumer goods 
price index in Beijing was 126 percent and that of retail sales 
was 122.2 percent, 5.6 percent and 4.6 percent up respectively 
over those in January. The price rise in Beijing has now 
surpassed that in Shanghai but has remained lower than that in 
Tianjin. 
  The inflation index in the capital in January and February 
was 6.5 percent and 14 percent up respectively over the same 
period of last year with prices of daily necessities such as 
sugar, meat and vegetables increasing by a large scale.

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Acting Premier Zhu 
Rongji today chaired the State Council's 18th executive meeting 
to discuss the additional regulations (draft) for the "PRC 
Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order." The 
meeting later adopted, in principle, the draft additional 
regulations. 
  The meeting maintained that, since they came into effect on 
1 
January 1987, the current regulations have played a significant 
role in safeguarding social order and social stability. 
However, with the development of the economy and the deepening 
of reform and opening up, many new situtions and new issues with 
regard to public order have appeared. Thus, the additional 
regulations are very essential for strengthening control over 
public offense; safeguarding public order, safety, and 
interests; and protecting citizens' legitimate rights and 
interests so that reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization can proceed smoothly. 
  The meeting adopted, in principle, the additional 
regulations 
(draft), which the State Council will submit to the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee after further revision.

(3769 1504 3768), and Liu Jing (0491 2533): "Unswervingly 
Develop Township Enterprises"] 
  [Text] On 7 April, accompanied by Li Bingliang, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee; Gao Yongtang, vice 
chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee; 
and responsible comrades of the Langfang city party committee 
and government; Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee, successively inspected 
Langfang Economic and Technological Development Zone and rural 
areas in Anci District. 
  During the inspection tour, Tian Jiyun listened to work 
briefings given by the Langfang city party committee and the 
city government. On hearing that the output value of Langfang 
city's township enterprises totalled 17.72 billion yuan which 
accounted for 70 percent of the total industrial output value, 
Tian Jiyun said: Developing township enterprises is where the 
hope of making peasants attain a better-off level of moderate 
prosperity lies. Without the great development of township 
enterprises, there can be no rural modernization, and without 
rural modernization, there can be no national modernization. 
Therefore, no matter under what circumstances, we should 
unswervingly develop township enterprises in the course of 
developing the rural economy. Certainly, it is hard to avoid 
some problems in the process of developing township enterprises, 
namely, pollution and low efficiency problems. However, we 
should not negate it because of the existence of some problems 
which must be solved in the course of development. We should 
proceed from the fundamental interests of the state and from the 
interests of peasants, and never slightly waver in our 
determination to develop township enterprises. 
  Tian Jiyun pointed out: Langfang is surrounded by Beijing 
and Tianjin. To accelerate the pace of economic development, we 
must take advantage of its location of being surrounded by 
Beijing and Tianjin to seize the two major markets of Beijing 
and Tianjin and try by all possible means to render good service 
and to seek development and economic efficiency in the course of 
giving

<F P=106> [By Laura Beck and agencies] </F>
  [Text] Tiananmen Square "black hand" Wang Juntao left 
China yesterday after being released from jail to gain medical 
treatment abroad for severe hepatitis. Mr Wang's mother, Ge 
Yumei, said by phone that her son -- sentenced in 1991 to 13 
years' jail, in the heaviest sentence given to 1989 
pro-democracy activists -- was put on an early morning flight. 
Officials had arrived unexpectedly at her house at about 7 am 
and driven her to the airport, where she briefly met her son, 
she said, adding that she was unclear who had arranged or who 
had paid for the trip. Hong Kong legislator Lau Chin-shek said 
Mr Wang was last night on a flight bound for New York, where his 
wife Hou Xiaotian has been studying since last year. XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY quoted a justice ministry spokesman as saying Mr Wang was 
released on bail "on account of the conditions of his illness". 
  A spokesman for the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the 
Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Lee Cheuk-yan, last 
night said: "We welcome such a move, but we are disappointed 
that he is a chip in MFN (most-favoured-nation) renewal. Just 
one move to benefit one dissident does not mean the human rights 
situation has changed in China," he said. Legislator Cheung 
Man-kwong said: "The main reason for Wang's release is because 
of MFN. We are sorry the Chinese government will use our people 
to get MFN." Mr Lau said: "I think Wang's release is for 
economic reasons. Because there is no freedom of speech in 
China, people voicing their opinions will continue to be 
arrested." 
  However, fellow dissidents welcomed Mr Wang's release, 
saying 
it appeared in part to be aimed at improving ties with 
Washington ahead of the decision which must be made by 3 June on 
the renewal of China's MFN trade status -- which United States 
President Bill Clinton has linked to human rights improvements. 
"This is the result of (U.S. Secretary of State) Warren 
Christopher's visit to China," Shanghai dissident Bao Ge said, 
noting that Mr Wang's case was highlighted on a list handed to 
the Chinese authorities by the US delegation in March. 
  But the decision to release Mr Wang at a time when the 
authorities are launching a concerted crackdown on dissidents 
also suggests the condition of his liver disease, contracted in 
jail before his trial, is now critical. The authorities had 
previously ignored lobbying by Ms Hou for her husband's release 
for treatment, and dismissed her claims that his illness was 
life-threatening. She left China in September. Mr Wang had 
been in a military hospital since June but Ms Hou said in 
October that the effectiveness of his treatment had been minimal 
because strict limits imposed on his freedom of movement 
continued to take a serious toll on his health. Ms Hou said she 
had been struck by his sharp deterioration and emaciation at 
their last meeting in September. 
  Mr Wang and fellow dissident Chen Ziming were labelled "the 
blackest of the black hands" behind the Tiananmen Square 
democracy movement and each was sentenced to 13 years for 
"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement". Both men had 
run a reformist think-tank associated with Zhao Ziyang, the 
former protegee of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who was 
ousted as communist party general secretary after the 
pro-democracy protests were violently crushed by the army. 
  Mr Cheung a member of the United Democrats and the Hong Kong 
Alliance, said they were concerned that the Chinese government 
had "kicked" Mr Wang out and would stop him returning, as 
happened with labour activist Han Dongfang. Mr Han, who spent 
22 months in jail for his role in the 1989 protests, has been 
stranded in Hong Kong since August, when he made his first 
attempt to go home after being sent abroad a year earlier for 
treatment for his tuberculosis contracted in prison. 
  Mr Wang's mother said: "I'm happy for him to go abroad to 
cure his illness, but I'm unhappy because I don't know when I'll 
see him again."

  [Text] The early release from prison of democracy advocate 
Wang Juntao calls into question the continued detention of other 
1989 activists and is raising the level of both hope and 
indignation from the families of jailed dissidents. 
  "Theirs was the same case. Why not let Chen Ziming free?" 
said Wu Yongfen, the mother of Chen, who like Mr Wang was 
sentenced to 13 years in jail for allegedly being one of the 
"black hands" behind what the Chinese Government calls an 
attempt to topple the Communist Party five years ago. 
  On Saturday, China announced the release of Mr Wang, 
allowing 
him to travel to the United States for medical treatment. 
  "It was a deal for MFN [Most Favoured Nation trade status]," 
Ms Wu said of Mr Wang's release. She said her family would 
press for the release of Chen. "We want more foreign pressure," 
she said. 
  The Chinese Government says the nation's laws make provision 
for the release of prisoners on humanitarian grounds but, in 
fact, China has used these legal provisions primarily as an 
excuse to make human rights concessions when it sees a political 
advantage from doing so. 
  While Mr Wang's wife Hou Xiaotian, had single-handedly 
launched a tireless campaign for the release of her husband, 
frequently meeting with the foreign press in on-the-record 
interviews, the families of Chen and other dissidents have kept 
a far lower profile. 
  Since the beginning of Chen's imprisonment almost five years 
ago, he has contracted a series of ailments, including a skin 
disease, high blood pressure, and heart trouble. His hair is 
falling out and his teeth are coming loose. Chen, ex-head of 
the Beijing Social and Economic Sciences Research Institute is 
being held in the Beijing No. 2 Prison. 
  "We want him to get the same as Wang Juntao. The case was 
the same. Wang Juntao was ill, so is Chen Ziming. Why let one 
go abroad and not let the other out on parole for medical 
treatment in China?" said Ms Wu. 
  "My concern is, who is the next?" said Bao Pu, the son of 
Bao 
Tong, the principal secretary of ousted Communist Party leader 
Zhao Ziyang. The elder Mr Bao is serving a seven-year sentence 
for allegedly "leaking state secrets." Mr Bao has had 17 polyps 
removed since being imprisoned in Qincheng Prison in 1989. The 
authorities say the polyps have so far been benign. His white 
blood cell count is well below normal and his carcinoembryonic 
antigen level has been increasing to well above normal, 
suggesting cancer. Doctors say Bao has thyroid tumours and 
suffers from salivary gland atrophy. 
  Recently Bao has been transferred to a hospital for 
treatment. While on the face of it, the principle of fair 
treatment would suggest that Chen, Bao, and other political 
prisoners should be released, analysts said the Chinese 
authorities might well decide to keep them in jail if they saw 
the release of Mr Wang as being enough to sway U.S. opinion 
towards renewing MFN.

  [Text] A rising star in the dissident movement has fled 
China and made his way safely to the West through Hong Kong. 
Informed sources said yesterday that Wang Jiaqi, 34, who was 
detained by Beijing police in early March for helping organise a 
petition for labour rights, arrived in Hong Kong last Friday. 
The sources said the dissident, a graduate student in the Law 
Faculty at Beijing University, was granted asylum by a Western 
country and left Hong Kong on Thursday. 
  Wang, a police officer for several years before his 
enrolment 
at Beijing University, escaped from a detention facility in his 
native Tangshan, a city in northern China where he was taken 
under heavy guard after his arrest. Chinese sources said the 
Miniseries of Public Security and State Security had been 
ordered by the leadership to conduct a nationwide investigation 
of his daring escape and to take remedial measures to plug the 
loopholes. 
  Sources in the dissident community said that although Wang 
joined the pro-democracy crusade after the June 4, 1989 
massacre, he was deemed a rising star because of his leadership 
qualities. Early this year, Wang reportedly formed a 
non-governmental labour organisation of 100 activists to press 
for such rights as freedom to strike. Two other leaders of the 
unit, Beijing University law lecturer Yuan Hongbing and veteran 
trade unionist Zhou Guoqiang, were detained with Wang. Yuan and 
Zhou, who are being held incommunicado in Beijing, are expected 
to be given at least two to three years of "re-education through 
labour", according to Western diplomats. 
  Aside from his association with the labour movement, Wang 
used his legal expertise to help a number of people sue the 
Chinese Government and enterprises for infringing their civil 
rights. 
  While in Hong Kong, Wang, who is in good health except for 
an 
ear infection, reportedly told friends he had great expectations 
of the pro-democracy and labour movements. Wang, who is 
divorced, expressed confidence that the crusade could be 
strengthened in spite of the recent spate of arrests of its 
leaders. 
  A Hong Kong government spokesman said yesterday that it was 
policy not to comment on "individual cases." 
  A spokesman for the Tangshan Public Security Bureau said he 
had no knowledge of the Wang case.

  [Text] One of the three suspects arrested in the Qiandao 
lake massacre was a demobilised soldier who wore his military 
uniform to carry out the attack, it was revealed yesterday. Yu 
Aijun was still wearing part of his uniform when arrested last 
Sunday, the Beijing- run TA KUNG PAO reported. The brother of 
another suspect, Wu Lihong, serves in the paramilitary Peoples' 
Military Police in the Hangzhou military district. However the 
report said there were only three suspects in the case and no 
military involvement in the raid, in which 24 Taiwan tourists 
were killed on a pleasure boat on March 31. The director of 
Taiwan's National Security Bureau, Yin Tzung- wen, told members 
of parliament in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday that eight 
to 10 people were involved in the case and that a number of them 
were soldiers of the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA). But with 
China denying the charge as "pure fabrication" and no evidence 
emerging to support the theory, calls began in Taipei yesterday 
for Yin to step down. "The issue is serious. If it was found 
later no mainland soldiers were involved in the case, he (the 
security head) should assume political responsibility for 
providing false information," an opposition MP, Chen Shui-hian, 
said. Opposition MPs said Yin should not to use false 
information to trick lawmakers into supporting the annual budget 
of the security bureau. It was during a meeting with opposition 
MPs to review the bureau's budget that the PLA charge was made. 
"As soon as the mainland government reveals all the details and 
completes court proceedings of the case, we will ask Yin and the 
military information bureau director to report to us how they 
handled the case," Chen said. 
  Taiwan officials also announced yesterday they would not 
allow expansion of imports from China until the completion of an 
inquiry into the incident. 
  Meanwhile, two journalists from the Hong Kong-based TVB 
Superchannel (TVBS), who were detained by police in Zhejiang on 
Wednesday, remained in Hangzhou last night. Ma Yu-yuen, a 
Taiwanese passport holder, and Cheuk Tak-ming, a Hong Kong 
resident, were detained and interrogated for reporting without 
permits when they arrived at the scene of the incident.

<F P=106> [Special dispatch: "Dependents of Three Culprits Arrive at </F>
County Center To Attend Hearings; Yu Aijun Used To Be a Soldier; 
He Was in an Old Army Uniform When He Comitted the Crime"] 
  [Text] Zhejiang's Chunan Qiandaohu, 21 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) 
-- The dependents of the three culprits of the "31 March 
manslaughter case" were summoned to the county center, the town 
of Qiandaohu, to accept hearings after the case was uncovered. 
  The parents of chief culprit Wu Lihong [0702 3680 1347] 
returned home on the evening of 21 April. Wu's father is 58 
years old this year, and his mother is 56 years old; both are 
farmers. There are five brothers and sisters in the family, Wu 
being the youngest son. He has an elder brother and three 
married elder sisters. His brother graduated from the Hangzhou 
Armed Police Corps Cadet School and is now an armed police corps 
officer. 
  The Wus' house is located at Qianjiao village, Tongziwu 
township in Chunan County, by the side of Qiandao Lake. Six 
years ago, Wu's father spent some 10,000 yuan to build a new, 
six-room two-story house, with a floor space of some 170 square 
meters. According to Wu's father, his youngest son was an 
introvert in temperament, and had been good at his studies since 
he was young. Later, through an entrance examination, he was 
admitted to a local key high school, Qinghan Middle School. 
Later, he failed the entrance examination for senior middle 
school, being 10 points short. Consequently, he studied at home 
for two years and took the entrance examination again, but 
failed it once again. Last April, Wu borrowed 8,000 yuan from 
his elder brother, and another 2,000 from his father and a 
friend; in addition he took out a loan of 15,000 yuan. With 
this money, he purchased a 25-horsepower Shuixing-brand 
speedboat, thus starting his business of carrying tourists on 
the lake. Toward the end of last year, he sold the speedboat, 
and spend 68,000 yuan to purchase a 75-horsepower Yamaha 70-seat 
speedboat, in partnership with his good friend, Yu Aijun [0151 
1947 6511], (another culprit in the same case), with which they 
continued the business of carrying tourists. Wu's father said 
that before the incident took place, Wu Lihong was doing 
business in the town of Qiandaohu, and seldom came home. He 
knew of his son's bad habit of gambling, but he knew nothing 
about his son's heinous crime. 
  Wu's father said that a person should bear sole 
responsibility for his adtions, and he had a grasp of this 
truth. Now that his son had committed a heinous crime, it 
served him right to received a stern legal penalty. The old man 
had faith in the people's government. 
  An accomplice of Wu Lihong was 23-year-old Yu Aijun [0151 
1947 6511], a native of the city of Jiangde, in Zhejiang 
Province. He had been a soldier, and when apprehended, was 
wearing a worn Army uniform without insignia; he was a very 
handsome young man, at that.

all of them looked and spoke with very clear train of thought. 
They told the police that they had worked on the plan for six 
months or so, and did not expect their case to be discovered; 
they expressed admiration for the police.

  [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CPC) today urged continuous and concerted efforts to put 
out the forest fire in the Hulun Buir League (prefecture) of the 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  In his note to a report on the forest fire, Jiang Zemin, who 
is also the president of China, said: "I hope you will make an 
all-out effort, plan meticulously, issue careful directions, 
unite and coordinate steps and fight consecutive battles to put 
out the fire as soon as possible so as to make contributions to 
protecting the forest resources of the state." 
  The two fires started seven days ago. One is in the western 
section of the forest, which was reported to have been brought 
under control. The other is in the eastern and southern parts 
of the forest, which is still blazing, due to strong winds and 
difficult terrain. 
  The fire fighters, mainly forest police, armed police, 
border 
police, men of the People's Liberation Army and local people, 
are still fighting the fire.

  [Text] Forestry Minister Xu Youfang arrived at the 
forefront of the (Hongba) forest fire site on 20 April to direct 
the operation of extinguishing the fire. After hearing a 
briefing on efforts to extinguish the forest fire, Minister Xu 
Youfang relayed the following four directives by the State 
Council: 
  1. Efforts should be made to adopt practical and effective 
measures for the operation and to make use of topographical 
advantages to create a separation gap and to pay attention to 
watching the fire situation. 
  2. We should be determined to concentrate strong forces on 
waging a battle and make good arrangements for ensuring support 
services for the safety of personnel. 
  3. We should maintain close contact with the meteorological 
departments and be aware of weather changes at all times. 
  4. We should report the disaster situation to the State 
Council at all times. 
  Minister Xu Youfang said: The pine trees of Zhangzi species 
are rare and the forest zones of such trees are the state 
wealth. The State Council attaches great importance on the seed 
forest base of Zhangzi-species pine trees in the Honghuaerqu 
forestry administration bureau. Thus, the struggle against the 
forest fire is important and greatly significant. The 
organizational and commanding work undertaken by the 
headquarters to extinguish the fire should be keyed up and 
carried out in a orderly manner. Responsibilities for the 
operation should be clearly defined, in addition, the policies 
and orders should be carried out in a unified manner. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to ensure support services to 
avoid missing opportunities to fight the fire.

  [Text] Hulun Buir, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The forest fire 
that has raged for days in the Hulun Buir League (prefecture) in 
northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was put out by 
six o'clock this morning. 
  A joint message of greetings was sent today to all the fire- 
fighters by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist 
Party, the State Council and the Central Military Commission. 
  The message praised the good job done by fire fighters 
despite unfavorable weather conditions. 
  There were no deaths or houses burnt, and damage to the 
forest was kept to the minimum, sources said. 
  Some of the fire-fighters have begun to leave the area, and 
it began to snow this morning in the forest. However, forest 
police stayed on to watch the final dying out of the fire. 
  A concentrated effort was made from about five o'clock 
yesterday afternoon when the wind weakened and the fire finally 
was completely extinguished by six o'clock this morning. 
  Sources at the fire-fighting command headquarters said that 
more than 7,000 policemen, People's Liberation Army soldiers and 
local workers joined in the efforts to extinguish the fire, 
which broke out seven days ago. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist 
Party, and acting premier Zhu Rongji and other Chinese leaders 
had earlier sent messages to encourage the fire fighters.

XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yu Changhong 
(0060 7022 3163)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Red Cross Society 
of China [RCSC] opened its sixth national congress in Beijing 
today. The congress adopted a namelist of new leaders with Jiang 
Zemin as the RCSC honorary chairman; discussed outlines of the 
work programs between 1995 and 1999; and formulated working 
directives that "China should earnestly implement the Red Cross 
Society Law and strive to develop Red Cross undertakings with 
Chinese characteristics." 
  The RCSC marks its 90th founding anniversary in 1994. After 
holding consultations and restructuring in 1950, the RCSC has 
done a lot of work as a humanitarian organization providing 
social aid and relief. The RCSC was New China's first organ to 
regain its legitimate seat in international organizations. It 
has extensively launched nongovernmental diplomatic activities 
in its special capacity and has played an important role in 
publicizing New China in the international arena. 
  Under the care of the party and government in recent years, 
China's Red Cross undertakings have vigorously developed. They 
have achieved remarkable results in making preparations against 
disasters, providing relief during and after disasters, 
supplying social services and first aid for the masses, 
promoting blood donation among citizens, establishing Chinese 
bone marrow banks, and cultivating young Red Cross members. 
While launching various campaigns, the RCSC has advocated the 
spirit of caring for others, feeling good about helping people 
and self-sacrifice, and has thereby enhanced the socialist 
spiritual civilization drive. The RCSC has played a special 
role in linking cross-strait relations. It has actively promoted 
bilateral and multilateral exchanges with Red Cross societies 
from various countries and the International Red Cross 
Organization, and has boosted friendly international exchanges 
and cooperation. In May 1993, the RCSC successfully hosted the 
fourth Asia-Pacific regional meeting of the International Red 
Cross Society and Red Crescent Society in Beijing, which adopted 
the historically significant "Beijing Declaration." It fully 
demonstrated the RCSC's important role in the International Red 
Cross movement. 
  On 31 October 1993, the Eighth National People's Congress 
Standing Committee formally adopted the "Red Cross Society Law 
of the People's Republic of China," thereby indicating that 
China attaches great importance to and supports Red Cross 
humanitarian undertakings. The law has provided a legal 
guarantee for the development of Red Cross undertakings in China 
and for links with the International Red Cross movement. It was 
a landmark that China's Red Cross undertakings have entered a 
new historic phase. 
  State Councilor Peng Peiyun spoke at the opening of the 
national congress. She said: Red Cross undertakings are lofty 
and great endeavors that benefit mankind. They have bright 
prospects for development and need active participation and 
selfless sacrifices from more people. She urged governments at 
various levels and various social circles should continually 
support Red Cross undertakings. She expressed the hope that Red 
Cross societies at various levels and the broad masses of their 
members would take into account China's reality; learn from 
useful foreign experiences; do a better job while executing 
their responsibilities and obligations as stipulated in the Red 
Cross Society; uphold professional ethics of "humanity and 
honesty"; and promote a workstyle "stressing unity, performance 
of concrete tasks, and attainment of development and high 
efficiency" in an effort to make more contributions to 
"improving conditions of the most vulnerable groups" and to 
enhancing social progress. 
  The namelist of the Sixth RCSC leaders adopted at today's 
meeting follows: Zhao Puchu, Wang Guangying, Li Peiyao, Qian 
Xinzhong, Cui Yueli, and Chen Minzhang are honorary vice 
chairmen. Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
Vice Chairman Qian Zhengying is chairman. Gu Yingqi is 
executive vice chairman. Fan Baojun, Yang Chongchun, Lin 
Yanzhi, Sun Boqiu, and Qu Zhe are vice chairmen. Li Changming 
is secretary general. 
  George (?Wilberson) [wei bo xiang 7279 0130 0686], the 
International Federation of Red Cross Society and Red Crescent 
Society secretary general, sent a congratulatory letter to 
today's meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Aimed at curbing the 
increasingly worsening smuggling activities using fake customs 
certificates, seals, and customs officers' signatures since the 
beginning of the year, the General Administration of Customs 
recently issued a circular calling on customs departments 
nationwide to begin cracking down severely on smuggling 
activities using the "three fakes." 
  Since the beginning of the year, customs departments 
nationwide have uncovered over 20 major smuggling cases using 
the "three fakes." The value of these cases was some 90 million 
yuan, or about 35 percent of the total value of cases uncovered 
during the same period. Of these, automobiles have become the 
main target for smuggling using the "three fakes," as 90 
smuggled automobiles were uncovered by customs officials in the 
first quarter alone. On 2 March this year, disguised under the 
names of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises, as well as using fake customs' tax reduction and 
exemption certificates and seals, illegal elements smuggled into 
the country 11 automobiles but were uncovered by Jinan customs 
officials in one stroke. Besides automobiles, other goods 
uncovered were motorcycles, color television sets, steel 
products, and polyester fibers. 
  It has been learned that gangs who specialize in producing 
fake certificates and seals for use in reselling goods for 
profits have been uncovered in the society. In smuggling cases 
using the "three fakes" uncovered by customs officials in 
various localities, illegal elements applied unscrupulous means 
to produce various fake customs seals and certificates. A 
certain company produced 17 fake copies of "Customs Certificates 
for Imported Goods" to obtain the tax-free status by cheating on 
32 items, including motorcycles, for resale, and was uncovered 
by the Shenyang Customs Department; and a certain company 
employee teamed up with others to illegally make two customs 
seals as well as 29 books of registration certificates for ship 
crews and their goods for resale activities, and was discovered 
by the Dalian Customs Department. Further, in the middle of 
March, the Kowloon Customs Department discovered the activities 
of producing fake customs penalty and confiscation certificates 
as well as covering up the illegal sources of goods. 
  As smuggling activities using the "three fakes" have 
seriously sabotaged the normal order of import and export trade, 
causing great damages to the country, it is necessary to 
severely crack down on such activities. It is understood that 
the General Administration of Customs has made specific 
arrangements on organization and leadership, key task areas, and 
plans of action for local customs officials to severely crack 
down on the "three fakes" smuggling activities.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Let the Entire Society Show </F>
Concern for the Growth of Orphans"] 
  [Text] Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi have written 
inscriptions respectively for the "social welfare plan to help 
raise and educate orphans on China's mainland" (also called the 
plan to save orphans), calling on all sectors of society to 
concern themselves with the growth of orphans. This indicates 
that the party and government, as well as the general public, 
are very much concerned about the healthy growth of children and 
attach great attention to developing socialist undertakings 
supporting the poor and orphans. 
  The Chinese government has always paid great attention to 
developing social undertakings of supporting the poor and 
orphans, one task of the undertakings being to protect the 
orphans' right to live. The government has formulated relevant 
laws and regulations, mapped out plans for the growth of 
youngsters, including orphans, and set up social welfare 
institutions to adopt orphans. Central and local governments 
provide funds to support orphans every year. Various localities 
have provided special workers to take care of orphans and set up 
a number of relevant scientific research institutes and 
organizations for rehabilitating and training orphans. In 
helping the orphans, many people in society were so warm-hearted 
that they produced many moving stories. With affectionate 
support from the party and government and from those who are not 
but are even dearer to them than their relatives, a great number 
of orphans have grown up and have worked hard on various fronts 
to help build up the country and to repay society's kindness. 
  In general, China's undertakings to save and support orphans 
have developed healthily. However, in the process of building a 
socialist market economy, the work is facing many new problems, 
some of which are knotty, such as the greater number of orphans, 
a serious shortage of funds, poor quality of education, poor 
living conditions for orphans, and so on. All of these problems 
cry out for immediate solution. 
  Saving and supporting orphans calls for the persistent 
participation of all sectors in society. Governments at all 
levels must tighten up leadership over the work of saving and 
supporting orphans and should mobilize and organize all social 
forces to raise and educate orphans in a down-to-earth manner. 
Civil affairs departments at all levels, which are functional 
departments in charge of the work, must conscientiously 
implement the State Council's regulations on protecting 
children, strengthen research in relevant legislation and 
policies, set up and improve regional social welfare networks 
with all-inclusive functions, encourage more volunteers to join 
in the work, explore new ways to save and support orphans in 
various types of regions, and focus on saving and supporting 
orphans in the countryside. All types of social welfare 
organizations must earnestly perform their duties in raising, 
protecting, and educating orphans; and deepen reforms, improve 
management, and promote the development of social welfare 
organizations in surrounding areas. It is imperative to try in 
every possible way to find more sources of funds for supporting 
orphans and improving service facilities to provide more 
services to orphans. Government departments concerned should 
energetically support operations to save and help orphans, 
providing sufficient funds and introducing appropriate policies. 
  Saving and helping orphans is a noble undertaking and also a 
traditional virtue of the Chinese nation. We should answer the 
party Central Committee's call by displaying the socialist 
humanitarian spirit, extending a helping hand, feeling sympathy 
for orphans, and concerning ourselves with the healthy growth of 
orphans. We expect that the activity to cultivate love for the 
Chinese nation and for orphans will become the order of the day 
throughout the country. The realization of the "plan to save 
orphans" will certainly usher in a blooming spring for China's 
undertaking to save and support orphans.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make Efforts To Resolve </F>
Contradictions--Strengthen and Improve Ideological and Political 
Work in Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The Eighth Annual Session of the Chinese Workers 
and Staff Ideological and Political Work Society analyzed the 
current situation in enterprise ideological and political work, 
summarized and exchanged experiences, and set forth the tasks 
ahead. This will play a positive role in further strengthening 
and improving enterprise ideological and political work. 
  On the whole, enterprise ideological and political work has 
been strengthened. Thanks to their awareness, positive 
attitude, and forceful measures, some enterprises have done a 
good job in this field and have scored marked achievements. 
However, there are some localities and enterprises which still 
lag behind in ideological and political work and have failed to 
meet the developing needs of reform, opening up, and the 
modernization program. This state of affairs must change. 
  We are promoting economic structural reform amid the swift 
operation of the national economy this year and are attaining 
rapid growth in the national economy amid the speedy process of 
switching systems. Hence, we are faced with a large number of 
contradictions and difficult problems. Different understandings 
of specific reform and construction issues is quite natural. 
When reform has reached a crucial stage, it gives rise to 
confused and complicated thinking and creates difficulties for 
ideological and political work. For this reason, ideological 
and political work is indispensable and well worth doing. 
Enterprises constitute an essential factor in the market, while 
workers are an important factor in enterprises. While 
strengthening and improving ideological and political work in 
the new situation, the most important thing is to proceed from 
the reality of workers' thinking, straighten out ideological 
problems, resolve contradictions, arouse all positive factors, 
turn negative factors into positive ones, and guide the 
enthusiasm of the broad ranks of workers to running the 
enterprise well and fighting for the supreme objective. 
  To straighten out ideological problems and resolve 
contradictions, the fundamental thing is to arm the broad ranks 
of workers with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line and policies, and to improve the ideological and political 
qualities of cadres and the masses. We should continue to 
publicize and study volume three of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. In propaganda work, we should give 
explanations in connection with practice to allow everyone to 
understand the meaning rather than repeat or copy what books 
say. Theory is fundamental. Only when we seek unity of thinking 
theoretically, in line and in terms of major principles and 
policies, can the ideological problems be readily resolved. 
  It is man's social being which determines his thinking. The 
limitations of man's social being are inevitably reflected in 
his thinking. Therefore, talking frequently about the 
situation, the overall situation, achievements and experiences, 
and difficulties and problems should be essential contents of 
ideological and political work. Through publicity on the 
current situation, we should enable the broad ranks of workers 
to have a correct understanding of the major economic structural 
reform plans introduced this year and have confidence in the 
policies and measures adopted by the government to stabilize the 
market and prices and dispel their misgivings. Through such 
education, we should also encourage them to keep the overall 
situation in mind, correctly understand the interest relations 
between the individual and the collective, between the part and 
the whole, and between the immediate and the long-term; stress 
idealism, discipline, unity, and the overall situation; and 
understand the reform, support the reform, and resolutely plunge 
themselves into the reform. 
  Showing concern for the well-being of the masses, 
attentively listening to their voices, and resolving 
difficulties for them are indispensable in straightening out 
ideological problems and minimizing contradictions. Our 
ideological and political work should be focused on propaganda. 
But this is not enough. Ideological and political work should 
be closely connected with the people's daily lives. Comrade Mao 
Zedong once said: If you want the masses to support the 
revolutionary war, you should show concern for their well-being. 
When we want the masses to support our reform today, we should 
also show concern for their well-being. Some workers' incomes 
have dropped because of the poor performance of enterprises. 
What should be done? Some enterprises are at the verge of 
bankruptcy and the workers are worried about their future? How 
should this problem be resolved? Because of poor social order 
in some localities, the masses lack a sense of security. How 
should we put an end to this state of affairs? With a high 
sense of responsibility to the people, enterprise leaders and 
leading local cadres should make strenuous efforts to resolve 
all of these problems, which are closely related to the 
interests of the masses, particularly "rice bags" and "vegetable 
baskets." 
  Leading cadres should set an example, be strict with 
themselves, keep themselves free of corruption, change their 
style, overcome bureaucracy and formalism, and resolutely fight 
against negative and corrupt practices. This will be of great 
significance to straightening out ideological problems and 
resolving contradictions. We should realize that the broad ranks 
of workers have the overall situation in mind. They have shown 
understanding of the difficulties and problems encountered in 
the course of reform. They do not care much about their limited 
benefits and making some temporary sacrifices for a period of 
time. But they cannot bear the attitude of a handful of leading 
cadres, who put on airs but who show no interest in the 
well-being of the masses. They cannot tolerate certain leading 
cadres, who, taking advantage of reform, abuse their power and 
office and seek private gain at public expense. To straighten 
out such ideological problems and resolve contradictions, fine 
sounding words will be to no avail. The only effective method 
is to take practical action to fight corruption, run a clean 
administration, and change work style. 
  Strengthening and improving ideological and political work 
is 
the job of political work departments and workers, as well as 
the whole party. Besides state enterprises, township, 
neighborhood, the three kinds of foreign-funded, and private 
enterprises all need enhanced and improved ideological and 
political work. Enterprise ideological and political work 
constitutes an important component of modern enterprise 
management. Numerous facts have proved that wise and successful 
enterprise leaders are those who pay great attention to 
ideological and political work and who are good at doing such 
work. How to do well enterprise ideological and political work 
in the new situation is a big and meaningful new topic. So long 
as we rouse ourselves, boldly make explorations, and think and 
do more to straighten out ideological problems and resolve 
contradictions at this crucial stage of reform, we will 
certainly be able to win the battle of ideological and political 
work and create more favorable conditions for "seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability."

<F P=106> [By Abdul Turay] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's whitecollar criminals are raking in 
hundreds of millions by swindling mainland businessmen. Police 
and financial sources say scams often involve foreign-exchange 
and debt- collecting deceptions, as well as letters of credit 
and securities fraud. 
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is holding 
monthly meetings with mainland authorities to find ways to clamp 
down on the problem, which is riding on the back of China's 
economic boom. A memorandum of co-operation between the two 
sides was signed in June last year. SFC public affairs manager 
Wesley McDade said companies and individuals which had fallen 
foul of SFC regulations in Hong Kong frequently re-established 
themselves in China. "The SFC has no authority over offshore 
companies but we are able to give the authorities on the 
mainland details on suspected companies," he said. 
  An investigation by the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD has 
revealed 
that Kingly Commodities, the brokerage firm which had its 
licence revoked by the SFC in March last year, is operating in 
Shenzhen under the name World Wide Forex. Last year, the SFC 
revoked the licences of 10 individuals, suspended four others 
and warned another 16. 
  Debt-collectors have also earned a bad name for widespread 
fraud. Commercial Crime Bureau chief superintendent Neil McCabe 
said: "We've had a number of cases where mainlanders have hired 
a dodgy debt collector who then makes off with the money. The 
debt collector shows up at the office of the Hong Kong company 
and says 'give us the money'. The people they are dealing with 
are fairly respectable and easily intimidated, so they pay." Mr 
McCabe said although these criminals were one or two-man shows, 
the amounts involved were sums of hundreds of thousands, or even 
millions, of dollars. 
  Peter Kwok, a former forex trader, said most crooked 
operators were doing business on the mainland. "They are 
running the same kinds of scams they were running in Hong Kong. 
There is a lot of interest in these companies on the mainland." 
  Inspector Tres Nielson, of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said 
Chinese were not necessarily more gullible. "They are attracted 
by any deal with a promise of a high return because they are 
unable to invest in China," he said. "Any kind of investment 
opportunity they will take."

  [Text] Moscow, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today reiterated that there is still the 
possibility of a political solution to the Bosnian crises 
despite the tension building in that former Yugoslav Republic. 
  In an interview with reporters after his talks with visiting 
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, Kozyrev called on 
the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations to 
work out a joint plan with Russia for ending the bloodshed in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  "While NATO is elaborating a military plan, we want to make 
a 
peace plan together with them," he added. 
  Without such a peace plan, "I think it would be a defeat of 
the international community," he said. 
  The Russian foreign minister also said, "We cannot agree 
with 
the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who put civilian facilities 
under artillery fire." 
  "It is quite evident that these people have taken the path 
that runs counter to the Serb interests -- Serbia as a single 
whole and Bosnian Serbs. Russia cannot describe this path other 
than barbarity and crime. How can one trust these people?" 
Kozyrev added. 
  He believes, however, that there is still hope for a 
political solution. "There are other Serbs, including in 
Bosnia, whom I call the 'party of reason'. There is President 
Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I spoke several hours in a row 
on the eve of April 17. His stand is very reasonable." 
  Asked about Russia's plan on relations with NATO, the 
Russian 
minister said Moscow is working on a package of proposals which 
can serve as the basis for cooperation with NATO. 
  This package is more serious than the one offered to Moscow 
by NATO, he said, without elaboration.

  [Text] London, April 22 (XINHUA) -- NATO today threatened 
the use of air power against the Bosnian Serb Forces around the 
Muslim town of Gorazde unless they pull back three kilometers 
from the center of the town by 00:01 GMT on Sunday [24 April], 
according to the BBC. 
  The ultimatum, issued after a meeting of NATO ambassadors at 
the NATO headquarters in Brussels, also asked Serbs to stop 
shelling Gorazde immediately and give U.N. personnel access to 
the town, one of the six U.N.-designated "safe areas" for 
Muslims in Bosnia. 
  NATO said that if all conditions were not met, it would 
consider air strikes on Serb positions within a 20-kilometer 
radius of Gorazde.

  [Text] Moscow, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Friday [22 April] that Russia is 
against the expansion of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs currently 
discussed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
  After his talks with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels 
Helveg Petersen, Kozyrev reminded reporters of "strongly 
negative estimation" of Bosnian Serb attacks on civilian 
facilities and, especially, a hospital in the Moslem-held town 
of Gorazde, noting that the international community has the 
right to work for termination of criminal actions. 
  At the same time, the Russian minister pointed out, a 
military response of NATO "would not be the best choice." 
  "Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the 
European Union should draw up a common approach to the Bosnian 
problem," Kozyrev said, describing this as "very important."

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton warned the Bosnian Serbs today that they "should not 
doubt NATO's willingness to act" on wider air strikes in the 
former Yugoslav Republic. 
  In a joint press conference with visiting Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly after NATO's fresh ultimatum 
for the Serbs, Clinton said Serb acts in Gorazde "justify firm 
action." 
  Papandreou, meanwhile, expressed Greek concerns and 
reservation for the NATO decision for fear of wider violence, 
although it did not vote against it. 
  "It's a fire that can spread very fast," Papandreou said. 
"On the Balkan peninsula, we have really dynamite on our hands," 
  Under the NATO ultimatum, the Bosnian Serbs should stop 
their 
assault immediately and pull out their heavy weapons before 
12:01 A.M. Sunday (local time) from a two miles radius from the 
center of Gorazde, one of six U.N.-designated "safe areas," or 
risk NATO air strikes. 
  The NATO decision also demands that the Serbs allow U.N. 
Peacekeepers and medical personnel into the enclave, which had 
been under intensive Serb attacks in recent weeks. 
  Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Papandreou also discussed 
Athens' 
relations with Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia. 
  For his part, Papandreou offered that Greece would lift its 
economic embargo on the land-locked Macedonia and stop blocking 
its membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), provided that Macedonia change some articles in 
its constitution. 
  As for the Republic's name, which resembles that of the 
Greek 
province of Macedonia, Papandreou said, it would set aside for 
further negotiations. 
  Clinton, expressing understanding for Greece's "legitimate 
concerns" while calling for the end to the Greek economic 
blockade on Macedonia, said he was hopeful that an agreement 
would soon be reached.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Only hours after NATO 
issued an air strikes ultimatum, the Bosian Serbs had agreed a 
ceasefire in the embattled Gorazde, UN Special Envoy Yasushi 
Akashi said here today. 
  Akashi told reporters that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw 
their heavy weapons from Gorazde and allow UN peacekeeping 
troops to deploy in the area after more than nine hours of talks. 
  The truce was to take effect at midday local time (1000 
GMT). 
"Dr Karadzic has expressed his agreement for this ceasefire to 
take effect at 12 O' Clock tomorrow", Akashi said. 
  In the NATO ultimatum statement issued earlier today, NATO 
warned Serbs to stop offensive and withdraw their forces three 
kilomiters from the center of Gorazde by 001 GMT on Sunday or 
face allied air raids to protect the UN designated "safe haven." 
  Serb political leader Karadzic said to reporters that 
relations had been repaired with the Unprofor after nearly 
collapsing following NATO air raids against Serb positions near 
Gorazde on April 10 and 11. 
  "This agreement has put our relationship with Unprofor fully 
back on track," Karadzic said. 
  Although making no specific reference to the NATO ultimatum, 
Karadzic said the model used to bring a ceasefire to Sarajevo in 
February had been applied to Gorazde. 
  Akashi had brokered a ceaseifre agreement for Gorazde 
earlier 
in the week but Serb shelling attacks continued unabated.

  [Text] Moscow, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here today that Russia opposes the 
Bosnian Serbs' attacks on Gorazde, but NATO air strikes against 
the Serbs would escalate the violence in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Kozyrev told the INTERFAX news agency that the Serb attacks 
on Gorazde "go far beyond reasonable military necessity" and 
"the international community has the right to end the criminal 
actions." 
  However, Kozyrev said, "massive NATO air strikes, I think, 
will lead to an escalation of the conflict." 
  NATO issue an ultimatum in Brussels earlier today, ordering 
the Serbs to stop offensives against the Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde and pull their forces three kilometers away from the 
center of the town by 02:01 local time on Sunday (0001 GMT), or 
they will face NATO air raids. 
  The NATO also demanded the Serbs to grand access to the 
United Nations peacekeepers and medical teams to the embattled 
city of Goradze. 
  Russia had stressed time and again a diplomatic solution to 
the Bosnian conflicts, complaining that NATO's previous air 
strikes on the Serbs undermined the peace efforts.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (XINHUA) -- United Nations 
Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi, Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic, and leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic 
today expressed satisfaction with their two days of talks. 
  After their second round of talks here today on 
implementation of the cease-fire agreement in Gorazde agreed to 
on Friday [23 April] night, all three were satisfied with the 
outcome. 
  Milosevic said that the agreement was "a big step toward 
peace", adding that the Republic of Serbia would continue to 
support a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis through 
negotiation. 
  Special Envoy Akashi said he believes that the agreement 
"created a possibility for avoiding a crisis". 
  Karadzic said that if peace, de-militarization and the 
elimination of the possibility of Muslim attack were achieved in 
Gorazde, a real peace could be expected. 
  At the end of 10 hours of talks on Friday, the Bosnian Serbs 
reportedly agreed to a cease-fire and the deployment of U.N. 
Protection Forces to within three kilometers around Gorazde.

  [Text] Moscow, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today urged Bosnian Serbs to carry out 
their own obligations, describing this as the only alternative 
before the planned NATO air strikes. 
  In an interview with the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY, the Russian 
minister stressed that the decision, made by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) Thursday [21 April] on imposing 
ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs, accords with the U.N. demands. 
  He said that the military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs 
has 
thrown down an criminal gauntlet to elementary norms of 
humanity, demands of the U.N. Security Council and Russia. 
  However, Kozyrev pointed out that NATO should coordinate 
with 
U.N. Peacekeeping Forces and should not overstep the limits of 
the tasks aimed at protecting security in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb Forces 
continued heavy shelling of besieged Gorazde in defiance of a 
NATO air strike ultimatum, a UN official said today in Sarajevo. 
  Dacre Holloway, UN Protection Force spokesman, was quoted as 
saying that scores of artillery and tank rounds were fired 
during "a heavy Bosnian Serb Army attack" hours before the 
deadline of 0001 GMT on Sunday [24 April] set by NATO. 
  He said the heavy artillery attack on the town began at 
11:00 
A.M. Local time, with impacts all over the city, some very 
close to U.N. military observer headquarters, and the town 
hospital was also hit again. 
  According to reports reaching here, Holloway said the Serb 
Forces were attacking from north of the Drina River which runs 
through the Muslim town. 
  He also acknowledged that there had been some Muslim firing 
but said the "indiscriminate" Serb response was out of 
proportion. 
  NATO ministers meeting Friday in Brussels ordered Bosnian 
Serb Forces to stop attacking the town immediately or face NATO 
air strikes. 
  The Serbs, who have been attacking Gorazde since March 29, 
were warned to withdraw all forces three kilometer from the 
center of the city by the Sunday deadline, and 20 kilometer from 
the town by Wednesday. 
  According to U.N. sources, about 700 people have been killed 
and more than 1,900 injured during the Serb offensive.

  [Text] United Nations, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian U.N. 
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov today questioned NATO's decision to 
establish "military exclusion zones" around the Bosnian towns of 
Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla or Zepa if they were attacked. 
  "The reply goes beyond the request" of U.N. 
Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali for air strike threats around Gorazde, 
Vorontsov told reporters after an informal Security Council 
session, which he required to convene, on possible NATO air 
strikes and the current situation around Gorazde. 
  He said his country was "in full agreement" with the U.N. 
chief's request to NATO. "We are of the opinion that the human 
tragedy at Gorazde should be stopped and if it cannot be stopped 
by political means it should be stopped by other means." 
  But he said there are some elements in NATO's decision that 
the U.N. chief did not request. There are some paragraphs of 
threat of "striking the infrastructure, striking all kinds of 
important economic areas. We do not understand why it is 
needed," he said. 
  According to NATO's North Atlantic Council decisions on 
Friday [22 April], "If any Bosnian Serb attacks involving heavy 
weapons are carried out on the U.N.-designated safe areas... 
[ellipses as received] These weapons and other Bosnian Serb 
military assets, as well as their direct and essential military 
support facilities, including but not limited to fuel 
installations and munitions sites, will be subject to NATO air 
strikes... [ellipses as received]" 
  The Russian ambassador said the Security Council would 
continue to discuss the Bosnian problem on Monday.

  [Text] United Nations, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A cease-fire 
agreement has been reached today between the U.N. secretary- 
general's special representative for the former Yugoslavia and 
Bosnian Serb civilian and military authorities. 
  According to the agreement, which is available here, both 
sides have agreed on "an immediate and total cease-fire in and 
around Gorazde from 1200 hours" on Saturday [23 April] and 
immediate start of negotiations on all military matters. 
  They also agreed on, as a first step, urgent deployment of a 
U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor) battalion in an area of three 
kilometers from the center of Gorazde on both sides of the Drina 
River, from which Bosnian Serb Forces will be redeployed by 
midnight on Saturday, to closely monitor, supervise and report 
on the observance of the cease-fire by both parties. 
  Not later than midnight on April 26, heavy weapons will be 
withdrawn out of a 20 kilometer radius of the center of Gorazde 
and out of range so as not to constitute a threat to the safe 
area, the agreement said. 
  The two sides also agreed on the guarantee of secure 
conditions for immediate medical evacuation from Gorazde and 
complete freedom of movement for all personnel of Unprofor and 
humanitarian organizations.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev has urged the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to drop the threat of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs. 
  At a news conference, the Russian minister claimed that the 
planned NATO air attacks, especially the massive ones, can make 
the conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  He argued that NATO air strikes did not and will not at 
present bring any results within the military sphere. 
  In Grachev's opinion, settlement of the conflict lies in a 
summit meeting involving Russia, the U.S., European Union allies 
and the United Nations, which can be held in any European state 
and should include the political leadership of the whole former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The defense minister urged the Peace-Keeping Forces in the 
Moslem-held town of Gorazde be reinforced to avert bloodshed, 
adding that Russia intends to send a 19-men strong platoon to 
the stricken city. 
  He strongly opposed the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
war- torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, warning that this would be an 
untimely and inappropriate decision fraught with a further 
political isolation of Russia in the world community. 
  Grachev said that it was not only Serbs but both conflicting 
sides who are to blame for the current crisis. 
  Gebnardt Von Moltke, NATO deputy secretary general for 
political issues, who is heading a NATO delegation participating 
in an international conference here, said earlier Monday [25 
April] that NATO is going to cooperate closely with Moscow in 
solving the Bosnian crisis.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said today that he is pleased by the apparent holding of 
ceasefire around Gorazde and urged the Bosnian warring parties 
to resume peace talks. 
  "It appears that the pressure brought to bear by NATO and 
the 
U.N. is working, that the ceasefire is holding, the withdrawal 
is continuing," Clinton said. 
  "I do want to say it's now clearly time to get the 
diplomatic 
initiative going again while we maintain our vigilance," he said. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is in 
London for talks with British and French officials on the 
Bosnian situation. 
  On Tuesday [26 April], Christopher will be meeting with 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before going to the 
Middle East. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has proposed that Russia, 
the 
U.S., Europe and the U.N. convene a summit on Bosnia, but 
Clinton said the idea was premature although "deserves serious 
consideration." 
  "The United States won't be ready to move on a summit until 
we have a better idea what the Serbs are up to," the ASSOCIATED 
PRESS quoted an unnamed administration official as saying.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher have agreed to meet for talks on Bosnian settlement 
in Geneva on Tuesday [26 April], the Russian Foreign Ministry 
announced today. 
  At their working meeting, the two ministers will discuss 
urgent issues of mutual concern, including the implementation of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to hold a high-level 
meeting to discuss Bosnian settlement with the participation of 
Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United 
Nations. 
  Moreover, Kozyrev and Christopher also plan to consult some 
European powers and, if the need arises, representatives of the 
warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In a statement issued earlier on Monday, the ministry said 
that "active work of the special envoys to the former Yugoslavia 
and the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the 
European Union with the participation of the United Nations" 
must provide the basis for an upcoming high-level meeting on 
Bosnian solution. 
  "We expect that the Bosnian sides and our partners in the 
settlement process will take an active part," the ministry said. 
It stressed that "despite the complexity of the situation, 
military measures must not overshadow the line for a political 
settlement."

  [Text] United Nations, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A senior U.N. 
official warned here today that air strikes would be used 
against Bosnian Serbs if they failed to withdraw their heavy 
weapons from a 20-km exclusion zone around Gorazde by 0001 GMT 
on April 27. 
  "If they do not comply," said Kofi Annan, U.N. 
undersecretary- general, "air strikes will be used to get them 
out." 
  Subsequently, he said, the U.N. had the exclusions around 
the 
other "safe areas," which if they attempted to move heavy 
weapons in, they would also be attacked. 
  The U.N. official made these remarks at a press briefing 
held 
here this morning. 
  Annan also said that a three-km exclusion zone had been in 
effect since 0001 GMT Sunday, following a decision of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday [15 April]. 
  NATO authorized the use of air strikes against the Bosnian 
Serbs if they did not end their attacks against Gorazde, pull 
their forces back from the city center, and allow U.N. Forces 
freedom of movement there. 
  Annan said that the Bosnian Serbs had not complied promptly 
with the first deadline, but that the U.N. Protection Force 
(Unprofor) commander had decided not to use air strikes 
immediately, as it felt that progress was being made and that 
the Serbs would soon comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
  "It was important to get U.N. troops and medical units into 
the city as quickly as possible and air strikes might have 
jeopardized that operation," according to the U.N. official. 
  There are 475 U.N. personnel in Gorazde at present. 
  Answering questions on the deteriorating relations between 
the U.N. and NATO, Annan said that "the relationship is good, 
and we have excellent collaboration between the United Nations 
and the NATO."

  [Text] London, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Britain today rejected 
a proposal by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to hold an 
international summit to resolve the two-year-old Bosnian civil 
war, saying it was not a good idea at present. 
  Speaking after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
briefly 
met Vitaliy Churkin, Russian peace envoy to former Yugoslavia, 
British officials said that the Americans also shared this view. 
  "A summit can be useful at the right time. That moment has 
not yet come," one official said. 
  Hurd will hold separate talks with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
before they meet British Prime Minister John Major later today 
to discuss how to put together efforts on a peace settlement for 
Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, Britain announced it would take 50 wounded 
Moslems 
evacuated from Gorazde for medical treatment in Britain. 
  Hurd told parliament Britain had agreed to a plea for help 
from the U.N. High commission for Refugees. 
  The U.N. plans to evacuate 600 Moslems wounded in a 
three-week Serb assault on the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a 
U.N.-designated "safe area" in eastern Bosnia. 
  Hurd said he believed the Bosnian Serbs were complying with 
the terms of a NATO ultimatum under which the Serbs had to 
withdraw all their heavy weapons 20 km from Gorazde by 0001 GMT 
on Wednesday. 
  Hurd reiterated that despite the threat of NATO air strikes 
to protect Muslim safe areas, the conflict could only be brought 
to an end by a negotiated settlement.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russia today made 
several new concrete proposals on the conflict in Bosnia, 
including the strengthening of the UN presence in the region. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement proposing 
the 
stabilization of order in the UN-declared "safe areas" in 
Bosnia, the INTERFAX news agency reported. 
  The statement, issued on the eve of a meeting between 
Russian 
and U.S. foreign ministers, suggests that Bosnian Serbs and 
Muslims sign an agreement on a complete cease-fire and the 
ending of hostilities. 
  A package plan for the political resolution of the Bosnian 
crisis should be sought, the Foreign Ministry announced. 
  While realistically facilitating the peace process, the 
international community should lessen its sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, the ministry said. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev are due to meet on Tuesday in 
Geneva to discuss the Bosnian crisis.

  [Text] London, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russia, the United 
States, the European Union and the United Nations have set up a 
"contact group" which wanted a four-month peace to allow the 
Bosnian map to be redrawn. 
  London will be the first venue for the "contact group" 
meeting scheduled on Tuesday [26 April], British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said today after meetings with his U.S, 
French counterparts and Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin. 
  Hurd said he preferred negotiation to air strikes, which 
were 
threatened if Serbs failed to comply with the ultimatum to 
withdraw all heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers from 
Moslem-held Gorazde by 0001 GMT on Wednesday. 
  "I think there is a realization amongst most people that 
this 
war is only going to be brought to an end by a negotiated 
settlement," he said, "What we are doing is seeking to unify the 
efforts we are all making towards that end." 
  British officials said the cast of negotiators in the 
"contact group" will be little changed from the previous team 
already working for the Bosnian peace. The list would probably 
contain Russian and American special envoys to former 
Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles Redman, United Nations 
peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg and German, French and 
British officials. 
  Western officials welcomed in the new group the inclusion of 
Russia, widely considered as an ally of Serbs. Churkin said he 
expected tremendous efforts to be made in bringing peace in 
Bosnia. 
  "I think the next week or two are going to be very intensive 
and hard work for us all in order to bring things to a peaceful 
conclusion in Bosnia," Churkin said after a meeting with British 
Prime Minister John Major. 
  Churkin said he had been working hard to persuade Bosnian 
Serbs to end hostilities with the Moslems. 
  British officials said there was a broad agreement that 
Serbs 
face "firm response" if the ultimatum to withdraw is not met. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hailed the 
formation of "contact group" and said there were "good 
prospects" of ending bloodshed. 
  "The contact group is the best way to try and regain the 
momentum that existed prior to the situation in Gorazde," said 
Christopher after meeting Britain's Major. 
  "We think only through the combined influence of all the 
parties that I mentioned will we achieve success here. It is 
the combined influence that has the best prospect for a 
resolution of these matters," he said.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton promised today to find why two U.S. jets accidentally 
shot down two allied helicopters, killing 26 people from the 
U.S. and other countries. 
  "No one's words can wipe away the grief, the pain, the 
questions" of the victims' families, Clinton said in a memorial 
service. "It is our duty... [ellipses as received] to find the 
answers which they rightfully seek." 
  Secretary of Defense William Perry and Chairman of Joint 
Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili also attended the service, 
praising the victims' contributions "to the Kurdish people of 
northern Iraq, to each of us here." 
  The 26 victims, 15 of them U.S. citizens, perished April 14 
when two U.S. F-15C fighter planes accidentally shot down two 
UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters over northern Iraq. 
  The toll also included three Turkish officers, one French 
officer, two British officers and five Kurdish passengers aboard 
the two helicopters. 
  Perry appointed an investigative board to look into the 
incident soon after. 
  No final results were released but reports said the 
"identification friend or foe" system of the two helicopters 
might be turned off. 
  But one official described the findings as preliminary, 
saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from 
"on" to "off," the WASHINGTON TIMES reported last Thursday [21 
April]. 
  THE TIMES said if the helicopters had been flying through 
the 
no- fly zone with the identification system shut off, it would 
explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system] 
surveillance aircraft got no response from the helicopters when 
it electronically queried them shortly before the F-15C jets 
fired missiles on them.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China today called 
on the developed countries to coordinate their monetary policy 
more adequately and effectively, which it said is vital to world 
economy and trade. 
  "The asymmetrical economic cycles and adjustment pace as 
well 
as the resulting weakening coordination mechanism have weakened 
the role the industrial countries in the world economy," said 
Chen Yuan, deputy governor of People's Bank of China. 
  Speaking here today at the 42nd meeting of the Interim 
Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Chen 
stressed that the developing countries have played an important 
role in helping the global economy out of its difficulties. 
  Chen said most of the developed countries, with better 
conditions of fiscal deficit and public debt, should enhance the 
underlying fiscal position to create favorable conditions for 
world economic growth. 
  Noting that many developed countries have achieved price 
stability, Chen said that these countries should take the 
domestic economic cycles into consideration while formulating 
monetary policy. 
  These countries, Chen said, "should also coordinate policies 
to avoid a recurrence of the turbulence in the international 
monetary system." 
  He said that the long-lasting structural unemployment in 
developed countries can only be addressed through reforms of the 
labor market and an acceleration of industrial restructuring in 
these countries. 
  The deputy governor of China's central bank also pointed out 
that the developed countries' reliance on protectionism to ease 
domestic economic difficulties will only prolong the structural 
adjustment process.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today sent best wishes to the new Japanese prime minister, 
describing Tsutomu Hata as "a well-known friend of the United 
States." 
  Hata "shared his predecessor's desire to implement reforms 
in 
Japan. We look forward to working with him on a wide range of 
issues," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. 
  "He was just elected this morning, so we'll have to wait to 
see how that situation shapes up domestically," she told a White 
House press briefing. 
  "We will work with Prime Minister Hata's new government," 
Myers said. 
  Hata, 58, was former foreign minister of Japan. He replaced 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned amid allegations of financial 
wrongdoing.

  He stressed that it was also part of Albania's efforts to 
obtain full membership in NATO. 
  The document provides that Albania and NATO will cooperate

  [Text] Athens, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Greece today said it 
was satisfied with U.S. President Bill Clinton's statements on 
Macedonian issue made during a joint press conference Friday [23 
April] with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou following their 
talks at the White House. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece 
was 
particularly satisfied with Clinton's statement on the issues of 
Macedonia, Greek-Albanian relations and the Cyprus problem. 
  Venizelos, however, expressed reservations concerning 
Clinton's optimism on Cyprus. 
  "In order to make progress in the confidence-building 
measures and the essence of the problem, we must have a 
substantial and clear change in the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot 
stance. That is, Turkey and Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktash must tone down their intransigence," Venizelos said. 
  On the Macedonian issue, the spokesman said that "It is 
important that President Clinton acknowledges Greek 
sensitivities, the soundness of Greece's position, and places 
such great emphasis on the mission of UN Special Mediator Cyrus 
Vance and Clinton's special envoy Matthew Nimetz." 
  Referring to the meeting on Monday between Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias and Vance, the spokesman said that 
"We must be patient and restrained... [ellipses as received]."

  [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China urged the 
industrial countries here today to take concrete actions to help 
the developing countries alleviate their poverty and improve 
their economies. 
  "We urge the developed countries to take concrete actions to 
meet the target of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product set by 
the U.N." and use the fund to help the developing world, said 
Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China. 
  In this aspect, Chen said at the 50th meeting of the Group 
of 
24 Ministers, the developed countries have "an unavoidable 
responsibility". 
  "With the developed and developing countries' increasing 
interdependence, it is clear that not until most of the 
developing countries have achieved stable and sustainable growth 
can sound and sustained global development be attained," Chen 
said. 
  The deputy governor of China's central bank said that a 
serious difficulty for developing countries' economic 
development was the uncertainty for their external environment. 
  It included the persistent decline in commodity prices, 
various forms of trade protectionism and the heavy debt burden 
which he said imposed acute constraints on the economic 
development of many low- income developing countries. 
  "We urge the developed countries to persevere in 
substantially reducing the debt of the low-income developing 
countries," he stressed. 
  He also urged the developed countries to take more 
substantive action in the areas of finance and technical 
assistance as well as in facilitating an improved economic 
environment. 
  Speaking of the world economy, Chen said the global economic 
activity is expected to improve in the next two years, although 
continuing recession in most European countries and Japan 
remains a cause for concern. 
  Many developing countries, he said, continue to face severe 
difficulties in their economic development, while economies in 
most East European countries and the countries of the former 
Soviet Union are still enduring hardships.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin, in a meeting with visiting Canadian 
Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn here today, expressed hope 
that China and Canada would strengthen friendly exchanges and 
cooperation. 
  He added that, in the fundamental interest of the two 
countries and the two peoples, bilateral relations should be 
raised to a new stage of overall cooperation, on the basis of 
seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual 
respect, equality and mutual benefit. 
  Extending his warm welcome to Hnatyshyn, Jiang said that in 
the 20 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, 
bilateral relations have witnessed fruitful development in all 
fields. 
  "We are pleased to see that during the past few years, China 
and Canada have overcome the temporary difficulties in bilateral 
relations under joint efforts and restored the vigorous 
development of such relations," the Chinese president said. 
  Jiang said that he had very good talks with Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien when they met in Seattle in November last 
year, noting that Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua is in Canada 
on a visit now. 
  He pointed out that "to enhance exchanges between leaders of 
the two countries is of great significance." 
  It is learned that this is the first visit to China by a 
Canadian governor-general since 1987, and a senior Chinese 
diplomat here pointed out that Hnatyshyn's visit marks the 
resumption of political contacts between leaders of the two 
countries and the overall normalization of Sino-Canadian 
relations. 
  On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang said that 
the two economies are highly complementary, and Canada has 
become one of China's major trade partners in the world. 
  He continued that bilateral trade volume has grown by a 
large 
margin and that two-way investment and economic and 
technological cooperation have been continuously broadened. 
  Jiang noted that Canada has valuable expertise in 
communications, telecommunications and hydropower, which are 
being emphasized in China's development for the next few years. 
  He said that China's economy is in rapid and sustained 
growth, the market is expanding and the investment environment 
is becoming better, which provides good opportunities for the 
expansion of Sino-Canadian mutually beneficial cooperation. 
  He asked his guest to urge the Canadian Government to seize 
the opportunities so as to further bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation. 
  Hnatyshyn expressed his pleasure at visiting China, adding 
that bilateral relations date back to a long time ago and his 
current visit marks the further development of such relations. 
  He said that "we admire China's achievement in its economic 
reform and believe that the Chinese people will have a better 
future." 
  He noted that China is more and more important in the world, 
and Canada is ready to strengthen cooperation bilaterally, 
multi-laterally and in international affairs, so as to 
continuously promote relations between the two countries. 
  On the human rights issue, Hnatyshyn expressed his 
understanding of China's domestic conditions, stressing that the 
human rights issue should not be linked to trade. 
  He pointed out that Canada is willing to carry out 
discussions and cooperation with China on this issue. 
  During the one-hour meeting, Jiang also briefed Hnatyshyn on 
China's economic development. 
  Present at the meeting were Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee; He Luli, vice 
chairman of the central committee of the Revolutionary Committee 
of the Chinese Kuomintang; Sun Yongfu, chairman of the reception 
committee and vice minister of railways; and Jiang Enzhu, vice 
minister of foreign affairs. Present at the meeting on the 
Canadian side was Canadian Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Ralph Goodale who was accompanying the Governor-General on the 
trip. 
  Hnatyshyn arrived here at noon today on a state visit to 
China. 
  This afternoon, President Jiang hosted a grand welcoming 
ceremony for Hnatyshyn on the plaza outside the east entrance of 
the Great Hall of the People 
  Before the welcoming ceremony, Governor-General Hnatyshyn 
visited the Forbidden City.

  [Text] Toronto, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zou Jiahua today urged Canadian businessmen to make bigger steps 
in developing economic relations and trade with China. 
  Addressing a roundtable breakfast jointly hosted by Goodman 
&amp; 
Goodman, one of Canada's law firms and the Institute of Toronto 
C.D. Howe in his honor, Zou said "I have become more keenly 
aware of both the possibility and great potential for our 
mutually beneficial cooperation" in economic and trade field 
[sentence as received]. More than 100 businessmen attended the 
event. 
  Zou said since the establishment of Sino-Canadian diplomatic 
ties, bilateral economic relations and trade between China and 
Canada have recorded considerable progress but it falls far 
short of the need and potential of the two sides. 
  With highly developed industries, Canada enjoys an advantage 
in energy, transportation, telecommunications and finance, he 
said, adding that "It is entirely possible for Canada to make 
bigger steps in developing economic relations and trade with 
China." 
  "One of the purposes of our current visit is to explore with 
you ways to further expand Sino-Canadian economic cooperation 
and trade in the years to come," the vice premier said. 
  He said during the past 15 years, China has scored 
significant achievements in its modernization drive. "The rapid 
economic growth in China is now materializing its great 
potential as a big market," he added. 
  "China, a big market with 1.2 billion population, is 
attracting more and more foreign investors." Until the end of 
1993, China has approved foreign investment in 174,056 projects 
and more than 60 billion U.S. dollars have been invested, he 
said. 
  He hoped that more Canadian enterprises will join the rank 
of 
Northern Telecoms Limited, who stands out with distinction among 
Canadian companies to gain a foothold in China's market. 
  He urged Canadian businessmen to seize the opportunities and 
take a more active part in China's modernization drive. "If we 
are not a partner today, it will be tomorrow," Zou said.

  [Text] Toronto, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Northern Telecom today 
announced a major investment program in China to establish a 
large-scale research and development, manufacturing, sales and 
service organization for DMS telecommunications switching 
products as well as semiconductors and other technology. 
  The integrated program, described in four agreements 
initialed by representatives of Northern Telecom and 
representative Chinese and European groups, will call for a 
total Northern Telecom program investment of over 130 million 
U.S. dollars over five years. 
  These agreements were initialed in Toronto in the presence 
of 
Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Canadian Minister for 
International Trade Roy MacLaren. 
  The projects include DMS telecommunications switch 
manufacturing facility in Guangdong, very large scale integrated 
(vlsi) circuit manufacturing joint venture in Shanghai, very 
large scale integrated circuit company also in Shanghai and 
establishment of Bell-Northern Research Laboratory in the 
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 
  The agreements represent the first phase of initiatives 
covered by a memorandum of understanding signed by Northern 
Telecom and the Chinese State Planning Commission last June. 
The memo covered a broad range of manufacturing, research and 
development, technical and training projects designed to help 
modernize China's telecommunications infrastructure. 
  Jean Monty, president and chief executive officer of 
Northern 
Telecom Limited, said at the opening ceremony "these projects 
signal the important market position that China has given 
Northern Telecom," representing a "growth opportunity" that is 
"very significant" for his company. 
  In his brief speech, Canadian Minister MacLaren said these 
agreements serve as a model of the kind of partnership that 
Canada and China can build. 
  "My government is confident that trade and investment 
between 
Canada and China will expand rapidly in the years ahead and we 
are determined to do everything we can to encourage and support 
the kind of partnerships we have witnessed here today," he said. 
  Chinese Vice Premier Zou also said in his speech that China 
attaches great importance to its cooperation with Canada in the 
fields of economy, trade and science and technology. The 
Chinese government hopes that Canada can gain bigger share in 
China's foreign economic cooperation.

  [Text] Toronto, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- China and Canada signed 
agreements on the cooperation in manufacturing, designing, and 
studying program-controlled switchboards and large-scale 
integrated circuits in Toronto on 22 April. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, who was paying a visit to Canada, 
and Roy MacLaren, Canadian Minister for International Trade, 
attended the signing ceremony. 
  The four agreements signed on this day include specific 
projects decided through negotiations based on the contents and 
spirit of the first phase in the memorandum of understanding 
signed by the Chinese State Planning Commission and Canadian 
Northern Telecom last June. These projects include: building a 
data management system telecommunications switch manufacturing 
factory in Guangdong, building a very large scale integrated 
circuit chip manufacturing joint venture in Shanghai, 
establishing a very large scale integrated circuit designing 
company in Shanghai, and establishing a telecommunications 
research laboratory in Beijing University of Posts and 
Telecommunications by the Bell-Northern Research Laboratory. 
  According to the aforementioned agreements, Canadian 
Northern 
Telecom will invest a total of $130 million to $150 million in 
the next 11 years. 
  After the signing ceremony, MacLaren and Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua respectively spoke briefly. MacLaren said: These 
agreements will benefit both sides. He said: The Canadian 
Government is confident that trade and investment between Canada 
and China will expand rapidly in the years ahead and is 
determined to do its best to encourage and support such a 
partnership. 
  Zou Jiahua said: The signing of these agreements is the 
outcome of long-time efforts by entrepreneurs of the two 
countries and the enthusiastic support of their governments; it 
marks a new phase of Sino-Canadian cooperation in economy, 
trade, science, and technology. 
  He said: China attaches importance to its cooperation with 
Canada in economy, trade, science, and technology and hopes that 
Canada can gain a bigger share in China's foreign economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Toronto, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- When Roy MacLaren, 
Canadian International Trade Minister, held talks with Zou 
Jiahua, visiting Chinese State Council Vice Premier, in Toronto 
on 22 April, he said that he had just returned from a visit to 
China and that China's rapid economic development had left a 
deep impression on him. He said he was convinced Canada and 
China could become very good cooperative partners. 
  MacLaren also reaffirmed support for the restoration of 
China's status as a signatory state of GATT and for China's 
becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization. 
  Zou Jiahua said he had personally experienced the strong 
desire of the Canadian Government and personalities of Canada's 
various circles to strengthen cooperation with China in the past 
few days of his Canada visit. He said he thought the two 
countries already had the conditions for accelerating the 
development of their bilateral relations and that the 
opportunity is also very favorable. 
  MacLaren and Zou Jiahua jointly explored the prospects for 
Sino- Canadian trade and cooperation in science and technology. 
Both sides believed that, though Sino-Canadian trade and 
economic relations have enjoyed comparatively great development 
in recent years, much remains to be desired when compared with 
the actual needs and existing potentials of the two countries. 
The potentials for the two countries to expand cooperation in 
energy, transportation, hydroelectric power, communications, and 
other infrastructure fields are still very tremendous. Both 
sides discussed relevant specific issues and reached a consensus 
on a wide range of topics. 
  After their talks ended, MacLaren hosted a banquet in honor 
of Zou Jiahua and his party in the evening.

  [Text] Toronto, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua, who was paying a visit to Canada, toured the Darlington 
Nuclear Power Plant on 21 April. 
  Zou Jiahua arrived in Toronto on 20 April after visiting 
Vancouver. The Darlington Nuclear Power Plant was the first 
stop of the tour arranged for him in Toronto. Strichter, chief 
of the nuclear power plant, told Zou Jiahua that he hoped to see 
Canadian built nuclear power plants equipped with heavy-water 
reactors in China. 
  Strichter enthusiastically recommended Canada's heavy-water 
reactor technology to the Chinese guests. He said: Canada's 
heavy- water reactors are one of the world's recognized high 
technologies. Since they use natural uranium as fuel, they not 
only cost less than reactors using enriched uranium, but are 
also safer. In addition, Canada uses the parallel connection 
technology so that nuclear power plants will not have to stop 
operation while having their old nuclear fuel pellets replaced 
with new ones. Canada currently owns 22 reactors; all of them 
have adopted heavy-water reactor technology. 
  After his tour of the Darlington Nuclear Power Plant, Zou 
Jiahua was received by Ontario Province Governor Ray [name as 
received]. On the afternoon of the same day, he also visited the 
Spa Aircraft Company [name as received]. In the evening, the 
Canadian-Chinese Trade Council held a banquet in his honor.

  [Text] Toronto, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Nearly 600 Chinese 
people of various circles in the Toronto area hosted a grand 
banquet at the Royal York Hotel on the evening of 23 April, to 
welcome Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, who is currently on a 
visit to Canada. 
  Zou Jiahua delivered a speech at the banquet. He said: 
Canadian Prime Minister Chretien's treating the development of 
relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region as the major 
point of Canada's foreign policy will promote the development of 
Sino-Canadian economic relations and trade. The potential for 
developing Sino- Canadian relations is tremendous. 
  Zou Jiahua hoped that Chinese people in Canada will continue 
to play the role of a bridge promoting friendship between the 
Chinese and Canadian peoples. He also briefed those present at 
the banquet on China's domestic situation. 
  Eggleton, president of Canada's Federal Treasury Board, 
attended the banquet. In his speech he said: Canada must rely 
on all people, including the Chinese people present at the 
banquet, for its economic development; it cannot rely on only 
mayors and governors. The activities of Chinese people play a 
very important role in strengthening Sino-Canadian relations. 
Chinese people in the Toronto area are very active. This is 
one of the reasons for Toronto's success. 
  Eggleton also said the Canadian Government will seize the 
opportunity to develop Sino-Canadian relations. 
  Representatives of local Chinese people also took the floor 
at the welcoming banquet.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A top manager of the 
General Motors [GM] Automotive Components Group (ACG) said here 
today that the Government of the United States should renew 
China's most favored nation status (MFN) in June to keep 
bilateral trade on the normal track. 
  The business of U.S. enterprises in China would not be 
affected as well, said Rudi von Meister, director of China 
operations of the GM ACG in his interview with XINHUA. 
  The group will spare no effort to help China receive MFN 
status, he said, adding that a Washington-based deputy president 
of the group had kept frequent contacts with U.S. Congressmen 
and government officials, in support of China's continued 
enjoyment of MFN status. 
  If trade conflicts arose between the two countries, it would 
be possible for those U.S. companies who had invested in China 
to lose this large market with great potential, the director 
said. 
  However, von Meister was confident about prospects of 
resolving the problem, saying that China would once again get 
MFN status, and the group would expand its China business. 
  "In order to show our determination to expand investment 
here, we have brought products from all seven departments of the 
group, as well as that of our joint venture with China, to show 
in the China '94 international engine exhibition," Meister said. 
  The exhibition, whose full name is the First International 
Exhibition on Internal Combustion Engine Technology and 
Equipment, opened here today. About 70 foreign and 240 Chinese 
companies are displaying their products. 
  The GM-China joint venture--Beijing Wan Yuan-GM Automotive 
Electronic Controls Ltd, established at the end of last year, 
manufactures advanced electronic fuel injection systems for use 
in locally produced automobiles. 
  In addition, the group also cooperates with six other 
Chinese 
companies by transferring technology and training technicians 
for them. 
  To increase its presence here, Meister said, the group has 
made an overall investment plan in China. 
  According to the plan, GM ACG would establish three 
manufacturing bases in northeast China, in coastal areas of the 
southeast, and in southwest China's Sichuan Province. 
  All seven departments of the group would establish joint 
ventures with China to help the country develop the 
export-oriented automotive components industry. 
  The director disclosed that over 30 cooperative projects 
were 
under discussion between the two sides, and agreement on several 
of them would be reached within the year.

<F P=106> [Article by Yan Xuetong (7051 1331 6639): "Differences on </F>
Human Rights Between China and the United States and Their 
Causes"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher failed 
to reach an anticipated consensus on the human rights issue 
during his visit to China, and there have been a lot of 
discussions in the foreign press on this. Differences on the 
human rights issue between China and the United States are very 
great, and it is not realistic to expect that a consensus could 
be reached through just one high-level visit. 
  Differences on the concept of human rights between China and 
the United States are mainly expressed in four aspects. 
  The first is that the idea of human rights in China is 
different from that in the United States. China holds that 
human rights is a comprehensive idea and is not a purely 
political concept. In accordance with the basic principle that 
"everybody enjoys freedom of speech and belief and is free from 
fear and want" stated in the "Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights," China holds that the contents of human rights should 
include four aspects, that is, the right to subsistence, the 
right to development, political rights, and social and cultural 
rights. These rights complement each other, and no one of them 
should be emphasized at the expense of another. In a certain 
sense, the right to subsistence and the right to development are 
the basis of political rights and social and cultural rights. 
If a person's safety, clothing, and food is not guaranteed, 
that person can in no way enjoy his political rights or social 
rights. However, the United States regards human rights in a 
narrow sense as civil rights, such as freedom of speech and 
freedom of belief, which do not include the right to 
subsistence, including safety and the basic conditions for 
subsistence. According to the "Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights," civil rights are only a part of human rights and human 
rights is a more extensive concept than civil rights. However, 
the United States equates the idea of human rights with that of 
civil rights. 
  The second is that China's understanding of the scope of 
human rights is different from that of the United States. China 
has a dialectical view of the scope of human rights and holds 
that human rights is the unity of the human rights of 
individuals with those of the collective in society. The idea 
of human rights has developed from the 18th century to its third 
generation at present. The first generation of the human rights 
concept stresses civil rights. In the second generation of the 
idea, economic rights, social rights, and cultural rights were 
added. The third generation, which emerged 20 years ago, 
includes the right to protect the environment and the right to 
death. China holds that the development of the idea of human 
rights from that of the human rights of the individual alone to 
stressing the human rights of the collective is human progress, 
because damage to the human rights of the collective is an 
infringement upon the human rights of most individuals. For 
example, an encroachment upon a country's sovereignty is an 
infringement of the right to independence of each citizen of 
that country. Although some U.S. scholars have criticized the 
outdated U.S. idea of human rights, the influence of the old 
idea remains very strong, and the idea of only stressing the 
human rights of the individual still occupies a dominant 
position in the United States. Since individualism is one of the 
mainstays of U.S. ideology, the idea of the human rights of the 
collective cannot be easily accepted by the government. 
  The third is that China's understanding of human rights 
standards is different from that of the United States. China 
holds that the standard for human rights has international and 
national characteristics. As a human right, each natural human 
being should of course enjoy some identical rights, and this 
part of human rights should be based on international standards, 
for example, the right to safeguard peace, the right to oppose 
armed aggression, the right of racial equality, the right to 
oppose terror and threats, the right to protect the natural 
environment, and so on. However, because people live in 
different countries and the political system, economic level, 
history, culture, customs, and habits of different countries 
vary greatly, some human rights can only be determined according 
to the standards of the respective nations and countries and 
cannot be unified. For example, a murderer still has the right 
to subsistence in countries where the death penalty has been 
abolished, but does not have such a right in countries where the 
death penalty still exists. Since the death penalty has been 
abolished in only some U.S. states, the criminals' right to 
subsistence varies even within the country. However, the United 
States holds that human rights have only one standard, which is 
the international standard of the West. In fact, the human 
rights standards of various western countries are not the same. 
For example, Canada has accepted the "International Convention 
on Eliminating All Forms of Racial Discrimination," but the 
United States has not. 
  The fourth is that China and the United States hold 
different views on the relationship between the rights and 
obligations of human beings. China holds that the rights and 
obligations of human beings are equal. While enjoying 
legitimate rights, each individual or nation must undertake the 
obligation of not preventing another individual or nation from 
enjoying legitimate rights. If this principle is not followed, 
it is impossible to guarantee that people can enjoy human rights 
fairly. When U.S. Armed Forces sent Panamanian President 
Noriega under armed escort to the United States for trial on 3 
January 1990 under the pretext that drugs threatened U.S. 
security, the right of the United States to defend its security 
was based on depriving the Panamanians' right to defend the 
political security of their country. Therefore, China holds 
that when the human rights standard of one country differs from 
another, no country should impose its standard on another, 
otherwise this means depriving the people of that country of 
their right to make a decision on their standard for human 
rights. Such an act itself would be an infringement of human 
rights. Nevertheless, the United States does not think that the 
rights and obligations of human beings are necessarily 
intrinsically connected. The United States holds that human 
rights are endowed by nature and that God has not endowed each 
individual with equal rights and obligations. For example, the 
United States only stresses that parents have the right to give 
birth to children and to divorce, but does not talk about 
parental obligations to raise and educate children. As a 
result, the number of single parents has rapidly increased, and 
many children have lost their right to enjoy normal family life 
and to receive tertiary education. [as published] 
  Causes of differences on human rights between China and the 
United States can be classified under two categories: objective 
causes and subjective causes. Objectively speaking, China's 
culture is different from that of the United States. China's 
culture praises the collective spirit highly, while U.S. culture 
praises individualism highly. Economically speaking, China is a 
developing country and still has many difficulties in solving 
the problem of clothing and feeding its 1.2 billion people. 
However, the United States, as a developed country, has the 
material conditions for solving the problem of clothing and 
feeding its people. Politically speaking, China is a socialist 
country and the equal sharing of social wealth is one important 
political goal of the country. However, the United States is a 
capitalist country, and protecting the rapid growth of private 
capital is one of the political tasks of that country. 
Differences on the concept of human rights between China and 
the United States are to a certain extent influenced by 
objective factors. However, the cause of such sharp differences 
between China and the United States is a subjective one, that 
is, the United States has adopted an attitude not conducive to 
settling differences. 
  First of all, the United States has tried to compel China to 
accept the U.S. standard for human rights while disregarding 
international human rights standards. The United States does 
not accept the unified standard for human rights of 
international society and uses its own standard to assess the 
human rights situation of other countries. Since the United 
Nations adopted the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" in 
1948, it has formulated a series of international conventions on 
human rights. The United States has not signed the "Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights," and, moreover, it has not joined 
many of the international conventions on human rights, such as 
"The International Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination," "The International Convention on Civil and 
Political Rights," "The Convention on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights," "The International Convention on Banning and 
Punishing Crimes of Apartheid " "The Convention on Eliminating 
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," "The Convention on 
Banning Atrocities and Other Cruel, Inhumane, and Humiliating 
Treatment or Punishment," and so on. The main reason why the 
United States does not recognize international conventions on 
human rights is that the United States holds that international 
law should not override domestic law. Therefore, the United 
States does not recognize any international convention which is 
not in keeping with domestic U.S. law. The United States holds 
that domestic law is the highest law, that these laws are 
applicable to all international affairs related to the United 
States, and that the countries concerned should also follow U.S. 
law to solve issues. In solving differences on human rights 
between China and the United States, the United States has 
explicitly demanded that China carry out the administrative 
orders of the U.S. President and improve human rights according 
to U.S. standards. Therefore, China cannot accept these 
hegemonic acts of the United States. 
  Secondly, the United States has adopted double standards on 
the human rights issue. It has all along adopted double 
standards in its foreign policy by relying on its strength as a 
superpower. It has adopted different moral standards in 
accordance with the peculiarities of specific issues. For 
example, in order to develop markets in Japan as a deficit 
exists in its trade with Japan, the United States has put 
forward the necessity of protecting free trade and has opposed 
linking Japanese-U.S. political relations with economic issues. 
However, to reduce imports of products made in China as 
imbalances occur in Sino-U.S. trade, the United States has put 
forward restrictions on China's export and regards the human 
rights issue as a prerequisite for extending China's 
most-favored-nation status. In settling differences on human 
rights between China and the United States, the United States 
has also adopted double standards. For example, the United 
States has said that China letting reform-through-labor 
prisoners engage in production of export goods violates human 
rights, but the United States itself is enthusiastically engaged 
in exporting goods made in prisons. According to a report by the 
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, Higgs [xi ge 1585 2706], the 
marketing manager of Oregon State's prison industries, said that 
the state would export $3 million of prison products this year 
and would export jeans, shirts, and shorts made by prisoners to 
Japan, Italy, and other countries. California would also export 
on a trial basis similar goods to Japan and Malaysia. China, of 
course, cannot agree to the U.S. practice of adopting double 
standards on human rights. 
  Third, much of the human rights criticism in the United 
States is based on groundless rumors. In criticizing China's 
human rights situation, the United States has seldom taken facts 
into consideration, but has often used hearsay as a basis. For 
example, the United States said the Beijing No. 1 Prison Qinghe 
Socks Plant exported socks made by reform-through-labor 
prisoners to the United States, but the results of an 
investigation showed no such thing. The U.S. government 
publication FEDERAL REGISTER announced the conclusion of an 
investigation in December 1993, which confirmed that socks made 
by prisoners at that plant were not, and could not have been, 
exported to the United States. The United States says that 
under communist rule, Tibetans have lost their human rights, 
however, in fact, Tibetan serfs escaped their status as serfs 
and were put on an equal footing politically with other people 
only after liberation. China has done nothing which infringes 
upon human rights and naturally cannot accept groundless U.S. 
accusations. 
  Fourth, the United States has disagreed with China's 
rational 
views on human rights to cover up its poor human rights 
situation at home. For example, China has put forward that 
human rights should include the right to subsistence and the 
right to development. This view tallies with the fundamental 
principle of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" and has 
won universal support and the recognition of the international 
community. The "Bangkok Declaration," the "Tunis Declaration," 
and the "Pact of San Jose" have accepted this view from China. 
However, the United States disagrees that the right to 
subsistence and the right to development are part of human 
rights. The main reason why the United States has disagreed 
with China's view is that the United States, being a country 
with the best material conditions, has not been able to ensure 
the basic right to subsistence of its people. According to a 
report carried in issue No. 9 of the U.S. weekly TIME, published 
on 28 February this year, several million people are homeless in 
the United States, and the number once reached 7 million in the 
1980's. This is equivalent to the total population of Tianjin, 
the third biggest city in China at that time. In winter, 
hundreds of people die from exposure. If calculated according 
to the official standards for poverty, the number of people 
living in poverty in 1994 reached 33.7 million. One-third of 
people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance 
and do not have normal medical care. Because of serious crimes 
of violence, the personal security of Americans is not 
safeguarded. According to official U.S. statistics, 23,200 
people were murdered in 1990, and if those who were robbed and 
raped were included, a total of 2 million people were victims of 
violent crime. In order to enable the people of all the 
countries in the world to enjoy legitimate rights to 
subsistence, China cannot but insist on its own correct stand. 
In the final analysis, differences on the human rights issue 
between China and the United States are not differences of 
cultural ideas or traditions. Nor are they merely an expression 
of a hegemonic mentality. It is an attempt by the United States 
to use the human rights issue as a point to break through to 
threaten China's existing system so that China will be in a 
state of chaos or weakness.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- At least 30 Asian 
Pacific Americans were killed in 1993 as a result of homicides 
in which racial animus was suspected or proven, the National 
Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium reported today. 
  In its "Audit of Violence Against Asian Pacific Americans 
1993," the first comprehensive, nationwide, non-governmental 
survey to assess the extent of anti-Asian violence, the 
consortium found 335 reported anti-Asian incidents in 1993, or 
one incident almost every day, despite significant 
underreporting. 
  "As this report documents, incidents of anti-Asian violence 
are a problem for communities around this country," said U.S. 
Congressman Norm Mineta, calling the consortium's report "a 
telling indicator, both of the scope of this problem and how far 
we have to go to solve it." 
  "Our trade tensions with Asian nations, the shakiness of the 
economy, and racism continue to drive a search for scapegoats," 
said Mineta. "All too often, those scapegoats turn out to have 
Asian Pacific faces." 
  The consortium found the total of 335 anti-Asian incidents 
includes 153 incidents with demonstrable anti-Asian motivation 
and 182 incidents where this animus was suspected. 
  "Among the incidents where there was demonstrable anti-Asian 
animus, assault, vandalism and threat or intimidation were 
reported most commonly," said Philip Tajitsu Nash, executive 
director of the consortium. 
  The study found Asian Pacific Americans are most vulnerable 
where they reside, with commercial business sites also being 
dangerous places. 
  In one incident, Sam Nang Nhem, a 21-year-old Cambodian 
American, was killed on August 14, 1993, when Nhem and his 
family were picnicking at their home in Fall River, 
Massachusetts. 
  As Nhem was disposing of the trash in a dumper only 100 
yards 
from his apartment, he was brutally attacked by white 
neighborhood residents, the report said. Nhem, father of a 
four-month-old infant, was called a "gook," repeatedly kicked 
and finally beaten to death. 
  The Federal Bureau of Investigation states that the most 
frequently-reported anti-Asian crime is intimidation, but in 
contrast, our finding are that assault and vandalism are most 
common, said Nash. 
  "Anti-Asian violence is widely underreported," Nash said. 
"as 
of January 1994, most jurisdictions had statistics for only the 
first three months of 1993." 
  He said the majority of incident reports were collected in 
New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco while limited data was 
available from only 14 states. 
  He urged federal and local governments to thoroughly 
investigate all suspected hate crimes, promptly and completely 
collect hate crime statistics and recruit more Asian police 
officers to have an ethnically and linguistically diversed law 
enforcement force.

  [Text] Almaty, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng arrived here from Bishkek this afternoon for an official 
visit to Kazakhstan, the fourth leg of his tour of Central Asia. 
  President N.A. Nazarbayev presided over a grand ceremony at 
the airport to welcome Li, the first top Chinese leader to visit 
Kazakhstan. 
  Li has toured three other Central Asian nations, including 
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. 
  Li's entourage includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission, and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign 
Affairs Office under the State Council. 
  A written statement by the Chinese premier was released upon 
Li's arrival at the airport. 
  Li, describing China and Kazakhstan as "joined by the same 
mountains and rivers along a common border of over 1,700 
kilometers," said that the ancient "silk road" was written into 
the annals of Sino-Kazakhstan friendship and today's Euro-Asia 
continental bridge closely links the two peoples. 
  After the establishment of diplomatic relations, such ties 
have gained satisfying expansion, Li noted, saying that 
President Nazarbayev's visit to China last year "made important 
contributions for the promotion of friendship between the two 
peoples." 
  According to Li the two countries have wide prospects for 
developing bilateral relations and the Chinese Government 
attaches great importance to the growth of its relations with 
Kazakhstan. "There is a sincere hope to develop a long-term, 
stable, and friendly relationship of mutual beneficial 
cooperation," he added. 
  Li also said he expected his visit will help promote 
friendship, expand cooperation in all fields and boost bilateral 
ties to a new high.

  [Text] Almaty, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng and Kazakhstan President N.A. Nazarbayev signed 
a border agreement between the two countries here today. 
  After the signing ceremony, Li called the agreement "a 
historic document," which defines the over-1,700-kilometer-long 
border between the two countries in a legal form. 
  This, he said, would serve to boost the development of the 
existing bilateral relations of friendship. 
  Nazarbayev said the agreement symbolizes a long-term good- 
neighborly relationship between the two countries. 
  He expected the Sino-Kazakhstan border to be one of peace 
and 
friendship. 
  Also signed were an agreement on China providing loans to 
Kazakhstan, notes to be exchanged on China presenting a batch of 
materials to Kazakhstan, and a summary of talks on developing 
international railway transportation between the Chinese 
Ministry of Railways and Kazakhstan's Ministry of Communications.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov today described Russian-Chinese 
relations as a priority in the country's foreign policy. 
  Speaking in the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian 
Parliament) Panov said his ministry was implementing plans to 
strengthen bilateral ties with China and bring Russian-Chinese 
relations to a level of constructive partnership. 
  Panov, who is in charge of Asian affairs and a former 
ambassador to South Korea, dwelt at length on problems in 
Russian-Chinese relations, cautioning about the massive Chinese 
immigration into Russia. 
  He noted that a current agreement drastically cuts the 
number 
of people entitled to a visa-free entry to Russia. 
  In the light of the acute border issue which exists between 
the two, a joint Russian-Chinese commission is now actively 
working to resolve questions on ownership of disputed islands on 
border rivers. 
  Panov also told the State Duma that talks are in progress to 
agree on cutting the strength of Russian and Chinese troops in 
border areas. 
  He said he believed the infrastructure of the 
Russian-Chinese 
border should be further developed to promote trade and economic 
cooperation, adding that the turnover of border trade totalled 
2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  The deputy minister also stressed the need to help the 
modernization of Chinese industrial enterprises built with 
Soviet assistance in the 1950s.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Zhou Dehui (0719 1795 1920): "PRC, </F>
Russia To Finalize Agreement Next Month on Disarmament Within 
100 Km of the Border"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (LIEN HO PAO)--Russia and mainland 
China are vigorously exchanging views on the issue of border 
disarmament. According to the tentative idea, both sides will 
reduce the number of their troops and weapons within 100 km all 
along the Sino-Russian border. Antiaircraft missiles and naval 
vessels are not included in the disarmament list, however. 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov said that, if mainland 
China and Russia reach an agreement, then it will be the first 
disarmament accord in the Asian region, which will symbolize 
another peak of friendship between the two countries. 
  Panov and the Russian General Staff Department addressed the 
issue of the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border and the 
level of armament there. If mainland China reaches a 
disarmament agreement with Russia in the north, it will redeploy 
its armed forces, which will, in turn, affect its southward 
development and the security of the Taiwan Strait. 
  Panov pointed out: The Sino-Russian border is 4,300 km long, 
of which 3,700 km is delimited by rivers. Because the rivers 
frequently change course, territorial disputes have arisen. For 
example, each the two countries is still sticking to its own 
views on the ownership of three small islands in Heilongjiang 
and cannot reach a final conclusion. The Russian Government has 
proposed a "joint development" program and wishes to use 
economic means to solve the political problem. Beijing has 
shown interest in the proposal and both sides will discuss it 
further. 
  In discussing the issue of border troops, Panov said: 
Mainland China and Russia are vigorously discussing border 
disarmament. If we reach an agreement, it will be a historic 
precedent. 
  The Russian General Staff Department said: When Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin visits Beijing in late May, it is hoped 
that the two countries will hold the 12th round of the 
disarmament conference and will reach a final agreement of 
disarmament so as to present it to Chernomyrdin as a gift for 
his visit to mainland China.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Chou Te-hui (0719 1795 1920): "Russia </F>
Supplies Beijing With an Arms Sales List"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (LIEN HO PAO)--According to Russia's 
General Staff Headquarters, Russia has recently given mainland 
China a list of 44 advanced weapons for the latter's reference 
in purchasing weapons. On the list are Sukhoi Su-30K and MiG-31 
fighters, air defense missile systems, and so on. 
  Russia-mainland China military cooperation has attracted 
great attention. In the face of great concern, Russia's General 
Staff Headquarters, Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, and 
other departments concerned broke the silence by proposing plans 
and guidelines for arms sales at a congressional hearing on 
China issues. 
  Antonchev [an dong xue ke fu 1344 2639 7185 0668 1133), 
representative from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, 
said: "According to the latest statistics, Russia owes $1.5 
billion to mainland China, of which $1 billion is loans and $500 
million results from the change in the form of clearing foreign 
exchange. The Russian Government offered to 'pay off the debts 
with weapons.' Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will 
discuss the matter with the mainland hierarchy during his visit 
to Beijing in late May." 
  As disclosed by the Russian General Staff Headquarters, 
following Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit to the 
mainland in October last year, the two countries signed an 
agreement on long- term military cooperation. It is certain 
that over the next two years, the two countries will have 
frequent exchange visits by military delegations and intensify 
their cooperation in military and high-tech fields. 
  The Russian General Staff Headquarters also said that after 
selling 26 Sukhoi Su-27 fighters to mainland China last year, 
the Russian military has recently sent a list of 44 advanced 
weapons to mainland China for its reference in purchasing 
weapons, adding that among the main items on the list are five 
kinds of new fighters: The Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30K, the MiG-29 
and MiG-31, and the TY-22M3 [preceding term published in Roman 
letters and Arabic numbers]; and the "Arrow"-10M [preceding 
three-character term published in Roman letter and Arabic 
numbers] and "Needle" air defense missile systems. 
  However, the General Staff Headquarters stressed that the 
weapons sold to the mainland are mainly defensive. Strategic 
weapons such as rockets and nuclear weapons are not on the arms 
sales list, they added.

<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified member of Moscow Radio </F>
International delegation to PRC by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] A delegation from Moscow Radio International 
visited China from 5 to 12 April. A protocol on cooperation 
between Moscow Radio International and China Radio International 
was signed in Beijing on 11 April. The document includes 10 
articles, one of which provides that each side is to fund the 
broadcasting of its programs via satellite communications to 
ground receiver stations in the capital of its partner. Our 
guests also traveled to Shanghai. During its stay in Beijing, 
the delegation was interviewed by a correspondent from the 
Russian section of China Radio International. Listen to this 
interview. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We know 
that during your visit, our radio stations signed documents of 
cooperation. How do you assess the prospects of our future 
cooperation? 
  [Delegation member] We have been cooperating for four years 
now, and we mutually extend the use of our transmitters. We 
have signed an agreement on extended mutual cooperation. We 
have also discussed still broader cooperation as well as 
exchanges of specialists, programs, and groups of journalists of 
various television and radio programs. The things outlined in 
the protocol signed today are the next step, but we have not 
stopped here. We have discussed meeting in Moscow this October 
or November to sign an even broader protocol. We have already 
determined the direction of our activity, and will sign [word 
indistinct] in Moscow this year. We are very satisfied with the 
rate in which our cooperation is growing from year to year. 
This helps both Chinese and Russian journalists and engineers, 
and constitutes mutual fertilization out of which new ideas and 
advances emerge. 
  The cooperation between Moscow Radio International and China 
Radio International in the technical field, and especially the 
allowing of mutual use of both countries' transmitters for 
broadcasting, is an important aspect of our work and [words 
indistinct] cooperation. But I believe a different side of the 
cooperation is no less important, and maybe even the most 
substantial. I am referring to the exchange of specialists, of 
groups of journalists, and of radio programs--in other words, 
fields in which cooperation is obvious. Cooperation in the 
technical field is important and essential; we simply could not 
conduct radio programs without it. However, this cooperation is 
invisible to many, and a limited number of Chinese and Russian 
experts know about it. 
  [Correspondent] One does not hear about it. 
  [Delegation member] Yes, that is correct. But when people 
visit a country themselves, Chinese journalists coming to Russia 
or Russian journalists going to China, when they see these 
changes with their own eyes and the way people relate to them, 
the upshot is that the most interesting radio programs are then 
broadcast. These programs introduce the life of a different 
country and different people, which is precisely what 
constitutes a bridge of mutual understanding between people who 
begin to understand each other deeper and better. I would like 
to focus your attention on this. Unfortunately, certain areas 
and points of cooperation in the sphere of exchange of 
specialists have not yet been included in the protocol signed 
today. But we hope, and maybe are even certain--and this 
certainty comes from both Russia and China being interested-- 
that we will certainly broaden and renew our connections as 
regards the exchange of journalists. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said on Monday [25 April] that despite 
the failure of his talks with the Ukrainian side on the disputed 
Black Sea Fleet the dialogue must continue at a higher level. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, the Russian 
minister 
said that it is pointless to begin a new round of talks unless 
top level officials agree to take part. In his opinion, the 
talks should involve the first vice-prime ministers or even the 
prime ministers of the two former Soviet Republics. 
  Grachev told reporters that at his last week's talks in 
Sevastopol Ukraine set forth unacceptable conditions including 
joint location of the Ukrainian Navy and the Black Sea Fleet in 
Sevastopol. This contradicts the agreement reached by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid 
Kravchuk earlier this month, he pointed out. 
  Ukraine suggested that Russian Black Sea Fleet ships should 
enter and leave their temporary bases through two-mile sea 
corridors and request permission three days in advance. 
  In addition, it also proposed to regulate the navigation of 
Russian warships in Ukrainian territorial waters and the 
economic zone by Ukrainian laws instead of international acts, 
Grachev said. 
  Before the future higher-level talks, the minister stressed, 
it is necessary to agree to some navy terms in order to rule out 
any misinterpretations in the future. 
  He said Ukraine has been considering the term "navy" as 
including only ships and other navy vessels. However, he noted, 
in reality the navy includes, apart from ships, navy aviation, 
marines, bases and logistics units. 
  "The Navy is not only what floats but also what provides 
support on the ground. The division of ships and vessels of the 
Black Sea Fleet is only one tenth of the implementation of the 
decision on the division of the fleet on the whole, only its 
first stage," Grachev stated. 
  In Kiev, Kravchuk said in a Sunday TV program that the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet can be resolved only with the 
participation of the Russian and Ukrainian top leaders. 
  In his opinion, the long crisis over the fleet can be 
overcome by leasing Sevastopol to Russia for a long period of 
time as a base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet "on the terms, 
generally accepted in the world." He cited as an example 
Russia's agreement with Kazakhstan over the Baikonur Space 
Center. 
  The talks between Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers in 
Sevastopol last week on a gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet 
problems ended virtually fruitlessly. 
  Grachev refused to sign any agreements due to an 
"unconstructive position" taken by the Ukrainian side on the 
main (according to Grachev) issue: bases for separate 
stationing of the Russian and Ukrainian Black Sea Fleets. 
  "We cannot agree that the headquarters of the two states' 
fleets should be based in the same city," Grachev told reporters. 
  Despite the fact that no documents were signed on the Black 
Sea Fleet, the sides reached a principled agreement on 
parameters of its division. 
  Under the agreement, 669 out of 833 ships or vessels are to 
be handed over to Russia, while 164 to Ukraine. Taking into 
account earlier understandings, Russia is to pay compensation to 
Ukraine.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said today that he was optimistic about the prospects of 
the country's social, political and economic situation. 
  In an interview with the German magazine "DER SPIEGEL", 
Yeltsin voiced his confidence that the signing of a memorandum 
of the civic peace accord scheduled for Thursday would provide a 
basis for a civic consensus in Russia. 
  The civic peace accord was proposed by Yeltsin in late 
February following a political amnesty, under which his main 
opponents including former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and 
former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were released. 
  The draft accord has been "fundamentally amended" since 
Yeltsin consulted with the leaders of political parties and 
various republics or regions, according to the presidential 
chief-of-staff Sergey Filatov. 
  Yeltsin said that the economy could be stabilized in 1994. 
In the past two months inflation had stood at eight to 10 
percent, much lower than in the same period last year, and the 
decline in production slowed down and the budget deficit shrank, 
he said. 
  Meanwhile, Yeltsin said whether he would run in the 1996 
presidential election would depend on how the situation will 
develop, but for now he would stick to his earlier decision not 
to participate. 
  "If I see that the situation improves in Russia, I will be 
able to leave with clear conscience and raised head..if the 
difficulties are not overcome, then it will be necessary to 
think everything over with regard to a new situation. 
Meanwhile, I stick to my earlier decision," he said. 
  He said that neither Rutskoy nor "ultra-nationalist" 
Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy would have a chance to become the president. But 
he expressed deep concern about a possible vacuum in the top 
leadership. 
  He said he is trying to find out who will be serious 
contenders for presidency in 1996. 
  Yeltsin said he would not put his "presidential party" in a 
special place because "the president should be responsible for 
the whole nation instead of the supporters of his party". 
  Yeltsin also talked about the situation in Bosnia. He said 
that air strikes can only make the situation worse and the war 
endless. He called for peace negotiations in solving the Bosnian 
conflict. 
  Asked about his attitude towards NATO's "partnership for 
peace" plan, Yeltsin said that it is a "specific proposal", 
although "some things have yet to be cleared up". 
  He said that Russia, which has "an army as big as NATO", was 
ready to sign the document. But he would also like to sign an 
additional protocol with NATO to settle "a whole range of key 
issues". 
  There are also technical problems, including different 
weapons systems which need to be unified, he added. 
  Yeltsin believed that Russia would always be a great power, 
as demonstrated in its tradition, history and culture.

Chinese action to help implement relevant U.N. resolutions on 
the Arab-Israeli conflict and on the Middle East peace issue. 
  Al-Lawzi also asked the Chinese side to import phosphate,

  [Text] Amman, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Jordan's lower house 
speaker Tahir al-Masri met here today with Wang Zhaoguo, vice 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  They discussed bilateral ties and the Middle East peace 
process. 
  In his speech at the meeting, which was also attended by the 
CPPCC delegation led by Wang and a number of Jordanian 
parliamentarians, Masri stressed that Jordan will never be 
content unless a just and comprehensive peace is realized in the 
region and the rights of the Arab and Palestinian people are 
guaranteed. 
  He also expressed regret over the fact that Israel and the 
U.S. -- one of the two sponsors of the Middle East peace process 
-- have not made enough efforts to realize a durable peace in 
the region. 
  The speaker said that Jordan will do its utmost to safeguard 
Arab rights. 
  On the democratization process, Masri said that Jordan has 
embarked on a democratic process, which includes all aspects 
although it is not perfect. "Jordan will not copy Western 
democracy, but will introduce one which suits its own tradition 
and culture," he noted. 
  Masri complained that although the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 
ended long ago, sanctions against Iraq have been increasing with 
one UN resolution following another. Despite all this, Masri 
said, Iraq has accepted all of the demands raised with it, 
including some which are harmful to it. 
  As a result of the sanctions against Iraq, Jordan's only 
port 
of Aqaba has been blocked by U.S.-led Western naval forces, 
inflicting heavy losses on the kingdom, he said. 
  The speaker appealed to China as well as other countries to 
make efforts for lifting the blockade. He asked Wang to convey 
the request of Jordan's lower house to China's National People's 
Congress and the CPPCC. 
  In his speech, Wang briefed the hosts on the enormous 
achievements China has made in the reform and economic boom in 
the past 15 years. 
  On the Middle East issue, Wang said that China has 
consistently supported the just cause of the Palestinian people 
and appreciated highly Jordan's endeavor to realize a just and 
durable peace in the region. 
  As one of the five UN Security Council permanent members, 
Wang noted, China will continue to make unswerving efforts to 
push forward the ongoing Middle East peace process. 
  Wang expressed profound sympathy with Jordan for its heavy 
losses resulted from the Aqaba blockade. He said China supports 
Jordan's fair and rational demands and hopes the blockade will 
be lifted as early as possible. 
  On the Iraqi issue, Wang said China has made clear its stand 
in the discussions at the UN Security Council. He expressed 
sympathy with the Iraqi people who have suffered dearly as a 
result of the international sanctions imposed on the country. 
  Wang, who arrived here Sunday [24 April] heading a 10-member 
CPPCC delegation, has met with Jordan's upper house speaker 
Ahmad al-Lawzi [spelling of name as received] and Prime Minister 
'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali. He will also meet with Jordan's 
Minister of Planning Ziyad Fariz and visit a tourist attraction 
in Jerash, 44 kilometers north of Amman.

  [Text] Dhaka, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The bangladesh Foreign 
Ministry stated here today that the recent visit to China by 
Foreign Minister A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman is "very successful" 
and several major achievements were made during his China tour 
from April 13-17. 
  Foreign Secretary Mufleh R. Osmany made the statement at a 
regular bi-weekly news briefing to journalists from local and 
overseas media. 
  According to the spokesman, Chinese Premier Li Peng has 
accepted an invitation from Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda 
Zia to visit this South Asian country in the second half of this 
year. 
  The Chinese side has agreed to buy more Bangladeshi goods in 
order to reduce trade imbalance and to continue to extend 
economic cooperation, he said. 
  China has also agreed to finance the construction of the 
Rupsa Bridge in Khulna in southwest Bangladesh, which is likely 
to cost more than 100 million U.S. dollars, he noted. 
  During the foreign minister's stay in Beijing, China 
reiterated its stance that the water-sharing dispute between 
Bangladesh and India should be settled through bilateral 
negotiation, the spokesman said. 
  He added that Bangladesh has also been firm to settle the 
dispute through bilateral talks. 
  At the news conference, the spokesman strongly condemned 
Bosnian Serbs' killings and bloodshed activities in Gorazde and 
he called on the Organization of Islamic Conference to take 
immediate steps for deterring "the continued Serbian aggression". 
  Referring to the slow pace of the repatriation of Myanmar 
[Burmese] refugees from Bangladesh, the spokesman said the 
government is now reviewing its process as well as the country's 
cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) on the issue. 
  "They are Myanmar nationals, and sooner or later they have 
to 
go back," he stressed, insisting that Bangladesh has the 
privilege to solve the problem which has cost the country 
enormous resources and involved some 700 personnel specially 
assigned to deal with the matter.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gu Wanming (7357 8001 2494)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
investigation and study tour of Guangdong Province, Li Tieying, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state 
councillor, and minister in charge of the State Commission For 
Economic Restructuring, pointed out: Establishing a modern 
enterprise system is the correct method for reform of 
state-owned enterprises -- it signifies that enterprise reform 
is shifting from the government delegating powers to enterprises 
and letting enterprises retain more profits, to establishing a 
new enterprise system. This has great significance for 
improving the management of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises. All localities should make positive efforts to 
seek new ways to effectively practice the public ownership 
system and should study the state economy's microeconomic 
organizational forms under socialist market economic conditions. 
  From 12 to 20 April, Li Tieying conducted investigations and 
studies in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Foshan, and Zhanjiang 
cities on how to experiment with establishing a modern 
enterprise system. He heard reports by concerned departments of 
provincial and city authorities on enterprise reform; inspected 
some enterprises; and held a special meeting attended by 
comrades in charge of Guangdong Province and various cities, 
secretaries of party committees of concerned departments, and 
factory directors (managers) of some enterprises, to seek their 
opinions. 
  The central authorities' various macroeconomic reform 
measures are being smoothly implemented in Guangdong, and the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and government have done a 
great deal to implement these measures. Compared with the same 
period last year, the value of the province's sold industrial 
products increased 18.6 percent in the first quarter of this 
year, financial revenue increased 48.8 percent, total retail 
sales of consumer products increased 33 percent, and total 
exports increased 96.1 percent. Li Tieying held that 
Guangdong's economic situation was good. He said: Although some 
practical difficulties and problems have cropped up in the 
course of development, most of them are just problems pertaining 
to development -- they are temporary. The central authorities 
are currently taking measures to solve some of these problems 
that are common in all localities. Guangdong has placed great 
importance on enterprise reform. All the cities I have visited 
have seriously studied and boldly practiced enterprise reform 
measures. They have conducted a great deal of studies on reform 
of the property right system, social insurance system, and 
enterprises' three systems [labor, personnel, and wage 
distribution system] as well as on preserving and increasing the 
value of state assets, and on improving and injecting new 
vitality into enterprise management. 
  Li Tieying pointed out: Enterprises experimenting with 
establishing a modern enterprise system should primarily study 
ways to improve the enterprise legal person system; decide the 
main investment channels for enterprises' state assets; decide 
enterprises' legal person organizational form; establish a 
scientific enterprise management structure; reform the 
enterprise labor and personnel system; improve the enterprise 
financial and accounting system; enable party organizations of 
enterprises to serve as a political nucleus; and improve 
enterprises' trade union work and democratic management by 
workers. In addition, they should study ways to establish a 
macroeconomic regulation and control system, social insurance 
system, unified market system, and socialized service system in 
line with the market economy, in order to organically integrate 
macroeconomic reform with enterprises' microeconomic reform. 
  Li Tieying stressed: We should strengthen leadership over 
the work on experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise 
system, and should establish a responsibility system for 
carrying out the work. Major comrades in charge of concerned 
localities and departments should personally take charge of the 
work of the 100 enterprises selected to experiment with 
establishing a modern enterprise system under the State 
Council's guidance; well-trained personnel should be assigned to 
assume specific responsibilities. All responsibilities should be 
affixed to individuals in charge, and they should ensure that 
work is carried out in a down-to-earth manner. Li Tieying said: 
The term "modern enterprise system" is a general term for an 
enterprise system in which enterprises' property rights, powers, 
and responsibility are clearly defined; government 
administration is separated from enterprise management; and 
scientific enterprise management is practiced. A modern 
enterprise system may be implemented in various specific forms. 
All localities should act in light of their local conditions, 
proceed from the actual situation, and make use of beneficial 
experiences from abroad while exploring new ways to establish a 
modern enterprise system. As reform continues to deepen, we 
should continue to change the way we think, and must not be 
bound by our current understanding of things, which may impede 
our efforts to deepen reform. Li Tieying added: In 
experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system, we 
should step up investigation and study work, and sum up 
experience regularly. Experimental work should be carried out 
steadily and in an active and down-to-earth manner -- we must 
not rush headlong into mass action or do work just for form's 
sake. Currently, we are experimenting with establishing a modern 
enterprise system; we should endeavor to achieve some results. 
This is not the time to promote the system in all enterprises. 
The term "modern enterprise system" is scientifically defined; 
we should not regard the system as a basket and throw everything 
into it because this will tarnish the system's reputation. For 
enterprises experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise 
system, we should do a good fundamental job -- we should 
transform their operating mechanisms; improve their internal 
management; improve their efficiency; improve their 
profitability; and carry out the various economic policies and 
macroeconomic regulation, control, and reform measures adopted 
by the central authorities, in order to lay a good foundation 
for the next-step reform.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Beijing Tightens Control Over External </F>
Communications to Prevent Foreign Businessmen From Leaking State 
Secrets"] 
  [Text] As an increasing number of foreign businessmen have 
come to the mainland to invest, in order to prevent them from 
gathering information on the mainland in the name of investment, 
the State Security Ministry has intensified supervision over the 
external communications of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  According to sources, in recent years, some intelligence 
agents from other countries have gone to the Chinese mainland 
especially to collect information by using investment and 
business opportunities, and this has caused great losses to 
China. In order to prevent leakage of state secrets, the 
departments concerned in mainland China have been intensively 
monitoring and eavesdropping on the telephones, faxes, and 
correspondence of foreign-funded enterprises. At the same time, 
they are also keeping watch on the external communications of 
people who have access to various types of state secrets in 
important state organs. At present, when mainland officials 
discuss confidential issues, they must try to avoid being tapped 
by other people. 
  The sources said: After Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang and bank 
official Tian Ye were found guilty by the courts, the relevant 
mainland authorities tightened up the management of confidential 
documents in various state organs. People are strictly 
prohibited from leaking any documents to outsiders classified as 
"top secret," "confidential," and "secret," and even some 
internally circulated documents that are not classified as state 
secrets. The scope of control has been expanded. If it is 
discovered that any government officials have connections to 
external communications, they become surveillance targets of the 
State Security Ministry. 
  The sources also said that people have found that many 
international telephone calls have been tapped. When double 
voices are heard on the telephone, this indicates that the 
phones has been tapped. Some mainland officials now do not dare 
to discuss important and sensitive matters using telephones or 
faxes and prefer to talk about such things in personal meetings. 
  As a number of mainland people have been sentenced to stiff 
prison terms because they revealed state secrets to Hong Kong 
reporters in the past few years, people who have access to 
"state secrets" are very careful about coming into contact with 
people from outside the mainland. They are afraid that talking 
with people from outside the mainland may lead to the leakage of 
"state secrets" and that they may thus be jailed.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Zhu Daian (2612 0108 1344): "Advanced </F>
Security System To Be Installed in Potala Palace"] 
  [Text] Lhasa, 5 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A responsible 
official from the office in charge of repairing Potala Palace 
said in an interview that the installation of a security system 
using modern safety technology had begun recently. 
  Potala Palace, which was built more than 1,000 years ago, is 
famous as the palace at the highest altitude in the world. 
Being the crystallization of the wisdom of the Tibetan people 
and the gem of Chinese culture, Potala Palace is the key object 
of protection by the state and the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  The safety technology and the security project is a new item 
in Potala Palace's full-scale repair and maintenance project, 
which has been going on for the last five years. The project 
includes an automatic system to fight fires, an automatic 
burglar detection system, a television monitoring system, and a 
command and communications system. The equipment is all 
technologically advanced by international standards. After the 
completion of the project, the screens in the control center 
will show the safety conditions throughout the palace, and the 
systems will perform the automatic fire fighting and burglar 
detection functions. 
  It has been learned that the safety and protection project 
in 
Potala Palace is costing approximately 3 million yuan, and it is 
expected that it will be officially put into operation in early 
August.

  [Text] The Reformist camp within China's ruling Communist 
Party is to launch sweeping celebrations to mark paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping's 90th birthday in a bid to further advance 
their capitalistic economic reforms. The August celebrations 
are also designed by reformist officials to boost their position 
in internal fighting in the post-Deng era, following fears for 
the health of the reclusive leader. 
  The moves to promote the patriarch's status in party and 
Chinese history are additionally aimed at offsetting the 
increasing influences of the late Chairman Mao. A high-profile 
team led by Politburo member and propaganda chief Ding Guanggen, 
who is also Mr Deng's bridge partner, was recently set up to 
co-ordinate a series of birthday activities, according to 
Chinese sources. For the first time, official ceremonies on Mr 
Deng's birthday will be held during the day. And autographed 
albums and other souvenirs of the senior leader will be issued 
in the coming months. 
  Meanwhile, the largest documentary ever made on Mr Deng is 
being shot by Central Newsreels and Documentary Film Studios 
under the supervision of Mr Ding and the propaganda department 
of the party's central committee. Mr Ding, in an internal 
speech, said the party central committee will provide enough 
cash to fund the shooting of documentaries for Mr Deng and Peng 
Zhen, another senior retired leader, despite attempts by many 
party elders to get cash for their own documentaries. 
  Beijing sources said the liberal wing within the leadership 
has been preparing for the Campaign to offset the late Chairman 
Mao's influence in China's politics. Some reformist officials 
thought Mr Deng's paramount authority was abating following last 
year's Mao frenzy, organised by leftists to mark the centenary 
of the birthday of the great helmsman. 
  Reformists wanted to capitalise on Mr Deng's 90th birthday 
in 
August in the same way. "They thought Deng Xiaoping's 90th 
birthday is the last good and important occasion for them to 
campaign for liberal ideas in China," one source said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China has launched a 
drive to root out the spreading phenomenon of paid news coverage 
among the press community. 
  The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) issued a circular recently urging 
unremitting efforts by party organizations to educate 
journalists on press ethics. 
  The circular says that the recent case of illegal nationwide 
fund raising by the Beijing Great Wall Machinery and Electronics 
Industry Corporation, fanned by false reports by some bribed 
journalists, revealed the extent of the problem. 
  Some correspondents had seriously disrupted the economic 
order and harmed the interests of the state and people by faking 
news stories in favor of the sponsoring parties, according to 
the circular. 
  The circular calls for strengthening the "development of 
ethics of the press community". 
  Over the past decade, more Chinese journalists have from 
time 
to time wandered astray from their professional ethics to write 
advertising in the guise of news after receiving various 
benefits. 
  A standard package of benefits in covering promotional 
events 
include a "small gift", a "red paper bag" with cash and a 
banquet after the press conference. 
  The practice reached its climax in 1992. A few reporters 
could not be attracted to a press conference if they were unable 
to receive similar benefits. Some crew members from television 
stations went even further. 
  It is in such situations that some reporters have succumbed 
to corrupt practices. 
  But the circular gives credit to the overall quality of the 
press circle, saying that journalists have made outstanding 
contributions to the country's reforms and opening up. 
  The unhealthy tendency was halted after the Propaganda 
Department released a circular last year, banning all "paid news 
coverage" and "sales of book numbers", codes that represent 
official permission to publish, according to the latest circular. 
  The circular says it is imperative to use the "Great Wall" 
case to educate reporters and editors nationwide. 
  It also demands that party committees in various localities 
conduct an inspection into how the circular's guidelines against 
paid journalism are being implemented. 
  Press units should formulate rules and regulations to 
prevent 
future occurrences of this practice and should be subject to the 
supervision of the public, says the circular.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China has made major 
breakthroughs in reforming the state's pension, unemployment and 
injury insurance system and has broadly extended its coverage. 
  According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued 
here 
jointly today by the Labor Ministry and the Statistics Bureau, 
some 600 cities and counties nationwide had by the end of last 
year taken up reform of the pension calculation system, 
involving a total of 25 million workers. 
  Some 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities 
have 
put their pensions under a unified provincial plan, in which the 
pensions are shared on the provincial scale. 
  Township enterprises in 1,900 cities and counties across the 
country have introduced unified social management of retirement 
pay, which better protects the interests of the retired workers. 
  To lighten the burden of enterprises, over 1,000 cities and 
counties now distribute pensions through banks or social 
insurance institutions, a practice common internationally. 
  According to the bulletin, the reform of the industrial 
injury insurance system, focusing on centralized administration 
and socialized management, is drawing nearer completion. The 
reform has covered over 500 cities and counties in 19 provinces 
and autonomous regions, involving 11 million people. 
  Labor Ministry Spokesman Liu Guanxue told reporters today 
that the vigorous reform of the unemployment insurance system 
has produced good results. A total of 530,000 enterprises and 
79 million working staff have benefited from the reform. 
  According to Liu, China had collected 1.63 billion yuan for 
the insurance fund by the end of 1993. Some 930 million yuan 
had been used on the unemployed. A total of 1.03 million 
jobless people had received unemployment relief aid from various 
labor departments. 
  According to the release, some 5.5 million women workers 
from 
300 cities and counties have been placed under the protection of 
the maternity insurance which effectively boosted the employment 
of women.

"Boldly Make Creations in the Course of Reform--Studying 
Comrade Xiaoping's Expositions on Creative Practice"] 
  [Text] Abstract: There have been some experiments and 
attempts in taking our own road, inheriting and developing 
Marxism with new thinking and concepts, making explorations in 
practice, and starting brand new undertakings. This is called 
creative practice, the highest level of human practice. It is 
the most essential characteristic of the concept of Marxist 
practice. 
  Experiments are the main form for promoting and deepening 
reform and for creative practice. 
  There are risks in creative practice. Reform is a new thing, 
as is creative practice, where there is no ready experience to 
follow. There is no perfect policy, method, or scheme and 
mistakes are unavoidable. Creative practice is bound to 
encounter obstructions which may not be accepted by the public. 
Creative practice, which means developing and exploring 
practice, itself contains high efficiency. 
  Only with creative thinking can we have creative practice. 
We should uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again 
practice, and again knowledge; constantly carry out "ideological 
reform and emancipation"; and always maintain ideological 
vitality. This is the scientific course of creative thinking. 
[end abstract] 
  Taking our own road, boldly breaking a new path, and 
creating 
through practice -- This is an important theme which runs 
through the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping." In resolving any problem, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
stressed on numerous occasions that we should take our own road, 
using new methods and new language, rather than stick to old 
conventions, mechanically copying the models of our predecessors 
or taking the beaten path. This is a very important conclusion 
drawn after profoundly summing up the basic experience of 
Chinese revolution and construction. 
<H8>  I. </H8>
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The success of the Chinese 
revolution is result of Comrade Mao Zedong integrating Marxism- 
Leninism with China's reality and taking our own road. While 
carrying out construction today, we should also integrate 
Marxism- Leninism with China's reality and take our own road." 
(p 95) He repeatedly emphasized: We should firmly stick to 
this point which conforms to our reality. The experience of 
other countries can only be taken as reference. The problems of 
the world cannot be settled by applying one set model. The key 
lies in learning through doing and making explorations in 
practice. "If we stick to conventions or follow the beaten 
path, without making any experiments or attempts, including 
certain setbacks, we will definitely not be able to attain our 
strategic objective." (p 318) Besides maintaining that a 
country should creatively take its own road and start a new 
undertaking in its revolution and construction, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping also urged all localities and fronts to have their own 
creations. In "the gist of the talks made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and Shanghai," he enthusiastically encouraged and spoke 
highly of "the rich experience gained every day in building 
Chinese- style socialism. There is a lot of experience. Viewed 
from the newspapers and material from various provinces, they 
have their own characteristics. This is good. We must have 
creativity." He reminded us that reform and opening up face new 
emerging things and experience can only be created by ourselves. 
He was fond of listening to and using "new concepts." He 
criticized the lengthy articles and speeches, which repeated the 
contents and failed to use new terms. Obviously, 
mechanically copying the experience of others, sticking to old 
conventions, and repeating the words of others are tantamount to 
repetitive practice and cyclic practice. But creative practice 
means taking our own road, inheriting and developing Marxism 
with new thinking and concepts, making explorations in practice, 
and starting brand new undertakings, including some experiments 
and attempts. Such creative practice, which is the highest 
level of human practice, has the most essential characteristic 
of the concept of Marxist practice. Only by constantly creating 
can revolution and construction continuously develop. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping used succinct language to strictly distinguish 
between creative practice and repetitive practice, which is of 
great significance to reform and construction. 
<H8>  II. </H8>
  Experiment, an important means for promoting and 
deepening reform, is the practice of creating and exploring. To 
create, it is necessary to boldly and resolutely experiment. 
Reform, as a creative practice, must have its own unique form. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping regarded experiment as reform and the 
main form of creative practice. He said: "Reform and 
opening up constitute a big experiment," "which cannot be found 
in books." "In a sense, what we are doing now are all 
experiments." 
  In other words, experiment is the basic and main form of 
reform, which is the most realistic creative practice. This is 
the case judged from both the macroscopic and microscopic 
viewpoints. The specific problems encountered in reform should 
all be resolved through experiments. For instance, there were 
no securities or stock markets in traditional socialism. Can we 
introduce such a thing? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's attitude is to 
allow observance and resolutely carry out experiments. He said 
that the comprehensive reform of China's economic structure has 
just started. When we have the general orientation and 
principles, it is necessary to further formulate specific rules 
and regulations in the course of the experiments. If the 
aforementioned exposition refers to a specific thing such as 
reform and opening up, which is distinctive, the following two 
expositions are of general and universal significance. The 
first one is: "No matter what we do, there must be a person who 
first makes an experiment and breaks a new path." In other 
words, to create and blaze new trails in whatever we do, 
it is necessary to experiment and there must be a person who 
makes the first attempt. Experiment is the main form for 
promoting and deepening reform and also for creative 
practice. The other one is: "No quarreling, boldly 
experiment, and break a new path." No quarreling is one of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's innovations. Instead of quarreling 
worthlessly over a matter, the most important and fundamental 
thing is to seize the opportunity to practice, create, and 
experiment. While carrying out bold experiments, we should seek 
unity of thinking and start a new undertaking. Hence, he 
always encouraged us to boldly and resolutely experiment. 
<H8>  III. </H8>
  There are risks in creation which might lead to 
mistakes and be unacceptable to the public. Nevertheless, facts 
will eventually prove that creative practice will turn out 
revolutionary effects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a penetrating 
analysis in this regard, including three important expositions. 
First, there are risks in creative practice. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "Reform is China's second revolution. 
Despite the risks, it is a very important thing that we must 
do." (p 113) "Urban reform is more complicated and risky than 
rural reform." (p 117) There are risks because reform involves 
the vital interests of the people and every step taken will 
affect millions upon millions of people. Meanwhile, 
reform is a new thing, as is creative practice, which has 
no ready experience to follow. There is no perfect policy, 
method, or scheme and mistakes are unavoidable. Second, 
creative practice may encounter obstructions and not be accepted 
by the public. This is mainly due to the influence of the old 
system, pattern, and concepts and the obstruction of "leftist" 
ideas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: In the past, we were 
used to conventions and it was no easy job to change this. "It 
was a difficult job to correct the `leftist' ideas which took 
shape over the decades. Our main task is to oppose `leftism' 
because it has become a force of habit." "The habitual practice 
of yearning for the past easily crops up while formulating and 
implementing specific policies." (p 228) As creative practice 
means blazing new trails, which itself constitutes a revolution 
and a negation of the old things, obstacles will be unavoidable. 
Meanwhile, as creative practice is an experiment, which has no 
ready facts to serve as grounds, it will take time to persuade 
people to accept it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "People could 
not understand the policy of reform at the beginning. Reform 
was universally accepted only when it was proved by facts." (p 
155) Third, creative practice may take a long time to show 
its effects, the results may be unexpected, and, what is more, 
it could be a failure. The problems in these three points 
raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping directly involved the appraisal 
of the efficiency and effect of creative practice. Viewed from 
the process of practice, creative practice is riskier than 
repetitive practice. It may encounter great obstructions and is 
likely to lead to mistakes and even failure. As a consequence, 
its efficiency will be affected. However, from a 
fundamental point of view, creative practice is a developing and 
exploratory practice which involves doing innovative things. 
This itself contains extremely high efficiency. Viewed 
from the results of practice, the social effect and success of 
creative practice will not be limited to a certain matter within 
a period. It may bring about a breakthrough in a field or 
sphere. Such progress may not even be expected by the persons 
involved in the practice. This was the case in rural reform. 
The line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee aroused the enthusiasm 
of the peasants and invigorated the rural areas. In addition to 
the development of agricultural production, township enterprises 
suddenly came to the fore and scored unexpected results. 
Similarly, the failure of creative practice is also of great 
social significance because it proves the mistakes of the 
thinking and methods never practiced before. This itself is a 
discovery which offers a new basis for opening up a new path. 
Successful experience, experience gained from mistakes, and 
lessons drawn from failure are all valuable wealth. For this 
reason, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged us to be 
fearless and to advance boldly in spite of risks and 
difficulties. 
  IV 
  Only by emancipating the mind, seeking truth from 
facts, thinking independently, and applying creative thinking to 
guide practice can we constantly make creations. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping encouraged us to creatively practice and think 
because practice is the conscious activity of men with 
intentions and objectives. Only with creative thinking can 
there be creative practice. He said: "The basic spirit of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee is to 
emancipate the mind, think independently, and formulate policies 
by proceeding from our reality." We cannot find the answer to 
building Chinese-style socialism from the books of Marx or 
Lenin. As the conditions and experience of each country differ 
from the other, we can create new things only through 
independent thinking. Unless we break with rigid ideas and 
think creatively, there will be no hope for reform and 
construction. He urged us to use our brains and be bold in 
thinking and blazing new trails. He was against those lazy 
people who repeated what others said and made empty talk instead 
of using their own brains. He hoped that the leading bodies at 
all levels could be a collective which thought independently, 
could face reality, genuinely and carefully studied the new 
circumstances, formed new trains of thought, offered new 
methods, and used new language. From whence does creative 
thinking come? Comrade Deng Xiaoping used many accurate remarks 
to express it. To sum up, first, it is necessary to uphold the 
ideological line of seeking truth from facts and integrate 
Marxism-Leninism with the reality of Chinese revolution. 
Marx could not give ready answers to problems cropping up 
centuries after his death. Similarly, Lenin could not undertake 
the task of offering ready answers to the problems emerging 50 
to 100 years after his death. We should study Marxist theory 
and also make theoretical creation in light of the new 
circumstances and conditions of the contemporary world and 
China. Second, it is necessary to rely on the creative 
practice of the basic levels and the masses. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said: "A lot of good things from rural reform were 
created by the basic levels. These were then defined and 
improved and taken as a guide for the whole country." While 
examining the manuscripts from the 14th Party Congress he said 
that many good things in reform and opening up were created by 
the masses in practice. They are the wisdom of the masses and 
the collective rather than something new thought up by any 
individual through racking his brains. My contribution was 
summarizing and advocating these new emerging things. 
Third, it is necessary to constantly sum up new 
experience; uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again 
practice, and again knowledge; look back after every step taken 
forward; continuously carry out "ideological reform and 
emancipation"; and always maintain ideological vigor. This is 
the scientific process for developing creative thinking. 
  China's economic structural reform has now entered a new 
stage of establishing a socialist market economic system, 
requiring us to creatively resolve many complicated matters. In 
the reform practice we urgently need, more than any period in 
the past, to carry forward the spirit of creative practice 
vigorously advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and boldly make 
creations and advance in the practice of the socialist 
modernization program.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with unidentified official "in charge </F>
of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court" by ZHONGGUO 
TONGXUN SHE reporter in Beijing on 24 April] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Our staff 
reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Beijing 
Municipal Higher People's Court on the hearing and adjudication 
of the Xi Yang case. The official being interviewed responded 
to questions raised by our staff reporter. His compiled answers 
are as follows: 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] The Xi Yang case has caused much 
concern in Hong Kong. Could you please give us an idea of what 
this case is all about? 
  [Unidentified official] In June and July 1993, Xi Yang 
arrived in Beijing in his capacity as a journalist covering 
"Project Hope," the Sino-British talks, and the Preliminary Work 
Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. Xi Yang confessed that after he came to 
Beijing, he started mainly to gather classified financial and 
economic information, as was specifically instructed by MING PAO 
executives. After learning that his friend Tian Ye was working 
for the People's Bank of China [PBC], he took the initiative to 
contact Tian and had him steal, pry, and illegally provide a 
large quantity of state financial and economic secrets, which 
included: China's banknote designs, top- secret information 
about the PBC's plan to sell gold on the international market, 
exchange rate adjustments, and the PBC's plan to raise interest 
rates on saving deposits again in July 1993, as well as a 
document, "Notes on Provisional Control Measures for 
Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions Engaged in Renminbi 
Transactions," which was labeled as "classified." Xi Yang wrote 
stories according to the data obtained from Tian Ye and sent 
them to Hong Kong's MING PAO for publication, causing great 
losses to the country's economy. 
  The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court heard the 
case and concluded that Xi Yang's acts constituted the crime of 
stealing and prying into state secrets and that this was an 
especially serious case. In accordance with the National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee's "Supplementary 
Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging State Secrets" 
and Article 51, Section 1 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the 
People's Republic of China," the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and three 
years deprivation of political rights. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was the penalty too heavy for Xi 
Yang? 
  [Unidentified official] The NPC Standing Committee's 
"Supplementary Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging 
State Secrets" read: "Stealing, prying, and illegally providing 
state secrets to overseas institutions, organizations, and 
persons," "in an especially serious case, shall be punished with 
a prison sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or 
the death sentence, with deprivation of political rights." The 
Beijing Intermediate People's Court heard the case and came to 
the conclusion that Xi Yang's stealing and prying into a large 
quantity of Chinese financial and economic secrets had caused 
great losses to the country's economy, so this was an especially 
serious criminal case which should be penalized with a prison 
sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or the death 
sentence. Taking into consideration the fact that Xi Yang had 
shown signs of repentance, the court handed down a lenient 
punishment. Therefore, the 12-year prison sentence and two-year 
deprivation of political rights passed on Xi Yang was 
appropriate. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why is Xi Yang's case considered 
especially serious? Could you please specify what kind of 
serious losses were incurred? 
  [Unidentified official] The classification of state 
financial and economic information stolen and pried into by Xi 
Yang was very high, the quantity was big, and the losses caused 
were serious. But the specifics are still state secrets, so we 
cannot publicize them. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's case heard in 
accordance with the law? 
  [Unidentified official] After receiving the indictment 
filed by a branch of the Beijing Municipal People's 
Procuratorate in reference to Xi Yang's case on 14 December 
1993, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court formed a 
collegiate bench according to law and started the hearing 
process for this case. During that time, because some evidence 
required verification, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court returned the case to a branch of the Beijing 
Municipal People's Procuratorate on 27 January 1994 for further 
verification. On 20 February, the branch of the Beijing 
Municipal People's Procuratorate once again handed the case over 
to the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court for 
hearings. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court passed judgment on this case according to law. 
Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment of the first hearing and 
lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court 
heard the case and on 15 April issued a final judgment, which 
rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. Hearings 
on this case held by the courts were in strict conformity with 
legal procedures. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was the hearing on Xi Yang's case 
not a public one? 
  [Unidentified official] Article 111 of the "Criminal 
Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: "The 
first hearing of a case by the people's court should be 
conducted publicly. But no public hearing should be held on 
cases that involve state secrets or personal privacy." Xi 
Yang's case involved state secrets, so the people's court, 
pursuant to the law, did not hold a public hearing on this case, 
but explained to the defendant the reasons for an in camera 
hearing at the court session. But during the process of the 
hearings, all the defendant's rights in relation to litigation 
were protected. Article 121 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of 
the People's Republic of China" reads: "All judgments shall be 
announced publicly." The judgment of the first hearing and the 
ruling of the second hearing on Xi Yang were both announced 
publicly, and written judgments and rulings were forwarded to Xi 
Yang himself after the public announcements. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's right to a defense 
protected? 
  [Unidentified official] The criminal procedural law 
stipulates that, besides exercising his right to defend himself, 
the defendant may also engage a counsel to plead for him. When 
forwarding a copy of the indictment to Xi Yang, the Beijing 
Municipal Intermediate People's Court informed Xi Yang that he 
had the right to defend himself or to engage a counsel to plead 
for him. Xi Yang declined to engage a counsel and said that he 
would exercise his right to defend himself when the court 
opened. During the first hearing, Xi Yang made a full defense 
of himself. At the second hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher 
People's Court also informed Xi Yang of his right to a defense. 
Xi Yang said that besides exercising his right to defend 
himself, he would also ask his father to engage a lawyer to 
plead for him. Xi's father first went to a lawyer working with 
the China Legal Affairs Center to act as Xi Yang's counsel at 
the second hearing. Later, because this lawyer turned down the 
engagement, Xi's father approached two lawyers, namely, Peng 
Xuejun [1756 1331 6511] and Xu Cheng [6079 2892], who were 
affiliated to the Beijing Municipality's Jingtian Law Firm, and 
asked them to defend Xi Yang. After they accepted the 
engagement, the lawyers looked through the relevant dossiers and 
had a consultation with the appellant, Xi Yang. Afterward, they 
submitted a written defense statement to the court. At its 
scrutinizing session, the collegiate bench gave full 
consideration to the defense statements made by Xi Yang and his 
counsels. Therefore, the courts at both levels protected Xi 
Yang's right to a defense in handling this case. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Some people said the second hearing 
on Xi Yang's case was too rushed. Is this true? 
  [Unidentified official] Article 141 of the "Criminal 
Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: The 
procedure by which the people's court handles an appeal or a 
counter-appeal at a second hearing shall conform to the 
procedure of the first hearing. After the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court pronounced the verdict according to 
law on 28 March, Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment and 
lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court 
filed the case on 30 March and formed a collegiate bench in 
accordance with the law. The collegiate bench listened to Xi 
Yang's grounds for the appeal, examined the dossiers, verified 
the relevant evidence, interrogated the appellant Xi Yang, and 
the defendant in the first hearing, Tian Ye, and studied defense 
statements submitted by Xi Yang and his counsels. After a full 
examination of the facts established at the first hearing and 
the applicable legal provisions, the Beijing Municipal Higher 
People's Court made a final ruling on 15 April. 
  Article 142 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's 
Republic of China" reads: "After the people's court takes up an 
appeal or a counter-appeal for a second hearing, it should wind 
up the case within one month or a maximum of one and a half 
months." In Xi Yang's case, the facts were clear and the 
evidence was conclusive and sufficient. Neither Xi Yang nor his 
counsels challenged the facts established by the initial 
verdict. Therefore, it was very normal for the second hearing 
court to conclude the case within 17 days. Xi Yang's counsels 
submitted their written defense statement to the court on the 
morning of 13 April, and the court made its final ruling on 15 
April. There was enough time for studying and considering the 
counsels' recommendations. 
  [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was Xi Yang's behavior considered 
a crime rather than normal activity of a journalistic nature? 
  [Unidentified official] According to relevant stipulations, 
Hong Kong and Macao reporters who wish to gather news on the 
mainland must apply to the relevant authorities, stating the 
object, content, and period of coverage, and they may not come 
to the mainland to gather news until approval is obtained. If a 
reporter needs to gather some additional news after completing 
the task originally approved, he should apply to the relevant 
local authorities and may not proceed until approval is 
obtained. Hong Kong and Macao reporters gathering news on the 
mainland are protected by the laws of the state; in the 
meantime, they must abide by the laws and decrees of the state 
as well as the relevant regulations. They may not engage in 
activities which are incompatible with their status as 
reporters. Hong Kong and Macao reporters entering the country 
for the express purpose of visiting relatives or sightseeing may 
not engage in news gathering activities. Xi Yang did not apply 
for permission to interview the PBC, let alone obtain approval. 
His act was an obvious violation of the relevant state 
stipulations regarding overseas reporters' journalistic 
activities in mainland China. 
  Xi Yang violated the relevant stipulations on gathering news 
on the mainland. To make this point clear is for the sole 
purpose of illustrating the fact that as far as news gathering 
is concerned, he was not doing this in a normal way either. But 
the penalty passed on him according to law was not because he 
failed to apply for permission to gather news through normal 
procedures, but because he violated the law, and, worse still, 
did so knowingly. It was Xi Yang who took the initiative to 
incite Tian Ye to steal, pry, and illegally provide state 
secrets. Anyone with a bit of common sense understands that the 
financial and economic intelligence Xi Yang stole and pried into 
were important state secrets. Xi Yang, who is a reporter and 
had lived and worked on the mainland for a long time, should 
have known better. After the case was discovered, the Chinese 
financial and economic information that Xi Yang stole, pried 
into, and published in an overseas newspaper was identified by 
the state institution concerned as important state secrets. 
Therefore, Xi Yang's behavior was nothing to do with freedom of 
the press, but was an act in violation of the law.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Authorities Confirm Explosion in </F>
Xichang Satellite Base in Early April"] 
  [Text] The Chinese authorities confirmed that an explosion 
occurred on 2 April at the Xichang Satellite Launching Base. 
One person was killed in the accident and over 20 people were 
injured. A laboratory and an advanced meteorological satellite 
were destroyed. Western space experts believe that the accident 
was a serious setback for China's aerospace industry. 
  A spokesman for China's Aerospace Industry Corporation 
confirmed the accident to foreign mass media after the U.S. 
magazine NEWSWEEK published a report about the explosion in 
Xichang. However, the spokesman said that only one person was 
killed and this was different from the NEWSWEEK report claiming 
two deaths. It is said that the satellite destroyed in the 
accident cost $75 million. MING PAO took the lead in reporting 
about the Xichang explosion on 9 April. 
  The spokesman for the Aerospace Industry Corporation 
stressed 
that the accident would not affect China's plan to launch other 
satellites throughout the rest of this year. Last month, 
GONGREN RIBAO reported that China planned to launch five 
satellites this year. 
  The spokesman also said that the authorities were 
investigating the cause of the explosion and would make public 
the findings once they reached a conclusion. 
  NEWSWEEK, in the latest issue published yesterday, quoted a 
diplomat as saying that the explosion was caused by a leak in 
the fuel supply system. The NEWSWEEK report said that this was 
a serious setback for China's aerospace development plan. 
  China attaches great importance to its satellite launching 
plans. On 8 April, the Chinese official mass media said only 
that the satellite launch was postponed due to unexpected 
factors. According to the original plan, a Fengyun-2 
meteorological satellite was to be carried into space orbit by a 
Changzheng-3 rocket. 
  In fact, China has strong competitive power in the field of 
satellite launching. Although a live televised satellite launch 
failed in 1992, people in this industry believe that the Chinese 
rockets were basically reliable and were extremely "economical." 
China only charged $45 million for launching a customer's 
satellite and this was much cheaper than the American and 
European services. The American companies normally charge $100 
million and Europe's Ariane Company charges $85 million.

Activist Wang Jiaqi Fled to Hong Kong and Is Granted Political 
Asylum by the United States"] 
  [Text] Democratic activist Wang Jiaqi, who has fled from 
Mainland China to Hong Kong, will go to the United States in the 
near future after a brief stay in Hong Kong. It is said that 
the U.S. Government has already approved Wang Jiaqi's request 
and granted him political asylum. 
  An informed source said the department concerned of the Hong 
Kong Government had a contact with Wang Jiaqi last week and 
asked him to keep a low profile during his stay in Hong Kong. 
Wang agreed to do so. 
  It is said that Wang Jiaqi is now staying on Lamma Island in 
Hong Kong, and he is maintaining contact with the outside 
through a non-government organization. 
  The Mainland Chinese government is quite concerned about 
possible leakage of secrets due to Wang Jiaqi's flight, and 
Mainland Chinese agencies in Hong Kong are busy in detecting 
Wang Jiaqi's move.

  [Text] A senior Chinese official died in Hong Kong on 
Thursday while on a secret mission to the territory. 
  Deng Qiang, 62, the deputy director of the Hong Kong 
Economic 
Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
(HKMAO) under the State Council, was admitted to Queen Mary 
Hospital on Tuesday after suffering a brain haemorrhage the day 
before. He died early on Thursday morning after emergency 
surgery. 
  Deng was heading a delegation of five State Council 
officials 
sent to investigate property speculation by Chinese companies in 
Hong Kong. The issue was raised last month by the HKMAO 
director, Lu Ping, who said it was unfair that companies funded 
from the mainland used state money to make profits in Hong Kong 
without worrying about risks. The State Council delegation led 
by Deng arrived in the territory two weeks ago and was scheduled 
to return to Beijing this Wednesday. 
  Deng was also dealing with the new airport financing 
arrangements as well as the forthcoming meeting of the economic 
sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee. "He was so 
active only a week ago and now he's gone," a Chinese official in 
Hong Kong said last night. 
  China has made no announcement of the death, but is expected 
to make a statement today. 
  Deng's wife, Mo Ruanqiong, the director of the Macao Affairs 
Department of the HKMAO, arrived in Hong Kong on Friday to 
handle funeral arrangements with Deng's former boss in Beijing, 
Chen Zuoer, now one of China's representatives on the Joint 
Liaison Group. Neither Zhou Nan, the director of the Hong Kong 
branch of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), nor his wife, 
Huang Guozeng, visited the ailing Deng while he fought for his 
life in the hospital. Chinese officials said this reflected the 
frosty reception Zhou usually affords the HKMAO, which is his 
shadow boss. 
  Deng was one of many cadres promoted in the recent reshuffle 
of the HKMAO, having served as a deputy director of the First 
Department, which was renamed the Hong Kong Economic Affairs 
Department. He was one of the longest serving and 
most-respected officials in the HKMAO. Colleagues said that 
they had long expected he would die "in the line of duty".

    [Editorial Report] Hong Kong MING PAO in Chinese on 23 
April publishes on page A6, below the fold, a half-page 
1,000-character "statement" signed by 118 China affairs 
reporters from 23 news organizations in Hong Kong, on the case 
of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, who has been convicted and jailed 
in Beijing for allegedly stealing state secrets. Entitled 
"Statement on the Xi Yang Case by Hong Kong Reporters Covering 
China Affairs," this item is also published, in Chinese, in the 
23 April edition of the English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING 
POST. The POST version takes up the lower left quarter of page 
22, in the paper's sports section. Both the MING PAO and POST 
versions are enclosed within a heavy black border, with the 
headline in large, bold characters. The statement does not 
appear in the 23 April editions of any of the other Hong Kong 
papers on regular coverage at Hong Kong bureau: HONGKONG 
STANDARD, EASTERN EXPRESS, HSIN PAO, and LIEN HO PAO, nor in the 
PRC-affiliated TA KUNG PAO and WEN WEI PO. Neither was the 
statement mentioned in the 0500 GMT "News at One" cast for 23 
April on Radio-Television Hong Kong (RTHK). 
  The full text of the statement reads as follows: 
  "We are a group of Hong Kong reporters who constantly visit 
mainland China to cover China affairs. Here we express our 
indignation and resentment against the case of MING PAO reporter 
Xi Yang, who has been charged with 'stealing state banking 
secrets,' and found guilty without an open, fair trial, and has 
been sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of his 
political rights for two years. 
  "Despite the fact that Chinese officials and official media 
have time and again stressed that Xi Yang's case was an 
individual one, and that it has nothing to do with press 
freedom, nevertheless, we Hong Kong reporters, who constantly 
visit Mainland China, found the case to be shocking and 
worrying. In fact, the behavior of Xi Yang, which which the 
Chinese authorities brought charges, was very familiar to us as 
our work style in our routine coverage of Chinese affairs. 
Should Xi Yang be found guilty, then we will face the same 
crisis, and Xi Yang will be neither the first nor the last 
reporter to be apprehended. 
  "Since the PRC implemented reform and opening up, Hong Kong 
news workers -- including Xi Yang -- have played an important 
and promotional role in China's economic growth. We hope the 
Chinese Government will adopt an open and practical attitude and 
that it will respect Hong Kong reporters' coverage methods and 
their right to report news according to the usual practices of 
world news coverage. 
  "We believe that Xi Yang's case has revealed two important 
issues: First, the Chinese authorities' definition of `state 
secret' is vague; second, according to the document, `On Matters 
of Attention for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for 
News Coverage,' our news coverage activities in mainland China 
can almost invariably be charged as `illegal.' 
  "The Chinese definition of `state secret' is very arbitrary 
and vague, and even some basic materials are listed as 
classified documents, which results in very great difficulties 
for reporters' news coverage. Furthermore, they can be charged 
on the grounds of `prying into' and `stealing' state secrets. 
This being the case, we strongly require the Chinese 
authorities to explicitly publish the definition of the category 
of `state secrets,' while reviewing and revising it according to 
customary international practice. 
  "In addition, Hong Kong reporters going to mainland China 
for 
news coverage are liable to violate the `Matters of Attention 
for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for News 
Coverage' because these rules and regulations stipulate that an 
application must be filed before going to mainland China for the 
purpose of news coverage, and furthermore, that no news coverage 
activities beyond those specified in the application are 
allowed. Practice over the past four and half years has 
demonstrated that these regulations are impractical. We require 
the Chinese authorities to remove promptly these restrictions on 
news coverage. 
  "To express our strong resentment against the handling of Xi 
Yang's case, and to urge the Chinese authorities to face our 
anxieties and requirements squarely, as of today and until 31 
May 1994, we have decided to boycott all news coverage 
activities in the north which are funded by the Chinese 
authorities by invitation as being of propaganda and tourist 
values. At the same time, we appeal for support from our 
employers. 
  "On the other hand, we urge the Hong Kong and British 
Governments to actively follow up Xi Yang's case through 
diplomatic channels, while requiring the Chinese Government to 
clarify the definition of `state secrets' and to lift the 
restrictions placed on news coverage by the requirement to 
submit applications beforehand. 
  "We require our media employers to make a commitment that 
they must bear legal, moral, and economic responsibilities 
should their employees be held in custody or detention while 
conducting news coverage in mainland China. We hope that the 
Hong Kong Press Guild, the Hong Kong Association for News 
Administrative Workers, and the Hong Kong Reporters' Association 
will support us in setting out these requirements to the Chinese 
authorities."

  [Text] Military sites that China is prepared to turn over 
to redevelopment would be worth more than $100 billion, 
according to the Chinese team leader of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG), Guo Fengmin. China has agreed to release 
25 of the 39 sites currently occupied by British forces, noting 
their value to Hong Kong's economic growth. A draft accord of 
which sites will be retained and developed for the People's 
Liberation Army has been drawn up by defence experts attached to 
the JLG, and British officials are reportedly hoping for early 
acceptance of it. 
  The use of military land has been discussed in the JLG for 
more than seven years. Some technical difficulties are still 
blocking full agreement, and Governor Chris Patten is hoping 
that he can resolve these by meeting the director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. 
  Mr Lu will visit the territory next week for the Bank of 
China's ceremony to launch its Hong Kong banknotes. But he has 
not yet agreed to meet Mr Patten due to still strained relations 
between Britain and China as a result of the row on 
constitutional issues. Mr Lu will deliver a keynote speech on 
"one country, two systems" at a function organised by five 
chambers of commerce on Friday, May 6. 
  Mr Patten wants to discuss the defence deal, the airport 
financing plan and the question of civil service through-train 
with Mr Lu and hopes to resolve some outstanding problems in the 
draft defence accord before the JLG holds its plenary meeting 
next month. 
  Defence experts plan to meet early next month and it is 
expected the JLG plenum will be held in mid or late May in Hong 
Kong. Mr Guo confirmed that the plenum would be held before the 
end of May. He said the two sides had yet to finalise details 
on the defence land but that it would be discussed again soon. 
  He would not confirm that the Chinese side had agreed to 
release the 25 plots of military land and said only: "We have 
agreed to hand a great deal of land back to Hong Kong for 
economic and social development. According to some conservative 
estimates made earlier, the land to be release would be worth 
hundreds of billions of dollars." 
  It is understood the draft accord produced by the defence 
experts in late February envisages that the military estates at 
King's Park, Kowloon Tong and Happy Valley will be freed for 
development. The value of such prime sites ranges from $4 
billion to as much as $10 billion. Sources indicated that the 
area covered in the 25 military estimates was not great.

  [Text] An official from the local office of the New China 
News Agency (Xinhua) has reconfirmed there was no chance that Lu 
Ping, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, would meet the Governor during his visit to the 
territory next week. It would be Lu's first visit since Chris 
Patten took office. Patten has said he would be "delighted" to 
talk to Lu. 
  "Patten probably thinks that he can do whatever he wants," 
said the local Xinhua deputy director, Zhang Junsheng. "He 
thinks if he wants to meet Lu, he can do so at any time. It is 
just his wishful thinking." When asked why Lu should decline 
Patten's invitation, Zhang said no reason was needed. "It is 
him (Patten) who has undermined the cooperative spirits of the 
two countries. 
  "Now Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report 
publicly voices its support for Patten's so-called reform 
proposal. 
  "There is nothing Lu can talk to him (about)." 
  Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, said 
yesterday the report represented the views of some MPs, not the 
British government.

  [Text] Wu Yi, minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], wants the China Resources 
(Holdings) Company Limited to try its best to expand, link the 
development of the company with the prosperity and stability of 
Hong Kong, and make active contributions. 
  The female minister ended her 12-day visit to the United 
States and arrived in Hong Kong on the 21st of this month after 
attending a meeting of the Eighth Joint Sino-U.S. Committee on 
Commerce and Trade as head of delegation. On the 23d, she spoke 
at the second session of the China Resources (Holdings) Company 
10th board of directors and 11th shareholders' meeting. 
  She fully affirmed the achievement of the company, stressing 
that "if China Resources seizes opportunities before 1997 and 
works actively for a breakthrough, it should become a big 
multinational corporation." 
  She wants China Resources to participate actively in the 
Hong 
Kong's economy, fully exploit its role as a financial center and 
a free port, and expand its business in conformity with 
international conventions and Hong Kong law and according to 
Hong Kong's economic situation. 
  As MOFTEC's biggest company, the China Resources company 
grossed $6.77 billion in total turnover, up 5.7 percent from 
last year, and initially achieved the change from being 
primarily a marketing agent to an independent business concern. 
Independent trade last year rose to account for 66.4 percent of 
its overall trade volume. New steps were also taken in 
industrialization and diversification. 
  Wu Yi visited China Arts and Crafts, the China Resources 
Department Store, the new Cheung Sha Wan Pier, new oil tanks 
under construction, and some enterprises under the China 
Resources Company. It is known that China Resources industrial 
and diversification programs extend to banks, listed companies, 
transport companies, shipping lines, oil storage, bonded 
warehouses, property and real estate, retailing, and industrial 
concerns.

  [Text] China has denied a report suggesting that capital 
punishment would be restored in Hong Kong after 1997. The 
report in The Sunday Times quoted Zhang Rongshun, from the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, saying that the 
future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government might 
restore the death penalty. But Zhang said: "I did not say 
there was such a possibility. I just said it was for the SAR 
government to decide whether there was a need to restore the 
death penalty in Hong Kong." 
  Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the local office of 
the New China News Agency (Xinhua), agreed. "What he said means 
that it is a decision to be made by the SAR instead of the 
central government," Zhang Junsheng said. "Of course, it cannot 
be said that the death penalty can never be used in Hong Kong." 
  Simon Li, a retired high court judge and leader of the legal 
sub- group of the Preliminary Working Committee, said the death 
penalty was not discussed by the PWC. "I personally don't think 
it really matters whether or not Hong Kong should have capital 
punishment after 1997," Li said yesterday.

  [Text] Police have seized more high-grade heroin in the 
past three months than the total amount seized in 1993, causing 
wholesale drug prices to climb slightly for the first time in 
six months. 
  The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now 
choked 
with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone, 
police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount 
for 1993 was 223 kilograms. 
  The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin 
into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last 
month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million 
from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the 
biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical 
surveillance operation no arrests have been made. 
  In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a 
hut at Yuen Long. 
  There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the 
drug 
"ice," a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine. 
  So far this year, 22 kilograms of "ice" has been seized, 
more 
than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last 
year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths 
linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92. 
  Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief 
Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not 
give police any reason for complacency. "Obviously, if one 
measures success by seizures and arrests, then we can say both 
figures are up," Mr Grant said. "But the other side is that 
there appear to be more drugs on the streets. There is always 
an element of luck in getting these results but a lot of it 
boils down to good, old-fashioned police work." 
  Mr Grant said police intelligence suggested Hong Kong was no 
longer as popular a transit centre for drug deals but many 
transactions were still locally brokered or financed. He said 
he was particularly pleased with recent police efforts to 
destroy drug-cutting centres where pure heroin is diluted for 
extra profits and ease of consumption by addicts. In 1993, 30 
such facilities were located and shut down. This year seven 
have been identified.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Council Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua spoke at a national telephone conference on 
chemical fertilizer production today, calling on leaders as well 
as economic and trade commissions, chemical industrial 
departments, and other relevant departments at all levels to 
take immediate action to promote the production, transportation, 
and supply of chemical fertilizers to ensure demand in the 
agricultural sector. 
  He said: The party Central Committee and State Council have 
decided that a bumper agricultural harvest is the major task for 
achieving economic and national stability this year. China's 
agriculture, grain production in particular, is by no means a 
local issue, but a cardinal issue having a bearing on the 
overall situation; it is not an economic issue in general, but 
an economic as well as political issue of strategic importance. 
Therefore, it is necessary to unify thinking, take concerted 
action, and make a determined effort to develop and support 
agriculture. At present, the shortage of chemical fertilizers 
remains acute. Farm work is seasonal, so racing against time to 
produce and supply more chemical fertilizers to ensure demand 
has become an urgent task in production, as well as an important 
matter having a bearing on this year's harvest. 
  He said: Chemical industrial departments and chemical 
fertilizer enterprises should strengthen confidence to overcome 
difficulties and go full steam ahead to produce more chemical 
fertilizers. Despite a good momentum in chemical fertilizer 
production and marketing since the beginning of this year, the 
supply of chemical fertilizers has fallen short of demand. 
Therefore, chemical industrial departments and chemical 
fertilizer enterprises should summarize experiences, and master 
and keep abreast of the law governing demand to guide production 
and supply. Meanwhile, operation of the nearly 600 enterprises 
whose production has been suspended should resume, and 
enterprises not operating at full capacity should put into high 
gear to produce more chemical fertilizers. Major enterprises 
that are tasked with the production of chemical fertilizers 
under unified state distribution should make a determined effort 
to fulfill and strive to overfulfill the task. Although chemical 
fertilizer enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in 
production, the shortage of market supply has provided 
enterprises with a good opportunity. Hence, all productive 
enterprises must strengthen confidence and exert every muscle to 
overcome difficulties and create production conditions. All 
enterprises must strengthen management, strive to improve 
quality and lower consumption and production costs, and mobilize 
workers to launch campaigns to increase production and practice 
economy, and to stop deficits and increase revenue. Chemical 
industrial departments and chemical fertilizer enterprises 
should do everything they can to mobilize and rely on cadres and 
workers to fulfill this year's production and marketing plans. 
They should take strong measures to strictly control and 
stabilize chemical fertilizer prices to satisfy the needs of 
agricultural production and farmers. 
  In his speech, Zou Jiahua also urged governments at all 
levels and all relevant departments to take the initiative to 
create a favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer 
production. He said: In order to win a bumper agricultural 
harvest this year, we must ensure the delivery of quality 
chemical fertilizers in full amounts to farmers. To this end, 
relevant government departments should take immediate action to 
comply with this requirement, taking the initiative to create a 
favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer 
production and to help enterprises solve problems caused by 
external factors. Energy, railways, transportation, commerce, 
and banking departments should coordinate efforts to help 
enterprises overcome difficulties in energy, transportation, 
and, in particular, funds. Industrial and commercial banks 
should expedite the processing of funds approved by the State 
Council meeting for storing chemical fertilizers and pesticides 
in winter and for resuming the operation of small chemical 
fertilizer enterprises. Departments concerned should ensure 
priority supply of coal, electricity, natural gas, and heavy oil 
needed for production. Railways and transportation departments 
should prioritize the delivery of chemical fertilizers and their 
raw materials for production. To support the production of 
chemical fertilizer, the state has decided to continue the 
present preferential fare for transporting chemical fertilizers 
and preferential charges for electricity used by small and 
medium chemical fertilizer plants in their production. All 
provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments 
should actively support chemical fertilizer enterprises in terms 
of funds, raw and semi-finished materials, electricity supply, 
and transportation, continuing to implement the provisions of 
relevant State Council documents, adopting preferential measures 
in prices, taxes, and loans, and helping enterprises solve 
production problems. 
  He emphasized: All localities should earnestly implement the 
policy toward prices of agricultural capital goods and guard 
against big fluctuations in market prices. Commodity price 
departments should strengthen supervision and inspection, 
resolutely checking unauthorized price rises and duly punishing 
indiscriminate price hikes in violation of the price policy. 
  He said: At present, departments in charge of agricultural 
capital goods should lose no time in trying every possible way 
to find new sources of goods, to link production with 
transportation and marketing, and to ensure timely supply of 
chemical fertilizers. They should serve as the main channels for 
not only procuring and supplying chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides during the peak season but also procuring them in 
good time during the off season so as to ensure normal 
production of chemical fertilizer and pesticide enterprises. 
Enterprises may directly supply chemical fertilizers not under 
unified state distribution to grass-roots supply and marketing 
cooperatives or farm households through direct sales or joint 
and commissioned sales with grass-roots supply and marketing 
cooperatives of agricultural capital goods. 
  Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry, announced 
specific 
plans for chemical fertilizer production to ensure demand during 
the spring farming season.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xia Jun (1115 0193) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Chao Wen (6872 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng pointed out at the eighth national meeting on rural 
reform experimental zones: The rural reform experimental zones 
have provided rich experience for China's rural reform. In this 
regard, we have achieved certain success, made some progress, 
and gained some new experience. In the days to come, we should 
make the experimental zones play an even better role in serving 
central policies and exploring methods for rural reform across 
the country. 
  Chen Junsheng said: Generally speaking, the situation in 
agriculture and rural areas has been good since last year. To 
enhance the good situation, the central authorities have adopted 
some measures to increase agricultural investment, and all the 
provinces and departments concerned have increased their share 
of agricultural investment. Ensuring the supply of essential 
agricultural products and steady increase in peasants' income 
are two important objectives of rural economic development in 
the 1990's. Arousing the peasants' enthusiasm is a new problem 
which requires solution in work concerning rural reform 
experimental zones. For this reason, it is necessary to 
constantly study new circumstances and new problems, and to 
explore new ways under the new situation. 
  On how to continue to run rural reform experimental zones 
well, Chen Junsheng emphasized: First, we should readjust the 
contents and arrangements of the experiment. Since the 
experimental zones were set up seven or eight years ago, many 
projects were conceived according to the situation then. For 
this reason, it is necessary to make a proper readjustment of 
their contents and pay attention to making breakthroughs in key 
projects and to summing up experience. Second, it is necessary 
to coordinate work among the leadership and departments of 
various experimental zones. This is because experimental zone 
work involves all quarters and requires the support and 
cooperation of other departments concerned. Third, to 
facilitate their experiments, the zones should be permitted to 
go beyond some existing policies and systems. However, 
experiments must be strictly kept within proper limits and 
submitted to the state for approval; only the approved 
experiments may be conducted. Fourth, it is necessary to 
strengthen the cadre force of the experimental zones.

  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China said today 
that it will take further steps to reform the country's fiscal 
and tax systems, the financial sector, foreign trade, investment 
and the state-owned enterprises. 
  Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, 
China's central bank, said here today that introduction of a new 
tax system and the unification of exchanges rates early this 
year have proved "satisfactory". 
  "The Chinese Government is well aware that many problems in 
the areas of macroeconomic management and the industrial 
structure remain unsolved," Chen said at the 42nd meeting of the 
Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  Chen said budgetary revenue of China increased by 21.4 
percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the 
same period last year, and the exchange rate of renminbi, 
China's currency, has remained stable. 
  "The Chinese Government is fully confident that in pushing 
ahead with reforms it will achieve its objectives while 
maintaining macroeconomic stability," Chen stressed.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A geographical 
information industry is taking shape in China as the country's 
survey and mapping research institutes and universities have in 
recent years achieved research breakthroughs. 
  These advances have come in the fields of surveying 
resources 
and monitoring the environment and natural disasters by using 
high- and remote-sensing technologies, including satellite 
sensing. 
  Official sources have said that China has established a 
dozen 
large-scale geographical information systems, including a 
national territory survey, flood forecast on the lower reaches 
of the Yellow River and anti-disaster measures. 
  Others include a monitoring information system for the 
"three 
norths" (north, northeast and northwest China) forest belts and 
environmental development, one for Shanghai's urban 
construction, one for the underground pipe network in urban 
Beijing and one for the basic land conditions in northeast 
China's Liaoning Province. 
  Speaking at today's inaugural meeting of the China 
Geographical Information Association, director of the State 
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping Jin Xiangwen said that China's 
construction of a geographical data bank has gone into high gear. 
  He said that a data bank on the primary geographical 
conditions of the national territory has been built up at the 
scale of one to one million, adding that a new one at one to 
250,000 is in the pipeline. 
  Meanwhile, he said, China has started building a 
high-precision data bank of the earth compiled from satellite 
information. 
  A digital survey and mapping system is being constructed to 
gradually integrate aerial and remote-sensing surveys and the 
information system for the national territory integrated into a 
whole, according to the official. 
  Jin said that his bureau has set up digital production bases 
in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu and Harbin. 
  Meanwhile, China has set up a key national lab for resources 
and environment information, a key national lab for surveys and 
mapping using remote-sensing data and a research institute for 
mapping and geographical information systems.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Last year the average 
per capita income of Chinese workers was 3,236 yuan, up 19.4 
percent over the previous year. 
  This was revealed by the China Labor Development Communique, 
jointly issued here today by the Labor Ministry and Statistics 
Bureau. 
  Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, quoted the 
communique as saying that in 1993 the country's total payroll 
reached a record 477 billion yuan, a rise of 21.1 percent over 
1992. After allowing for price rises, the actual increases in 
the workers' total payroll and their average per capita annual 
income were 4.3 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. 
  The spokesman attributed the rise to the reform of 
enterprise 
operational mechanism and to the ongoing reform of the state's 
wage distribution system, which now cover 18,000 enterprises and 
14 million workers across the country. 
  An elastic wage plan, the core of the current wage 
distribution reform, has been carried out in 30 provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities. The plan is designed to 
set the total payrolls in light of the economic efficiency 
targets of various localities.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Troubles Dog Private Firms"] </F>
  [Text] There might be at least another 1 million Chinese 
joining the troops of self-employed businessmen this year. 
  And, predicted the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce, the number of private firms in the country could reach 
more than 300,000, up 26 percent from last year. 
  "But, private businesses are now more at the mercy of 
outside 
interference," said an official with the administration's 
Department of Individual and Private Enterprises. 
  Private businesses have become a major source of State 
revenue, and to protect them China should promptly deal with the 
many difficulties they face, said the official, who declined to 
be named. 
  He noted that the country is awaiting more stringent 
official 
tax policies on self-employed businessmen and privately owned 
firms. 
  The administration believes there are many arbitrary levies 
on private businesses. 
  Besides the regular income taxes levied by the State 
Administration of Taxation, private businesses in some provinces 
must pay at least 100 other assessments by other official 
departments. 
  These practices create a heavy financial burden on daily 
business operations. 
  Such charges -- often in the name of improving urban 
infrastructure, transportation and management -- often exceed 
taxes owed to the State. 
  "The government should ban these financial levies while 
strengthening the management of tax collection from private 
businessmen and individual firms," the official noted. 
  By doing so, cash-starved local governments can raise enough 
revenue to develop their local economies. 
  However, some local governments prefer to impose extra 
levies 
on private businesses instead of improving tax collection, said 
analysts with the Ministry of Internal Trade. 
  Such practices have left many loopholes for some individual 
businessmen and privately owned firms to evade taxes, they added. 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce would not 
release figures on tax evasion by individual businesses. 
  However, it does claim that the tax levies on individual 
businessmen and private firms are much better than its 
expectations. 
  The administration's figures show that self-employed 
businessmen and privately owned firms turned over to the State 
more than 29.3 billion yuan ($3.37 billion) in taxes last year, 
up 6.3 billion yuan ($724 million) from 1992. 
  At present, the State Administration of Taxation levies 
income taxes only on self-employed businessmen, and the tax 
treatment it applies to individual business firms is the same as 
that for State enterprises. 
  By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million 
individual business households, up 15.2 percent from a year 
earlier. 
  It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 percent.

"Mainland State-Owned Enterprises Almost Completely Lost Their 
Role as Locomotive of the Economy"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 22 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In the 
first quarter of this year, the gross domestic product of the 
Chinese mainland increased by 12.7 percent over the same period 
last year; in particular, industrial production increased by 16 
percent and continued to maintain a high growth rate. There 
were some prominent contradictions in industrial operations, 
however. For example, growth of state-owned enterprises only 
accounted for 6.6 percent of the national industrial production 
growth, while 93.4 percent of the growth was made by 
non-state-owned enterprises (including collective enterprises in 
urban and rural areas, private enterprises, and foreign-funded 
enterprises). The state-owned enterprises, which produced 50 
percent of the mainland's output value, almost lost their role 
as the locomotive of the economy, and this was certainly a major 
problem for China's economy. 
  The declining economic efficiency of state-owned industrial 
enterprises was primarily reflected in the facts of declining 
profits, increasing losses, the shortage of funds, and the 
accumulation of debts. According to official statistics, in the 
first two months of this year, 370,000 industrial enterprises at 
and above the township level incurred losses totaling 17.6 
billion yuan, an increase of 5 percent over that in the same 
period of last year, and 40.7 percent of the state-owned 
enterprises incurred losses, twice as much as those among 
non-state-owned enterprises. Triangular debts that the 
enterprises owe the banks and each other exceeded 300 billion 
yuan. 
  There are currently more than 14,000 large state-owned 
enterprises in China, and they account for only 3.9 percent of 
the total number of industrial enterprises; however, their 
assets account for 46 percent of the industry in the mainland, 
and the profits they handed over to the state account for 
approximately 67 percent. They have always constituted the main 
force of the mainland's economy, the backbone of the national 
economy, and the primary source of the state's financial 
revenue. Therefore, the state-owned enterprises hold a 
decisively important position. 
  At present, however, some 40 percent of the large and medium 
state-owned enterprises on the Chinese mainland are running in 
the red, and the situation is rather serious. In Liaoning 
Province, the country's major heavy industrial base with a large 
number of state- owned enterprises, in recent years, nearly half 
(46.2 percent) of the state-owned enterprises have been running 
in the red, and nearly 700,000 workers could not receive their 
wages on time. The situation of Heilongjiang Province, another 
major heavy industrial base, was even worse. The large and 
medium enterprises in Harbin have failed to pay a total of 1.3 
billion yuan of debts that are due, and still owe debts 
totalling 6.3 billion yuan. Some enterprises have been mired in 
a state of suspended or semi- suspended operation. 
  In the authorities of the mainland, there are different 
opinions on how to carry out reform in those state-owned 
enterprises that have lost their vigor. Some people maintain 
that financial input to such enterprises should be increased 
appropriately in order to support the state's basic industries 
and the high and new technology industries; otherwise, some 
trouble may occur. Other people maintain that increasing 
investment and financial subsidies to enterprises which have 
been running in the red for a long time would only be a waste of 
resources and would achieve no result in creating new productive 
forces; moreover, it would increase the government's financial 
deficit and become a major burden on the government. The 
problems with the state-owned enterprises, which have not 
adopted the market mechanism, cannot be solved by increasing 
financial input; instead, the problems must be solved through 
enterprise reform and through the establishment of the social 
insurance system, the property right transaction system, the 
debt settlement system, and the mechanism for keeping the good 
and eliminating the bad. Therefore, many experts proposed that 
the enterprises running in the red be auctioned through property 
rights transactions, that mergers be allowed between enterprises 
and individuals within the mainland, and that foreign investors 
be allowed to buy and run such enterprises. At the same time, 
it is necessary to set up the debt settlement system and the 
system for laying off workers and to allow enterprises running 
in the red to apply for bankruptcy; thus, the state-owned 
enterprises can actually play the role of the locomotive of 
industrial production after those that have lost vigor are 
eliminated. 
  It is said that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of 
the financial and economic work, agreed to adopt measures to 
"resurrect" the loss-incurring enterprises and called this 
"rising again like a phoenix from the ashes." He said: Going 
bankrupt does not mean that the workers will not be taken care 
of. In the course of reorganizing the property rights of the 
enterprises after bankruptcy, workers will live on social 
insurance, and part of the money from the auctions will be used 
to help the workers. After the enterprises are reinvigorated, 
the banks can also recover the money. Bankruptcy cannot proceed 
too quickly, however, because this may cause social unrest. At 
least one enterprise may go bankrupt in one county. This 
mechanism may be adopted on a trial basis so that all factory 
directors will be under pressure and will not dare spend public 
money on sightseeing trips. They will have to discharge their 
responsibilities as factory directors or they could lose their 
jobs! 
  At the same time, Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, said that, over a period of three 
to five years, the large and medium state-owned enterprises will 
be pushed to the market in groups so that they will be tested by 
market forces, with the good being kept and the bad being 
eliminated. Chen said that 30 percent of the present 
state-owned enterprises were vigorous and dynamic in their 
operation and would be able to survive in the market, and 20 
percent of the enterprises would fail and would have to be 
closed down, suspended, merged, shifted to production in other 
fields, or leased, contracted, auctioned, or taken over by 
foreign investors. The remaining 50 percent of the enterprises 
will find a way out only through transforming the operational 
mechanism and adjusting the structure.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (CNS) -- China has recently made 
known regulations governing conversion of state assets into 
shares in a bid to meet the needs of reform of the enterprise 
system, especially the changing of state-owned medium- and 
large-sized enterprises into shareholding companies. The 
regulations stress that the overall restructuring of state-owned 
enterprises into shareholding companies had first to be subject 
to evaluation of their assets and prior approval was a must. 
  The regulations state that before the issuing of new shares, 
the adjusted net assets book value of a particular enterprise 
had first of all to be converted into the stake held by 
shareholders. Should part of the assets not be turned into 
shares, it would be listed in a capital accumulation fund and 
the capital would in no way be changed into liabilities. 
  The matter of whether the ratio which the conversion of 
assets into shares will employ is suitable has to be considered 
together with the proposal for the issuing of shares and the 
issuing price. The premium price for the issuing of new shares 
should not be kept too low, otherwise the net assets book value 
will not be fully shown. 
  The regulations also stress that the premium price should be 
made higher in order to fully reflect the actual value of the 
stake resulting from the conversion of state-owned assets into 
shares.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Liu: "Cash-Flush Banks Fearful of Inflation"] </F>
  [Text] Individual savings grew steadily in the first 
quarter of this year despite double-digit inflation and the 
spending frenzy during the Spring Festival holiday. 
  However, experts predict a tough time for banks in the 
coming 
months if the inching up of prices isn't brought under strict 
control. 
  At the end of March, bank savings topped 1,662.5 billion 
yuan 
($191.1 billion), up 35.8 per cent from the corresponding period 
last year. 
  The monthly growth rate reached a high of 6.8 per cent in 
February, compared with 2.5 per cent in January and 2.77 per 
cent in March. 
  Wang Zhiqiang, a savings official for the People's Bank of 
China, the central bank, said the growth rates are among the 
highest in recent years and mark a big improvement from March 
1993, when private savings plunged because of high inflation, 
illegal schemes for raising capital, and low interest rates. 
  Wang attributed the growth to high interest rates and the 
government's continuous efforts to bring order to the country's 
financial system. 
  "Actually," Wang said, "the strong momentum appeared last 
May 
when the central bank raised interest rates to reverse the 
decline in bank savings." 
  Wang said the decision by the People's Bank of China to peg 
the interest rates for deposits with fixed terms of more than 
two years to the inflation rate also helped diminish depositors' 
worries over losing the real value of their savings. 
  Meanwhile, with pay reform spreading across the country, 
many 
government units raised employees' salaries during the quarter. 
Most of the extra income has been set aside in bank savings, 
Wang said. 
  In addition, many investors disappointed by the sluggish 
stock market are turning to banks for a safe place to keep their 
idle cash. 
  Also, to prevent too much capital being drained away from 
savings and treasury bonds, the People's Bank of China has 
decided to suspend the development of investment funds. 
  "Overall, China can still expect a steady growth in bank 
savings this year," Wang said. "But the pace may slow down." 
  He said individual savings may decline in the second quarter 
because of the sale of 87 billion yuan ($10 billion) worth of 
treasury bonds, which began on April 1 and will end on June 30. 
  "The treasury bonds, with their increased liquidity, 
shortened term and higher interest rates, are selling well 
across the country. This will no doubt siphon off a considerable 
part of the bank savings," Wang said. 
  High inflation is another big threat to savings, he said. 
  The inflation rate in the first quarter was 20.1 per cent, 
and even surpassed 30 per cent in some cities such as Haikou. 
At the same time the interest rate for one-year bank deposits 
remained at 10.8 per cent. 
  If not narrowed, the gap may trigger a consumer buying spree 
that would soak up a lot of ready cash. 
  "If the price hikes continue, it will be a very difficult 
time for banks," Wang said. 
  In fact, rising prices at the end of last year sparked a 
buying binge especially in big cities, and led to a slowdown in 
the growth of bank savings. 
  Meanwhile, Wang said that with the country taking strides in 
housing reform, more government units are selling homes to 
employees. This, in turn, means that people will spend more for 
housing and draw down bank savings, he said.

Standard Chartered Securities: "Amendments Will Ease Concerns 
Over New Tax"] 
  [Text] According to a senior official from the Chinese Tax 
Bureau, details of the controversial capital gains tax on 
property will be off1cially announced in the near future. The 
capital gains tax was first introduced in the middle of December 
last year as a part of China's tax reform package and was 
expected to become effective on January 1. However, it met with 
strong opposition from both local and Hong Kong property 
developers as the new tax will substantially erode profitability 
on property developments. After a few months of lobbying from 
Hong Kong developers, the State Council is believed to have made 
the following improvements to the original proposal: 
  -- Projects signed before January 1 with 20 per cent of 
total 
investments already put in will be exempted from the capital 
gains tax. 
  -- All projects (commercial or residential) with less than 
20 
per cent appreciation in value will be exempted. To encourage 
the construction of low-cost residential units for domestic end 
users, low-cost mass residential projects which appreciate in 
value by less than 40 per cent will also be exempted. 
  -- Sales of existing residential property and the 
acquisition 
of new property for the purpose of upgrading accommodation 
conditions will be exempted or entitled to a refund. 
  The above amendments to the initial capital gains tax should 
ease concerns about the erosion of profits for major property 
counters in the mainland market. In addition, companies that 
have postponed the completion of their property projects while 
waiting for the official announcement of the new tax law will 
speed up the completion of these projects. 
  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Real Estate, a major 
developer 
of commercial and residential property in prime locations in 
Shenzhen, is trading at 7.6 times 1994 earnings and is at a 40 
per cent discount to its net asset value. Gintian, a 
conglomerate with substantial property interests, is trading at 
an extremely attractive 4.1 forward price-earnings ratio, while 
Vanke, which focuses on construction of low-cost mass 
residential property, is only trading on a prospective earnings 
multiple of 8.4.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Plagued by corruption and disorder, China has 
unveiled a new weapon in its war against the miscreants -- the 
black placard. From now on, work units with a reputation for 
wrongdoing will be disgraced by a black sign hung at their front 
gates. 
  The new system was initiated last week in Haikou, the 
capital 
of Hainan province, where signs reading "bad social order work 
unit" were hung outside seven government departments and 
enterprises. Among the units forced to advertise their own 
shortcomings were the provincial Goods and Materials Bureau, the 
Haikou branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Hainan 
Fertilisers Factory. 
  "It's a way of putting social pressure on them to improve 
their behaviour," Xu Wei, secretary to the mayor of Haikou, 
said. "The police cannot exert this kind of pressure by 
themselves." Wen Guangshou, deputy director of the Haikou 
committee for comprehensive management of social order, adds: 
"The police had many talks with these units but they did not 
take any preventive measures." "We have no choice but to hang 
the black signs," he said. 
  Most of the work units had been found guilty of embezzlement 
several times over. Other black-listed units had suffered from 
"social chaos incidents", Wen said. He did not elaborate. "By 
hanging the black sign over the door, we are saying that if more 
cases keep occurring the top leaders of the units will be 
personally disciplined," he said. 
  It is probably no coincidence that the system has taken off 
in Hainan first. The island was considered to be rife with 
corruption and vice even before it became a province with 
special economic zone status in 1988. It has been called the 
"Wild West of of China". Watching street brawls is regular 
entertainment for the pineapple-munching citizens of Haikou, 
whose police force often respond by joining the crowd of 
enthusiastic onlookers, or else accepting a small consideration 
to forget the whole affair. The Haikou police dismissed 41 
officers in the first half of last year for accepting bribes. 
  Wen said the black signs will be removed if the behaviour of 
the seven work units improves in the second half of the year. 
"At the end of this (lunar) year, we will select another group 
of work units with social order problems and hang signs on their 
gates," he said. Wen said those which depend on their reputation 
with the public were least likely to get black plates. "When we 
threaten a hotel with a black sign, it always acts quickly," he 
said. "Otherwise nobody would want to stay there." 
  The system rings eerily similiar to the Cultural Revolution, 
when "big character posters" were posted outside the homes and 
work units of suspected wrongdoers. "The central government 
made a decision last year to begin this system," Wen said. 
"It's part of our national campaign to deal with certain 
outstanding problems." 
  From a distance, the signs look like the ubiquitious wenming 
danwei (civilised work unit) signs which the Communist Party has 
handed out by the stackful since nationalising the economy in 
the mid-1950s. "No, those signs are red. They are meant to 
praise, not criticise," Wen explained. "Besides, the red signs 
are usually hung inside the office where the workers can enjoy 
them. With the black signs, they have no choice."

  [Text] Tianjin, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Economic integration 
is emerging around the Bohai bay area in north China, as the 
nation has quickened the pace of reform and opening to the 
outside world over the past few years. 
  The fast-growing regional economic integration, which 
gradually has changed China's pattern of economic development, 
has now caught the eye of the world. 
  The Bohai economic rim includes north and northeast China's 
Shandong, Liaoning, Shanxi and Hebei Provinces, as well as 
Beijing and Tianjin, covering an area of 680,000 square 
kilometers. 
  The area boasts good geographical conditions and is rich in 
natural resources. It also has well-developed industries, 
express transport systems and a highly-trained work force, 
playing a leading part in the country's economy. 
  The idea to develop the Bohai economic zone began in 1985 
when senior officials of 16 big and medium-sized cities around 
Bohai bay, including Tianjin, Dalian (in Liaoning Province) and 
Qingdao (in Shandong Province), met for the first time to 
discuss economic cooperation in the Bohai area. 
  In 1992, the Bohai rim was approved by the state as an 
independent economic zone under the country's general strategic 
economic development plan. 
  The opening and development of the Bohai area, in accordance 
with the decision of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China, was to be accelerated. After 20 years of effort 
it would be built into China's first modernized region, marking 
the economic rim's going into operation. 
  Efforts made in the past eight years laid the groundwork for 
the realization of regional economic cooperation along the 
coastal areas of the Bohai bay and interior zones next to them. 
  Economists maintain that the close ties for an 
inter-regional 
economy needs are based on the density of cities. 
  So far, there are 85 cities of various size around Bohai 
bay, 
accounting for 17.7 percent of the country's total. The number 
of cities with a population of over 500,000 adds up to 18, about 
58.1 percent of the total in east China's coastal areas. 
  What is more, each of 11 cities there has a population of 
over one million people, accounting for 61 percent of the 
country's total, ranking first among the coastal regions. 
  Concentration on heavy industries is another distinct 
feature 
of the bohai economic rim. The scale and influence of the 
densely packed heavy industries within the rim have remained 
first in the country since it was founded in 1949. 
  Located in the rim are China's biggest chemical and 
petrochemical industry bases, such as the Yanshan Petrochemical 
Corporation and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Group. 
  The three biggest iron and steel producers also are located 
around the bay, namely, the Shougang Company (the Capital Iron 
and Steel Company), the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the 
Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. 
  Data from an official department shows that the output in 
internal combustion engines of this area accounted for 32.15 
percent of the country's total in 1991, that of soda ash 62.17 
percent, and that of steel 36.76 percent. 
  Experts involved believe that the Bohai bay economy features 
an industrial development pattern with the heavy chemical 
industry taking the lead. The driving power of this pattern is 
beyond comparison with that of the light industries in south 
China. 
  On the other hand, the population employed in the first 
industry in this region is relatively low compared with that in 
the interior areas. And more farmers there have shifted to 
other industrial sectors. 
  But in the past eight years, the provinces and cities 
involved have tried hard to seek their local interests instead 
of paying attention to the integral ones. 
  This has resulted in redundant construction projects and 
low- 
efficiency production, which waste a lot of resources. 
  It was in the past few years that the local governments have 
been aware of the importance of the regional economic 
cooperation in their own development. 
  As a result, a new port with a handling capacity of 35 
million tons will be put into operation by the year 2000 in 
Tangshan (Hebei Province) through the joint efforts of Beijing 
and Tangshan city. 
  Also, Beijing and Tianjin have jointly invested 40 million 
yuan to build China's biggest liquid chemicals berth in Tianjin. 
  A Bohai Economic Cooperation Development Stock Company is 
expected to go into operation this year. 
  All these indicate that a third economic zone is rising in 
north China that will exert great influence on the country's 
economic development.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Model Cities Set For Urban Reform"] </F>
  [Text] The central government has selected 17 cities to 
carry out "comprehensive urban reforms' and serve as national 
models for how to develop a socialist market system. 
  The reform package is designed to push forward urban reform 
in a comprehensive manner, instead of focusing on only the 
business sector, said Guo Shuqing, director of the Comprehensive 
Department under the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economic System yesterday in Beijing. 
  The pilot cities include Changchun, Harbin, Anshan and 
Shenyang in Northeast China; Tianjin, Tangshan. Xian and Yantai 
in North China: Nanjing, Ningbo, Tongling and Changzhou in East 
China; Wuhan in Central China; Chengdu and Chongqing in 
Southwest China; and Quanzhou and Guangzhou in South China. 
  The reforms to be implemented in these cities will focus on 
three areas this year. 
  First is the reform of the property ownership system to 
transform State-owned enterprises into modern corporations. 
This effort will go hand-in-hand with developing the finance, 
real estate, labour and technology markets, the official said. 
  The second area will be the improvement of the pension and 
unemployment insurance systems. At the same time, housing 
reform will be hastened by selling houses, raising rents and 
building more houses for ordinary salary-earners. 
  Thirdly, education, science and technology will be reformed 
in line with the development of a market economy. 
  The pilot cities are also encouraged to move faster to 
reform 
government functions. 
  Guo stressed that these cities will not enjoy any 
preferential treatment. 
  "Preferential policies are counter to the idea of a market 
economy, which requires competition on equal footing and 
adherence to international practices," he said. 
  The 17 cities are located not only in the rich eastern 
provinces, but are also in the relatively poor central and 
western provinces. 
  "The purpose of this drive is to speed up reforms in inland 
cities and help them get rid of poverty," Guc added. 
  Guo's commission will be responsible for designing standards 
for the model reforms and it plans to set up a liaison 
association for mayors of these pilot cities, which is expected 
to give them chance to exchange information on their reform 
experiences.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 23 (XINHUA) -- China's reform and 
opening drive has helped remote areas, mostly inhabited by 
ethnic nationalities, develop their economies. 
  The northwestern Gansu Province, home to 44 minority 
nationalities, is an example. 
  The people of minority nationalities have been driven by the 
current nationwide economic tide to get involved in various 
businesses such as commodity transportation, business and 
sightseeing. 
  The local people of the Hui, Tibetan, Dongxiang and Salar 
nationalities transport local products, daily necessities and 
garments to Sichuan Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, in 
return taking back arts and crafts and medicinal herbs. 
  Moreover, some local farmers have set up joint ventures in 
co- operation with business people from India, Sikkim and Bhutan. 
  Uygur-nationality people who live in the Qilian mountains 
have developed scenic spots to attract tourists. 
  The province's Kazak Autonomous County of Aksay and 
Mongolian 
Autonomous County of Subei have established economic 
co-operation ties with Kazakhstan and Mongolia, respectively. 
  A number of markets for leather, wool, timber and tea have 
emerged in the province. Some of its products are exported to 
Hong Kong, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Southeast 
Asian countries. 
  This economic prosperity has in return promoted unity and 
stability in Gansu. Some of the richer local people have funded 
the building of schools and roads.

  [Text] Taiyuan, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Three provinces in 
northern, south-western and central China have been benefited 
economically by their regional cooperation over the past decade. 
  Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, three neighboring provinces along 
the middle reaches of the Yellow River, are now expanding their 
cooperation in all aspects of economy, especially in transport, 
energy and chemical industries, as well as agriculture. 
  The provinces share a triangle plain area, where the Yellow 
River flows south and then turns east. Covering a total of 
40,000 square kilometers, the triangle area has 30 countries and 
cities with a population totalling 11 million. 
  Although they have been neighbors along the Yellow River, 
the 
provinces had never had any cooperation with one another, 
because they had been under independent regional administrations 
in China. Provinces and autonomous regions in different 
administrational regions hardly cooperated in economy or culture 
in the past. 
  It was not until 1986 that some departments of the State 
Council initiated a plan for the three provinces to start 
economic cooperation in the triangle area. 
  With further reforms and opening up, China has encouraged 
regional cooperation across the country. So far dozens of 
provinces and cities have expanded cooperation with their 
neighbors. 
  The on-going cooperation involving the south-western 
provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou has promoted the local 
economies. The same is true for the cooperation schemes 
embracing provinces and cities on the middle and lower reaches 
of the Chang Jiang River and around Bohai Bay. They are now 
playing a crucial role in the economy of the whole of China. 
  Given best opportunities for regional cooperation at the 
time, the three neighbors along the Yellow River have worked out 
a scheme together to promote their local economy, especially in 
the triangle area. 
  Costing more than 100 million yuan, the Sanmenxia Bridge 
across the Yellow River started to be used at the end of last 
year. It now contributes much to the coal transport from 
Shanxi, a province abundant in coal, to Henan where power energy 
is in short supply. 
  In the past, coal was carried across the Yellow River by 
ferry. An annual amount of only 600,000 tons of coal was 
ferried. Passengers would wait two or three hours to queue up 
for the ferry. 
  The 1,300-meter bridge has not only put an end to the ferry 
between the two provinces across the Yellow River, but also 
links up with a national highway leading from Hohhot City in 
northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Beihai City 
in south-west China's Guangxi Autonomous Region. 
  Another big bridge now being built across the Yellow River 
in 
the triangle area is expected to improve the traffic conditions 
in the area after it is put into use this October. 
  The three provinces have technological cooperation as well 
to 
promote their major industries. A total of one billion yuan has 
been invested in their industrial and agricultural projects. 
  Three thermal power plants with a total annual generating 
capacity of six million kw have been set up in the provinces. 
Large plants for aluminium, synthetic ammonia, phosphate 
fertilizers and urea have been built as well. 
  The provinces have also upgraded their low-yield land and 
land bordering the Yellow River. 
  Over the past decade, the trade between the cities and 
counties in the triangle area has amounted to more than 300 
million yuan. 
  The gross product of the region now is twice the 1985 
figure, 
and its general industry and agriculture product is 3.4 times 
the figure of 1985.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 24 (XINHUA) -- A four-day national 
commodity trade fair has closed in north China's port city of 
Tianjin, with an estimated trade volume of over 6.3 billion 
yuan, topping last fall's record in Shanghai, an internal trade 
official said. 
  He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade, spoke at the 
opening of the trade fair, saying that from now on a national 
commodity trade fair will be held every spring and fall in both 
Tianjin and Shanghai. 
  The official said that there are many reasons to choose 
these 
two big cities to host the nationwide trade fairs. 
  Tianjin and Shanghai were China's trade centers in the past, 
he said, adding that, being locating at the mouths of big 
rivers, they both had developed good transport systems by air, 
land and water. 
  He said that over the past few years both municipal 
governments have taken many forceful steps to restore their 
prestige as business centers. A number of large-sized markets 
and modern trade centers have been built in these two cities. 
  In Tianjin there are now 22 trading centers for production 
necessities, with a trade volume of 35.4 billion yuan in the 
first quarter this year, a sturdy 65 percent rise over the total 
last year, the official said. 
  In contrast, he said, Shanghai's total commodity retail 
sales 
last year reached 65.35 billion yuan, increasing 33.5 percent 
over the previous year. 
  National commodity trade fairs were staged in Shanghai in 
the 
fall of 1992 and 1993. This has laid the groundwork for the 
city to be a business center for the country, he said. 
  But there is a need to build another such trade center in 
north China around Bohai Bay, he said, adding that Tianjin 
appears to be the ideal choice.

  [Text] Yichang, Hubei Province, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China 
started construction on the Three Gorges Dam as ground was 
broken on a temporary set of ship locks here this morning in 
Yichang, central China's Hubei Province. 
  So far, earth work on three big projects for the Three 
Gorges 
Dam has begun on one side of the dam, including permanent ship 
locks, a power station and the temporary ship lock and lift 
system. 
  Earth and rock work for these three projects adds up to 
39.24 
million cubic meters, accounting for one-third of the dam's 
total. 
  The first phase of the permanent ship locks work, which 
started on April 17, is 3,800 meters long and nearly 100 meters 
in depth. The two-way five-staged locking and lifting system 
will have an annual handling capacity of 50 million tons and is 
to be the biggest of its sort in the world. 
  The one-way one-staged temporary ship locks with a handling 
capacity of 3,000 tons aims to ensure normal water traffic 
during the dam's construction.

1994 Adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui

  [Text] Through examination and after consulting the 
Examination Committees' report on the provincial economic and 
social development plan as well as fiscal budget, the Second 
Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress has 
decided to approve the 1994 Anhui provincial economic and social 
development plan and also the "Report on the Implementation of 
the 1993 Anhui Provincial Economic and Social Development Plan 
and the Draft Plan for 1994" made by Chairman Huang Yuezhong of 
the provincial Planning Commission. 
  This is a crucial year for promoting reform in an all-round 
manner and for accelerating the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure. Following the guidelines of the 
Second Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, 
governments at various levels should have a good grasp of the 
relations between reform, development, and stability; should 
further deepen various reforms; should strengthen and improve 
macrocontrol; should strictly control the increase of commodity 
prices; should show actual concern for the living condition of 
the masses; and should promote a sustained, rapid, and sound 
development of the national economy. It is necessary to place 
the development of agriculture first; promote all-round 
development of the rural economy; increase the peasants' income; 
vigorously promote the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system; improve the economic structure; quicken technological 
progress; strengthen operations and management; increase 
economic efficiency; effectively improve the investment 
structure; attach importance to building key projects; open up 
wider to the outside world; and seriously attach importance to 
education, science, and technological work. Governments at 
various levels throughout the entire province must improve their 
style, struggle in unity, and mobilize and rely on the masses to 
fulfill the 1994 economic and social development plan in an 
all-round manner.

<F P=106> ["Resolution Adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth </F>
Anhui Provincial People's Congress on 12 April 1994 Concerning 
the Work Report Submitted by the Anhui Provincial People's 
Congress Standing Committee"] 
  [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial 
People's Congress has examined the work report submitted by the 
Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. 
The report was presented by Vice Chairman Shao Ming on behalf 
of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing 
Committee. The session maintains that the Standing Committee, 
in light of the requirements adopted in the resolution of the 
First Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, 
has earnestly discharged its constitutional and lawful 
responsibilities and made new headway in all sectors on the 
basis of the work accomplished by the Seventh Anhui Provincial 
People's Congress Standing Committee. The work accomplished in 
1993 as summarized in the report is factual, and the assignments 
set for this year are realistic and practical. The meeting has 
decided to approve the report. 
  The meeting maintains that the Standing Committee should 
continue to adhere to the guidance provided by the party's basic 
line as well as by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics; should follow through 
with the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, and the 
10th Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial 
Party Committee; and should earnestly implement the party 
Central Committee's basic principle for this year's assignments. 
Focusing on economic construction, the Standing Committee 
should consider it its basic task to promote socialist democracy 
and build a legal system; should exert positive efforts in 
discharging all its constitutional and lawful responsibilities 
and authority; and should obey and serve the prevalent 
requirement of "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening 
up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and 
maintaining stability" so that its role as a permanent 
organization of the local state power organ can be brought into 
full play. The Standing Committee should consider it its top 
priority to intensify economic legislation, to display the 
spirit of reform, to promptly and efficiently draw up local laws 
and regulations, and to earnestly implement the province's 
five-year plan for legislation. The Standing Committee should 
intensify its supervision over the implementation of laws and 
other work, attaching special importance to inspecting and 
supervising law enforcement so as to safeguard the dignity of 
the law and uphold the authority of the law. The Standing 
Committee must continue to intensify the publicity and education 
of the legal system so the public will become more law 
conscious. It should forge closer ties with the deputies and 
the people, build the Standing Committee into a stronger body, 
work earnestly, and proceed with an exploratory spirit so as to 
make new contributions to Anhui's reform, opening up, and 
modernization.

  [Text] The Third Plenary Meeting of the Second Session of 
the Eighth Provincial People's Congress was held yesterday 
morning. The meeting was presided over by Huang Changxi, the

Wang Jichao, Wu Xintao, Li Xiuji, Zhang Guman, Chen Mingyi, Chen 
Changji, Chen Junjie, Yi Bailu, Zhou Yifeng, Ke Lianmei, Zhong 
Leixing, and Dai Yongshan. 
  Entrusted by the Standing Committee of the Provincial 
People's Congress, Vice Chairman Yuan Qitong first made a report 
to the meeting on the work of the Standing Committee since the 
First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress. 
  He indicated: 1) The pace of local legislation has been 
speeded up so as to meet the requirements for the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure. 2) Supervision has 
been strengthened to ensure smooth progress in the work in 
various fields of endeavor. 3) Close ties with deputies to the 
people's congresses and the masses of people have been 
maintained, and the deputies' role has been further 
strengthened. 4) Proper guidance has been given to the election 
of new county and township governments, the election task has 
been completed successfully, and the building of political power 
at the grass-roots units has been augmented. 5) The building of

the Standing Committee has continuously been improved. 
  Yuan Qitong said: Since the beginning of 1994, some 
achievements have been made in the work of the Standing 
Committee, but there are still many inadequacies. Problems such 
as how to enable supervisors to meet the requirements of the new 
situation, how to bring the role of Standing Committee members 
and deputies better into play, and how to make the Standing 
Committee accept supervision by the deputies earnestly need 
examination and improvement. 
  In his report, he also put forth the guidelines and primary 
tasks of the work of the Standing Committee for this year. Fang 
Zhongbing, president of the provincial higher people's court, 
and Zheng Yizheng, chief procurator of the provincial people's 
procuratorate, delivered their own work reports at the meeting. 
  Yesterday afternoon, the meeting voted to adopt the decision 
on accepting the request of Jia Qinglin to resign his 
governorship and expressed its satisfaction with Jia Qinglin's 
work as governor. The meeting also approved the election method 
of the Second Session of the Eighth Provincial People's 
Congress. The current meeting will hold a by-election for the 
Standing Committee chairman, two Standing Committee members, and 
the governor of the provincial people's government.

(2799 1420 3152) and Shih Ping (0670 0365): "Huian Chosen as 
the Site for the Fujian Nuclear Power Plant; Feasibility Studies 
Have Been Approved"] 
  [Text] Quanzhou, 23rd--Shanqian Township in Fujian's Huian 
County has been chosen as the site for the third nuclear power 
plant, after the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong and 
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. A feasibility 
study on the site was approved a few days ago. 
  The township in Huian County is the only site among the 
three 
initially picked by state nuclear power departments in Fujian 
that is not near an earthquake zone. Following numerous surveys 
and scientific demonstrations, concerned experts finally 
determined that Shanqian Township was the best site for a 
nuclear power plant in the province. The new plant will be 
located in the middle region of coastal Fujian at the mouth of 
Quanzhou Wan, near a hillside and facing the sea, and is 140 km 
north of Fuzhou and 20 km south of Quanzhou. 
  The Huian Nuclear Power Plant project plans to build six 
900,000 kw generating units with a total installed capacity 5.4 
million kw, commanding over 50 billion yuan in total investment. 
Phase one has been listed in the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" and 
will include two 900,000 kw generating units requiring 30 
billion yuan in total investment. The units will be integrated 
with the eastern and central China power grids. 
  Huian County has begun the early phase of preparations for 
the nuclear power plant project in Shanqian township, which 
includes resettling villagers and educating people about nuclear 
power. 
  According to the electricity departments, because the 
project 
requires a huge amount of capital and the province itself is 
short on construction funds, the departments concerned are 
hoping to solve the funding problem by inviting bids and 
attracting foreign capital.

  [Excerpt] The provincial meeting on the work of opening to 
the outside world was held in Jinan on 25 April. Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th 
party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, participants in this meeting conscientiously 
summarized the province's opening up work since the commencement 
of reform and opening up since 1992. In particular, they 
learned from and used for reference the successful experiences 
of fraternal provinces and municipalities, researched and drew 
up the province's general pattern of opening up in the 
foreseeable future, and defined the province's overall goal and 
policy on developing the economy oriented to opening up in the 
next step. Attending the meeting were provincial leading 
comrades Jiang Chunyun, Zhao Zhihao, Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Li 
Zhen, and Lu Maozeng. Li Chunting presided over the meeting. 
  He said: This meeting, held by the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, is an important one 
related to the province's overall economic situation and is a 
major move adopted by the province to accelerate the development 
of the economy oriented to opening up since the issuance of Deng 
Xiaoping's speeches made during his south China trip in spring 
of 1992 and since the convocation of the provincial meeting on 
opening up. The purpose of this meeting is to again mobilize 
the whole province to deepen reform and open even wider to the 
outside world and to further emancipate the mind and seek unity 
in understanding and action in order to push the province's 
opening up towards the orientation of high level, high sphere, 
and in-depth development. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jinan, 3 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Zaozhuang Hengli 
Optics Communications Company in Shandong successfully invented 
our country's first deep-sea fibre optics cable and filled in 
the production gaps in our country's optics communications 
material. 
  Deep-sea fibre optics cable is a kind of fibre optics 
communications cable laid on seabeds. Such cables must be 
highly resistant to water and corrosion, and must be able to 
withstand heavy pounding from the sea. So far such cables are 
only produced by a handful of developed countries such as the 
United States, Germany, and Britain. Our successful invention 
was the result of joint research begun last May by the Zaozhuang 
Hengli Optics Communications Company and the No.8 Research 
Center affiliated to the Ministry of Electronics Industry. 
Tests conducted by fibre optics communications research and 
monitoring centers in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other 
localities have proved that the cable's performance has reached 
or surpassed similar products produced abroad. Batch production 
of the cables has begun.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 25 (XINHUA)--One hundred and 
twenty-nine multi-national companies have invested in Shanghai, 
China's largest manufacturing center, an official from the 
Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
said today. 
  The official said that in the first quarter of 1994, 
Shanghai 
approved the establishment of 15 businesses involving investment 
by multi-national companies, including the McDonald's Company of 
the United States and the Sony Corporation of Japan. 
  By the end of March, Shanghai had approved the undertaking 
of 
472 major projects, involving 10.24 billion U.S. dollars in 
total overseas investment, he said. 
  Multi-national companies began to invest in Shanghai in 
1980, 
he said. 
  The Swiss elevator manufacturer, Schindler Holding Company, 
took the lead, and was followed by the Foxboro Company, of the 
United States, the Volkswagen Company, of Germany, and the Bell 
Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium. 
  He said that 60 percent of the 129 multi-national companies 
began investing in Shanghai in 1993. 
  He praised these companies for helping speed up the 
construction of the Pudong new area and build Shanghai into a 
major economic, financial and trade center in Asia. 
  The Du Pont Company, of the United States, began to 
cooperate 
with Shanghai in the 1970s, in the form of merchandise trade, he 
said. 
  In the 1980s, the company began transferring technology to 
its business partners in Shanghai. In the 1990s it began 
combining direct investment with technology transfer, the 
official said. 
  To date, the company has set up a joint venture involving at 
least 10 million U.S. dollars in investment in the Pudong new 
area, where flexible policies are being pursued to encourage 
Chinese and overseas investors. 
  It is now negotiating with research institutes in Shanghai 
on 
co- production of substitutes for freon (used in refrigerators 
and aerosols), he said. 
  In 1992 the Sharp Corporation of Japan launched a joint 
venture -- capable of building 200,000 air conditioners a year 
-- in the Pudong new area, he said. 
  The company has decided to increase its investment in 
Shanghai and transfer production of other electrical appliances 
to the city, he said. 
  The Bell Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium, plans to 
site all its new investment projects in China in the Jinqiao 
Export processing zone in Pudong. 
  The American Telegram and Telephone Company has set up three 
joint ventures in Shanghai, the official said. 
  These ventures have achieved high economic returns by 
combining American managerial expertise with specific conditions 
in Shanghai, he said. 
  In 1993, the American company's business volume, including 
economic returns from their joint ventures, in China amounted to 
200 million U.S. dollars, half of which came from its 
Shanghai-based ventures, he said.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A modern mobile 
telephone production line started operating early this month in 
Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province. 
  It is expected to produce the world's up-to-date 9900X 
mobile 
phones for this country's large telecommunications market. 
  With an annual production capacity of 400,000 mini mobile 
phones, the production line is another important landmark for

from Motorola, the U.S. blue-chip company. 
  According to sources from the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, China has registered 480,000 subscribers of 
mobile telephones, 2.67 times the total figure for all the 
previous years.

  [Text] The provincial government held an enlarged plenary 
meeting in Guangzhou from 14 to 15 April to review the economic 
condition in the province in the first quarter of this year, 
forecast this year's economic development trend, discuss 
solutions to prominent problems in the present economic 
operation, and assign tasks for the next stage. 
  Executive Vice Governor Lu Ruihua presided over the meeting 
and delivered a concluding speech on six problems that badly 
need to be resolved in the reform and development process of the 
province. These six problems are: 
  1) It is necessary to face reality squarely and work in a 
down- to-earth manner to resolve the problem of a shortage of 
funds and the strong demand for funds. 2) It is necessary to 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and to keep the 
drastic rise of the general price level down. 3) It is 
necessary to stabilize grain output, strive to increase grain 
production, and stop the slump in grain output. 4) It is 
necessary to conscientiously carry out fiscal and tax reform and 
ensure a steady increase in financial revenue. 5) It is 
necessary to strictly exercise self-discipline and carry out the 
anticorruption struggle in a deep-going way. 6) It is necessary 
to properly support reforms with a view to expediting reform 
actively and appropriately.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently, 
public security organs and the border guards in the cities of 
Shantou, Huizhou, and Foshan in Guangdong Province cracked three 
major cases of illegal emigration organized by lawbreakers 
inside and outside the mainland. They detained 153 illegal 
emigrants from Fujian and Hunan and seized four organizers [she 
tou 5748 7333] from Taiwan and the mainland. 
  On 20 March, the frontier guards brigade of Huidong County 
and the Apojiao branch of the Huidong Border Defense Station 
received information from the public: A boat carrying illegal 
emigrants was intercepted at sea off Huangbujiao Cape, and 33 
people who tried to emigrate illegally to Hong Kong were seized. 
  On 12 April, after public security and border defense organs 
received information that the Taiwan fishing boat "Risheng 17," 
which was berthed in Shantou, planned to carry illegal emigrants 
from the coastal area of Huidong County, they immediately took 
action to intercept the boat. That afternoon, after the fishing 
boat left Shantou, it was detained by the Shantou Public 
Security Sub-bureau. The captain of the ship admitted that a 
boss called Li Chun-hsiung ordered him to carry more than 100 
illegal emigrants by sea between Huidong and Hong Kong to Mexico. 
  On 15 April, the Guangdong Provincial Border Defense Bureau 
received information that more than 100 people from Fujian had 
gathered in the Banyuedao Holiday Village in Nanhai City, 
Guangdong Province, and planned illegal emigration. The 
provincial public security department organized and commanded 
the action and dispatched policemen from Foshan and Nanhai to 
search Baoyuedao and round up people who had tried to emigrate 
illegally. As a result, 99 people from Fujian who had tried to 
emigrate illegally were detained.

  [Text] Having a correct understanding of the situation, 
further achieving unity in thinking, and earnestly solving the 
problems cropping up in the course of reform and development in 
areas such as finance, agriculture, state-owned industrial 
enterprises, taxation, and commodity prices were the major 
contents of the important report Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered 
at the meeting of prefectural commissioners and directors, 
mayors, and county magistrates held yesterday. 
  Party, government, and Army leaders attending the meeting 
were Chen Bangzhu, Yang Zhengwu, Liu Fusheng, Liu Zheng, Pang 
Weiqiang, Hu Biao, Wu Xiangdong, Wang Keying, Shen Ruiting, (Yu 
Haicaho), (Liu Yie), Zhu Dongyang, Zhou Bohua, Ban Guiyu, He 
Wenbin, (Zhou Kanning), Long Yuxian, (He Xiaoqin), and (Xu 
Jinfu). 
  At the meeting, Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered a 
comprehensive work report. First, he said: In the first 
quarter of this year, our province's situation was fine on the 
whole. The key to consolidating and developing the fine 
situation lies in having a firm grasp of the overall situation 
of seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider the 
outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
Particular efforts should be made to correctly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. 
  When discussing the issue of state-owned industrial 
enterprises in the course of reform and development, Governor 
Chen said: Invigorating state-owned industrial enterprises is 
the greatest difficulty in the current economy. Turning losses 
into profits is the outstanding problem in current industrial 
production. The provincial authorities are responsible for 
helping 100 major enterprises turn their losses into profits and 
must complete their objective. 
  On the agricultural issue, Governor Chen stressed: The 
province's goal of striving for 76 million mu of land sown to 
grain crops and a total grain output of over 50 billion jin for 
this year must be attained. We should strive for 6 million dan 
of cotton. While doing a good job of production, all localities 
must attach importance to grain and cotton purchases. While 
doing a good job of grain and cotton production, they must pay 
keen attention to readjusting the structure of agricultural 
production, further develop the secondary and tertiary 
industries in the rural areas, and ensure that all peasants will 
have an additional income of 100 yuan this year. 
  The governor also urged that banks in all localities should 
put stress on deposits and continue to rectify the financial 
order. Financial departments should open more sources of revenue 
and pay close attention to revenues, and all localities should 
work hard to develop the "shopping market" and "rice bag" 
projects in the urban areas and the supply of capital goods in 
the rural areas, and stabilize the market and commodity prices. 
  At the meeting, Yang Zhengwu, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, delivered an important report on the 
issues of social and political stability and structural reform.

  [Text] Yesterday [17 April], at a provincial meeting 
attended by commissioners, prefectural chiefs, mayors, and 
county magistrates, the provincial government commended and 
awarded 20 counties, cities, and regions, including Youxian 
County and others, whose total production output of township and 
town enterprises topped one billion yuan in 1993; 140 townships 
and towns including Xiangbei in Changsha County whose total 
production output of township and town enterprises reached 100 
million yuan; and two units including the village of Jinyuanshan 
in Jinhuahu Township of the city of Yueyang, and the Langli 
automobile body plant in Changsha County. The honorific title 
of "Township and Town Enterprise Entrepreneur in Hunan Province" 
was also conferred on 100 comrades, including Comrade Tao 
Guoqing and others. 
  Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Comrade Yang 
Zhengwu. Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying made a work report 
on township and town enterprises. He said: The CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council have promulgated a series of 
measures for economic structural reform. Such economic reform 
will, in the long run, benefit economic development as a whole, 
and the development of township and town enterprises as well. 
However, in the course of implementing some specific measures, 
and especially those connected with financial, tax and monetary 
reform, township and town enterprises are directly affected. It 
is obvious that those measures will give sharp shock to some 
trades and services, and enterprises with poor economic 
efficiency in particular. This has required that leaders at all 
levels strengthen their confidence and determination in speeding 
up reform and development, and truly do well in ensuring a 
smooth transition in light of practical conditions. Township 
and town enterprises must deepen their internal reform, further 
improve their quality, and strengthen their capability in 
dealing with emergencies and enduring difficulties. On the one 
hand, they must truly do well in adjusting industrial setups and 
product mix, and they must strengthen and improve internal 
management of enterprises to promote their export-oriented 
economy. On the other hand, the development strategy for 
township and town enterprises should be changed from the 
previous main reliance on extensive expansion into tapping 
intensive potentials to broaden enterprises in scale, promote 
their technical level, and upgrade their products. 
  Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying also stressed: Pursuing 
a shareholding system and a shareholding cooperative system is a 
nucleus of deepening the present reform of township and town 
enterprises. Through popularizing the shareholding and 
shareholding cooperative system, various localities must solve 
the three main difficult problems facing the development of 
township and town enterprises: Enterprises' vague equity 
relationships, severe degeneration of operational mechanisms, 
and utterly insufficient input of funds. 
  In his speech, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: 
Governments at all levels and various departments must support 
township and town enterprises in terms of policies, input, 
import and export trade, and mass media guidance, whereas 
township and town enterprises must scale new heights in terms of 
mechanisms, management, technical progress, and their ability to 
earn foreign exchange. This will enable them to make new 
progress in the production of the second quarter.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA)--Building materials have 
become the third biggest industry of Beijing, after the 
automotive and electronics industries. 
  Officials of the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction 
Committee said that the industry had a turnover of 7.5 billion 
yuan and exports worth 31.33 million U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  A large part of the value was created in modern building 
materials, such as cement, new wall material, sound-proof, fire- 
proof and water-proof materials, porcelain ware, decoration 
materials and hardware, rather than in bricks, sand and other 
traditional products, the officials said. 
  According to the officials, energy-saving and other 
high-tech 
new building materials will be the direction for future 
development.

Corporate Club, the first of its kind in China, has been set up 
here to promote economic exchanges between Chinese and overseas 
companies. 
  An official of the club said that it would provide 
information and services to members to help them find 
cooperation opportunities throughout the world. 
  Members of the club will also share experience and 
information in enterprise management and operation, he said. 
  The club currently has 51 members--34 Chinese enterprises, 
11 
foreign-funded businesses and six foreign firms. 
  These members are engaged in such sectors as manufacturing, 
commerce, urban construction, trade, science and technology and 
tourism, the official said. 
  He said that all Beijing-based state-owned enterprises, 
collectively-owned businesses, foreign-funded firms and offices 
of foreign companies can apply to join the club, provided they 
abide by the articles of association of the club. 
  Economists here said that the establishment of this club is 
a 
need posed by the creation of a market economy in China, because

firms enter the global market and facilitate the establishment 
of a modern enterprise system in China.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter from Beijing": "Beijing Grain Shops Have No </F>
Grain to Sell For a Month; Grain Growers Are Cornering the Grain 
Market"] 
  [Text] In mid-April, an engineer who is a native of south 
China living in Beijing suddenly discovered that several grain 
shops in the vicinity were only selling flour, and rice was no 
longer available in these shops. Infuriated, he telephoned the 
municipal government to ask about this and learned that many 
grain shops in Beijing had had no rice to sell for almost a 
month. In the free market, individual peddlers are selling rice 
at a price of 2.4 yuan per kg, 50 percent higher than the 
government limited price. This is hardly unacceptable to 
southerners, who are used to eating rice as a staple but not 
other grains. 
  Some experts said that this situation in the Beijing grain 
market is the result of contention between different interest 
groups which use rice as a pawn. 
  At the end of last year, grain prices began to soar in some 
southern Chinese provinces, and this astounded the high-level 
CPC leadership. The State Council immediately took measures to 
control grain prices to prevent overall inflation. Price 
inspection teams were sent out one after another, and many 
cities introduced grain price limits. 
  Some officials optimistically estimated that grain prices 
could be controlled. Several months have passed and these 
measures which were effective under the planned economic 
structure--a structure which was backed by state monopoly over 
the purchase and marketing of grain--have been mercilessly 
restricted by the market mechanism. 
  In this "contention for rice," the government and consumers 
are on one side whereas grain selling departments, officials in 
grain producing regions, and peasants are on the other. An 
assistant in a grain department said that the government had set 
the rice price at 1.6 yuan per kg, but now the purchase cost of 
rice is 1.7 yuan per kg, so the more rice it purchased, the 
heavier losses it is suffering. The government's attitude is 
very clear: Grain shops may stop selling rice but may not sell 
rice at a high price. So grain shops stopped selling rice. 
Similarly, in some grain producing provinces, the government 
and grain growers are cornering the grain market to wait for an 
upward adjustment in grain purchase prices which will be 
introduced soon. Thus grain purchasing personnel sent out by 
Beijing Municipality have found doors slammed in their face. 
The good old days when of all parts of the country supported 
Beijing at all costs under the planned economic structure has 
ended once and for all. 
  Reports say that to control rice prices, the government will 
use the grain reserve fund to purchase rice from grain producing 
regions at high prices and then sell it at low prices. The 
relevant government department is worried that this sum of money 
will not be recovered after being spent. How long will the 
government be able to play this "game?" 
  The present situation reminds us of the "combat" against 
inflation carried out by the old and new regimes in Shanghai 
40-odd years ago. In 1948, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was then in 
charge of economic control, introduced monetary system reform in 
Shanghai; to curb inflation, he adopted measures to limit prices 
and even resorted to the use of economic policemen for the 
enforcement of the measures. But Shanghai industrialists and 
businessmen declared that there were no commodities. The 
confrontation between these administrative measures and the 
market mechanism resulted in Chiang Ching-kuo's failure. 
  Years later the newly born CPC regime encountered a 
situation 
similar to the one Chiang Ching-kuo had met. Under Chen Yun's 
plan, the new regime skillfully injected the liberated areas' 
cotton and coal reserves into the market to control prices. As 
a result, the tactic of cornering the market failed and 
businessmen who wanted to become wealthy by "honest and 
dishonest means" suffered heavy losses. Subsequently the CPC 
won a key battle in curbing nationwide inflation. 
  Forty-odd years have passed, and the "contention for rice" 
in 
Beijing reminds us that administrative measures which were 
effective under the single planning structure in the past are no 
longer "panaceas." Introducing market mechanisms and 
administrative measures simultaneously and establishing a new 
price control system to curb inflation are difficult problems 
for a government in an economic transformation period. 
  We will soon know the outcome of the ongoing "contention for 
rice" in Beijing. Reports say that after a special meeting is 
held, the municipal government's relevant department will 
allocate a fund and send rice purchasing teams. Then millions 
of kilograms of reserve rice will be injected into the market.

  [Text] On 5 April, the provincial party committee convened 
a rural work meeting in Guiyang, at which Chen Shineng, 
provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial 
governor, relayed the spirit of a central rural work meeting 
held in late March of this year, and Provincial Party Committee 
Secretary Liu Fangren delivered an important speech entitled 
"Strengthen Leadership, Firmly Grasp Implementation, Make Every 
Possible Endeavor To Reap a Good Agricultural Harvest in 1994." 
  Secretary Liu Fangren's speech was divided into three parts: 
  1. To profoundly understand the great importance of this 
year's agricultural and rural work; 
  2. To successfully accomplish this year's basic agricultural 
and rural work tasks; 
  3. To further strengthen party leadership over agricultural 
and rural work. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren said in his speech: Ever since the 
last rural work meeting held by the provincial party committee 
in late February of this year, all areas across the province 
have accomplished a great deal and have scored gratifying 
results in respect of implementing the spirit of the last 
central rural work meeting and the spirit of the last provincial 
party committee rural work meeting. In general, the province's 
rural situation has remained excellent. Nonetheless, we have 
not yet fulfilled all agricultural and rural tasks, satisfied 
all agricultural and rural demands, or implemented to the letter 
all agricultural and rural policies. 
  We are still confronted with a difficult situation in this 
regard and with such thorny problems as increasingly high prices 
for agricultural production means, slow growth of summer crops, 
lack of agricultural funds and loans, slow increase of peasant 
income, and so on. Should these thorny problems fail to be 
resolved, the province's overall agricultural and rural 
situation would be adversely affected. In view of this 
situation, party committees and governments at all levels in the 
province should bravely stand up to difficulties, strengthen 
confidence, proceed from the overall interests of party work, 
conscientiously implement to the letter all basic central 
principles concerning this year's agricultural and rural work, 
profoundly understand the great importance of successful 
agricultural and rural work in 1994, and properly handle the 
strategic relations between reform, development, and stability. 
  They must expand contacts with the outside world and with 
the 
provinces and regions to the east, ensure a sufficient food 
supply, emancipate the mind in a down-to-earth manner, implement 
to the letter each and every central and provincial agricultural 
and rural policy, stabilize the grain growing area, and raise 
the per unit area yield of grain and total grain output. They 
should step up wheat field management in the latter half of this 
year's wheat growing season, successfully nurse rice seedlings 
in hothouses, under plastic films, and in two stages, develop 
and transplant more maize strains with more nutrition, take 
steps to protect more than one million mu of high-yield rice and 
maize fields from excessive rainfall in spring and summer, turn 
more dry land into irrigated farmland as soon as possible, and 
make every possible effort to increase income on the part of the 
peasants by boosting diversified economic growth. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren noted: This year, we should strive to 
raise the peasants per capita net income by 60 yuan over last 
year on average throughout the province, by more than 80 yuan in 
better- off areas where conditions permit, and by more than 50 
yuan in poverty-stricken areas. Approximately 10 million people 
currently lack food and clothing across the province. In view 
of this situation, we should provide more assistance to and help 
poverty- stricken areas successfully shake off poverty, work out 
a new plan aimed at assisting poverty-stricken areas, carry out 
scientific farming, vigorously build a batch of pillar 
industries, energetically build infrastructure facilities, push 
ahead with education development in poverty-stricken areas, and 
enable poverty- stricken areas shake off poverty as soon as 
possible. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren asserted: We should closely combine 
four types of work, specifically, family planning, economic 
exploitation of poverty-stricken areas, assistance to 
poverty-stricken areas, and spring plowing production. We 
should unswervingly carry out these four types of work in a 
down-to-earth manner and make unreserved efforts to keep the 
province's natural population growth rate at and below 14 per 
thousand this year. We should successfully build grassroots 
organizations in rural areas and ensure rural economic 
development with political and organizational guarantees. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren urged all areas across the province to 
strengthen party leadership over agricultural and rural work. 
To this end, he stressed, prefectural, autonomous prefectural, 
and county party committees should put more energy toward 
agricultural work, earnestly improve work style, provide 
agricultural production with better services, and institute a 
responsibility system under which party and government leaders 
at all levels are held fully responsible for agricultural and 
rural work and are assessed in light of local agricultural and 
rural work achievements. The party committees at all levels 
across the province should also organize broad masses of cadres 
and people to set off a spring plowing upsurge at once and 
concentrate efforts, time, and human resources on spring plowing 
production over the next two months with a view to successfully 
winding up spring plowing production before the summer solstice. 
  A number of provincial party and government leaders, 
including Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Li Wanlu, Xia Guohua, Huang 
Yao, Hu Tiansheng, Wang Anze, Gong Xianyong, Mo Shiren, and Zhu 
Yaoguo, attended the rural work meeting, at which the province's 
prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party and 
government leaders summed up and exchanged experiences of 
implementing the spirit of the last provincial party committee 
rural work meeting.

<F P=106> [By station reporters (Liu Changjiang) and (Ren Youmin); </F>
from the "News" program] 
  [Text] A seven-day regional conference on propaganda and 
ideological work ended in Lhasa in the afternoon of 24 April. 
The meeting pointed out: It is necessary for us to firmly 
grasp the fundamental guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to 
closely revolve our efforts around the central task of economic 
construction; to subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall 
situation of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to 
fulfill the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front in an 
all-round way; and to provide an effective ideological guarantee 
and a favorable environment of public opinion for accelerating 
the establishment of a socialist market economic system, for 
promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in 
Tibet [cu jin wo qu guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa 
zhan], for maintaining Tibet's social and political stability, 
unity among nationalities, and unification of the motherland, 
and for expediting Tibet's sweeping social and economic progress. 
  Deputy Secretary Danzim of the autonomous regional party 
committee presided over the conference. Lieque, Buqiong, (Lu 
Huimin), and Puqung, leaders of the autonomous region, attended 
the conference. Du Tai, executive deputy director of the 
Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party 
Committee, delivered a concluding speech. 
  He pointed out: The regional conference on propaganda and 
ideological work is a meeting that has a bearing on the overall 
situation held at a crucial moment of Tibet's reform, opening 
up, and economic development. It is a meeting held by the 
autonomous regional party committee to stress the persistence in 
grasping two links at the same time and the mobilization of the 
whole party to step up propaganda and improve ideological work 
to provide a more effective ideological guarantee and a more 
favorable environment of public opinion for reform, development, 
and stability. Through the meeting, we gained a clearer 
understanding of the situation; reached a consensus; improved 
our understanding; enhanced our vigor; boosted our confidence; 
acquired a clearer understanding of the role played by 
propaganda and ideological work; further defined the fundamental 
guidelines and main tasks of propaganda and ideological work; 
gained a clearer understanding of the responsibility and mission 
shouldered by ourselves; and boosted our confidence in doing a 
good job of propaganda and ideological work. 
  Du Tai said: Propaganda and ideological work have always 
played an important role since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee. They are mainly manifested in the 
fact that every time people's minds were emancipated to a great 
extent, such emancipation invariably promoted great development 
of the productive forces and sweeping social progress. It fully 
proves that the more efforts we make to carry out reform and 
open up, the more necessary it is for us to improve propaganda 
and ideological work. Now is a crucial moment for us to deepen 
reform, open up wider, and accelerate economic development. 
Both the central authorities and regional party committee 
proposed new tasks for and set new demands on propaganda and 
ideological work. We must promote propaganda and ideological 
work to a new level by making fruitful efforts so as to better 
serve the drive to deepen reform and accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system. All the 
fundamental guidelines, basic principles, and ideas and overall 
arrangements for the tasks of propaganda and ideological work 
have been clearly defined for the present and for a certain 
period of time to come. What counts now is that we must 
conscientiously have a thorough understanding of and carry out 
the guidelines of the conference, do solid work, and pay close 
attention to implementation. 
  Du Tai pointed out: If we want to comprehensively fulfill 
the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front and to promote 
the work to a new level, we must further emancipate our minds, 
seek truth from facts, and follow the road of reform and opening 
up. Meanwhile, in compliance with the requirements raised by 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, we must arm the people with 
scientific theory, use correct public opinion to guide them, use 
noble spirit to mold them, and inspire them with excellent works 
[of literature and art]. This is an important mission and a 
glorious responsibility entrusted to us by the new period. Only 
thus can we correctly propagandize the party's theories, line, 
principles, and policies, and give prominence to the keynote of 
our times. 
  To practically succeed in implementing the guidelines of the 
conference, Du Tai stressed: The party committees and 
governments at all levels must further improve their 
understanding; treat the comprehensive implementation of the 
guidelines of the conference as an important matter; practically 
pay close attention to their successful implementation; draw up 
and perfect various measures; and successfully handle the tasks 
to be done now and in the future in a down-to-earth manner. 
They must treat the successful handling of propaganda and 
ideological work in agricultural and pastoral areas as the main 
point for improving propaganda and ideological work in Tibet, 
and handle it accordingly. They must strengthen the building of 
contingents of personnel; they must raise the level of 
propaganda and ideological work; they must improve cadres' 
training and education; and they must continuously enhance the 
political integrity as well as professional proficiency of 
cadres engaged in propaganda and ideological work. If cadres 
want to be qualified for propaganda and ideological work, they 
must have a strong sense of responsibility for and dedication to 
a revolution; unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line; 
maintain close ties with the masses; uphold materialist 
dialectics; have a keen political sense, remain sober-minded, 
and take a clear-cut stand; maintain unity with the CPC Central 
Committee in ideology and in action; and provide an effective 
ideological guarantee and a favorable environment of public 
opinion for Tibet's social stability and economic development.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Raise the Level of Propaganda and </F>
Ideological Work, Strive To Accomplish Our Historical Mission"; 
from the "News" program] 
  [Text] The regional propaganda and ideological work 
conference has come to a successful conclusion. This is a 
significant meeting of the largest scale and highest quality in 
the regional propaganda and ideological front since Tibet's 
peaceful liberation. The spirit of the conference will 
certainly have a far-reaching influence on propaganda and 
ideological work in Tibet, and will contribute positively to its 
reform, development, stability, and all-round social progress. 
Party and government organizations at all levels as well as the 
propaganda and ideological front must earnestly implement the 
spirit of the conference by obtaining a clearer understanding of 
the situation, further emancipating minds, achieving greater 
unity in understanding, and heightening spirits so as to 
effectively strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological 
work throughout the region. 
  Propaganda and ideological work has always been an important 
component of the party's work. In the past four decades since 
Tibet's peaceful liberation, the propaganda and ideological 
front has done a tremendous job and achieved remarkable 
achievements in earnestly implementing the party's basic 
theories and lines in various historical stages to bring about 
momentous changes in Tibetan society and to accomplish the 
party's various tasks. Especially since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the propaganda and 
ideological front has greatly inspired cadres and people 
throughout Tibet to emancipate their minds and change their 
mindsets; it has harnessed the initiative, enthusiasm, and 
creativity of the masses in dedicating themselves to reform and 
the establishment of a socialist market economy. It has also 
effectively promoted the anti-splittist struggle and stability; 
has enriched the people's spiritual and cultural life; has 
publicized the outstanding Tibetan cultural traditions; has 
safeguarded the motherland's unification and unity of 
nationalities; and has facilitated the smooth progress of 
reform, opening up, and modernization construction in Tibet. 
The facts have proved that Tibet's propaganda and ideological 
workers are a contingent of people loyal to the cause of the 
party and the people; who possess special strengths and fighting 
capacity to endure hardships and sacrifice; who are full of 
vigor and vitality; and who can be trusted by the party and the 
people. 
  Under the party's correct leadership, people of all 
nationalities in Tibet are implementing the guidelines of the 
14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary Enlarged 
Session of the Fourth Regional Party Committee; they are 
striving to build a new socialist market economic system. A new 
situation of reform and opening up has emerged in Tibet. In the 
process of this historic change, the propaganda and ideological 
front is confronted with two fundamental tasks: to study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and conscientiously adhere to the party's basic 
line to facilitate Tibet's socialist modernization and safeguard 
the motherland's unification, and to enhance the unity of 
nationalities and oppose splittist forces in order to ensure 
Tibet's social stability. In the final analysis, these two 
fundamental tasks are issues concerning reform, development, and 
stability; they are the main issues of Tibetan social life at 
present and for some time to come in the future. 
  All propaganda and ideological departments in Tibet should 
firmly grasp these issues. They should follow Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's instruction that we should arm our people with 
scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, 
inculcate them with noble ideals, and encourage them with fine 
works of literature and art. They should persist in the 
orientation of serving the people and socialism, and should 
adhere to the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a 
hundred schools of thought contend. They should bring into play 
their specialties and advantages in publicizing the spirits of 
our times, promoting a flourishing socialist literature and art, 
and creating more and better quality intellectual products to 
the delight of the masses. They should continuously satisfy the 
masses' growing demands in spiritual and cultural life, raise 
the level of propaganda and ideological work, enhance propaganda 
effects, and work hard for Tibet's social stability and economic 
growth. 
  The propaganda and ideological front is facing a glorious 
yet 
arduous task. Presently propaganda and ideological departments 
in Tibet are facing difficulties and still cannot cope up with 
the demands in building the two civilizations and in stabilizing 
the situation. However, we are convinced that so long as 
propaganda and ideological departments take the just concluded 
regional propaganda and ideological work conference as a new 
starting point and work hard to forge ahead and fulfill various 
tasks, they will certainly be able to raise the level of 
propaganda and ideological work in Tibet and accomplish the 
historical mission entrusted by our times upon propaganda and 
ideological work.

  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- The cabinet-level 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday [26 April] that it 
would not send a group to mainland China to discuss the March 31 
Qiandao Lake murders until the mainland supplies more 
information about the crime. 
  The MAC statement represented an about-face from its earlier 
call for a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation to visit 
Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province later this week to learn more about 
the mainland's investigation into the March 31 murders, in which 
24 Taiwan tourists and 8 mainlanders were robbed and killed 
while on a pleasure cruise. 
  SEF is Taiwan's non-official conduit for mainland-Taiwan 
relations. 
  MAC asked the mainland to submit autopsy reports and details 
of the crime scenes to SEF before the delegation, comprised of 
SEF officials, retired police detectives and relatives of the 
victims, leaves for Hangzhou. 
  However, mainland authorities have not responded to the 
request. SEF wrote Monday to its mainland counterpart, the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to 
request the information before it decides when to send the 
delegation. 
  MAC official said that the request was made on behalf of the 
relatives of the victims, who said their trip would be futile 
without the proper information and would only endorse Beijing's 
handling of the case. 
  The official said that the delegation's departure would 
depend on ARATS' supplying such information. 
  MAC Deputy Director-General Su Chi said Tuesday that when 
the 
delegation leaves for the mainland, it would not only seek to 
learn the truth behind the crime, it would also try to establish 
a formula for handling future threats to the life and property 
of Taiwan residents on the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan's reliance on the 
mainland Chinese market continued to rise last year, while the 
mainland's trade dependence on Taiwan declined, the government 
said Monday [25 April]. 
  The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which sets the country's 
policy toward Beijing, said exports to the mainland accounted 
for 16.47 percent of Taiwan's total outbound shipments in 1993. 
  It was the highest ratio since the government began to tally 
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in 1981, the 
council noted. In 1992, mainland-bound shipments made up 12.95 
percent of the island's total overseas sales. 
  Imports from the mainland accounted for a modest 1.43 
percent 
of Taiwan's total purchases from abroad in 1993, according to 
MAC tallies. 
  Altogether, two-way trade with the mainland made up 9.32 
percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade, also a new record, the 
council said, quoting statistics released by local and Hong Kong 
customs authorities. 
  Meanwhile, mainland China's trade dependence on Taiwan 
declined last year for the first time since 1986, the council 
said. 
  Indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong made up 4.44 
percent of Mainland China's total foreign trade in 1993, down 
0.03 percent from the 1992 level. 
  Shipments destined for Taiwan accounted for only 1.2 percent 
of the mainland's aggregate overseas sales last year, while 
purchases from Taiwan made up 7.3 percent of its total imports. 
  In addition, the council said that Taiwan has gradually lost 
to the mainland in overseas markets. 
  "The mainland has overtaken U.S. in our two major export 
markets -- the United States and Japan," a MAC official said. 
  Quoting statistics compiled by Taiwan and U.S. authorities, 
the official said America imported U.S.$24.98 billion worth of 
goods from Taiwan last year, up 1.83 percent from 1992, while 
its imports from the mainland rose a hefty 23.17 percent to 
U.S.$31.43 billion. 
  Mainland China's share of the U.S. market stood at 5.47 
percent in 1993, higher than Taiwan's 4.35 percent, the official 
noted. It was the second year in a row Taiwan lost to the 
mainland in the American market. The mainland took a 4.8 
percent share of the U.S. market in 1992, while Taiwan's share 
was 4.67 percent. 
  The mainland has outpaced Taiwan in the Japanese market 
since 
1982 and the gap has widened steadily, the official said. 
  Japan imported U.S.$9.68 billion worth of Taiwan goods last 
year, while its imports from the mainland reached U.S.$20.56 
billion. The mainland commanded an 8.55 percent share of 
Japan's total imports, more than double Taiwan's 4.02 percent 
share. 
  The official noted that increased Taiwan investment on the 
mainland has helped boost the mainland's exports while 
undermining Taiwan's own competitiveness in major overseas 
markets. 
  Many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland produce goods 
similar to their counterparts at home, the official explained. 
Slow technological development has made Taiwan manufacturers 
less competitive than their mainland counterparts, he added. 
  Government tallies show Mainland China remained Taiwan's top 
overseas investment destination last year. Government approved 
outbound investment totaled U.S.$4.83 billion in 1993, of which 
65.61 percent went to the mainland. Hong Kong and mainland 
estimates of Taiwan investment in the mainland are much higher.

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will again protest the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) 
unilateral decision to change the ROC's title at the 
international banking institute to "Taipei, China." 
  Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying, who will lead an ROC 
delegation to the 27th ADB board of directors meeting scheduled 
to open May 3 in Nice, France, said the name change was 
unacceptable and unjust. 
  The unilateral decision to change the name deprived the ROC, 
an ADB founder, of its rights at the international banking 
institution, Li said. 
  Li said he may issue the protest during the meeting either 
directly to the ADB board chairman, or in a statement when he 
makes an oral report. 
  The ADB changed Taiwan's representative name from Chinese, 
Taipei into "Taipei, China" after Beijing joined the group in 
1986. Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in 
protest of the insensitive and unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. 
  Taipei resumed its involvement with the ADB and returned to 
the annual board meeting in 1988 after President Li Teng-hui 
advocated more pragmatic diplomatic measures. 
  The ROC mission protested the name change during a board 
meeting last year by placing a sign reading "under protest" 
above the "Taipei, China" designation.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang 
began a special meeting of its Central Committee on Saturday [23 
April] to consider constitutional-amendment proposals prepared 
by a party task force. 
  The proposals are expected to be endorsed by the committee, 
thus paving the way for some key changes in Taiwan's political 
operations. Associate members of the committee and ranking 
party officials are also attending the meeting to air their 
views. 
  The meeting, which will conclude Sunday, is being held at 
the 
Chungshan Building in Yangmingshan, a Taipei suburb. 
  Speaking at the opening ceremony in his capacity as KMT 
chairman, Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui 
reiterated his idea of a country run by the people. "This is a 
meeting to tell the people of the nation the ruling party's 
determination to push ahead with constitutional reforms so as to 
realize the idea of, 'the power belongs to the whole of the 
people.'" 
  He urged the committee members to build consensus during the 
meeting so as to help accomplish the mission of constitutional 
reform. 
  If endorsed by the meeting, the proposals will be formally 
submitted to the National Assembly, which is scheduled to 
convene later this month. 
  In the draft proposals, the KMT will recommend several key 
changes, including election of the president and vice president 
by popular vote, rather than by members of the National 
Assembly, as has been done in the past; installment of a speaker 
and vice speaker in the National Assembly; and a restriction on 
the premier's right to co-sign the laws promulgated and mandates 
issued by the president. 
  The ruling party will also seek to extend the legislative 
term from three years to four, [words indistinct] limit 
legislator, right of immunity from prosecution for speeches 
delivered during legislative sessions, and to change the 
official name of the "Shanpao (mountain) people" to "aborigines."

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan has decided to 
sign government procurement agreements with contracting parties 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year 
in order to facilitate its entry into the Geneva-based world 
trade regulating body. 
  The cabinet-level GATT task force gave the green light to 
the 
plan late Friday [22 April]. The task force comprises officials 
from the Council for Economic Planning and Development and the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
  Previously, Taiwan rejected such agreements because of the 
great number of state organizations involved. 
  Although the government agreed to the plan, it will seek to 
exclude the International Telecommunications Administration, 
Taiwan Power Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel 
Corp. from the procurement agreements, informed sources said. 
  Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and 
thus adversely affect these state-run companies, the sources 
noted. 
  Under the new plan, they pointed out, the government will 
substantially revise its current procurement practices to come 
into line with the GATT codes. 
  For example, they elaborated, the base price for open 
tenders 
will be lowered from the current NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 50 
million (U.S.$1.88 million) to NT$4.7 million (U.S.$177,000). 
  Moreover, all the bidding procedures will be completely open 
and transparent, they said. 
  Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year. 
All GATT signatories are set to become members of the World 
Trade Organization, which will be given tougher enforcement 
powers to supersede GATT and will start operations between 
January and July next year.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] Two former Iranian military officials have demanded 
at a court hearing that a Taiwan state-run bank return $15 
million that Iran paid for arms that were never delivered. The 
mysterious arms deal began in 1991 when Iran transferred the 
money to a Midland Bank in London to the Taiwan Changhua 
Commercial Bank [sentence as heard]. Iran had wanted to buy 
bullets and other like ammunition from Taiwan's arms dealers for 
use in its eight-year war against Iraq, which ended with a cease 
fire in August 1988. But the Taipei government later turned 
down the sale. 
  (Aduba Hatami) and (Motosher Fatayi) told the Taiwan High 
Court they came to Taiwan in 1981 with another defense ministry 
official but the Taiwan bank rejected their demand for the 
money. The bank said that the money already had been withdrawn 
by three men presenting passports bearing the names of the 
Iranian officials listed by the Midland Bank as the recipients. 
Iran's Defense Ministry filed a lawsuit in the Taipei District 
Court to reclaim the amount. The Changhua Bank argued that its 
clients had been the Midland Bank, not the Iranian Government. 
The local high court did not say when it would deliver its 
final verdict.

  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- German Economic Affairs 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt said Monday [25 April] that he supports 
Taiwan's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  Speaking upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International 
Airport, Rexrodt also said he is visiting Taiwan to help 
strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations. 
  Rexrodt arrived in Taiwan late Monday night at the the head 
of an eight-member delegation. He was met at the airport by 
Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang. 
  Meanwhile, Rexrodt met with Minister of Transportation and 
Communications Liu Chao-shiu on Tuesday to lobby for German 
companies seeking contracts to build Taiwan's proposed 
high-speed railway project. 
  During a meeting with Vice Economic Affairs Minister Hsu 
Kai- 
sheng later in the day, Rexrodt and Hsu discussed the signing of 
a bilateral agreement to avoid double taxation. 
  Hsu said he hopes germany can remove Taiwan from the "high 
tension area" list which Germany uses to prohibit arms sales to 
designated countries. 
  Rexrodt said Germany welcomes Taiwan investment in eastern 
Germany and the establishment of a Taiwan Trade Center in 
Frankfurt to promote bilateral ties. 
  Two-way trade between Taiwan and Germany totaled U.S.$7.73 
billion in 1993 with Germany enjoying a trade surplus of 
U.S.$715 million. Germany is Taiwan's largest trade partner in 
Europe. 
  Rexrodt is scheduled to leave Taipei Tuesday night.

  [Text] Manila, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Monday [25 
April] pledged to reduce import duties on Philippine products by 
an average 18 percent during the first year of its entry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The commitment was made after just three hours of tariff- 
reduction negotiations with the Philippines held at the Ministry 
of Industry and Commerce in Manila. 
  Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of 
Foreign Trade, headed a 13-member delegation at the meeting. 
  Lin said the meeting was harmonious, and that the two sides 
agreed to hold further consultations to work out details of the 
agreement. 
  This was Taiwan's first tariff-reduction meeting with any 
Southeast Asian country. Taiwan has held similar negotiations 
with Australia, [words indistinct], New Zealand, South Africa, 
Turkey, and the United States. 
  Lin and his delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 
Tuesday to conduct similar talks with Malaysia. 
  Bilateral tariff-reduction talks with GATT contacting 
parties 
are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to the 
Geneva- based world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of the year.

  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- J.L. Viljoen, South 
Africa's ambassador to the Republic of China [ROC], opened 
Taiwan voting in his country's first all-race elections when he 
cast his ballot at 7 a.m. 
  All citizens and permanent residents of South Africa above 
the age of 18 residing or traveling here are eligible to vote at 
Taipei's polling station, Viljoen said. 
  The polling station, located at the South African Embassy on 
Tinhua North Road, will remain open until 7 p.m. Tuesday [26 
April], he added. 
  Although a few hundred South Africans have already cast 
their 
ballots, the envoy said he did not know how many voters will 
turn out for the one-day vote. 
  In order to ensure the poll's fairness, the South African 
government invited Chou Nien-tzu, a researcher at National 
Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations, and 
Arlene Lang, a U.S. citizen, to act as observers at the Taipei 
polling station. 
  All the ballot boxes will be sealed and transported back to 
South Africa via express delivery for vote counting, which will 
begin on April 29, Viljoen said. 
  The South African polls, which will elect the president, 
National Assembly, nine governors, and nine regional assemblies, 
opened Tuesday morning and will continue through April 28.

  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation, 
headed by Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of 
Foreign Trade (BOFT), left for Tokyo Tuesday [26 April] to meet 
with Japanese officials on a number of trade issues. 
  Huang said prior to his departure that the main purpose of 
his visit is to push Japan to take effective measures to narrow 
the widening trade gap between the two countries and to seek 
Japan's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Taiwan has long incurred huge trade deficits with Japan. The 
amount reached U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993 and may hit U.S.$16 
billion this year. "We hope Japan can address the trade 
imbalance problem before it develops into a political issue," 
Huang noted. 
  Huang will also hold informal tariff reduction talks with 
Japanese officials under the GATT framework. Although Japan has 
not yet sent Taiwan a "tariff reduction" list, Huang said the 
BOFT has prepared a package of measures to cope with possible 
Japanese requests. 
  "To win Japan's support for our GATT bid, we plan to open 
our 
market to Japanese cigarettes and alcohol before our GATT 
entry," Huang said. 
  Taiwan also plans to remove "area and quota" restrictions on 
16 kinds of fruit imports, including apples, in line with the 
GATT requirements, Huang said. "The liberalization would allow 
such Japanese fruits as apples and pears to enter our market," 
he explained. 
  At present, Taiwan only allows free imports of apples from 
the United States and Canada. 
  Huang said Japan is most concerned about Taiwan's ban on 
imports of Japanese compact cars. Taiwan currently allows free 
imports of American and European compact cars. In line with 
GATT regulations, Taiwan must open its market to Japanese 
compact cars. In consideration of Taiwan's huge trade deficit 
with Japan, Huang said he will ask Japan to voluntarily restrict 
its auto exports to Taiwan. "Such a measure would also help 
minimize the impact on the local auto industry," he added. 
  Huang is scheduled to return to Taipei Friday.

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang 
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) 
warned Sunday that Taiwan's worsening investment environment has 
prompted multinational enterprises to withold investment here. 
  Britain's ICI, U.S.-based Glaxo and DHL, and even Taiwan's 
Acer will cut the size of their business in Taiwan, according to 
an investment willingness survey comissioned by the CEPD. 
  Hsiao said the survey showed that some 30 percent of all 
foreign business groups lacked confidence in Taiwan's investment 
climate and are making plans to gradually withdraw capital from 
Taiwan in the next few years and shift their Asian business 
centers to Singapore or Mainland China. 
  Most manufacturers surveyed said Taiwan's investment climate 
had become worse over the past five years, creating problems in 
their investment and production plans, Hsiao noted. 
  Hsiao explained that the survey listed Taiwan's labor 
shortage, rising labor costs, skyrocketing land prices, low 
administrative efficiency and deteriorating quality of life as 
most affecting manufacturers' investment willingness. 
  If there is no significant improvement in the domestic 
investment climate, some international enterprises will consider 
narrowing their business scale here and may even leave the 
island, Hsiao warned. 
  Hsiao added that the survey results have stunned the 
government, which planned for increased investment after the 
completion of the six-year national development plan in 1996. 
The results also run counter to the government's plans to 
develop Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operations center, 
Hsiao said. 
  Some of the multinational enterprises already have concrete 
plans to cancel new investment in Taiwan, which may have a 
negative impact on the island's economy, Hsiao said. 
  Improving the domestic investment climate and keeping 
foreign 
manufacturers are the government two most urgent tasks, Hsiao 
said. 
  The survey polled 103 manufacturers in the service, finance, 
and manufacturing fields, including President Foods, Jardine 
Fleming, Nestle, Bayer, 3M, American Express, Texas Instruments, 
Westinghouse, IBM, AT&amp;T, Citibank, United Airlines, Lockheed, 
BBC, Canon, Philips, NEC, Ford Motor Co., General Electric, 
General Motors, Microsoft Corp., and Acer.

  [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan will open its 
financial-services market wider to foreign investors in order to 
facilitate its entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, or GATT, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said Friday 
[22 April]. 
  "We plan to ease restrictions on foreign investment in local 
financial-service industries, including banking, insurance and 
investment trust," Li explained. 
  Taiwan already allows the establishment of fully 
foreign-owned securities brokerage houses, but still bans 
foreign investment in its banking industry. Meanwhile, foreign 
investment in local insurance firms cannot exceed 49 percent, 
and foreign capital in investment trust companies cannot exceed 
40 percent. 
  Li said the ceilings for foreign investment in insurance and 
trust companies will be raised to more than 50 percent in the 
future. 
  The Ministry of Finance is preparing a position paper 
detailing Taiwan's stance on financial liberalization in line 
with the General Agreement on Trade and Services, which is 
associated with GATT, Li said. Such a paper is a prerequisite 
for Taiwan's GATT accession. 
  As Taiwan hopes to join GATT by the end of this year, Li 
said, "We'll draft short- and mid-term timetables for financial 
liberalization to win foreign support for our GATT bid." 
  Li said that since many GATT members still limit foreign 
investment in their banking industry to less than 50 percent, 
Taiwan may follow suit. 
  As the General Agreement on Trade and Services stipulates 
that foreign investors in financial and other service industries 
must be given "national treatment," Li said Taiwan will allow 
the introduction of more financial products into the local 
market and give foreign investors a freer hand in operations. 
  At present, Taiwan only permits American insurance firms to 
open branches here. After Taiwan joins GATT, Li said, insurers 
from other countries will also be allowed to enter the Taiwan 
market. 
  Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade 
regulatory body as a separate customs territory in 1990 and was 
granted observer status in 1992. It expects to become a full 
member before GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization 
next January.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- A ranking industrial 
official said Saturday [26 April] that Taiwan's restrictions on 
car imports will be significantly eased to meet General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations. 
  "Imports will be allowed from all but a handful of 
countries," said Yin Chi-ming, director of the Industrial 
Development Bureau (IDB). 
  Yin's statement marks an about-face in Taiwan's car import 
policy. Taiwan currently allows the import of automobiles from 
the United States, Canada and Western European nations, but 
proposed regulations will open Taiwan's auto market to almost 
all countries. 
  Yin said that only a few countries, likely Japan, South 
Korea 
and other countries which have high import tariffs on 
automobiles, will be subject to import restrictions in the 
future. 
  A certain number of imports from those countries may be 
allowed, Yin said, with the numbers decided upon during 
bilateral negotiations. 
  Taiwan has already held initial consultations with 
Australia, 
Hungary, New Zealand, and South Africa on import tariffs, 
regional restrictions and local content requirements. 
  During the negotiations, Taiwan requested a five-year grace 
period for elimination of its local content requirements, which 
support Taiwan's auto parts industry but violate GATT 
regulations. 
  GATT contracting parties ranked as developing countries are 
usually given five years for the adjustment of their car 
industry. However, Taiwan applied as a developed economy and may 
be allowed only two years. 
  Ho Mei-yueh, deputy IDB [expansion unknown] director, is 
leaving for Southeast Asia for similar consultations Saturday. 
He will meet with officials in Malaysia, Thailand and the 
Philippines. 
  In addition, laws governing industrial development will be 
reviewed and outdated provisions revised to create a healthy 
development climate for local industries and help ease the 
negative impact of GATT entry, yin added. 
  Taiwan applied for membership of the world trade regulatory 
body in January 1990 and was admitted as an observer in 
September 1992.

  [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- Drops in marriage and 
birth rates have prompted the government to draft a package of 
measures aimed at encouraging more women to marry and have more 
children. 
  The measures, which will be made public soon by the 
cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development 
(CEPD), represent the first major population policy adjustment 
by the government since 1969, when it announced its population 
policy. 
  According to a survey recently conducted by the CEPD, the 
marriage rate of females aged over 15 years had dropped to 60.9 
percent in 1992 -- down from 1983's 61.8 percent. The rate is 
expected to fall below 60 percent in a few years. 
  More astounding has been the big fall in the marriage rate 
among women between the ages of 25 and 29, which slid from 77.3 
percent in 1983 to 63.9 percent in 1992. The figure for women 
aged from 20 to 24 also dropped from 37.2 percent to 23.8 
percent during the same ten-year period. 
  The survey also found that the declining marriage rate also 
caused a noticeable fall in the nation's birth rate. Each woman 
in Taiwan over the age of 15 is having an average of 1.71 
children, a decrease from 1983's rate of 2.15. 
  The CEPD has recommended increasing subsidies for married 
couples and easing the age restriction on applicants for public 
housing. Currently married couples with newborn babies would 
also receive more financial assistance from the government. 
  The government expects that if such measures are 
implemented, 
the average number of babies born per woman will climb to 1.85 
by 2011, with the nation's total population increasing to 24.19 
million and the density per square kilometer standing at 670, 
the CEPD reported.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Eighteen more local 
citizens have tested positive for Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) antibodies, bringing the number of aids virus 
carriers on Taiwan to 615, the Department of Health reported on 
Saturday [23 April]. 
  Over the past eight months, 100 more AIDS virus carriers 
have 
been recorded, indicating the virus is spreading quickly 
thoroughout the island, a Department of Health official said. 
  Of the newly identified AIDS virus carriers, 15 are male and 
three female. The carriers are between 20 and 30 years old, the 
department said. 
  Among the 18 are three couples. One husband reportedly 
contracted the virus after intravenous drug use and the other 
two through sexual contact with prostitutes. 
  Five carriers were identified by the non-profit blood 
donation center, according to the department. 
  Five out of the 615 carriers recently developed AIDS-related 
complications, increasing to 110 the total number of AIDS 
patients in Taiwan.

  [Text] United Nations, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The United 
Nations Security Council today demanded an immediate cease-fire 
by the Bosnian Serbs, under the auspices of the UN Protection 
Force (Unprofor), in Gorazde and throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The council, by adopting this resolution, invited the 
secretary- general to take the steps necessary to ensure that 
Unprofor is able to monitor the situation in Gorazde, one of the 
six UN-designated "safe havens" in the republic. 
  Condemning in the strongest terms the shelling and attacks 
by 
Bosnian Serb forces against Gorazde over the past two weeks, the 
council demanded the withdrawal of these forces and their 
weapons to a distance where they no longer constitute a threat 
to the safe area. 
  The council also demanded the immediate release of all UN 
personnel currently held by the Bosnian Serb forces, as well as 
unimpeded freedom of movement for Unprofor in the fulfillment of 
its tasks. 
  In order to bring together current diplomatic initiatives, 
the council called for the intensification of efforts to achieve 
a peaceful settlement, with coordination and close consultation 
between representatives of the United States and Russia and 
those of the United Nations and the European Union. 
  The council warned that it "stands ready promptly to 
consider 
taking further measures as required."

Xiaoguang (5170 2556 0342): "At the Foot of Lofty Tianshan, a 
Fine Steed Conveys Friendship"] 
  [Text] Bishkek, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 24 April, Kyrgyz 
Prime Minister Dzhumagulov handed the reins of a tall, deep 
brown steed strapped with saddle and stirrups into the hands of 
Premier Li Peng at the foot of the lofty Tianshan. 
  Today is the third day of Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan. In 
a most solemn ceremony of the Kyrgyz nationality held at a 
national park famous for its "multicolored dragon spruces," 
Dzhumagulov offered this fine-bred steed as a present to Premier 
Li Peng to show respect and friendship for the Chinese people. 
The horse is named after a Kyrgyz river called "Naolusi" [name 
as received]. It is also the name of a traditional festival of 
the Kyrgyz nationality, meaning "the beginning of spring." 
  The horse, 1.7 meters tall and over 2 meters long, is six 
years old. It won a horse race at Bishkek last year. When the 
Chinese premier approached the fine steed, it raised its head 
and neighed. Softly touching the steed's long mane, Li Peng said 
laughingly: "It is very friendly." 
  On a slope at an altitude of 2,000 meters above sea level 
and 
against a backdrop of mountains whose peaks are perennially 
covered with snow, Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin gladly posed for 
a group photo with Kyrgyz girls and boys singing a song in front 
of a forest of multicolored, evergreen dragon spruces at the 
foot of the mountain. 
  Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin told reporters 
Premier Li Peng has entrusted the raising of the fine steed

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China's public 
security bodies have cracked more than 2,000 cases of narcotics 
trafficking during the first quarter of this year, seizing 
2,000-plus kilograms of various drugs. 
  Officials from the Ministry of Public Security said that 
public security departments in Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian and 
Guangdong Provinces, which are located in south-western border 
areas and in south-eastern coastal areas, have strengthened 
border and coast defences and speeded up investigations. 
  During the first three months, Yunnan Province successfully 
dealt with about 900 cases of drug-trafficking, and seized over 
700 kilograms of narcotics. 
  The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong Province 
each cleared up 400 such cases in that period. 
  Fujian Province cracked 22 cases, and seized about 40 
kilograms of various drugs. 57 criminals were caught in the 
province, some of whom came from Taiwan province. 
  Big drug-trafficking cases were also cleared up in Shaanxi, 
Gansu, Qinghai, Henan, Hunan, Shandong and Sichuan provinces and 
in Beijing. 
  Officials said that local people have played a very 
important 
role in the anti-drug campaign.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The only way out for 
China's national education program is to devote major efforts to 
developing occupational education, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said 
here. 
  During his three-day tour in the city, the vice premier said 
that great importance must be attached to the development of 
occupational education while institutions of higher learning 
have to achieve both the highest educational quality and the 
highest social and economic gains. 
  Speaking of the reform in education, Li said that education 
has a positive bearing on the nation's quality, on the country's 
prosperity and on development now and in the 21st century. 
  Li, also a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, said 
that China's educational agenda should include basic education, 
adult and professional education and higher education, as well 
as special education such as education for the disabled. 
  In basic education, he said, emphasis should be placed on 
the 
spreading of the nine-year compulsory schooling in areas 
including 85 percent of the nation's population, and on the 
elimination of illiteracy in areas covering 90 percent of the 
total population. 
  To achieve greater, faster, better and more economic results 
in running occupational schools, the official said that 
professional education should be divided into three stages. 
  He said that students should be given such education in 
primary, middle and high schools, respectively, to meet the 
demands of a socialist market economy. 
  Talking about teaching quality and the social gains of 
higher 
education, he pointed out that efforts should be made to create 
new educational patterns for colleges and universities, by way 
of intercollege cooperation and resource sharing. 
  The vice premier noted that all of society must respect 
teachers. Officials at all levels should "show respect to 
teachers." 
  Greater attention should be paid to the work and life of 
teachers, he added. 
  Li was accompanied by local officials on visits to many 
universities and high schools in Tianjin.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "MFN on Cards as China Plays Ace"] </F>
  [Text] China played its ace card yesterday. If there were 
any lingering doubts that Bill Clinton would renew its Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) trading privileges, a decision many 
believed was already inevitable, then the sudden release from 
prison of democracy activist Wang Juntao removed them at a 
stroke. With an astute eye on the U.S. political scene, China 
handed Mr Clinton the gilt-edged gesture he so desperately 
needed to honourably fulfil his pledge of no MFN without 
"significant progress" on human rights. 
  For good measure, Beijing even threw in a second smaller 
carrot, with the revelation it had reached unspecified 
"understandings" with the International Committee of the Red 
Cross over another issue that has been at heart of the MFN 
debate; that of access to mainland prisons. 
  The news will come as an unexpected gift to Chief Secretary 
Anson Chan Fang On-sang as she today begins her mission to lobby 
Washington for a renewal now almost assured, even as she 
contemplates the unfortunate impact the death of former 
President Richard Nixon will have on her previously jam-packed 
schedule. 
  Much of the credit for Wang's release must go to his brave 
and indefatigable wife Hou Xiaotian, who by ceaselessly 
campaigning for his freedom, at great personal risk, made his 
plight a matter of international concern. Now she has helped to 
achieve what was once believed almost impossible -- Wang was, 
after all, freed after serving little more than four years of a 
1 3-year jail term -- relatives of other dissidents may be 
encouraged to adopt a similar approach, thus causing further 
headaches for the Chinese security authorities. But that is a 
small price for Beijing to pay to reap the benefits of a 
strategy which became startlingly clear yesterday. Having 
repeatedly humiliated Washington in recent months, especially by 
rounding up dissidents during the visit to Beijing of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, China has now thrown in a 
last-minute concession -- therefore not only securing MFN 
renewal, but also ensuring Washington will think long and hard 
before ever linking trade to the mainland's human rights record 
again. 
  That will be good news for Hong Kong, which has had to live 
with the uncertainties caused by the annual arguments over MFN 
for the past four years. It is sad to see sick dissidents being 
exploited in such a cynical way. But it can only be hoped that 
his release will be followed by many more: especially fellow 
victims of the 1989 crackdown, such as Chen Ziming and Bao Tong, 
who were jailed on similar charges.

<F P=106> [Report: "Minister Wu Yi Talks About Favorite Topics in </F>
Foreign Trade"] 
  [Text] In 1993, China continued to maintain a good 
development trend and make new progress in foreign economic 
relations and trade. Following the introduction of China's 
reform measures in 1994, major headway will also be made in 
foreign economic and trade structural reform. Prior to the 
opening of the "75th Chinese Export Commodities Fair," a GUOJI 
SHANGBAO reporter interviewed Wu Yi, Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] minister, on some favorite 
current topics in foreign trade. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Last year there were deficits which have 
been rare in China's foreign trade. Will you talk about the 
main cause of these deficits? 
  [Wu Yi] In 1993, China continued to maintain good growth in 
foreign trade on the basis of rapid development over the last 
few years. In 1993, imports and exports totaled $195.72 
billion, an increase of 18.2 percent over the previous year, 
fulfilling the target of 11.7 percent growth set by the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC]. Of this total, exports 
amounted to $91.77 billion and imports to $103.95 billion, 
increases of 8 and 29 percent respectively. 
  Last year China's foreign trade was mainly characterized by 
a 
slow increase in exports and a rapid growth in imports, the 
import growth rate being 21 percent higher than the export 
growth rate and the trade deficit stood at $12.18 billion. Last 
year exports increased slowly but imports increased by a wide 
margin, mainly because the domestic economy grew rapidly; 
investments expanded; market demand was strong; some commodity 
prices, particularly the prices of primary products, soared; 
commodities were in short supply; and exports were reduced. In 
addition, the imports of raw and semiprocessed materials, 
energy, and goods and equipment for economic development 
increased by a wide margin. According to statistics, imported 
commodities worth more than $1 billion included planes, 
automobiles, steel, crude oil, processed oil, chemical 
fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and full sets of equipment. 
This indicates that China is a market with a huge potential and 
that the Chinese market is open. 
  China's basic principle in foreign trade is to maintain a 
basic balance between imports and exports. It is our opinion 
that to maintain a basic balance between imports and exports, 
there is a need to expand exports, instead of reducing imports. 
In 1994, we should make efforts to expand exports so that they 
will develop further and there will be coordinated development 
between imports and exports. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] It was said that there were deficits in 
bilateral trade with some countries last year; what is your 
opinion on this? 
  [Wu] In my opinion, deficits in bilateral trade are 
inevitable. It is our opinion that to maintain a basic balance 
between imports and exports, there is a need to expand exports, 
instead of reducing imports. China's purpose in exporting is to 
import advanced technology and equipment for the country's 
modernization and to import goods which are in short supply in 
the country. According to an estimate, China's imports will 
amount to $400 billion during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. As 
everyone is aware, 80 percent of China's foreign exchange income 
is from foreign trade and exports. If deficits remain unchanged 
because of a slowdown in exports, foreign exchange income will 
reduce and imports will also be affected. I hope our trade 
partners will increase their imports from China to maintain 
coordinated development in bilateral trade. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] We have learned that foreign countries' 
antidumping lawsuits against China's exports have increased; 
will this affect China's exports? Will you please express your 
views? 
  [Wu] Because some countries are experiencing economic 
depression, their industrial production has come to a 
standstill, their tariff barriers can no longer control imports 
and, in addition to this, they do not understand what China is 
doing in establishing the socialist market economic structure 
and they discriminate against Chinese products and use 
antidumping measures to prevent Chinese commodities from 
entering their markets. This is something we are unwilling to 
see. We favor promoting exports according to international 
trade standards and object to expanding exports by dumping 
commodities. China is a developing country and does not have 
the economic power to dump its commodities on foreign markets. 
The prices of Chinese export commodities are low mainly because 
China's labor force is cheap and its production costs are low. 
We hope the governments of the relevant countries, as well as 
their industrial and commercial circles, will view the prices of 
Chinese export commodities in accordance with the facts. Of 
course, we will impose sanctions against enterprises which sell 
their products to the international market at prices lower than 
production costs. For this reason, we will soon promulgate 
"Regulations on Handling Antidumping Lawsuits Against Chinese 
Export Commodities" and "Regulations on Punishments Against 
Low-Priced Exports." It is necessary to stress that under the 
Chinese socialist market economic structure, enterprises have 
the right to set prices. If an enterprise dumps its products at 
prices lower than production costs, this is entirely its own 
behavior and antidumping can only be meted out against this 
enterprise's products; similar products of other enterprises 
should not be subjected to antidumping. I would like to 
reiterate that we object to expanding exports by dumping 
commodities and are also opposed to the practice of trade 
protectionism by means of antidumping. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How good is the quality of Chinese export 
commodities? 
  [Wu] Following China's economic development, and its 
scientific and technological progress since the introduction of 
reform and opening up, the quality of Chinese export commodities 
has improved. Particularly since the implementation of the 
strategy of "scoring successes by means of quality" in 1991, all 
trades and undertakings have improved their awareness about 
quality, applied stricter quality criteria, and strengthened 
commercial inspection work and methods. As a result of the 
common efforts of foreign trade, commercial inspection, customs, 
and production departments, as well as their close cooperation 
and effective measures, the quality of products has improved 
markedly, product variety has increased, products have been 
upgraded, a number of crackdowns have been carried out against 
counterfeit products achieving prominent results, and foreign 
businessmen's claims for compensation have reduced. According 
to statistics by commercial inspection departments, from January 
to October last year, 941,000 batches of export commodities 
worth $30.317 billion were examined, with a commodities approval 
rate of 99.05 percent and a total amount approval rate of 99.21 
percent, increases of 0.24 and 0.52 percent respectively. The 
general situation was good. The implementation of the strategy 
of "scoring successes by means of quality" is the fundamental 
way to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, 
jiankang] development of China's foreign trade. We will 
persistently adhere to this for a long period. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are the main contents of the next step 
in foreign trade structural reform? 
  [Wu] According to the overall arrangements by the State 
Council, this year China will carry out foreign trade structural 
reform together with taxation reform, financial reform, 
investment structural reform, planning system reform, and 
foreign exchange structural reform, and will make major steps in 
these reforms. 
  In deepening foreign trade structural reform, we will hold 
firm to the orientation of standardized policy, open management, 
equal competition, assuming sole responsibility for losses and 
profits, integrating industry and trade, and introducing the 
agent system. The purpose of foreign trade structural reform is 
to establish a foreign trade operational mechanism which 
conforms with international economic rules. 
  The main contents of the next step foreign trade structural 
reform are: First, further improving foreign trade 
macromanagement, during which the state will mainly use foreign 
exchange rates, taxation, credit, and other economic means to 
regulate foreign trade activities. The import and export 
management system will be reformed, mandatory plans will be 
abolished, administrative intervention will be reduced, and 
control will be exercised over the total amount of some 
commodities. Management over these commodities will be 
exercised according to the principle of good results, fairness, 
and openness, with the introduction of quota tenders, auction 
sales, and regularized distribution. The policy of encouraging 
exports will be implemented, the export tax refund system will 
be improved, and a credit policy favorable to foreign trade 
development will be put into effect. A practical overseas 
enterprise management system will be established. Foreign trade 
legislation will be expedited and management will proceed 
according to law to maintain good operational order in foreign 
trade. Second, deepening foreign trade enterprise reform and 
reorganizing state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to 
the modernized enterprise system. New ways of "macroeconomy and 
trade" will be explored looking toward the integration between 
trade and industry, trade and agriculture, trade and technology, 
and trade and commerce and the integration between foreign 
trade, foreign capital, and foreign economic relations. 
Production enterprises, scientific and technological units, and 
some commercial and material supply enterprises which possess 
the necessary conditions will be entrusted with the right to 
engage in foreign economic relations. Third, establishing a 
foreign trade coordinating service mechanism, improving it, and 
fully displaying the coordinating and service functions of 
import and export chambers. Fourth, maintaining the unity 
between foreign trade policies and system and increasing their 
transparency. 
  I believe that under the correct leadership of the State 
Council and with the common efforts of people in all fields, the 
anticipated results will be achieved in the next step foreign 
trade structural reform. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] China will introduce major reform to the 
foreign exchange system. What impact will this have on foreign 
trade development? 
  [Wu] Foreign exchange system reform is the key to deepening 
foreign trade structural reform and will produce a major and 
farreaching impact on China's foreign trade development. In my 
opinion, it will create a fine environment of equal competition 
for all kinds of export enterprises, greatly expedite the 
transformation of foreign trade enterprises' operational 
mechanism, more effectively display the role of foreign exchange 
rates in regulating foreign trade, and play quite an important 
role in expanding foreign trade and exports. This reform will 
enable China's foreign exchange and foreign trade structures to 
comply more closely with the requirements of the socialist 
market economic structure, help form an operational mechanism 
which corresponds with international economic rules, and play a 
positive role in restoring China's GATT status. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] After the implementation of the foreign 
exchange conversion system [jie hui zhi 4814 0565 0455] and the 
abolition of foreign exchange retention, how will the normal use 
of foreign exchange by export enterprises be ensured? 
  [Wu] Some people are worried that after the implementation 
of the foreign exchange conversion system and the abolition of 
foreign exchange retention, export enterprises' normal use of 
foreign exchange cannot be guaranteed. As a matter of fact, 
this worry is uncalled for because first, with the abolition of 
the approval system for the use of foreign exchange on the basis 
of the foreign exchange conversion system, banks will practice a 
foreign exchange sales system and conditional conversions 
between renminbi and the foreign currencies through current 
accounts. If an enterprise wishes to use foreign exchange, it 
can exchange renminbi for foreign currencies through a bank by 
presenting an effective certificate, provided this conforms with 
the state industrial policy. This will provide much convenience 
for all kinds of enterprises. Second, to ensure the use of 
foreign exchange by export enterprises, as a transitional 
measure, they can use 50 percent of their foreign exchange 
conversion quota to open an account with a designated foreign 
exchange bank. The bank will provide the export enterprises 
with the necessary foreign exchange facilities for expanding 
their exports, including funds for processing materials, 
packing, export bases, payment of claims, transportation 
insurance, after-sales service, and affiliation, all to be 
provided with preferential treatment and guarantees in their 
accounts. The export enterprises can still have their foreign 
exchange converted in the designated foreign exchange bank even 
if their use of foreign exchange exceeds their account balance. 
Therefore, export enterprises' normal use of foreign exchange 
is reliably guaranteed. 
  Of course, during the transition from the old structure to a 
new one, all sorts of problems will crop up. We will further 
deepen reform and formulate detailed operational methods to 
resolve these problems. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What impact will foreign exchange 
structural reform have on export enterprises' foreign exchange 
retention? To put it more specifically, can they still use 
their foreign exchange retention? 
  [Wu] This question involves enterprises' interests and all 
export enterprises are concerned about it. Here, I can say 
explicitly that in the current foreign exchange structural 
reform, we will fully consider enterprises' interests. First, 
we will allow enterprises to retain their accounts for foreign 
exchange retention quotas and cash and to continue their use. 
Second, enterprises are allowed to continue to use the balance 
in their foreign exchange quotas according to the original 
exchange rates listed one day before the standardization of 
foreign exchange rates. Enterprises which have not entered 
their foreign exchange quotas in different bank accounts must 
complete the necessary procedures within one month and their 
foreign exchange retention can still be used according to the 
above principle. Third, enterprises' foreign exchange cash 
accounts can still be used, allowing withdrawals and forbidding 
deposits; their accounts can be used to cover normal 
expenditures or sold to the banks. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How is the situation in China's foreign 
trade legislation? What are the plans? 
  [Wu] Since the introduction of reform and opening up the 
NPC, its Standing Committee, and the State Council have 
formulated and promulgated more than 500 foreign-related 
economic laws and regulations, including the "Joint-Venture 
Enterprise Law," "Cooperative-Operated Enterprise Law," 
"Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law," "Foreign-Related Economic 
Contract Law," "Customs Law," "Commercial Inspection Law," 
"Animal and Plant Quarantine Law," and the "Maritime Commercial 
Law." The state has also explicitly stipulated that to ensure 
the standardization and transparency of the country's foreign 
economic and trade policy, all laws and regulations involving 
foreign economic relations and trade must be promulgated by 
MOFTEC with the exception of laws and regulations formulated and 
promulgated by the NPC and the State Council. Our ministry has 
also promulgated four batches of valid documents, totaling 93 
copies; it has also revoked four batches, totaling 744 copies. 
In the future, we will still continue to strengthen the 
legislation of foreign economic and trade laws so that foreign 
economic relations and trade will develop along the legal track 
in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner [chixu, kuaisu, 
jiankang]. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] To converge with the international economy, 
what foreign economic and trade laws and regulations will China 
promulgate? 
  [Wu] Following the deepening of China's foreign economic and 
trade structural reform and the progress of talks on China's 
resumption of GATT status, China is changing its foreign 
economic and trade management modes and transforming the old 
practice of mainly relying on administrative means into mainly 
relying on legal and economic means. For this reason, China 
will introduce a series of foreign economic laws and 
regulations, of which the most important is the "Foreign Trade 
Law." The draft of this law has been submitted to the NPC by 
the State Council for examination and formal ratification is 
expected to come out in the first half of this year. China will 
also adopt some international methods to protect its domestic 
industries. We are drafting "Antidumping Regulations," 
"Antisubsidy Regulations," and "Regulations on Protective 
Measures." These three sets of regulations will soon be 
submitted to the State Council for examination and approval. 
Moreover, we have started formulating a series of regulations in 
coordination with the "Foreign Trade Law," such as the 
"Regulations on Ratifying Foreign Trade Enterprises" and 
"Regulations Governing Import and Export Chambers of Commerce." 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Would you please talk about the main 
contents and significance of the "Foreign Trade Law." 
  [Wu] It has taken 12 years to draft the "Foreign Trade Law," 
during which time 10 revisions have been made. It has now been 
submitted to the NPC by the State Council for examination. 
Hopefully, it will soon be promulgated and put into effect. 
  Apart from providing terms on equal benefits and 
standardized 
policies, the "Foreign Trade Law" also contains principled 
stipulations on foreign trade management methods which have 
remained valid for the last 40 years, such as regulations on 
examining and approving foreign trade enterprises, regulations 
on import and export quotas, and regulations on license control. 
To cope with the situation after China's resumption of GATT 
status, the "Foreign Trade Law" will provide stipulations on 
service trade, antidumping, antisubsidy, and protective measures. 
  Apart from being a management law, the "Foreign Trade Law" 
will provide stipulations on measures, applicable 
internationally and suitable for China's national conditions, to 
promote foreign trade development such as: Establishing a 
foreign trade risk-bearing fund, a foreign trade development 
fund, a special foreign trade financial organization, export tax 
refunds, and strengthening the role of import and export 
chambers of commerce. 
  The "Foreign Trade Law" serves as a milestone in foreign 
economic and trade legislation and is a basic law in the foreign 
trade field. It will establish major foreign trade policies and 
laws in a legal form. It is the basis for formulating detailed 
laws and regulations and serves as a precondition for putting 
foreign trade under the legal system. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How are the talks on China's resumption of 
GATT status progressing? What is the crux of the problem? Is 
there a timetable for China to resume its GATT status? 
  [Wu] During the seven years of talks, the Chinese delegation 
has made detailed explanations about China's economic and trade 
structure and the signatory nations have obtained an overall 
understanding of China's foreign trade system. In the last 
seven years, China has carried out profound economic and trade 
structural reform, which has brought China's foreign economic 
and trade structure quite close to the GATT provisions. 
Detailed discussions are now under way on the agreement's 
contents relating to China's resumption of GATT status. Most of 
the signatory nations are hoping for rapid progress in the 
talks. A number of countries are beginning to conduct tariff 
negotiations with China or will soon announce their readiness to 
conduct such negotiations. 
  The main problem in China's resumption of GATT status is 
that 
some major signatory nations have set very high demands on 
China-- demands which are a little distant from China's economic 
capacity; on the other hand, it is necessary for some major 
signatory nations to have the political will so that they can 
really support China's reentry into GATT. 
  On the timetable for reentry, China of course wishes to 
renter GATT as soon as possible, to enhance the vitality of the 
global multitrade structure. The Uruguay Round of talks ended 
smoothly on 15 December last year. Objectively, this set a 
timetable for China's resumption of GATT status. According to 
the regulations, China must reenter GATT before the whole 
package of Uruguay Round agreements come into force; in this 
way, China will be able to finally sign the agreements and 
become a member of the World Trade Organization. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What is the influence of the Uruguay Round 
of talks on China? 
  [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks has 
increased China's sense of urgency to reenter GATT. Because 
China was an overall participant in the Uruguay Round of talks, 
only by resuming China's GATT status as early as possibly will 
China be able to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round 
of talks and perform all the duties clarified by the agreement. 
This will help expand the achievements of the Uruguay Round of 
talks and strengthen the comprehensiveness of the multilateral 
trade structure--the World Trade Organization. 
  [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are your comments on the Uruguay Round 
of talks which concluded at the end of last year? 
  [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks will help 
prevent the spread of trade protectionism, promote international 
trade development and world economic growth, and create a 
comparatively stable international trade environment for China's 
economy, which is developing speedily. Therefore the Chinese 
Government always hoped that the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks could end smoothly. 
  China has always favored strengthening the multilateral 
trade 
structure and is opposed to unilateral trade retaliation and 
trade protectionism. This position corresponds with the 
principle of the Uruguay Round of talks. As an overall 
participant in the Uruguay Round of talks, in accordance with 
the procedures, China submitted an initially agreed opening 
price list for service trades and a reduced and concessionary 
opening price list for agricultural and nonagricultural 
products, thus fulfilling its duties and making contributions to 
the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks together with other 
participants. However, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
talks did not remove all trade and investment obstacles and the 
final agreement and documents from the talks were unbalanced and 
could not fully portray developing nations' interests. In 
future the multilateral trade structure should provide 
developing nations with more rights to speak.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr -- Wang Xingyi, spokesman for the 
Finance Ministry, recently reported on the smooth execution of 
the state budget in the first quarter of this year. He also 
described the operation of the new financial and taxation system 
in the same period as "basically normal." 
  In the first three months of this year, Wang Xingyi said, 
the 
nation witnessed revenue fulfill 18.7 percent of the budget, up 
21.4 percent from the same period last year; and expenditure 
fulfill 14.9 percent of the budget, an increase of 23.8 percent 
over the corresponding period last year. Although expenditure 
growth outstripped revenue, the growth rate was still normal. 
After balancing the nation's revenue and expenditures, it 
showed that revenue exceeded expenditure by 7.765 billion yuan, 
which was better than the same period last year. 
  He said the operation of the new financial and taxation 
system was also normal. Most regions in the nation have 
implemented and put into operation the tax-sharing sysem, which 
is the framework for the financial system, down to the 
prefectural and county levels. The operation of the new 
financial and taxation system in the last three months has 
ensured growth in revenue; it did not cause big commodity price 
fluctuations; and it did not adversely affect commodity 
production and distribution. 
  Although the overall situation in the execution of the state 
budget and the operation of the new financial and taxation 
system far has so far been good, he said some contradictions and 
budding signs of future problems were exposed in the course of 
executing the state budget. Among them are: low production 
output and poor efficiency at industrial enterprises under the 
budget; financial difficulties at county-level governments; and 
administrative units in some regions fail to pay employees' 
wages on time. 
  Wang Xingyu called on all levels of financial departments to 
pay close attention to executing the state budget, to the 
operation of the new financial and taxation system, and to doing 
a solid job in all spheres of work. First, it is necessary to 
continuously attach importance to improving the performance of 
state-owned enterprises, to promptly study and work out ways to 
solve problems which emerge during production and operation, and 
to raise enterprises' economic efficiency. Second, we should 
strive to maintain the good momentum in the sale of treasury 
bonds and help ensure the successful fulfilment of the task of 
selling treasury bonds. Third, there is a need to impose strict 
control on the growth of expenditures, to refrain from spending 
money unless it is absolute necessary, to postone starting up 
projects if it is possible, and to exercise strict control over 
supplementary expenditures. Fourth, proper measures should be 
worked out to help counties solve financial difficulties.

Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of 
the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, met with Mr. Lee 
Shau-kee, Hong Kong affairs adviser and president of Hong Kong 
Henderson Investment Ltd., in Guangzhou's Zhudao Guesthouse.

  [Text] Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces, Guangxi and 
Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of Chengdu and 
Chongqing have joined together to explore the market, thus 
enabling the great southwest to march toward the new market 
structure with giant strides. 
  The southwest is one of the areas in China with the greatest 
potential for economic growth. Nevertheless, the southwest's 
per capita gross industrial and agricultural output value was 
lower than that of other parts of the country by 320 yuan in the 
early 1980's. Since early 1984, after the southwest economic 
cooperation program was initiated, the great southwest has been 
rising rapidly as a new power in the market. In 1993, the 
area's gross industrial and agricultural output value increased 
by more than 230 percent over 1983. Nowadays, the southwest has 
become one of the areas in China with the greatest economic 
vitality. 
  Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and autonomous 
regions and the two cities have lifted restrictions one after 
another, removed barriers between them, and opened their own 
markets to each other. As a result, more than 6,000 economic 
cooperation projects were started. In the field of 
communications and telecommunications, all the parties of the 
southwest have joined to raise funds totaling more than 200 
million yuan to build trans- provincial highways with a total 
length of 918 km, four cross-river bridges linking Sichuan 
Province with other provinces and regions, and opened more than 
100 province-wide passenger transport routes. With the support 
of all parties, the electrification projects for the 
Chengdu-Chongqing, Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang 
railways were completed ahead of schedule. The key postal and 
telecommunication facility projects and microwave 
telecommunication centers of such central cities as Chengdu, 
Chongqing, and Kunming, as well as the Tibet satellite 
telecommunication station, have been put into operation. 
Members of the southwest have also made major progress in their 
joint efforts to explore energy resources.

  [Text] Taiwan police on Sunday [24 April] set foot on the 
largest island in the Spratly Island chain for the first time in 
ROC [Republic of China] history. Local media described the move 
as an affirmation of the ROC's exclusive and complete control 
over the island in the South China Sea. 
  More than 30 police officers from the National Police 
Administration escorted the Council of Agriculture research 
vessel to Taiping Island and then visited the ROC marines posted 
there. This was the first time the National Police 
Administration has sent officers to the island. It was part of 
a wider plan to bring the Spratly further under ROC control. 
  The ROC is maintaining a radar station, meteorological 
center, power plant, library, and marine activities center on 
the island. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, mainland China, 
Malaysia, and Taiwan all claim part or all of the Spratlys. All 
except Brunei have troops stationed on the islands.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that the modified Murkowski 
Amendment is absolutely unacceptable and urged the U.S. 
Government to abide by the principles of the three Sino-U.S. 
Communiques and take effective measures to keep the Sino-U.S 
relations from serious harm. 
  The modified Murkowski Amendment adopted by the joint 
conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 
U.S. on April 19, asserts that the Taiwan Relations Act takes 
primacy over the Sino-U.S. August 17 Joint Communique. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that the Murkowski 
Amendment, 
which asserts that sections 2 and 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act 
take primacy over statements of U.S. policy, including 
communiques, regulations, directives and policies based thereon, 
is designed, in essence, to negate the Sino-U.S. August 17 
Joint Communique, undermine Sino-U.S. relations and erect 
obstacles to the great cause of the peaceful reunification of 
the Chinese people. 
  It is absolutely unacceptable and the Chinese Government and 
people are firmly against it, Wu said. 
  "We demand that the U.S. Government take this case 
seriously, abide by the guiding principles of the Sino-U.S. 
relations as set forth in their three joint communiques, live 
up to its promises and take effective measures immediately to 
keep the Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm," Wu said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The report about China 
sending additional 30,000 troops to Sino-Indian border is a 
"sheer fabrication", Wu Jianmin, a spokesman for the Ministry of

  "Spreading such lies is obviously out of ulterior motives," 
he said. 
  He told a news briefing that the Governments of China and 
India signed an agreement on the maintenance of peace and 
tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control in the border 
areas last year and have begun talks on the reduction of troops 
along the Actual Control Line," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- China will continue to 
make efforts to promote Hong Kong's economic development and 
improve people's living there, Wu jianmin, Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, said here today. 
  He told a weekly news briefing here this afternoon that the 
two panels of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region in charge of political and economic affairs will meet in 
Hong Kong from May 2-3 and from May 4-5, respectively. 
  Lu Ping, PWC deputy director and secretary-general, will 
head 
mainland members of the two panels and other personnel of the 
PWC Secretariat to attend the meetings in Hong Kong, he said. 
  While in Hong Kong, Lu will listen to advice and proposals 
from the Hong Kong people, he said. 
  "The Chinese side has always been greatly concerned with the 
economic affairs and people's livelihood of Hong Kong," he 
noted. "We have already made efforts, and will continue to do 
so, in order to promote Hong Kong's economic prosperity and 
improve the people's livelihood there," he stated. 
  He said that China hopes to maintain cooperative relations 
with the British side in this regard. 
  Whether or not the cooperation will go smoothly depends 
entirely on the attitude and actions of the British side, Wu 
added.

believe that, following the establishment of the new Japanese 
Government, China and Japan will continue to maintain their 
close coordination and cooperation and will work together in 
promoting the long-term and steady development of the two 
countries' relations."

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (AFP)--China has no wish to spark 
an incident in the disputed Spratly islands but will honour its 
contract with a US company to explore for oil there despite 
Vietnamese protests, the foreign ministry said Wednesday [27 
April]. "The Chinese government has all along stood for a 
peaceful settlement of the Nansha (Chinese name for Spratlys) 
issue and we do not wish to see the occurrence of any incident 
that might complicate the matter," a ministry spokesman said. 
  The Spratlys are claimed wholly or in part by China, 
Vietnam, 
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan. The crux of the 
dispute centres on what are believed to be large oil and natural 
gas deposits in the area. Hanoi has reacted strongly to what it 
described as the "illegal" contract signed by China and 
Colorado-based Crestone Energy, warning that the deal marked a 
"serious escalation of the situation in the South China Sea." 
Crestone had announced that it would sink exploratory wells 
under the protection of the Chinese navy, which has recently 
stepped up operations around the Spratlys. 
  The spokesman, reaffirming China's claim to the island 
chain, 
said the contract was perfectly legal. "China has undisputed 
sovereignty over the Nansha islands and adjacent waters," he 
said. "The signing of the contract with the American company 
entirely falls within China's sovereignty," he added. 
  The war of words between Beijing and Hanoi continued Monday 
when the Vietnamese communist party daily, Nhan Dan, evoked the 
spirit of Dien Bien Phu -- the site of Vietnam's decisive 
victory over France in 1954 -- in a front page article on the 
Spratlys. "During these days of April, the people and troops of 
the district of Truong Sa (Vietnamese name for Spratlys) are 
lighting the historic flame of Dien Bien Phu in this sacred part 
of the country," the newspaper said. Taiwan, meanwhile, 
announced at the weekend that it had stepped up naval patrols in 
the Spratlys to emphasise its sovereignty over the archipelago. 
  Historical enemies China and Vietnam normalised relations in 
November 1991 after a 12-year diplomatic freeze, agreeing at the 
time to settle peacefully border disputes through negotiations. 
But mutual suspicions and allegations of violating bilateral 
understandings have continued to strain relations, with rival 
claims to the Spratly and Paracel islands the main point of 
contention. The South China Sea was the sight of bloody 
confrontations between the two countries in 1988, when hundreds 
of Vietnamese troops lost their lives.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland, 
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), will visit China early next month at the invitation of 
Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi. 
  An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today that during Sutherland's 
stay in China, the GATT chief will exchange views with top 
Chinese leaders on China's resumption of its GATT membership. 
  This will be his first visit to China since last June, when 
Sutherland succeeded former GATT chief Arthur Dunkel, who had 
visited China twice during his term. 
  China was a GATT founding member in the 1940s, but applied 
for the restoration of its contracting status in GATT in 1986. 
The end of the Uruguay Round of talks last November has brought 
China's restoration of its GATT membership to a critical stage 
and the re- entry negotiations are being accelerated. 
  China is making strenuous efforts to become an original 
member of the World Trade Organization, which is to take the 
place of GATT. 
  Observers here said that therefore Sutherland's coming visit 
will be helpful to push forward the process of negotiations on 
China's re-entry to GATT. 
  Sources said that Sutherland, together with former U.S. 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, will attend a May 11-15 
international seminar on the development strategies of China's 
foreign trade in the 1990s, which is to be sponsored by MOFTEC. 
  Some 300 experts, trade officials and entrepreneurs from 
both 
home and abroad are expected to attend the seminar and discuss a 
wide range of issues concerning China's foreign trade 
development in the 1990s, including the international trade 
environment, strategic choices and administrative measures.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): "Wang </F>
Jiaqi Arrives in New York Smoothly"] 
  [Text] This newspaper has learned that mainland dissident 
Wang Jiaqi, who was helped by a Hong Kong underground rescue 
organization called "yellow bird operation" in his flight from 
China, has already been granted political asylum by the United 
States. After spending some time in London, Wang Jiaji arrived 
in New York smoothly on 25 April, as arranged by a human rights 
organization, and has since begun a new life. 
  Wang Jiaqi, 34, was a graduate student of law at Beijing 
University before fleeing China. He had worked in Hubei 
Province's Tangshan City Public Security Bureau for 11 years, 
taking charge of a large quantity of "state secrets." His 
escape has allegedly caused a great shock in internal circles on 
the mainland, and the Ministry of State Security has already 
received an order to investigate the incident and determine the 
responsibility of the relevant persons. 
  On 27 January 1994, Wang Jiaqi joined hands with Yuan 
Honghing, a law teacher at Beijing University, and Zhou 
Guoqiang, a trade unionist, in releasing an appeal letter signed 
by various circles regarding the incident of police beating up 
Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's Congress 
in Zhejiang Province; the letter asked the public security 
organs to stop infringements of citizens' rights. A total of 
350 persons signed the appeal, including scholars, artists, 
reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, and standing committee 
members of a certain provincial people's congress, as well as 
pro-democracy activists such as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and Liu 
Nianchun. 
  In early March, the mainland authorities arrested a number 
of 
active pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai, and Wang 
Jiaqi was also detained by Beijing; thereafter, he escaped while 
being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan, the place of his 
registered household. 
  Hong Kong has often played the role of a refuge when 
communist China persecuted dissidents. Particularly at this 
sensitive time -- when Sino-British relations have deteriorated 
-- Wang Jiaqi's trip to Hong Kong and his travel to the United 
States via London will make the already sour bilateral relations 
even worse.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with African Countries (CPAFAC) is 
considering sending a delegation to the inauguration ceremony of 
the new South African [RSA] president, said a Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman at a weekly press conference here this 
afternoon. 
  In response to a question, spokesman Wu Jianmin noted that 
the inauguration marks the end of apartheid rule in South Africa 
and the start of a new, non-racial South Africa. 
  "The Chinese people have always staunchly supported the just 
struggle of the South African people and share the great joy at 
their historic victory," Wu said. 
  As an expression of the congratulations of the Chinese 
people 
to the South African people, Wu said, the CPAFAC is expected to 
send a delegation to the inauguration.

<F P=106> [By reporter Deng Ying (6772 4481)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of 
the Chinese State Nuclear Safety Bureau, an International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] team on international evaluation of nuclear 
safety control today began the evaluation of the effectiveness 
of China's nuclear safety supervision and control. 
  The team consists of experts from the United States, France, 
Britain, Spain, and Belgium, as well as IAEA officials. During 
their stay in Beijing, the team members will listen to the State 
Nuclear Safety Bureau's briefings on nuclear safety supervision 
and control system, organizations and functions, the formulation 
of nuclear safety law and its evaluation and enforcement, as 
well as nuclear contingency plans in China. They will also hold 
special talks with the state bureau on the aforesaid topics. In 
addition, the team members will visit Shenzhen to hold talks 
with Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Plant and the state bureau's 
Guangdong Supervision Station to familiarize themselves with the 
Chinese state bureau's nuclear safety supervision and control 
over the operating units. 
  International evaluation of nuclear safety control is a form 
of international cooperation activity, through which IAEA 
organizes international nuclear safety experts to evaluate the 
effectiveness of nuclear safety supervision and control carried 
by the nuclear safety agency of a certain member state. The 
purpose of the evaluation is to obtain firsthand information 
about the member state's nuclear safety supervision and control, 
to summarize successful experiences, to make suggestions for 
improvement, and to exchange experiences in order to raise all 
member states' level in nuclear safety supervision and control. 
  According to a state bureau official, international 
evaluation of nuclear safety control is to be requested by 
member states on a voluntary basis and to be organized and 
carried out by the IAEA. Since the inauguration of the State 
Nuclear Safety Bureau in 1984, China has adopted relatively 
comprehensive nuclear safety regulations and supervision system. 
The international evaluation, the first to be conducted on 
China's nuclear safety supervision and control in 10 years, will 
help improve China's nuclear safety work, enhance its influence 
on the world, and promote its international cooperation in 
nuclear safety. 
  The IAEA team, which arrived in Beijing 24 April, will 
complete the evaluation on 9 May.

  [Text] Kuwait City, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher today reassured the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) that his country is committed to the 
security and stability of the region. 
  At a delayed news conference following his one-hour meeting 
with the GCC foreign ministers held in Riyadh, the capital of 
Saudi Arabia today, Christopher, who arrived there to start his 
Middle East shuttle to push forward the stalled peace process, 
described the meeting as excellent. 
  He said the talks dealt with relations between the U.S. and 
the GCC -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, 
Bahrain, Qatar and Oman -- and the Middle East process. 
  They also discussed the Gulf security situation in the light 
of Iraq's intransigence, the GCC relations with Iran and the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added. 
  Christopher reiterated the necessity for the GCC countries 
to 
stand firm in alliance against Iraq, the Kuwait news agency KUNA 
reported. 
  He also expressed hope that the GCC states would help in 
lifting the Arab boycott against Israel, explaining that the 
boycott would now harm the Palestinian side as well, KUNA quoted 
informed sources as saying. 
  The GCC ministers reiterated their countries' commitment to 
the Arab League resolutions on imposing trade embargo against 
Israel. 
  During the meeting, the ministers did not discuss the 
reported normalization of relations with Israel or offering more 
financial aid to back up the self-rule agreement signed between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
  Christopher left Riyadh this evening to continue his Middle 
East shuttle, which will also take him to Egypt, Israel and 
Syria.

  [Text] Cairo, April 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher arrived here this evening from Riyadh on a 
24- hour visit to Egypt as part of his current Middle East tour. 
  Immediately after arrival, Christopher delivered the first 
batch of police cars donated by the U.S. Government for the 
Palestinian police force to Nabil Shaath [spelling of name as 
received], PLO chief negotiator. 
  Christopher said an effective police force was essential to 
making a success of Palestinian autonomy when Israel pulls out 
its troops from the the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  He said the shipment of the vehicles was a tangible sign 
that 
the process of implementation of the peace accord will be soon 
be under way. 
  Shaath said in taking the delivery of the U.S. gift that he 
was happy to have received the the first shipment of the 
automobiles, which "will make it possible for the Palestinian 
police to start deploying in Gaza and Jericho." 
  The U.S. official is scheduled to meet Thursday with 
Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak and will hold talks with his Egyptian 
counterpart 'Amr Mussa on the Middle East peace process and 
other international issues of common concern. 
  Christopher is expected to be present at a tripartite 
meeting 
with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, who is scheduled to 
arrive here after midnight, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres, who will arrive in the Egyptian capital early Thursday. 
  The meeting is to remove hurdles blocking the signature of a 
final Palestinian-Israeli agreement on implementing Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Political observers say the mission of Christophers present 
Middle East tour is to assist in resolving the delicate problems 
facing Palestinian and Israeli negotiators currently meeting in 
Cairo to reach a successful conclusion so 'Arafat and Israeli 
Premier Yitzhaq Rabin will be able to sign a final agreement 
early next month. 
  His second task, according to the observers, is to try to 
convince Israel and the Arab parties concerned to return to the 
negotiating table and resume the bilateral talks in Washington, 
suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre of February 25 by 
an Israeli settler, killing some 40 of Palestinians. 
  Christopher is to discuss with Egypt how to make efforts to 
push forward the peace process and he may call on Egypt, the 
only Arab state that has diplomatic ties with Israel, to play a 
more active role in resumption of the bilateral Arab-Israeli 
peace talks, particularly the talks between Syria and Israel. 
  Before leaving Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Christopher said the 
Middle East has suffered too long from bloody conflict and 
repressive rule. 
  Now the region "has a chance to turn a new page, to put war 
aside, to choose peace, to end the boycott of Israel and lay the 
foundation for regional development and cooperation," he noted.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Jianqing (2621 1696 7230)] </F>
  [Text] Macao, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, said yesterday that 
while China would like to explore and study [tan tao he yan jiu 
2232 6062 0735 4282 4496] the human rights issue with other 
countries, it opposes the linkage of this issue with the trade 
issue. 
  Wu Yi made this statement at a news conference last evening 
while answering a question concerning Sino-U.S. trade relations. 
  She said: The most-favored-nation [MFN] issue is one key 
provision of the trade accord China and the United States signed 
when the two countries established diplomatic relations. It is 
also the foundation of the development of the two countries' 
trade. She stressed: The MFN issue is strictly a trade issue. 
China will never accept any attempt to link trade with 
irrelevant issues, especially the human rights issue. 
  Wu Yi said: China is not afraid even if confrontation ever 
occurs on the MFN issue [ru guo shuo zai zui hui guo dai yu wen 
ti shang fa sheng dui kang, zhong guo ye bu hai pa 1172 2654 
6141 0961 2584 1920 0948 1765 0795 7344 0006 4099 3932 1417 2123 
0022 0948 0048 0008 1364 1830]. It has now established trade 
relations with more than 200 countries and regions. It has many 
trade partners. 
  She added: We hope the United States can properly resolve 
the MFN issue and will not do anything that may give rise to 
confrontation on this issue because that will not be in the 
interest of both countries. 
  Wu Yi arrived in Macao from Hong Kong the other day to 
attend 
the seventh board of directors meeting of the Nanguang Holdings 
Company Ltd. after concluding her visit in the United States.

April) on the results of her visit to the United States. She 
was optimistic about the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, saying 
that "no matter how Sino-American economic and trade relations 
develop in the future, the Chinese Government will try every 
possible means to maintain the prosperity and stability of the 
Hong Kong economy." 
  Herbert Liang Hin--ying, president of the Chinese 
Manufacturer's Association, gave a banquet for Wu Yi, PRC 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and her 
party of six at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Central District 
yesterday. Wu Yi also listened to their views on trade issues, 
about which the attendees were concerned. 
  Wu Yi pointed out at the banquet that she had met U.S. 
Government officials, Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs 
during her visit to the United States. U.S. Government 
officials still stressed that a precondition for renewing 
China's MFN status was to improve its human rights situation. 
However, over 30 Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs 
unanimously extended their support for the unconditional renewal 
of MFN. She said that during her visit to the United States, 
she found that most of the Senators and Congressmen had changed 
their stand on the issue of renewing China's MFN status, which 
was largely attributed to the policy of inviting U.S. Senators 
and Congressmen to visit China to observe the development 
situation there personally. She stressed that to settle trade 
problems between China and the United States, it is very 
important to enhance understanding between the two countries in 
all respects. 
  Wu Yi stressed that no matter how the MFN issue develops, 
China will try every possible means to maintain Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability, because this is the Chinese 
Government's paramount policy. She said: "After its return to 
China in 1997, we believe that Hong Kong's economy will achieve 
greater development than at present." 
  Wu Yi said: "MFN treatment is the most appropriate agreement 
on developing trade relations reached between China and the 
United States since the establishment of diplomatic relations, 
as well as the foundation of economic and trade development 
between our two countries. It has never been a favor bestowed 
by one side on the other, but a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
Hence, I hope that the United States can handle this issue 
properly. It will be to the detriment of both China and the 
United States if our two countries confront each other on the 
issue of MFN treatment." 
  As far as the United States is concerned, 200,000 people 
will 
become unemployed if China's MFN treatment is revoked, 
enterprises specializing in Sino-American trade will face severe 
damage, the competitive power of U.S. commodities in the China 
market will be greatly weakened, U.S. consumers will have to pay 
$14 billion more to buy commodities to replace Chinese products, 
and U.S. investment in China will be severely damaged. At 
present, there are over 12,000 U.S.-invested projects in China, 
and the total amount of investment agreements signed between the 
two countries exceeds $14.4 billion, while over $5.2 billion of 
capital has been invested. 
  Not long ago, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, chairman of the Hong Kong 
General Chamber of Commerce, led a delegation to Washington to 
lobby for the renewal of China's MFN treatment. He pointed out 
at the banquet that there should not be any problem in renewing 
China's MFN treatment this year, but whether or not renewal will 
include conditions depends on the development of events. 
Raymond Chien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of 
Industries, also went to Washington to lobby for renewal. He 
pointed out that after his visit to the United States, he felt 
that the U.S. Government intends to separate human rights from 
the MFN issue, but the key to the solution lies in how the U.S. 
Government devises an appropriate justification. 
  Wu Yi said that Sino-American trade relations have always 
made progress along with friction. She said that although the 
two countries often squabbled with each other, Sino-American 
trade has still grown at an annual rate of 20 percent over the 
past few years. Hence, she believes that both sides will finally 
reach an agreement and join hands with each other in economic 
development and trade. However, she stressed that China would 
not be afraid even if the United States, due to certain 
political needs, confronted China on the MFN issue. She said: 
"The door of China is open wide to the whole world. At 
present, China has established economic and trade relations with 
228 countries in the world, and we will unswervingly pursue the 
line of reform and opening up. The sky will not fall even 
without MFN." 
  During her visit to the United States, Wu Yi also conveyed 
to 
U.S. officials and concerned figures China's stand on its 
reentry to the GATT. She pointed out that most of the 118 GATT 
members supported the resumption of China's membership of the 
GATT, but the United States had erected obstacles by saying that 
it did not recognize China as a developing country. 
  Wu Yi said she could not accept the U.S. attitude of going 
back on its word. She said that as far as the current economic 
strength of China was concerned, it was unacceptable that China 
was considered as a developed country in the GATT talks. She 
said: "China has made a lot of efforts in applying to re-enter 
the GATT, and the central leadership is very enthusiastic about 
it, but we will not accept excessive demands at any cost." 
  Among those invited to attend yesterday's banquet were 
Ulanmulun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Chen 
Keqiang, director of the economic department of XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch, and Hong Kong industrialists and businessmen, such as 
Sir Quo-wei Lee, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung, 
Ngai Shiu-kit, Wu Man-han, Fang Heng, Lo Wing-chan, Yip 
Hing-chung, Wong Ka-chit, Ding Hok-shou, Shao Yan-chung, Chau 
Man, Yeung Sun-sai, Lo Man-sui, Luk Tsang-yong, and Ding Ng-shou.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter: "China's Card Toward U.S. </F>
`Human Rights'" -- first three paragraphs are editor's note; 
numbering as published] 
  [Text] Each year, China's departments related to national 
defense and state security call a symposium on "reviewing the 
state security situation" to analyze the long-range effects of 
the world situation on China and the Asian region. The 
participants include experts from the Ministry of National 
Defense, the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of State Security, and research institutes 
specialized in studies of strategy and world issues. 
  Toward the end of last year, the Ministry of Defense called 
meetings in this category on two occasions, with topics 
including Sino-U.S. relations, the security of the Nansha 
[Spratly] Islands, the election of the new Russian parliament, 
and measures for the security of various peripheral countries in 
the Asia-Pacific Region. 
  Based on the discussions at these meetings, this journal has 
sorted out an article on Sino-U.S. relations for our readers' 
reference. 
  Since last May, when U.S. President Clinton announced the 
extension of MFN status to China for the 1993-94 fiscal year, 
Sino-U.S. economic exchanges have deepened and expanded further, 
with a rapid increase in U.S. investment in China. At the same 
time, U.S. media has given voluminous coverage to "China's 
miraculous economic growth," which created a positive climate of 
opinion for the Clinton administration to review its China 
policy in a comprehensive way and to improve Sino-U.S. 
relations. However, since the beginning of the third 
quarter, some troubles have surfaced in Sino-U.S. relations. 
For example: The U.S. implementation of "Category II trade 
sanctions" under the pretext of China's having sold M-11 
guided-missile technology to Pakistan, the "Yinhe" incident, and 
the continued U.S. sales of advanced weapons and equipment to 
Taiwan. 
<H5>  The United States Tries Hard To Mend Its Relations With China </H5>
  Reviewing Sino-U.S. relations over the past six months or 
so, 
it is not difficult to see that the United States has been 
getting impatient with waitng for China to make corresponding 
concessions in such arenas as human rights and weapon 
proliferation. In addition, an all-encompassing and consistent 
China policy on the part of the Clinton administration, as well 
as a continuous guiding principle in this arena, are not on the 
horizon. Thus, it has been impossible to effectively control 
the escalation of friction between the two sides, resulting in 
greater turbulence in the unstable bilateral relations. 
  However, the United States has misgivings over the growing 
tension in Sino-U.S. relations. This being the case, the 
Clinton administration has taken a series of initiatives. For 
example, Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national 
security affairs, submitted a comprehensive policy document to 
Clinton in mid-September last year, in which he proposed mending 
U.S. relations with China. 
  In Seattle, the Chinese and U.S. heads of state finally 
accomplished their first meeting since February 1989. 
<H5>  "Economic Security Equates With National Security" </H5>
  The factor prompting the United States to readjust its China 
policy lies primarily in the fact that focus of U.S. diplomatic 
strategy has shifted to the economy. While summarizing the six 
key points in U.S. diplomatic strategy, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said: "Economic security equates with 
national security," while stressing that the economy is primary 
among all diplomatic focal points, and emphasizing the 
importance to U.S. economic revival of U.S. participation and 
leadership in Asia-Pacific economic operation. He believed that 
"no other area in the world is more important than the East 
Asian and Pacific region." In recent years, bilateral trade 
between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has 
increased, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. 
In 1993, the volume of trade between the United States and the 
Asia-Pacific region was $344.05 billion, accounting for 52 
percent of U.S. general export volume. 
  Over the past two years, China's economy has enjoyed a high 
growth rate, and has become a focus in the world, forcing the 
United States to renew its understanding of China, and to show 
concern for the ever-expanding U.S. economic interests in China. 
At present, the volume of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade approaches 
$70 billion. China is an important market for U.S. commercial 
aircraft, electronic equipment, and farm produce. In these 
three areas alone, 63,000 job opportunities have been created 
for the United States. 
  U.S. Businessmen Urge the U.S. Government To Revise 
Its China Policy In the fourth annual survey of the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, 98 percent of those polled believed the 
prospects for investment in mainland China to be "favorable" or 
"very favorable." At the same time, 78 percent of U.S. 
companies believed that the disputes over MFN status would 
jeopardize their commercial activities in China. So we can see 
that with the expansion of U.S. investment interests in China, 
U.S. businessmen are urging the government to re-examine 
Sino-U.S. relations so as to ensure comprehensive U.S. 
participation in China's economic development. 
  Apart from economic considerations, the United States also 
is 
calling for China's cooperation in handling global and regional 
security. In actual fact, because China is one of the countries 
having mastery of guided missiles and nuclear technology, the 
United States will have to rely on China in its 
"non-proliferation diplomacy." In particular, viewed from the 
angle of Asia-Pacific regional security, China has played a 
vitally important role in the UN peace-keeping plan in Cambodia, 
easing the tense situation and realizing a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula, and promoting the building of a multilateral security 
mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region. At at time when the 
United States is attempting to "take an active part and play a 
leading role" in the Asia-Pacific region, it would be 
impractical to reject China's participation and support. 
  Based on the new principle that "Sino-U.S. relations are one 
of the most important bilateral relationships in the world," the 
United States has started to establish new focuses in its China 
policy, namely: 1) To take the initiative into its own hand to 
restore high-level dialogues in various arenas; 2) To take a 
practical attitude toward the existence of China as a political 
and military power, and establish "normal military relations" 
with China, which are not aimed at any third country, but are 
conducive to world peace and stability, especially in the 
Asia-Pacific region, as well as regional security; and 3) In 
areas where the differences between the two sides are 
comparatively great, for example, the human rights issue, the 
United States also has stated that it will not proceed from U.S. 
value concepts in "doing business with China," but will "reflect 
the commitments made by various countries according to the UN 
Charter," which shows that from now on, the United States will 
exert influence on China by relying more heavily on 
"international criteria." 
<H5>  The United States Is Worried About the Shaping of the </H5>
Sino-Russian Alliance 
  Since July last year, the new trends in Russia's foreign 
policy have placed a renewed stress on the maintenance of the 
traditional national interests and sphere of influence. What 
worries the United States is that this change in Russia's 
foreign policy has taken place under conditions of a malignant 
growth of nationalism in Russia. At the same time, the United 
States has renewed its worries about the shaping of a 
Russia-China alliance, and was anxious about Russian Defense 
Minister Grachev's China visit. That being the case, while 
thinking of readjusting its policy toward Russia, the United 
States acknowledged: "The importance of China has been 
neglected over the past few years," and hoped that China would 
become a "friend" of the United States through so-called 
"contact strategy." 
  To summarize, China's rapid economic development and growing 
comprehensive national strength, the integration of economic 
interests between China and the United States, and the concerns 
over Russia are the basic considerations pushing the Clinton 
administration to establish the axes of its policy toward China. 
Since President Clinton approved the "Action Memorandum" set out 
by the National Security Council in mid-September last year, 
quite a few high-ranking U.S. officials have visited China, one 
after another. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President 
Clinton met in Seattle in late November last year; in mid-March 
this year, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited 
China. All this shows that progress has been made recently in 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Nevertheless, the improvement in bilateral relations is 
confined to elevating the levels of contact and expanding the 
areas, pending satisfactory solutions to substantial issues. 
During his recent China visit, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was somewhat relaxed about the linking of MFN status 
with human rights conditions; this brought about a silver lining 
to the cloud hanging over China's MFN status. However, a 
solution to this issue once and for all continues to call for 
the two sides' joint efforts. The ups and downs in Sino-U.S. 
relations in recent years were related to the readjustment in 
U.S. strategic focuses; now that the United States has seen the 
importance of the Asia-Pacific region, and has a renewed 
understanding of China's role, the Clinton administration has 
been active toward China, resulting in a change in Sino-U.S. 
relations. In view of this, it is advisable for China to have a 
comprehensive, long-range strategy toward the United States, as 
well as short-range measures for individual specific issues. To 
achieve this end, we make the following suggestions: 
<H5>  Revise the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques </H5>
  I. It is necessary to strive for the revision of the 
communiques on bilateral relations. 
  The three existing communiques on Sino-U.S. relations were 
signed against the backdrop of the Cold War. The 1982 "17 
August" Communique already has stood for 12 years, and many of 
its contents cannot reflect the new foundation and realities in 
Sino-U.S. relations. The problems surfacing in Sino-U.S. 
relations in recent years increasingly have revealed the 
fragility of bilateral relations founded on ideology. Today, it 
is imperative to find a new supporting point. It seems 
inevitable that economic cooperation will be the new tie in 
relations between the two countries. However, this point 
has never been touched on in the three past communiques. This 
being the case, a mechanism to standardize disputes is not on 
the horizon. For example, this important principle in handling 
issues involving economic relations and trade, as well as 
political matters, should be written into the new communique. 
  II. The issue of human rights. 
  The human rights issue will remain a thorny one in Sino-U.S 
relations from now on, and this has a bearing on the MFN status 
after 1994. To handle this issue, China may take the following 
measures: 
  1. To adopt a tough stance, fighting tit for tat: China 
should adhere to the principle of separating trade and political 
issues, while opposing the addition of human rights conditions 
to the MFN status. China should do more work in the U.S. 
Congress, in the U.S. Government, and among the U.S. public so 
as to win the support of more people. 
  At the same time, China should take full advantage of the 
media to indicate the serious human rights issues in the United 
States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry should collect materials 
about human rights conditions in the United States: racial 
discrimination, violence, and murder, for example. These should 
be published each year, while a list of Chinese citizens 
suffering from violence and unfair treatment in the United 
States should be submitted to the U.S. side. 
  2. To agree to discuss the human rights issue, though it 
should not be linked to the MFN status. 
  We may take into consideration making the international 
discussion of the human rights issue regular and institutional. 
Discussions can be conducted between governments, as well as 
scholars. The issues of human rights in China, as well as in 
the United States, can be discussed. According to a U.S. State 
Department official, this the minimum requirement of the U.S. 
side on the "human rights" conditions, the fulfillment of which 
will somewhat help the extension of the MFN status. 
<H5>  Releasing Counterrevolutionaries </H5>
  3. According to the revised penal code, some imprisoned 
counterrevolutionaries should be released in all at once. At 
present, the definition of "counterrevolutionary crime" is 
comparatively vague in China's current penal code, and it would 
be very difficult for the code to be compare with foreign penal 
codes, and to be understood and accepted in the world, so the 
code's revision seems imperative. Furthermore, this practice 
will enable China to have a law by which to abide when dealing 
with issues in this category, as well as sufficient legal 
grounds to deal with U.S. "human rights diplomacy," in contrast 
to the practice of releasing one or two political prisoners each 
year when the United States is set to discuss the extension of 
China's MFN status. 
  4. Further relax restrictions on emigrants: The United 
States regards freedom of emigration as one of the basic human 
rights. Although China has relaxed its emigration policy on 
several occasions, it is still impossible for Chinese citizens 
to leave the country freely. "Human rights" issues are derived 
from such conditions, which then are linked to the issue of the 
"imprisonment of political offenders," and used to deal with 
China. In Clinton's order to extend MFN status to China last 
year, he continued including freedom of emigration as a 
prerequisite, while requiring China to "permit Chinese citizens 
to emigrate overseas for political or religious reasons, without 
any restriction." This being the case, we suggest that the 
departments concerned further relax restrictions on citizens' 
crossing the border, so that legitimate emigrants many enjoy 
full freedom, and the United States' additional human rights 
condition thus lose its "legal grounds." 
  5. Further reveal the truth concerning U.S. exports of 
prison-produced products: Many states in the United States have 
prison factories, and the law permits the export of their 
products. The United States, however, is making a great fuss 
over products turned out by Chinese prisoners. China has failed 
to fully expose this unreasonable behavior, and seems to be very 
passive. China also should investigate and publish the 
conditions under which U.S. prison products are exported.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (AFP) -- A Chinese delegation led 
by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited the U.S. Embassy 
Wednesday to pay its respects to former U.S. President Richard 
Nixon who died last week. 
  Qian, who is also vice-premier, and Luo Gan, 
secretary-general of the State Council, observed a moment's 
silence in front of a picture of Nixon hanging in the dining 
room of the U.S. ambassador's residence. Qian, copying from a 
prepared text, then wrote a message of condolence in a special 
book. 
  "Nixon, when he was president of the United States, opened 
the door to Sino-US relations and made a valuable historical 
contribution. I want to express my heartfelt sorrow," Qian 
wrote. Luo wrote a similar message, expressing his sympathy for 
Nixon's relatives. 
  Wreaths "expressing deep condolences" from President Jiang 
Zemin, Premier Li Peng and vice premier in charge of the economy 
Zhu Rongji, surrounded the Nixon portrait. 
  Nixon is best remembered in China for his historic 1972 
visit 
here which ended decades of mutual hostility and paved the way 
for the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen offered his condolences here 
this morning on the unfortunate death of former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon, who made important contributions to the 
improvement and growth of Sino-U.S. ties. 
  Today the U.S. Embassy was filled with a solemn silence. 
Wreaths presented by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen as well as State 
Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan 
were placed in the mourning hall of the U.S. Embassy. A portrait 
of Nixon draped with black gauze was hung on the wall in the 
hall. 
  At about 9:30 A.M. Qian and Luo slowly walked into the 
embassy and shook hands with U.S. Ambassador to China J. 
Stapleton Roy, expressing their deep condolences on Nixon's 
death. 
  They stood silently in front of a portrait of the deceased 
for a while and then each wrote a few words of commemoration in 
a mourning book. 
  Qian's inscription read, "During the time he served as U.S. 
president, Mr. Nixon opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations and 
made historic contributions." Luo's inscription expressed his 
deep condolences and sent his best regards to Nixon's family and 
relatives. 
  Also on hand were Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Jiang 
Enzhu, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's 
National People's Congress Zhu Qizhen, Vice-Minister of the 
State Sports Commission Liu Ji and Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor of 
Beijing. 
  Nixon died of a major stroke on the evening of April 22 at 
the Cornell Medical Center in New York at the age of 81. 
  He had always been keen in Sino-U.S. relations and visited 
China on seven occasions. During his presidency he opened the 
door to Sino-U.S. relations together with the late Chairman Mao 
Zedong and the late Premier Zhou Enlai, thus opening up a new 
phase in bilateral ties.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS) -- The Chinese Vice Premier 
and Foreign Minister Mr. Qian Qichen and other officials went to 
the U.S. Embassy here this morning to express their condolences 
on the death of former U.S. President Mr. Richard M. Nixon. The 
Chinese President Mr. Jiang Zemin, the Premier Mr. Li Peng and

wreaths there. 
  The Chinese government decided yesterday that it would 
dispatch Vice Premier Mr. Zou Jiahua who was now visiting the 
United States to attend the funeral which would be held in Yorba 
Linda, California, the hometown to the former president. 
  Several Chinese leaders including Mr. Jiang Zemin, Mr. Li 
Peng, Mr. Zhu Rongji and Mr. Qian Qichen sent condolence 
messages to mourn Mr. Nixon's death the day after the former 
president died. They paid respects to this politician for his 
important role in international politics. 
  The Chinese leaders praised Mr. Nixon for his strategic 
farsightedness and political bravery when in his capacity as 
37th U.S. President together with Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and 
Zhou Enlai he opened the era of diplomatic ties between China 
and the United States. He visited China on seven occasions 
after stepping down. The last two visits to Beijing in October, 
1989, and April, 1993 were to deal with the Chinese leadership 
on solution to problems harming bilateral relations resulting 
from the "June 4 incident" and the granting of Most Favoured 
Nation status. 
  Mr. Nixon was the first U.S. President after World War II to 
visit China 22 years ago. He appeared at a welcoming banquet on 
the evening of February 21, 1972, and delivered a speech on 
behalf of the U.S. Government and the American people. He said 
in his speech that should the people of the United States and 
China make enemies of each other, the future of the entire world 
would be very gloomy. He added that were the people of the two 
powers to find common ground for cooperation, the chances for 
peace for the entire world would increase immeasurably. Mr. 
Nixon said in his speech that the two countries were once 
enemies and they still harboured great differences. He, 
however, noted that mutual interest was the factor to help them 
join together and go beyond the differences.

  [Text] Washington, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Funeral services 
for former U.S. President Richard Nixon were held at 04:00 p.m. 
local time (23:00 GMT) today at the Nixon Library and birthplace 
in Yorba Linda, Orange County, California. 
  Nixon died in a New York hospital last Friday [22 April] 
night at the age of 81 after suffering a major stroke last 
Friday night. [sentence as received] 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton and four former U.S. presidents, 
Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, along 
with U.S. congressional leaders and senior government officials 
were among the more than 2,000 guests at the service presided 
over by Nixon's life-long friend the Rev. Billy Graham. 
  Among foreign guests from some 88 countries were Chinese 
Vice- Premier Zou Jiahua, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu 
Huaqiu and Chinese ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu 
representing the Chinese Government. They paid tribute to the 
late U.S. statesman, who opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations 
and made important contributions to the improvement and 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  As the service began under cloudy skies, Nixon's mahogany 
casket, draped with two U.S. national flags, was moved to the 
front of the library by ten U.S. soldiers in dress uniforms, 
while the mourners stood to pay tribute. 
  The mourners were then addressed by Nixon's secretary of 
state Henry Kissinger, U.S. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, 
California Governor Pete Wilson and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  In their eulogies, they all recollected Nixon's triumphs and 
crises, and hailed him as a great leader. 
  Dole said that Nixon will be remembered as a great statesman 
of the second half of the 20th century. 
  President Clinton praised Nixon as a leader with a sharp and 
vigilant mind and expressed his gratitude once again for Nixon's 
special counsel on Russia. 
  Following the eulogies, four jet planes flew over the 
library 
where the service was being held. 
  At the end of the 85-minute service, which was the first 
funeral of a former president since Lyndon Johnson in January 
1973, Nixon was laid to rest beside his wife pat, who died of 
lung cancer last June. They are buried in a rose garden a few 
steps from the black tile and whitewall house where Nixon was 
born 81 years ago. 
  The garden was fashioned after the White House Rose Garden 
and his wife of 53 years held it dear; it has more than 100 
varieties of flowers -- pink, red and white. Fittingly, 
burgundy roses named for the former first lady are now in full 
bloom. And one of the roses came from China. 
  Finally, a 21-gun salute was fired to pay tribute to the 
37th 
president, and the two U.S. national flags that had draped the 
casket were folded into triangles and presented to Nixon's two 
daughters. 
  Earlier, funeral service officials said, about 42,000 people 
filed past Nixon's casket in 21 hours as it lay in the Nixon 
Library yesterday afternoon. 
  Mourners waited in a line three miles long and some waited 
for as long as eight hours in chilly and damp weather to glimpse 
the flag- draped casket in the library lobby. 
  In the lobby, mourners were greeted by a large color photo 
of 
a grinning Nixon giving a thumbs-up gesture. There was also a 
picture taken by Nixon and his wife on China's Great Wall during 
one of their visits to China. 
  Wreaths from China, Russia and Poland, and many more 
flowers, 
adorned the casket, which stood on a pedestal under the gaze of 
a military honor guard. 
  Clinton declared today as a mourning day throughout the 
United States and federal government offices closed out of 
respect for the late U.S. president. 
  The U.S. Postal Service suspended regular mail delivery and 
offices were closed for the day. The U.S. Congress, the Supreme 
Court, and all U.S. stock, bond and commodities markets also 
closed today.

  [Text] Washington, April 26 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton today offered U.S. congratulations to the people of 
South Africa and pledged to cooperate with the new government 
when the elections are over. 
  Clinton made the remarks before meeting a group of 
congressmen who visited South Africa a couple of weeks ago. 
  "To have this multi-racial election is really a wonderful 
thing," Clinton said. "The United States is committed to this 
process and its success, and we'll be there as a partner when 
the elections are over." 
  On Monday [25 April], Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said 
Washington would double its economic aid to South Africa once 
the first multi-race government takes over. 
  In a speech sponsored by the Howard University Committee on 
South Africa, Brown said Washington will pledge about 160 
million dollars to the nation after this week's historic 
elections. 
  The U.S. will also encourage its companies to invest in 
South 
Africa, Brown said. 
  At present, the U.S. Agency for International Development 
provides 80 million dollars in educational and humanitarian aid 
to non-governmental organizations in South Africa. 
  Officials said the new assistance will cover such 
traditional 
aid programs as housing, health and other social needs.

  [Text] London, April 26 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said today that Bosnian Serbs must do more to 
avert the threat of NATO air strikes. 
  Speaking to reporters after talks with British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, Christopher said the Serbs had not yet 
done enough to avoid the threat of being bombed. 
  "The information I have this morning is that the Serbs have 
moved a number of heavy weapons outside the 20 km zone, but 
there are a number still there," he said. 
  "It is clear that today will be an important day to see if 
they really will comply with requirements," he stressed. 
  Hurd also told reporters that he hoped the Serbs would pull 
back completely. 
  "If they don't then they know there will be air strikes 
against them," he warned. 
  Christopher and Hurd conferred as the "contact group", made 
up of high-level officials of the United States, Russia, the 
European Union and the United Nations, its first meeting in 
London [as received] to coordinate efforts to bring peace to 
Bosnia. 
  NATO has given the Serbs until 0001 GMT on Wednesday [27 
April] to pull back all heavy weapons to at least 20 km from the 
U.N. safe haven of Gorazde.

  [Text] Washington, April 26 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
Defense William Perry today urged his Russian counterpart Pavel 
Grachev to keep the joint U.S.-Russian military exercises 
planned for July. 
  In a telephone conversation originally intended to focus on 
Bosnia, Perry "urged Minister Grachev to push within his 
government to keep the exercise going forward," Pentagon 
spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski said. 
  Delaski refused to characterize Grachev's response other 
than 
to say that the minister accepted Perry's concern and said he 
would take it to his government. 
  The week-long joint exercises, scheduled for July in the 
Ural 
Mountains with 250 troops from each country, was agreed upon by 
Grachev and Perry's predecessor Les Aspin, when Washington and 
Moscow were enjoying their diplomatic honeymoon. 
  Ties between the two countries soured recently following the 
Aldrich Ames spy case and differences over Bosnia and in other 
front. 
  No longer branding it as warm partners, secretary of 
defense, 
before a trip to the former Soviet Union, characterized 
U.S.-Russian relationship as a "pragmatic partnership." 
  Earlier today, Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's spokesman, said Yeltsin instructed the defense 
department to consult with Washington on the matter. 
  The move came after Russian parliamentarians from the State 
Duma, the lower house, called the exercise an American plot to 
invade Russia. 
  Yeltsin "regards with understanding the doubts expressed in 
the Duma about the expediency of the joint Russian-U.S. staff 
and field exercise," Kostikov said. 
  At the Pentagon, Delaski said the Russian move came as a 
surprise in the U.S. although "our experts on this issue may 
have had an inkling." 
  In response to the Russian objection to exercises in the 
Urals, Delaski said conducting the games elsewhere or on U.S. 
ground was "certainly a possibility." 
  "Originally, we talked about the possibility of doing them 
in 
the U.S. or in Russia or even in neutral territory somewhere in 
Europe," she said. "So that remains a possibility."

  [Text] Ningbo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. expedition 
arrived in Xiangshan County, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, 
yesterday in search of the wreckage of an American Air Force 
B-25 bomber that crashed 52 years ago. 
  The 19-strong expedition, headed by Bryan Moon, former vice- 
president of the Northwest Airline Company of the United States, 
includes divers, pilots, photographers and other members. 
  Commanded by General Doolittle, a squadron of U.S. bombers 
launched America's first air strike during World War Two on 
Tokyo on April 18, 1942. 
  The bombers were scheduled to land at the airport in Quzhou, 
Zhejiang Province, but lost contact with the airport while 
returning from their mission. 
  The airmen had to abandon their planes by parachute after 
they ran out of fuel. 
  It has been verified that six bombers crashed in Zhejiang 
Province and that 27 airmen were rescued by local residents and 
returned home, while three died. 
  The bombers were believed to have crashed in the sea off 
Zhejiang Province or in its mountains, with the exception of the 
No. 15 bomber. 
  Griffith Williams, a co-navigator of the No. 15 bomber, one 
of the airmen who survived the crash, recalled that the bomber 
floated for about eight minutes on the sea before sinking, just 
giving the crew time to get into their inflatable life-boat. 
  Later, the pilot of the bomber was rescued by Zhao Xiaobao, 
wife of a local fisherman. Zhao provided the pilot with food, 
shelter and clothing, and hid him to avoid search by Japanese 
soldiers. 
  In March 1993, the Chinese Government agreed to Bryan Moon's 
request that his expedition enter islands off-limits in Zhejiang 
to search for the wreckage of the bomber. 
  During the expedition Moon and his assistants enlisted help 
from Zhao Xiaobao's family. Zhao's son, a fisherman, took Moon 
to where he netted an aluminum plate. 
  Moon found that the place where the plate was found was 
identical with that where the bomber sank, as shown by Williams 
on a map. 
  In September 1993 the Chinese Government agreed to Moon's 
request that a Sino-American joint expedition be organized in 
search of the wreckage of the bomber. 
  Henry Potter, 76, a pilot in the squadron commanded by 
General Doolittle, is one of the members of the joint 
expedition, which is set to begin operations off Tantoushan 
Island in Xiangshan County. 
  He said that to search for the wreckage of the sunken bomber 
is his long-cherished wish. 
  If the wreckage is found, that would be the happiest thing 
in 
his life, said Potter, who was rescued by Zhejiang rural 
residents 52 years ago. 
  "Without the help of the Chinese people, I would not have 
been what I am today," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Li Lanqing, in meeting here today with Ian m. Rolland, chairman 
and chief executive officer of the U.S.-based Lincoln National 
Corporation, said that developing bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation is beneficial for both China and the United States. 
  Li said that China is the biggest developing country, the 
U.S. is the biggest developed one, and the economies of the two 
countries are mutually complementary. 
  Developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is 
conducive to the economic development of the two countries and 
global economic development as well as to maintaining world 
peace and stability, said Li. 
  Developing bilateral trade and strengthening exchanges in 
culture and education between the U.S. and China are good for 
the two countries and their peoples, said Rolland, adding that 
he believes that the majority of the businessmen in the U.S. 
share the same view. 
  "We believe that more and more U.S. politicians will also 
share the same view," Li said. 
  Rolland said there is no such force that can hold back the 
momentum of the development of bilateral trade. 
  The Lincoln National Corporation, founded in 1905 and named 
after late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, is one of the top ten 
insurance companies in the U.S. 
  Rolland said that his company is deeply impressed by China's 
economic development and is interested in its insurance market. 
  He said that his company will set up a Beijing office on 
April 28, and that they are looking forward to developing the 
China market. 
  Li expressed his congratulations on the opening of the 
Beijing office, saying that "a thousand-li journey is started by 
taking the first step" and that he is convinced that the office 
will experience good development in the future. 
  Rolland and his party arrived here April 22 as guests of the 
China Association for International Friendly Contacts.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Acting Premier Zhu 
Rongji met with visiting Canadian Governor-General Ramon John 
Hnatyshyn at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this afternoon. 
  Zhu welcomed Hnatyshyn and gave him greetings from Premier 
Li 
Peng -- away on a Central Asian official tour. 
  Hnatyshyn said that he was glad to meet Zhu again, whom he 
met with last may in Canada. 
  Zhu said that Hnatyshyn had very good talks with President 
Jiang Zemin yesterday, and that he believed that his current 
visit would further promote the friendly cooperative relations 
between China and Canada. 
  Touching on bilateral trade relations, Zhu said that China 
attaches great importance to its trade cooperation with canada, 
especially in the field of agriculture. 
  Zhu said that China was willing to further its trade 
relations with Canada, adding that the economies of the two 
countries are mutually complementary, and the potential for 
future cooperation was great. 
  The Chinese acting premier said that the economic recovery 
in 
canadian regions along the Pacific coast was better than that of 
the region along the atlantic coast. The reason was that the 
economic cooperation between canada's Pacific region and Asia 
had developed faster than that of the other regions in canada. 
  Hnatyshyn agreed with Zhu's views. He stressed that the most 
favored nations trading status between the two countries was 
unconditional, adding that developing cooperative relations 
between Canada and China was in the interests of both countries. 
  Sun Yongfu, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception 
Committee and vice-minister of railways, and Vice-Foreign 
Minister Jiang Enzhu, as well as Canadian senior officials 
accompanying the governor-general, took part in the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Canadian 
Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn said here today that the 
Canadian Government would continue to support the cooperation 
between the universities of the two countries. 
  He said this in a speech to about 200 students and teachers 
at Qinghua University, one of the most prestigious in China. 
  He expressed his satisfaction with the academic exchanges 
between the universities of the two countries over the last 
decade. 
  He made the speech during a tour of the university after his 
meeting with Chinese acting Premier Zhu Rongji in the morning. 
  Following the speech, three Qinghua professors gave him an 
outline of the cooperative projects between Qinghua University 
and Canadian ones. 
  Professor Zhao Chunjun, deputy dean of the School of 
Economics and Management of Qinghua, told Hnatyshyn that since 
the Sino- Canadian cooperative project on management education 
began in 1984, over 30 Canadian professors had taught at 
Qinghua, and a center had been set up in the university to train 
Chinese management officials. 
  About 200 Chinese managers had taken courses on 
international 
marketing, international finance, technology transfer, 
securities and stocks, as well as development of human 
resources, Zhao said, adding that the project had yielded good 
results. 
  In the afternoon, Hnatyshyn visited the Beijing 
International 
Earth Station. 
  There he attended a ceremony marking the finish of initial 
testing of the first phase of construction of the Beijing 
domestic satellite telecommunications earth-station, a 
cooperative project between China's Post and Telecommunication 
Ministry and the spar company of Canada. 
  It was learned that 19 earth stations will be established in 
China after the project is completed, and 14 of them have been 
set up in the first stage. China and the Canadian company were 
satisfied with the testing of the first phase of the project. 
  During the second stage, which is predicted to be finished 
within the year, another five stations will be established. 
  The governor-general spoke highly of the project, and said 
that Canada would continue its cooperation with China in the 
fields of telecommunications, personnel training and technology 
transfer. 
  The guests are due to leave Beijing for Shanghai tomorrow.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Mayor Huang 
Ju met here this evening with visiting Canadian Governor-General 
Ramon John Hnatyshyn and extended his warm welcome to the 
Canadian guests. 
  During the meeting, Hnatyshyn said that with the speeding up 
of Shanghai's opening and reform in the past few years, more and 
more overseas investors have come to invest in the city and 
Canadian entrepreneurs are enthusiastic about investing here. 
  Hnatyshyn and his party arrived here this morning from 
Beijing.

  [Text] Ottawa, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Canadian Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien said today that his country pays great attention 
to its further development of friendly relations of cooperation 
with China. 
  Meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua here, Chretien 
said mutually beneficial cooperation between Canada and China 
hold out great potential because the two countries, which are 
vast in territory and rich in resources, have their own 
advantages and share a lot of common ground. 
  Canada's advantages in the economy and its advanced 
technology will be useful for China's development of 
infrastructure and modernization drive, he said. 
  Chretien expressed his warm welcome to the Chinese vice 
premier who arrived in Canada 10 days ago for an official visit. 
It was a wise and foresight decision in 1970 when the Canadian 
Government led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau established 
diplomatic relations with China, he said. 
  Chretien said he is confident that the two countries will 
make their efforts to strengthen the good relations. 
  During the meeting, Chinese Vice Premier Zou said he is 
delighted to see the emergence of new trend towards all-round 
development in the Sino-Canadian relations. 
  He said China and Canada are faced with a rare opportunity 
to 
enhance their ties and a lot of things can be done in the 
development of the mutual cooperation between the two countries. 
  He hopes that the two countries will make common efforts to 
promote the Sino-Canadian relations to a new high. 
  On behalf of Premier Li Peng, Zou also invited Chretien to 
visit China later this year at his convenience and Chretien 
accepted the invitation. Chretien said he will head a group of 
businessmen and provincial premiers for the China visit. 
  Present at the meeting were Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet, 
Finance Minister Paul Marti and Secretary of State 
(Asia-Pacific) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Raymon Chan on 
the Canadian side. 
  On the Chinese side, Vice Chairman of the State Planning 
Commission Zeng Peiyan, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, vice 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation Zhen Silin 
and Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun attended the 
meeting. 
  After the meeting, Zou left Ottawa for the United States by 
a 
special plane to attend the funeral of the former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu also left here 
in the same plane.

  [Text] Almaty, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng and Kazakhstan President N.A. Nazarbayev held two rounds of 
talks here today on bilateral relations and international issues 
of common concern. 
  Li Peng told Nazarbayev that China attaches great importance 
to its ties with Kazakhstan, which he described as a new type of 
relationship based on mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, 
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
  Nazarbayev said that Li's visit was an historic event in 
terms of bilateral relations, which would serve to deepen the 
friendship between the two countries. 
  "Relations with China enjoy a top position in Kazakhstan's 
foreign policy," he added. 
  According to a Chinese spokesman Nazarbayev said that 
Kazakhstan adheres to the position of non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs, opposes national splittism as well as 
hegemonism, and will never allow factions of "East Turkestan" to 
involve themselves in activities here against China that will 
hurt Sino-Kazakhstan relations. 
  Nazarbayev also stressed that Kazakhstan will not develop 
any 
kind of official relations with Taiwan, which it recognizes as 
an inalienable part of China's territory. 
  Li voiced appreciation for Nazarbayev's remarks on not 
allowing national separatists to engage in activities against 
China in Kazakhstan and for his stance on Taiwan and Tibet. 
  "The Chinese Government appreciates the efforts made by 
President Nazarbayev as well as the Kazakhstan Government to 
develop bilateral ties and to safeguard peace and stability," he 
said. 
  He noted that China and Kazakhstan share identical or 
similar 
views on many international issues. 
  The two leaders spoke highly of the signing of the Sino- 
Kazakhstan border agreement, calling it "an event of historic 
significance and an important indication of the further growth 
of friendship," according to the spokesman. 
  "It shows that Sino-Kazakhstan relations are based on mutual 
trust and full of vitalities," Li said. 
  "We will work together for the building of a new 'silk road' 
and turn our common border into a bond of everlasting peace, 
friendship and cooperation," he added. 
  Nazarbayev said the development of equal and 
mutually-beneficial trade and economic cooperation between 
Kazakhstan and China has a broad basis, and Kazakhstan hopes to 
"further enrich the content, expand the scope and raise the 
level of such cooperation." 
  Li voiced full support for those aims pointing out that 
China 
takes a positive attitude towards President Nazarbayev's 
proposal for furthering bilateral cooperation. 
  "The two countries should encourage their enterprises to 
develop cooperation," he said, adding that the improvement of 
transportation would create better conditions for trade and 
economic cooperation between China and the entire central Asia. 
  Li conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's invitation for 
Nazarbayev to visit China again, the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Sun Zhanlin (1327 0594 2651) and Ju </F>
Mengjun (0215 1322 6511)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and 
Kazakh President Nazarbayev held two rounds of talks at the 
presidential office here this morning. They had an in-depth 
exchange of views on Sino-Kazakh relations and issues of common 
interest. 
  The talks were conducted in a cordial and friendly 
atmosphere. Li Peng said: "Our talks have been fruitful. The 
talks, which have deepened mutual understanding and trust, will 
be conducive to further expanding relations between the two 
countries in various fields." 
  He added: China and Kazakhstan are neighbors sharing a long 
border. China attaches great importance to its friendship with 
Kazakhstan. The two countries hold identical or similar views 
on many international issues. He pointed out: Sino-Kazakh 
relations are new-type relations based on equality, mutual 
benefit, respect, and noninterference in each other's internal 
affairs. 
  Nazarbayev stated: Premier Li Peng's visit to Kazakhstan, 
the first in history by a Chinese leader, is a historic event in 
Kazakh-Chinese relations. He added: To develop relations with 
China is a priority of Kazakhstan's foreign policy. Kazakhstan 
will stick to the stance of noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs, will oppose national separatism and 
hegemonism, and will not allow "Eastern Turkistan" to carry out 
activities from Kazakhstan against China to the detriment of 
Kazakh-Chinese relations. Kazakhstan maintains that Taiwan is 
an integral part of the Chinese territory, and that Almaty will 
not have any official contacts whatsoever with Taiwan. 
  Li Peng expressed appreciation for Nazarbayev's stand that 
the Kazakh Government will not allow national separatists to 
engage in anti-Chinese activities from Kazakhstan. He also 
thanked the Kazakh Government for taking the correct stand on 
the Taiwan and Tibet issues. 
  The two leaders highly evaluated the Sino-Kazakh border 
agreement, which they believed is a historical event in 
bilateral relations and another important hallmark of the growth 
of Sino- Kazakh goodneighborly and friendly relations. The 
agreement will have a positive impact on expanding economic 
cooperation between the two countries. Li Peng said: The 
signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement once again shows to 
the entire world that Sino-Kazakh relations are founded on 
mutual trust and have strong vitality. He added: "We shall 
strive to build a new silk road together and will turn the 
Sino-Kazakh border into a boundary of peace, tranquility, 
friendship, and cooperation." 
  Discussing bilateral economic and trade relations, 
Nazarbayev 
noted there exists broad foundations for developing economic and 
trade relations based on equality and mutual benefit. He hoped 
to further enrich the contents of cooperation and expand the 
areas of cooperation at a level commensurate with the two 
countries' potential. Li Peng said: "Despite the large growth 
in bilateral trade in recent years, there is still room for 
further development. I entirely agree with Your Excellency the 
President's proposal for further developing cooperation between 
the two countries. China will adopt a positive approach toward 
this proposal." 
  LI Peng conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings to 
Nazarbayev, as well as the Chinese president's invitation to him 
to visit China once again. Nazarbayev asked Li Peng to relay 
his best wishes and gratitude to President Jiang Zemin.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Hongzhi (6079 1347 3112) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Kazakh President 
Nazarbayev hosted a banquet here this evening to give a warm 
welcome to Premier Li Peng on his visit to Kazakhstan. 
  Nazarbayev first proposed an ebullient toast. He said: 
Kazakhstan is located on the border of Europe and Asia, like a 
bridge linking the civilization of the East with the 
civilization of the West. The people of Kazakhstan know very 
well their neighbor China's long history and industrious and 
wise people. The Government of Kazakhstan appreciates China's 
important role in the international arena and its basic 
principles for handling international relations. 
  Quoting a saying shared by both the Kazakh and Chinese 
peoples, he said, "Neighbors are dearer than distant relatives." 
Kazakhstan will develop long-term, stable, good-neighbor, 
friendly, and cooperative relations with China, and this has 
been proven again by the Kazakh-Chinese border agreement signed 
today. 
  Responding to the toast, Premier Li Peng said: President 
Nazarbayev paid a very successful visit to China and held 
fruitful talks with President Jiang Zemin last year. The joint 
statement signed by the two sides then has laid a solid 
foundation for the development of bilateral relations. "Today 
we signed another historic document -- the Chinese-Kazakh border 
agreement. It declares that the more than 1,700-km-long border 
between the two countries will be an area of permanent peace and 
friendship." 
  Li Peng said: "My talks with President Nazarbayev this 
morning had to be extended another hour because we had a great 
deal to discuss. We had an in-depth discussion on a wide range 
of issues, including bilateral relations, regional and 
international issues, as well as political, diplomatic, 
economic, and cultural affairs. Your Excellency's repeated 
emphasis on Kazakhstan's attaching importance to its relations 
with China has left a deep impression on me." 
  Premier Li Peng again expressed his appreciation for the 
Kazakh Government's principled position on adhering to the 
"one-China" policy and opposing national splittism, as well as 
on the Tibet issue. He also expressed his appreciation for 
President Nazarbayev's efforts to promote peace and security in 
Asia. 
  He said: "From as early as ancient times, the great `Silk 
Road' has linked our two countries. Today, China and Kazakhstan 
face the common task of building a new 'Silk Road.' We should 
fully use this road of friendship and cooperation to bring about 
common prosperity and development." 
  Premier Li Peng's entourage also attended the banquet by 
invitation. They included Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife; 
Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister of the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of 
the State Council's Foreign Affairs Office. President 
Nazarbayev's wife; Kazakh Prime Minister Tereshchenko, and 
Speaker Kekilbayev also attended the banquet to help entertain 
the guests.

  [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng today stated a six-point proposition for 
developing China's economic cooperation with Central Asian 
nations. 
  Li made the statement to about five hundred business people 
in Kazakhstan, the last of four Central Asian countries he has 
visited in the past nine days. 
  The six principles are as follows: 
  Firstly, cooperation should be based on equality and mutual 
benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In 
specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's 
needs, stick to the principle of exchange at equal values, and 
maintain balance of trade, which should be regularized. The 
setting up of joint ventures should benefit both or all parties, 
with the purpose to help develop the national economies of 
relevant countries. 
  Secondly, cooperation should be developed in diversified 
forms. While exchange of commodities takes up a big portion in 
bilateral trade at present, cash payment represents the trend of 
development. For that, means of banking settlement need to be 
improved. Also, the Chinese Government fully agrees with the 
Central Asian nations' hope to develop economic cooperation with 
different parts of China, in addition to the nearby Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region. 
  Thirdly, economic cooperation should proceed from the actual 
conditions, with full use of local resources. Also, market 
prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very 
beginning of joint ventures, which need to bring in good 
economic returns with competitive products. 
  Fourthly, communications and transportation need to be 
improved, with a view to building up a new "Silk Road." China 
and Kazakhstan have reached an important agreement in this 
regard. The two sides should strive to ensure smooth traffic 
through the Euro-Asia continental bridge, to bring benefits to 
all countries concerned. 
  Fifthly, the small amount of economic assistance China has 
provided the Central Asian nations within its means is only a 
symbol of friendship from the people of China, which itself 
remains a developing country and faces an arduous task of 
economic development. 
  Sixthly, China is willing to develop multi-lateral 
cooperation to promote common development. China's open policy 
is meant for the developing countries as well as the developed 
nations, particularly the neighboring countries. While China 
will work for the expansion of cooperation with the Central 
Asian nations, it is also willing to see the growth of their 
trade, economic cooperation and friendly contact with other 
countries. China is ready to participate in equal and fair 
competition. 
  "China seeks no spheres of economic or political influence 
in 
Central Asia," he asserted, in ending the speech.

  [Text] Alma Ata, April 26 (CNS) -- At the end of his visit 
to four Central Asian countries, China's Premier Li Peng hosted 
a forum here with the delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs 
accompanying him on his visit, Mr. Li said that China would 
never seek its own sphere of influence in the region and would 
not hinder other countries from investing in the Central Asian 
countries. 
  Premier Li said that special attention would be given to the 
quality of commodities entering the Central Asian markets and 
legitimate business should be protected and speculation cracked 
down on. Border trade should continue to develop and its 
operational level enhanced. 
  In reply to a question on the issue of dual nationality put 
to him by a journalist today, the premier said that China did 
not recognize dual nationality as was made clear in China's Law 
on Nationality. There were now 50 million people in the world 
of Chinese origin living outside China with most of them living 
in Southeast Asian countries. The fact that such a large number 
of people of Chinese origin were living overseas was a 
historical result and China accepted this historical fact. 
China had offered them the right to choose their nationality. 
They could either choose Chinese nationality or that of the 
country in which they lived. That option meant that they could 
enjoy all the rights and fulfill the obligations of the country 
which they choose. 
  This morning, a Sino-Kazakh border agreement was signed here 
by Premier Li and the President of Kazakhstan, N. A. Nazarbayev. 
  The Sino-Kazakh border is over 1,700 kilometres in length 
and 
the two sides reached agreement on more than 1,600 kilometres of 
its length. At their meeting, the Kazakh president said that 
Kazakhstan adhered to the principle of non-interference in the 
internal affairs of other countries and opposed national 
splittism and hegemonism. Kazakhstan, he said, would not allow 
"East Turkistan" to stage anti-China activities and undermine 
Kazakh-Chinese relations in Kazakh territory. 
  President Nazarbayev also said that Kazakhstan considered 
Taiwan an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and 
Kazakhstan would not have any official contacts with Taiwan.

  "The visit has achieved the desired objective of enhancing 
mutual understanding, promoting friendship and expanding 
mutually- beneficial cooperation," he said. 
  Dai said the principles Li stated during the tour on 
developing political as well as economic relations with the 
Central Asian nations are "a long-term policy." 
  As time goes by, these principles will show its increasing 
vitalities, Dai said, calling the prospect "inspiring" for 
cooperation with Central Asia in both political and economic 
fields. 
  Referring to the signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement 
and the common wish expressed by China and Kyrgyzstan to solve 
the border issue at an early date, Dai said Li's tour served to 
further improve China's "environment in the neighborhood." 
  "We hope to see an early successful settlement of the border 
issue with all the neighboring countries to the north, and turn 
our common boundary into a bond of lasting peace and 
friendship," he said. 
  After the tour of the four former Soviet republics, Li will 
continue his trip to Mongolia for a two-day official visit that 
will end on April 29.

(0719 2885 2504)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Foreign 
Minister Dai Bingguo said during an interview with reporters in 
Almaty on 28 April: Premier Li Peng's visit to four Central 
Asian countries was a complete success, marking a new stage of 
development in the relations of good-neighborliness, friendship, 
and cooperation between China and those countries. 
  Dai Bingguo said: "The visit, with rich contents, was of 
great significance and remarkable success" It will certainly 
move relations between China and the Central Asian nations 
toward a greater depth and breadth. The visit has achieved the 
desired objective of enhancing mutual understanding and trust, 
promoting the relations of good-neighborliness and friendship, 
and expanding mutually-beneficial cooperation. 
  He particularly mentioned the important speech delivered by 
Premier Li Peng in Tashkent. He said: It was the first time 
that a Chinese leader had quite completely and openly expounded 
China's basic policies toward the Central Asia countries. What 
he expounded are China's permanent, basic principles, not 
expedient policies. His speech fully showed China's respect for 
the sovereignty of those countries, and its good intentions for 
promoting regional stability and development. The speech has 
aroused a positive response among the Central Asian nations. It 
will certainly yield a far-reaching impact on the relations 
between China and the Central Asian countries. As time goes by, 
the principles proposed in the speech will show their increasing 
vitalities. 
  The visit has enabled us to see many common stands shared by 
China and the Central Asian nations: Both sides want to 
maintain long-term relations of good-neighborliness and 
friendship, be good friends and good neighbors, and develop 
friendship and cooperation in all fields. Both sides maintain 
that every country should choose its own political system, 
ideology, and road of development according to its own 
situation; all countries are equal regardless of size; and a 
new, just and rational international political and economic 
order should be established. Both sides are anxious to maintain 
a lasting peace and stability in the Central Asian region and 
oppose national splittism and other activities detrimental to 
regional stability. Both China and these countries expressed 
their desire to strengthen mutual consultations and cooperation 
in international affairs. 
  Dai Bingguo said: In Almaty, Premier Li Peng made an 
important six-point proposition on developing economic 
cooperation with the Central Asian countries. Both China and 
the Central Asian countries want to continue to expand and 
strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation on an equal footing, 
enrich the contents of cooperation, increase the forms of 
cooperation, improve the environment of cooperation, and enhance 
the benefits of cooperation. Chinese entrepreneurs who 
accompanied the premier on the trip had wide contacts with their 
counterparts in the four Central Asian countries, and reached a 
series of agreements and signed a number of letters of intent on 
cooperation with the latter, indicating a good start for 
cooperation between the enterprises of the two sides. 
  Dai Bingguo emphasized: During the premier's visit, the 
Chinese Government signed a series of bilateral cooperation 
documents with the governments of those countries. The most 
important of them is the Sino-Kazakh border agreement. The 
conclusion of the agreement was an event of great historic 
significance, and it will yield a far-reaching impact on the 
development of bilateral relations. Dai Bingguo said: During 
the talks between Premier Li Peng and Kyrgyz leaders, both sides 
shared the willingness to settle their border issue at an early 
date. The settlement of border issues between China and these 
countries will help us create a good border environment.

  [Text] Almaty, April 27 (CNS) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's 
trip to four Central Asian countries represented a new stage in 
which China established intensive and extensive relations with 
the four countries, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Dai 
Bingguo said today. He added that the visit had succeeded in 
its purpose of boosting understanding and confidence as well as 
cooperation and good neighbourliness between China and the four 
countries based on mutual interest. 
  Mr. Dai noted that during the visit Mr. Li exchanged views 
with leaders of the four countries of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, 
Kyrgyztan and Kazakhstan on bilateral relations and on 
international as well as regional matters of mutual concern. He 
also said that China and these countries shared common ground in 
political and economic sectors. First, China and these 
countries were very eager to develop bilateral relations and the 
leaders of China and these countries would continue to boost 
exchange and contacts. 
  Second, China and these Central Asian countries confirmed 
that they should choose their own political system, ideology and 
road to be followed based on their national situation. Other 
countries were not entitled to interfere with the internal 
affairs of a particular country. They also agreed on equality 
enjoyed by each country irrespective of how big or small, rich 
or poor and strong or weak they are. A just and reasonable 
international political and economic order has to be established. 
  Third, the five countries were all anxious to maintain 
stability and peace in the Central Asian region. 
  Fourth, they all opposed nationalist splittism and other 
activities disadvantageous to regional stability. 
  Fifth, China and these countries expressed their hope to 
strengthen mutual consultation and cooperation in international 
affairs. 
  Sixth, they all strongly hoped to expand and intensify 
cooperation based on mutual benefits in the economic field for 
better results. 
  Finally, China and the four Central Asian countries agreed 
that the Euro-Asian continental bridge had to be fully used 
while at the same time measures had to be explored for the 
setting up of a modern "Silk Road". 
  Mr. Dai said he was convinced that China and the four 
countries had promising prospects on political relations as well 
as on economic and trade cooperation.

  [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Visiting 
Chinese Premier Li Peng said today that there will be high-level 
exchange of visits between Chinese and Russian leaders this year. 
  The Chinese premier made the announcement at a press 
conference here this afternoon, a day before ending his tour of 
Central Asia. 
  Asked about Sino-Russian relations, Li called the growth of 
such ties normal in the past few years. 
  President Boris Yeltsin paid a fruitful visit to China and 
bilateral trade has surpassed the level of that with the former 
Soviet Union, Li said. 
  Touching on the so-called China's intention to "fill in the 
vacuum" left by the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, 
Li restated that China seeks no spheres of influence, neither 
political or economic, in Central Asia. 
  "We have a lot of matters to take care of at home and have 
no 
interest or intention to fill in the so-called vacuum," Li said. 
  His visit is meant to develop friendship with the Central 
Asian nations and not directed against any other countries, Li 
said.

  [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, addressing a press conference here this 
afternoon, stated that a complete nuclear test ban should be 
established through negotiations. 
  Asked about China's attitude towards such a policy, Li said 
that while China is a nuclear country, its nuclear weapons take 
up only a very small portion of the world's total. 
  "China has initiated the proposition of not using nuclear 
weapons first and not resorting to threats with nuclear 
weapons," he noted. 
  He pointed out that the Chinese Government always stands for 
a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons, and for the realization of a complete nuclear test ban 
in such a context. 
  Towards that aim, he said: "the Chinese Government holds 
that 
it is of positive significance to reach a pact on a complete 
nuclear test ban through negotiations." 
  He added that China has stated clearly that it would work 
towards reaching such a treaty in 1996. 
  "At the moment, China is positively participating in 
negotiations on a complete nuclear test ban of the Geneva 
Disarmament Conference," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun </F>
(0215 1322 6511)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Visiting Premier Li Peng 
met with Kazakhstan's businessmen and entrepreneurs in the 
commercial center here this afternoon. He stated a six-point 
proposition for developing China's economic cooperation with 
Central Asian nations. 
  When Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Kazakh Prime Minister 
Tereshchenko, arrived at the conference hall, he was accorded a 
warm welcome by several hundred entrepreneurs and economic and 
trade officials. 
  Abishev, Kazakh deputy prime minister and minister of 
foreign 
economic relations, spoke first. He said: Kazakh enterprises 
are greatly interested in developing economic cooperation and 
trade with China. China already has some 170 joint ventures 
here. They involve a wide range of businesses and play an 
important role during the course of Kazakhstan's economic 
development. 
  He said: "Kazakhstan and China are mutually complementary in 
economics and there is a great potential for cooperation between 
them. Premier Li Peng's current visit will further promote 
bilateral economic cooperation and trade." 
  Premier Li Peng said in his speech: The Chinese Government 
attaches great importance to developing economic cooperation and 
trade with Kazakhstan. Accompanying me on the trip here are the 
persons in charge of five major Chinese corporations dealing in 
construction engineering, petroleum and natural gas, iron and 
steel, textiles, and import-export of electronic products 
respectively. They are here to have direct contacts with 
Kazakhstan's enterprises and to explore ways of expanding 
cooperation. Extending his welcome to Kazakh entrepreneurs to 
visit China, Li Peng said: "Enhancing understanding is the basis 
for developing cooperation." 
  Premier Li Peng stated a six-point proposition for further 
developing China's economic cooperation and trade with 
Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations: 
  1. Cooperation should be based on equality and mutual 
benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In 
specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's 
needs, benefit each other, stick to the principle of exchange at 
equal values, and basically maintain a balance of trade, which 
should be regularized. The setting up of joint ventures should 
benefit both or all parties, with the fundamental purpose to 
help develop the national economies of relevant countries. 
  2. Cooperation should be developed in diversified forms. 
While barter trade takes up a big portion in bilateral trade at 
present, cash payment trade represents the trend of development. 
Of course, there must be an adequate means of banking 
settlement to conduct cash payment trade. The Chinese 
Government fully agrees with the Central Asian nations' hope to 
develop economic cooperation with different parts of China, in 
addition to the nearby Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  3. Economic cooperation should proceed from the actual 
conditions, with full use of local resources. Economic 
cooperation follows a course of gradual development from small 
to large quantity and from lower to higher level. Market 
prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very 
beginning of joint ventures. Market demand is an important 
factor deciding the survival of enterprises. We should take 
full advantage of local resources such as raw and processed 
materials, and enable enterprises to bring in good economic 
returns with competitive products. To do so, we should give 
full play to the role of those enterprises which have both 
strength and good reputation. 
  4. Communications and transportation need to be improved 
with 
a view to building a new "Silk Road." To further expand 
economic cooperation and trade, it is essential to gradually 
improve communications and transportation. The Chinese railways 
minister and Kazakh transportation minister have held fruitful 
talks and reached an important agreement. The two sides should 
strive to ensure smooth traffic through the Euro-Asia 
continental bridge, to bring benefits to the peoples of all 
countries concerned. 
  5. The small amount of economic assistance China has 
provided 
the Central Asian nations within its means is only a symbol of 
friendship. China itself remains a developing country with a 
very low per-capita GNP and faces an arduous task of economic 
development. China is providing assistance within its power to 
some developing countries, including Central Asian nations, but 
the assistance is very small in amount. It is only a symbol of 
friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of those 
countries. 
  6. China is willing to develop multi-lateral cooperation to 
promote common development. China's open policy is meant for 
the developing countries as well as the developed nations, 
particularly the neighboring countries. While China will 
maintain and further develop friendship and cooperation with 
Kazakstan and other Central Asian nations, it is also willing to 
see the growth of trade, economic cooperation and friendly 
contact between them and other countries. It is a matter of 
course that other countries will come to invest and run 
factories in Central Asian countries. China is ready to 
participate in equal and fair competition. China seeks no 
spheres of economic or political influence in Central Asia. 
  Premier Li Peng's speech won warm applause among Kazakh 
economic and trade officials and entrepreneurs.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], April 28 (XINHUA) -- China and 
Kazakhstan have issued similar press communiques on Chinese 
Premier Li Peng's visit to this country, which ends today. 
  The communique says Li Peng's two rounds of talks with 
President N.A. Nazarbayev proceeded in a friendly atmosphere of 
mutual understanding and trust, as the two leaders had an 
in-depth exchange of views on furthering bilateral ties, 
regional and international issues of mutual concern. 
  Both sides are satisfied with the results of the talks and 
pledged to develop bilateral relations in the spirit of good- 
neighborliness and friendship and to cooperate in the

President Nazarbayev on building trust in Asia, while the 
Kazakhstan side reiterated its support for China's principled 
position on the Taiwan and Tibet issues. Both sides expressed 
opposition to national splittism. 
  Also, the two sides are determined to strictly abide by the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence and the Sino-Kazakhstan 
joint declaration signed last year, with a view to maintaining 
and expanding a long-term friendly relationship of mutually 
beneficial cooperation between the two countries, the document 
says. 
  This, the communique says, is not only in keeping with the 
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but conducive to the 
peace, stability and development in Asia as well. 
  Leaders of the two countries spoke highly of the signing of 
the Sino-Kazakhstan border agreement, calling it a historic 
document and the mark of a friendly relationship, according to 
the communique. 
  The two sides agreed to further expand bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation and stressed the importance of improving 
communications and transportation. In this regard, a summary of 
talks was signed on developing railway transport, the communique 
says. 
  Also, Li conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's invitation 
for President Nazarbayev to revisit China, as part of shared 
willingness to continue the frequent contact between leaders of 
the two countries.

  The two leaders had an in-depth exchange of views on 
furthering bilateral ties and regional and international issues 
of mutual concern. Both sides are satisfied with the results of 
the talks and emphasized that China and Kazakhstan are willing 
to further develop bilateral relations in the spirit of 
good-neighborliness and friendship and to cooperate in the 
international arena so as to consolidate stability and security 
in Asia. The Chinese side expressed its appreciation of the 
measures proposed by President Nazarbayev on building trust in 
Asia, while the Kazakh side reiterated its support for China's 
principled position on the Taiwan and Tibet issues. Both sides 
expressed opposition to national splittism. 
  The communique says: The two sides reiterated their 
determination to strictly abide by the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence and all the principles contained in the 
Sino-Kazakhstan joint declaration signed during President 
Nazarbayev's visit to China in 1993 with a view to maintaining, 
safeguarding, and expanding a long-term relationship of 
good-neighborliness, friendship, mutual benefit, and cooperation 
between the two countries. The two sides held that this is not 
only in keeping with the fundamental interests of the two 
peoples, but conducive to peace, stability, and development in 
Asia as well. 
  The communique points out: Leaders of the two countries 
spoke highly of the signing of the Sino-Kazakhstan border 
agreement and regarded this document of historic significance as 
a proof of good- neighborly and friendly relations between the 
two countries. 
  The two sides agreed to further expand bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation and stressed the importance of improving 
communications and transportation. The two sides signed a 
summary of talks on developing railway transport. 
  The communique adds: The leaders of the two countries shared 
a willingness to continue the frequent high-level contact. 
Premier Li Peng conveyed President Jiang Zemin's best regards 
to President Nazarbayev. On behalf of President Jiang, he 
extended an invitation for President Nazarbayev to revisit China 
at a convenient time. 
  Premier Li Peng expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm 
hospitality accorded him and his entourage by the government and 
the people of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kazakhstan, April 27 (XINHUA) -- 
Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today that his current 
four-nation tour of Central Asia is successful. 
  Speaking at a news conference, Li said he had "comprehensive 
and in-depth" exchange of views with leaders of the four 
countries -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan 
-- on bilateral, regional and international issues. 
  "We reached agreement on a wide range of issues and found 
many common points," Li said. 
  "As far as I know," he said, "the four basic principles and 
six- point proposition I stated for developing relations, 
including economic cooperation, with the Central Asian nations, 
have won good response from leaders and people of all circles in 
the four countries." 
  "We all hope to remain good neighbors and friends forever," 
he added. 
  In particular, Li noted, the signing of the Sino-Kazakhstan 
border agreement defined the boundary in a legal form, saying he 
expected the boundary to be one of "lasting peace and 
friendship." 
  He also said that the visit has achieved substantial results 
in the economic field, for the top trade officials and 
entrepreneurs traveling with him came into wide contact and 
signed a range of agreements, contracts or letters of intent 
with local business circles. 
  In this respect, he said the agreement reached between 
communications departments of China and Kazakhstan on developing 
international railway transportation is "a specially important 
achievement." 
  Before long, he added, "We will invite relevant countries, 
including Russia, Kyrghyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, to 
further discuss the issue to ensure smooth traffic and make full 
use of the new silk road." 
  The Chinese premier, referring to the Sino-Kazakhstan border 
trade issue, said that the selling of shoddy or even fake 
products by some Chinese businessmen, mostly private, run 
against the Chinese Government's policy in this regard. 
  "We are ready to work with the Government of Kazakhstan to 
draw up relevant measures so as to reduce the negative effect," 
he said, adding that large corporations of the two countries 
should form the "main channel" of bilateral trade. 
  Asked to elaborate on talks with President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, Li again voiced appreciation for Kazakhstan 
Government's position on adhering to the "One China" policy with 
regard to the Taiwan and Tibet issues, on not allowing elements 
of "East Turkstan" to undertake activities against China here 
and on opposing national separatism in general. 
  Also, he said, "We support and appreciate President 
Nazarbayev's efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia." 
  The Chinese premier also stated China's position on nuclear 
test ban and talked about Sino-Russian relations. 
  Li arrived here Monday [25 April] on the last leg of the 
10-day Central Asia tour, which is to end Thursday.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun </F>
(0215 1322 6511)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Upon concluding his tour 
of four Central Asian countries, State Council Premier Li Peng 
held a news conference this afternoon at the state guesthouse 
where he was staying. He answered reporters' questions on the 
results achieved during the trip, Sino-Russian relations, 
China's stand on nuclear testing, China's nationalities policy, 
and other issues. 
  First of all, Premier Li Peng said: The current Central 
Asian visit is the first by a Chinese head of government since 
China established diplomatic relations with the four countries. 
"During the visit, I held fruitful [fu you cheng guo di 1381 
2589 2052 2654 4104] talks with the leaders of the countries in 
question, and enhanced mutual understanding. In my opinion, the 
visit has been successful." 
  At the request of a China Central Television Station 
reporter, Li Peng made a further assessment of the concrete 
results of the tour. He said: "I had a comprehensive and 
in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of the four 
countries on international issues, the regional situation, and 
bilateral relations." "I found that we had many common points. 
For example, when I discussed China's continuous economic 
development as a result of its implementation of the policies of 
reform and opening up while maintaining social and political 
stability, the leaders of the four countries expressed similar 
views, saying that maintaining domestic stability is of 
paramount importance to carrying out economic reform and to 
developing the national economy. Also, we all want to be on 
friendly terms, and hope to become good neighbors and friends. 
This is also a common point." 
  Li Peng said: "In my speech in Tashkent, I expounded China's 
four basic policies for developing relations with Central Asian 
nations. In Almaty, I also made a six-point proposition on 
developing economic cooperation and trade with various Central 
Asian countries. As far as I know, my speeches won broad 
support and good response from leaders, as well as business and 
media people, in the four countries." 
  He stressed: The signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement 
is of great significance. The border issue between China and 
Kazakhstan is left over from history and has remained unsolved 
for a long time. That it is being resolved now is the result of 
joint efforts by the two sides. The document defines the 
boundary between the two countries in legal form. "We hope and 
believe that the lengthy Sino-Kazakh border extending more than 
1,700 km will be one of lasting peace and friendship." 
  Li Peng pointed out: The current visit also has achieved 
substantial results in promoting economic cooperation. 
Accompanying me on my tour are senior officials in charge of 
economics and trade, as well as a number of entrepreneurs. They 
came into wide contact and concluded a set of agreements, 
contracts, and letters of intent with economic, trade, and 
business circles in the four countries, scoring even greater 
successes than had been anticipated. An important achievement 
in this respect is the understanding reached between Chinese and 
Kazakh railways and communications departments on improving and 
strengthening international railway through transportation to 
better solve current problems in railway transit transportation. 
During the latter half of this year, we will invite the 
railways and communications ministers of Russia and various 
Central Asian countries to a meeting in Beijing to further 
discuss this issue so as to make full use of the new "Silk Road." 
  In response to a question about China's so-called 
"intention to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet Union's 
disintegration," Li Peng said: "First of all, I would like to 
state my views on the issue. The newly independent countries 
born of the Soviet Union's disintegration are all sovereign 
states; there is no question of so-called `vacuum.' However, I 
would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China 
seeks no sphere of influence, politically or economically. 
China has many matters to attend to at home and has no interest 
in filling or intention to fill the so-called `vacuum.' My 
present visit is meant to develop the friendship between China 
and various Central Asian countries, and is not directed against 
any other country." 
  On the Sino-Kazakh border trade issue, Li Peng said: It is 
true that a considerable number of Chinese merchants do business 
in Kazakhstan, with self-employed traders constituting the 
largest number. Generally speaking, they have played a certain 
role in promoting border trade between the two countries. A 
small number of them, however, have colluded with some local 
people in carrying out profiteering activities by selling fake 
and shoddy products. The Chinese Government opposes such 
actions. 
  Li Peng emphasized: We are ready to work with the Kazakh 
Government to draw up relevant laws, regulations, and measures 
to stem this unhealthy tendency and to reduce the negative 
effect on bilateral trade. He noted that trade companies in the 
two countries, especially those with good reputations and vast 
resources, should form the main channel of trade between the two 
countries. 
  In response to a question by a Russian reporter about 
Sino-Russian relations, Li Peng said: "The development of 
Sino-Russian relations following the Soviet Union's 
disintegration has been normal. Rather than being weakened, 
bilateral economic relations and trade have surpassed the level 
during the era of the former Soviet Union. President Yeltsin 
visited China in 1992, and the leaders of the two countries will 
exchange high-level visits this year." He added: "Russia is a 
great nation endowed with abundant resources, vast territory, 
and diligent and intelligent people. I believe that the Russian 
people can surely overcome the temporary difficulties they are 
now encountering so long as they rely on themselves." 
  Asked about China's attitude toward a complete nuclear test 
ban, Li Peng pointed out: Although China is a nuclear country, 
the quantity of its nuclear weapons is insignificant compared to 
those of other nuclear countries. Among the nuclear countries, 
China was the first to propose not to use nuclear weapons first 
and not to threaten nonnuclear countries with nuclear weapons. 
The Chinese Government has always stood for complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and for 
realizing a complete nuclear test ban within this context. For 
this reason, the Chinese Government holds that reaching a treaty 
on a complete nuclear test ban through negotiations is of 
positive significance. China has stated clearly that it will 
work toward concluding such a treaty in 1996. He said: At the 
moment, China is actively participating in the negotiations 
being held in Geneva regarding such a treaty. 
  Asked by a Kazakh reporter on how China, a multinational 
country, handles nationalities issues and maintains national 
stability, Li Peng said: China's Constitution provides for 
equality for all nationalities. We also have a law on autonomy 
for minority regions. Minority nationalities enjoy political 
rights equal to those of the Han nationality. Areas where 
several minority nationalities live in compact communities are 
experiencing economic development with each passing day, and the 
living standards and cultural levels of their people are 
improving continuously. It can be said that the relations among 
our nationalities are marked by great concord and harmony [shi 
fen he mu he rong qia di 0577 0433 0735 4207 0735 5816 3174 
4104]. 
  Premier Li Peng asked Ismail Amat, state councilor and 
concurrently minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission who was accompanying him on his trip, to give 
a detailed account of China's nationalities policy. 
  Asked about his talks with President Nazarbayev by a 
reporter, Li Peng said: "Despite my short stay here, we held 
several rounds of talks during which we reached many common 
understandings on bilateral relations and international issues. 
We both agreed that all countries should independently choose 
their own development courses and set their own foreign 
policies, and should not allow other countries to interfere. 
Both sides attach great importance to creating a good 
environment for their national economic construction and oppose 
national splittism. During the talks, Nazarbayev said that he 
upholds the One-China stand and regards Taiwan and Tibet as 
inalienable parts of Chinese territory. Nazarbayev also 
explicitly stated that the Kazakh Government will not allow 
elements of so-called "East Turkstan" to carry out activities 
against China in Kazakhstan, and that it opposes pan-Turkism. 
Nazarbayev briefed me on some of his propositions on Asian 
security. I told him that the Chinese side understands and 
appreciates his efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Japan's socialists quit 
the ruling coalition on Tuesday [26 April], NHK Public

  The socialists' move is plunging Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's government into crisis just hours after they helped to 
elect him. 
  Hata is expected to form his new cabinet on Monday after

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The decision by the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) to quit the ruling coalition has 
caused an impasse in the formation of a new Japanese cabinet 
headed by newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The SDP's decision is an angry reaction to the abrupt 
establishment of a parliamentary group that excludes the 
socialists. 
  In a statement issued after a meeting early today, SDP 
Chairman Toriichi Murayamua said that the formation of such a 
group infringed upon the relationship of trust among the 
coalition parties. 
  The 130-member parliamentary alliance named "Kaishin" 
(Renovation) includes the Shinseito Party, the Japan New Party, 
the Democratic Socialist Party, the Jiyuto (Liberals) and 
Kaikaku No Kai. 
  This new group will be the largest force in the coalition 
and 
will have more members than the SDP. 
  Hata earlier today invited the SDP to remain in the 
coalition, while defending the formation of the parliamentary 
group. 
  "Unless we have such a group, coalition parties will not be 
able to cope with the difficult problems and act in solidarity," 
Hata said. 
  Several meetings were being held this morning to discuss the 
situation after the SDP announced it was quitting the coalition. 
  Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday 
afternoon has been postponed because of the delay in forming a 
new government. 
  A large-scale reshuffling of the cabinet now seems 
unavoidable since the SDP held six cabinet posts in former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Japan's newly elected 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata today called for talks with the 
breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP) in a bid to draw it back 
to the ruling coalition fold. 
  Hata, while appealing to SDP to remain within the coalition, 
warned that he will form a new cabinet even without the SDP, the 
biggest party in the alliance. 
  He had this to say, "we cannot spend so much time" on this 
matter. 
  SDP quit the coalition earlier today, in a move that 
deprived 
the coalition of its parliamentary majority, leaving the new 
prime minister crippled at the start of his administration and 
the country facing the prospect of possible early elections. 
  The SDP decision of pullout was approved formally at an 
emergency meeting of the party's central executive committee. 
  At the meeting SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attacked the 
sudden formation last night of a new parliamentary bloc grouping 
the coalition's centrist and conservative parties but excluding 
the SDP, saying it destroyed the coalition structure. 
  The SDP holds 74 seats in the 511-member lower house. Beside 
the 130 lawmakers already committed to the new bloc, the 
centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party) is reportedly ready to 
bring in its 52 members as well. 
  Against this, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
holds 206 seats.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Newly-elected Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata was sworn in by Emperor Akihito today, 
formally taking over as Japan's 51st prime minister. 
  Hata, elected by parliament on Monday, has failed to reach 
agreement among coalition party leaders on a new cabinet and 
appeared set to form the first minority administration in four 
decades. 
  Hata will make a last-ditch effort later in the day to 
persuade the socialists to return to the ruling coalition. 
  The Social Democratic Party (the socialists), the biggest 
partner in the eight-month-old coalition, walked out on Tuesday 
[26 April] in an angry reaction to the establishment of a rival 
parliamentary bloc grouping five coalition parties but excluding 
the socialists within just hours of Hata's election. 
  The socialists' move wold deprive Hata of his parliamentary 
majority and raise prospects of a period of weak minority rule 
followed by forced early elections. 
  Hata took over from Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned abruptly 
on April 8 after just eight months in office over his dubious 
personal finances and a Diet (parliament) stalemate.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Japan's new Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata launched his cabinet today to rule with a 
minority coalition government, the first of its kind in nearly 
four decades. 
  The inauguration of the Hata administration came after 
Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama rejected 
Hata's last-minute call for SDP to return to the nine-month-old 
coalition. 
  The largest political force in the alliance led by former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, SDP on Tuesday announced its 
withdrawal from the ruling bloc to protest the formation of a 
130-strong parliamentary group called Kaishin (Renovation) that 
excludes the Social Democrats. 
  The Hata coalition now has only 182 seats in the decisive 
511- member House of Representatives, far short of a majority 
of 256. 
  Earlier today, Emperor Akihito appointed Hata, leader of the 
coalition's key party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), as 
Japan's 51st premier in a morning ceremony at the Imperial 
Palace. 
  The appointment had been delayed by the political unrest 
sparked by Kaishin's establishment on Monday and the subsequent 
SDP defection from the coalition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has invited inspectors from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to observe the 
replacement of fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor, a DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said today. 
  The spokesman told reporters that the DPRK would fully 
guarantee access for the inspectors and turn over the replaced 
fuel rods to the IAEA for examination to ensure the continuity 
of nuclear safety. 
  The spokesman also said he hopes the United States and the 
IAEA would respect DPRK's status regarding the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and adopt just standpoints and attitudes. 
  He added if the United States and the IAEA impose the 
further 
inspections,the situation will become more complicated. 
  The IAEA has said it will observe the replacement of fuel 
rods during this "additional inspection", reports said.

Election Process"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg, April 22 (XINHUA) -- With the 
announcement of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) participation in 
next week's non-racial election in South Africa, it is expected 
the poll will proceed in an atmosphere of goodwill and 
reconciliation. 
  The April 26-28 election is historically important to South 
Africa as it is the result of the 300-year struggle of the South 
African people, the blacks in particular. 
  Since the Dutch invaded the South African continent in 1652, 
the black people have gradually become the slaves of the white 
settlers. 
  Before the implementation of the 1993 interim constitution, 
South Africa was the only country in the world which had 
legalized the apartheid system. 
  The current election in South Africa symbolizes the end of 
the inhuman apartheid system in the human history. 
  On April 19, or one week before the election, the Inkatha 
Freedom Party -- the second biggest black party in South Africa 
-- announced its participation in the election. 
  The South African press described the IFP's participation in 
the election as "a miracle." 
  In reality, this is a natural result for the IFP after an 
international mediation failed in the previous week. 
  If the IFP does not want to be a guerilla movement in a new 
South Africa after the election, it has no other choice but to 
participate in the election. 
  The IFP stands for a federal or confederate state in a 
future 
South Africa. It asked the international mediation over the 
constitutional dispute between the IFP and its rival, the 
African National Congress (ANC), so that the 1993 interim 
constitution is amended and the election postponed. 
  The IFP can only become an opposition party if it does not 
participate in the election after the failure of the 
itnernational mediation. 
  IFP's decision to participate in the election has greatly 
changed the political situation in South Africa. 
  The three major political players in South Africa, namely 
the 
ruling National Party, the ANC and the IFP, will all participate 
in the election. They are expected to obtain 85 percent votes 
of all the voters in the country. 
  On April 19, South African President F.W. de Klerk, ANC 
president Nelson Mandela and IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
signed an agreement and a joint statement in Pretoria. 
  The agreement said the three parties reject violence and are 
committed to realize reconciliation and peace in South Africa. 
  The joint statement appealed to the South African people to 
end violence, exercise maximum restraint and pursue their 
objectives by peaceful means. 
  The agreement and the joint statement will create 
circumstances conducive to the holding of a free, fair and 
peaceful election in South Africa. 
  Buthelezi said his party will accept the election result so 
long as the international community regards it free and fair. 
  After the IFP decision was declared, many Zulu people 
expressed their ardent wish to participate in the election. 
  Buthelezi was given a hero's welcome and support when he 
returned to Ulundi, capital of the Kwazulu homeland, on April 19 
after the signing of the agreement and the joint statement. 
  Definitely, violence will greatly be reduced as the root 
cause of the political conflicts between the IFP and the ANC 
have been removed. 
  An amendment on the 1993 interim constitution was tabled in 
the parliament on April 21. 
  The bill will be debated and approved at a special session 
of 
the parliament on April 25. 
  The bill makes provisions for the institution, role, 
authority and status of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. 
  This is the result of a reconciliation among the ruling 
national party, the ANC and the IFP. 
  Where will the seven million Zulu people go? it is important 
to the result of the April 26-28 election.

  [Text] Johannesburg, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The first 
non-racial election in South Africa began today, ending 350 
years of the apartheid rule in the country. 
  The historic elections are recognized by the international 
community as a momentous event and the completion of the 
transition from apartheid to democracy. The elections are the 
final repudiation of institutionalized racism in the world. 
  About 22.71 million South African voters will elect a 
400-seat national assembly and provincial legislatures during 
the three days of elections. 
  An estimated 16.2 million members of the Black community, or 
72 percent of the total number of voters in South Africa, will 
be voting for the first time in their life, marking the end of 
342 years of the White domination. 
  Twenty-seven parties, including the African National 
Congress 
(ANC), the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, are 
contesting the elections, with another eight at regional level. 
  Today is the first day of the elections, or special voting 
day. Voters who are physically disabled, pregnant, infirm, aged, 
and ill, and members of the defense force, police force and 
national peace-keeping force, are voting today at about 800 
special polling stations, both fixed and mobile, across the 
country. 
  Hospitals, homes and care centers catering for more than 200 
patients are fixed voting stations while those with less than 
200 patients are being visited by a mobile station which will 
remain at the institution until all those who wish to vote have 
voted. 
  Most of the South African voters will cast their ballots on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
  On Wednesday and Thursday, 9,000 polling stations throughout 
the country will be opened at 07:00 (0500 GMT) on Friday at 
between 800 and 1,000 counting centers around the country. 
  Initial election results are expected to be released 48 
hours 
after the elections and final results may be announced by the 
independent electoral commission on May 1 or May 2. 
  The ANC, which enjoys high reputation for its anti-apartheid 
struggle during the past decades, is likely to win a sweeping 
victory in the elections.
