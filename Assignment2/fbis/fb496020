  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--A 10-member Republic of 
China [ROC] delegation, led by Vice Finance Minister Li 
Chung-ying, is leaving for France Friday [29 April] to attend 
the 27th Asian Development Bank (ADB) annual meeting. 
  Some 54 ADB member countries are expected to attend the May 
3-5 meeting in Nice. An annual report will be released at the 
meeting and participants will discuss economic prospects in 
Asia, common problems Asian countries are facing, and problems 
funding infrastructure development in Southeast Asia. 
  During the meeting, Li will report on Taiwan's overseas 
investment and economic development as well as express the 
island's strong desire to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  Li said before departure that delegation members will also 
explain Taiwan's "southern strategy," which encourages 
investment in Southeast Asia, as well as Taiwan's financial 
situation. 
  In addition, Taiwan delegation members will attend a meeting 
of the procedures committee. This will be the first time since 
1970 that the ROC, a founding member of the ADB, has been 
allowed into the 12-member committee. 
  During the meeting, Li will protest the ADB's unilateral 
decision to change the ROC's designation at the international 
banking institute to "Taipei, China." 
  The ADB changed the ROC's representative name after Beijing 
joined the group in 1986. Taipei refused to take part in any 
ADB activities in protest of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 
1987. Participation resumed in 1988. 
  The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei May 8.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists dared [kamhaeng] to conduct a 
series of aerial espionages on the northern half of the 
republic. According to military sources, an RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane, which flew to the sky above South Korea 
from the U.S. imperialists' overseas base on 28 March, made a 
sortie to the sky above the areas near the Military Demarcation 
Line [MDL] and ran wild in taking aerial photographs and 
electronic reconnaissance on the strategic centers [chollyakchok 
chungsimjidaedul] of the northern half of the republic while 
making repeated shuttle flights between east and west. The 
strategic reconnaissance plane has conducted aerial espionage 
more than 10 times since the beginning of March. 
  Meanwhile, from around 1700 [0800 GMT] to 2400 [1500 GMT] on 
29 March, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane 
made night flights in the skies above the areas adjacent to 
Oeyon Islet, Yangpyong, and Yangyang and ran amok in aerial 
reconnaissance on the entire area of the northern half of the 
republic. 
  On 9 and 15 March, three of the high-altitude strategic 
reconnaissance planes made 24-hour alternate flights around the 
sky above the areas near the MDL and were frenzied with aerial 
espionage. 
  Aerial espionage by the U.S. imperialists has been 
intensified concurrently with their full-scale military 
confrontation commotion [chonmyon kunsajok taekyol sodong] 
against us since 21 March, the date on which the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks had been scheduled. 
  On 24 March, the U.S. imperialists dared to conduct aerial 
espionage on the northern half of the Republic by deploying five 
RC-12's, four RV-1 Army tactical reconnaissance planes, two U-2 
high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, and two EH-60 
electronic-warfare helicopters day and night in the sky above 
South Korea. On 26 March, they also ran amok in aerial 
espionage on our side by flying seven RC-12 Army tactical 
reconnaissance planes in the sky above the areas near the MDL. 
  The frequency of such aerial espionage on the northern half 
of the republic by the U.S. imperialists during the period from 
21 to 30 March totaled over 90 times. The total frequency in 
March amounted to 234 times, 40 more than that of February. 
  Various facts clearly show how the U.S. imperialist are 
running wild with blood-shot eyes in the preparatory maneuvers 
for a war of aggression against the northern half of the 
republic.

<F P=106> ["Grave Provocations Driving Situation to Brink of War" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- If the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique dared ignite a 
war against us, our people and People's Army would deal a 
thousand-fold retaliatory blow at them, declares NODONG SINMUN 
in a by-lined article today. 
  The situation of the Korean peninsula is now being brought 
to 
the brink of war by the new war provocation moves committed by 
the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique to 
stifle our Republic, the article says, and goes on: 
  The U.S. imperialists have brought the nuclear-powered 
carrier Carl Vinson near the Korean peninsula and deployed a 
naval fleet of 30 warships including two carrier task forces on 
the waters within a reach of 24 hours from the Korean coast for 
the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. 
  Meanwhile, a Patriot missile battalion involving 40 odd 
missile launching pads and over 800 troops left Texas for South 
Korea on the order of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Availing itself of this situation, the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique has become all the more undisguised in its criminal war 
moves against the North. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group ordered all the puppet forces on to 
"a 
special alert" to keep them "prepared to attack the North," 
crying for "a tough reaction" against the North and "full 
preparations to invade the North through a cooperative system" 
with the United States. The puppets went so far as to make 
public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan 
No. 5027." 
  The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
have 
staged very provocative and dangerous war gambles which might 
develop to a real war any time on the ground and in the air and 
the sea almost every day. 
  The danger of war on the Korean peninsula is imminent and 
real. 
  The U.S. imperialists intend to keep hold on South Korea 
indefinitely as their colony and, with it as the bridgehead, 
dominate the North of Korea and the rest of Asia. Intolerable 
are the crimes of the U.S. imperialists, who are trying to turn 
the Korean peninsula into the theatre of a thermonuclear war for 
their aggressive goal and of the Kim Yong-sam group, which is 
acting the shock brigade in executing their policy of aggression 
and war, courting their favor. 
  Our people and People's Army do not want a war. But they are 
not afraid of it.

  [Text] In connection with the fact that the South Korean 
authorities' obstruction maneuvers have blocked [chadan] former 
presidents and premiers and high-ranking politicians of various 
countries of the world from visiting Pyongyang through 
Panmunjom, a spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of 
the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], on 30 March, issued 
the following press statement [tamhwa]: 
  Press statement by a spokesman for the Reunification Policy 
Committee of the DPRK SPA: 
  At a time when numerous envoys of friendship from the five 
continents of the world are continuously visiting our country 
with the festive day of April [Kim Il-song birthday] on the 
horizon, former presidents and premiers and high-ranking 
politicians of various countries of the world who had attended 
the Second World Peace Conference expressed their hope to us a 
while ago that they would visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom. 
They were approximately 100 distinguished political activists 
from various continents of the world: They include 
approximately 30 former heads of state or government of various 
countries, including former Costa Rican Presidents Rodrigo 
Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman 
Sowar el Dahab, former Sudanese Premier El Katim el Kalifa, 
former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese 
President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor General 
Edward Schreyer. They also include current and former 
high-ranking politicians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, 
Thailand, and other Asian countries; Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and 
other Middle East countries; France, Spain, Norway, and other 
European countries; and Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Latin 
American countries. They also include high-ranking politicians 
from the United States. 
  This large high-level foreign peace delegation expressed its 
intention to visit Pyongyang, know better the reality of our 
country, and extend their support to and solidarity with our 
people's efforts for peace in the country and its reunification. 
We made preparations to receive them as envoys of peace and 
friendship and had our side's area of Panmunjom opened. We did 
so because we treasure peace on the Korean peninsula and its 
peaceful reunification and welcome the intention of the former 
presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking politicians 
from various countries and their activities for peace in the 
world. 
  However, the foreign delegation's visit to Pyongyang through 
Panmunjom could not take place because of the South Korean 
authorities' obstruction. 
  At the 28 March Panmunjom contact of joint duty officers 
[jigilgwan] of the Military Armistice Commission, the opposing 
side [taebang] said that the foreign delegation's plan to visit 
Pyongyang through Panmunjom had been canceled. 
  At a news conference that was held in Seoul prior to this, 
the foreign delegation announced that they could not visit 
Pyongyang because the South side did not approve of the visit 
and expressed its dismay and regret for this. They also told us 
that they were very thankful for the DPRK for inviting them to 
visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom and extending kind hospitality 
to them and that there would surely come an opportunity for them 
to pay such visits. 
  We cannot but think that it is regrettable that the large 
high-level foreign delegation for peace in the world could not 
visit Pyongyang. 
  The South Korean authorities prevented the foreign 
delegation 
from visiting Pyongyang by blocking [pongswae] the South side's 
area of Panmunjom. This is an uncourteous act lacking 
international courtesy or morality [kukchejok yeuido todokto 
morunun muryehan haengwi]. 
  The South Korean authorities prevented the approximately 100 
former presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking 
politicians from visiting Pyongyang. This cannot be construed 
otherwise than an act of restraining the intention of the 
foreign delegation and its activities for peace in the world. 
  The just activities for independence, peace, and friendship 
by the dignitaries of the world must be respected as a matter of 
course. 
  They blocked the world peace delegation, not the dissidents 
[pancheje insa] who are restricted [kyujedoen] under South 
Korea's National Security Law, from even passing through 
Panmunjom under an unjustifiable pretext. This shows the 
National Security Law is fully applied [kudaero chogyongdoego] 
to foreign envoys, as well. 
  What cannot be overlooked with regard to the South Korean 
authorities' recent act is an act of wrongfully misusing 
[kuruttoege agyong] the visit to Pyongyang by the foreign 
delegation in North-South confrontation. As has already been 
known, the South Korean authorities unilaterally broke up 
[kyollyol] the contact of working-level delegates for the 
exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South, 
froze all North-South dialogue, and are bringing the situation 
to the brink of war. 
  The South Korean authorities had kicked up large-scale 
commotions with regard to southward aggression [namchimsodongul 
taedaejoguro irukyo], thus making people uneasy; made public a 
plan on a war of northward aggression called New Operation Plan 
5027; and openly cried for achieving reunification after 
prevailing over communism. They more loudly babbled [ttodurotta] 
about this [achieving reunification after prevailing over 
communism] when foreign delegations' visits to Pyongyang resumed. 
  As was shown, they created an extreme crisis in the 
situation 
[kuktanhan chongsejok wigi] in the face of the foreign envoys 
and asked them to cancel their plans to pass through Panmunjom 
and visit Pyongyang under the pretext of such a crisis. This is 
a disgusting, mean act [hyomogamul chaanaenun]. 
  With regard to this, voices of denunciation are raised 
among media at home and abroad, including an English-language 
paper, THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL. Reporting that the South 
Korean authorities are at a loss because the issue of the large 
foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang was raised 
[namchoson tanggukchaduli taekyumoui oeguk pyonghwa sajoltanui 
pyongyang pangmun munjega chegidoende taehayo maeu tanghokhae 
hagoittago hamyonso]. The papers wrote that South Korea's 
national unification minister hastily canceled its permission 
for the international delegations' visit to Pyongyang, changing 
its former stance. 
  The papers exposed that the national unification minister's 
negative stance created an obstacle to the plan by the 
delegation--which is made up of former heads of state, 
politicians, and policymakers--to visit Pyongyang by crossing 
the Military Demarcation Line. 
  It is a matter of course that the world's fair media will 
protest the South Korean authorities' rude acts of blocking the 
foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang as disregarding 
basic international manners. 
  The South Korean authorities blocked the foreign peace 
delegation's visit to Pyongyang for another reason: They were 
afraid that the quite different realities of the North and the 
South would be known to the world public. 
  If the delegation had visited Pyongyang, it would have 
clearly seen that, under Korean-style socialism centered on the 
popular masses where the leader, the party, and the masses are 
single-heartedly united, all the people are leading an 
independent and creative happy life with no worries about food, 
clothing, and housing; are stepping up peaceful economic 
construction not preparations for a war; and are aspiring for a 
reunified Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers 
advertise. 
  Contrary to this, South Korea's various kinds of rotten, 
ailing social evils that prevail under the present civilian 
rule, which stakes its fate on outside forces, will be 
strikingly revealed in contrast to the North. 
  If one sees the true faces of South Korea, where a 
powder-reeking war fever is all the more instigated, and our 
republic, where peaceful construction is pushed ahead 
everywhere, he will clearly know who truly wants peace and 
reunification, and who pursues war and national division. This 
is what the South Korean authorities are afraid of. 
  The third party will clearly see that South Korea is the one 
that is a secluded society, which the South Korean authorities 
babble about, and that the South Korean authorities are the ones 
who attempt to perpetuate the national division by erecting an 
immense concrete wall across the entire area of the Military 
Demarcation Line that extends approximately 240 km. 
  Truth and lies are bound to be revealed. As one cannot hide 
sunshine with hands, the South Korean authorities can never 
cover our republic's external status, which is winning victory 
after victory, by blocking the international delegation's visit 
to the North. 
  The South Korean authorities should no longer commit rude 
acts of damaging the nation's prestige, which is known as a 
country of courteous people in the East, running against the 
aspiration of the fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving 
people. 
  We will always keep the door open for the foreign delegation 
who, with a good intention, wish to visit Pyongyang to do good 
things for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. 
  [Signed] Spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of 
the DPRK SPA 
  [Dated] 30 March, Pyongyang

  [Text] The puppet prime minister showed up at the "Seoul 
City Police Office" on March 27 and ordered it to "maintain a 
perfect public peace and alert posture", according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  On March 26, while making a round of frontline units of the 
puppet Army, he incited war fever for a northward invasion, 
crying for a flawless "posture for countermove". 
  Facts that have been revealed show that the South Korean 
puppets are getting more frenzied with the passage of time in 
driving North-South relations to a phase of confrontation and 
war [taekyolgwa chonjaeng kungmyon].

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front [Hanminjon] 
published a white paper headlined "Heavy Water Reactor and 
Multipurpose Research Reactor Are for Nuclear Arms Development" 
on March 30, which says that the atomic reactors used for the 
development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not 
the experimental reactor of North Korea but the heavy water 
reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in 
Taedok, South Korea. 
  The white paper notes: 
  The Wolsong heavy water reactor is a plutonium-producing 
reactor introduced for nuke development. It is not a reactor 
for commercial use but one for the development of nuclear 
weapons in view of its structure. 
  The multipurpose research reactor now in operation in Taedok 
nuclear complex is advertized not to be related with nuke 
development, but it is one of the key reactors exclusively for 
nuclear development in South Korea. 
  Nevertheless, the International Atomic Energy Agency, making 
a noisy fuss about the experimental reactor of North Korea, has 
overlooked the heavy water reactor and multipurpose reactor of 
South Korea which are for military purpose and whose capacities 
are scores of times and several times that of North Korea. IAEA 
has not disclosed as yet the result of inspection of these 
nuclear facilities of South Korea. 
  The South Korean authorities must, first of all, give up the 
nuclear development policy and destroy the heavy water reactor 
and the multipurpose reactor that are used for the production of 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Rev. Kim Song-pok, 
chairman of the Independent Reunification Committee of the 
Inchon Federation for Democracy and Reunification of the 
Fatherland in South Korea, called for the repeal of the 
"National Security Law" (NSL) and the legalization of the 
National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon). 
  In an article contributed to HANGYORE SINMUN on March 16, he 
urged the puppet authorities to scrap the NSL, an 
anti-reunification evil law, and send back to the North old men 
Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who have been kept in prison in South 
Korea for refusing to be converted after they were arrested 
during the Korean war (June 25, 1950- July 27, 1953). 
  He also demanded that the authorities legalize the 
Pomminnyon, not branding it as an "organization benefitting the 
enemy", and guarantee the activation of the civilian 
reunification movement.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean 
Religionists Association (KRA) held an enlarged meeting here 
today calling on the South Korean religious organizations, 
clergymen and believers to take a resolute action for 
overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam regime of flunkeyist traitors for 
the reunification of the country in the 90s. 
  The meeting discussed measures concerning the refusal of the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to allow the joint celebration of the 
centenary of the Kabo (1894) Peasants War by Chondoists in the 
North and the South. It was attended by members of the KRA and 
officials of the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean 
Chondoists Association, the Central Committee of the Korean 
Buddhists Federation, the Central Committee of the Korean 
Christians Federation and the Central Committee of the Korean 
Roman Catholics Association. 
  A relevant resolution and a letter to the South Korean 
religious organizations, clergymen and believers were adopted at 
the meeting. 
  The letter said the Kim Yong-sam regime's anti-national acts 
in blocking all the contacts and travel between the North and 
the South and the joint commemoration by the North and the South 
of the centenary of the peasants war, an anti-feudal, 
anti-aggression mass struggle of the nation, could never be 
justified and tolerated. 
  It noted that if such an anti-national group as the Kim 
Yong-sam clique, which takes no account of the nation and 
ancestors, were left in the country, neither the peace of the 
Korean peninsula nor the independent and peaceful reunification 
of the country could be expected and there would be only a 
nuclear holocaust. 
  It called on the South Korean religious organizations, 
clergymen and believers who love the country and the nation and 
hope for national reunification to decisively break with the Kim 
Yong-sam regime and join in the struggle for the establishment 
of a genuine independent, democratic government.

<F P=106> ["Intelligence Surveillance of `Civilian Government'" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- It has been brought to 
light recently in South Korea that the rulers set up three watch 
posts around the house of former Chairman of the Democratic 
Party Kim Tae-chung in Seoul in 1979 to keep an eye on his every 
movement and have continued surveillance till today. 
  Papers here today say this act of the Kim Yong-sam group has 
proved that political surveillance over politicians is as 
vicious and persistent as under the military "regimes", though 
it claims a "civilian government" has been established in South 
Korea. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN notes: 
  It is a serious matter that the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
continues vicious political surveillance over civilians, though 
he committed himself to build "a society where human rights are 
respected" and "stop intelligence surveillance" when taking the 
"presidential" seat. 
  With the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and such notorious 
intelligence tools as the "Security Planning Board" and the 
"secret affairs command" left alone, the South Korean people 
cannot evade being targets of intelligence surveillance. 
  A MINJU CHOSON commentary stresses that if human rights and 
democracy are to be guaranteed and the people are to live in 
peace in South Korea, all the political charlatans like the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam who stirs up horror and uneasiness and 
resorts to terrorism and plots must be removed.

<F P=106> ["Japan Not Qualified To Be UNSC Permanent Member'--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Democratic 
Socialist Party, one of the seven ruling parties of Japan, 
Monday in its political platform for 1994 declared it would push 
for permanent membership in the UN Security Council (UNSC) as 
well as give its wholehearted support to UN operations, 
including peacekeeping activities, the KYODO News Service 
reported. 
  The Japanese authorities have revealed their intention to 
become a permanent member of the UN Security Council more than 
once. 
  It is an unbiased view of the international community that 
Japan has no justification and elementary qualification to seat 
itself at a responsible post of the United Nations. 
  It is ridiculous of Japan, a criminal state which provoked 
World War II, to seek UNSC permanent membership while having yet 
to atone for the unpardonable crimes and cleanse its dishonor as 
"enemy state" specified in the UN Charter. 
  Moreover, it is a reckless act for Japan to seek permanent 
membership while being criticised by unbiased public opinion for 
its grave threat to peace and security in Asia and its 
obstructions to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
through the promotion of its nuclear armament on the pretext of 
the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  In trying to gain a permanent seat in the UNSC, Japan 
pursues 
the purpose of increasing its political say in the international 
arena, act a "leading state" and establish a "world order" 
militarily favorable for it. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must discard the foolish 
daydream, 
liquidate its past first of all and immediately renounce their 
scheme to convert Japan into a military power and arm it with 
nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["Report at National Conference of Party Cell Secretaries"-- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam, secretary 
of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], 
delivered a report under the title "Let Us Make All Party Cells 
Militant Organisations Remaining Intensely Loyal to the Party 
and the Leader and Defending and Exalting the Cause of 
Socialism" at the national conference of party cell secretaries, 
which opened here today. 
  The report says: 
  The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il is a historic meeting, the first of its kind ever 
since the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. It will 
powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and unshakable 
will of the entire party cell secretaries and party members to 
remain loyal to the party and the leader and accomplish the 
cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation under the 
complex situation; it will also mark a radical turning point in 
further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and 
accelerating the general march of Korean-style socialism. 
  Through a long-drawn-out arduous yet glorious struggle, the 
WPK has been strengthened into a tested veteran party with great 
revolutionary exploits and rich experience and a powerful 
revolutionary party that can defend and carry to completion the 
revolutionary cause of chuche, the cause of socialism and 
communism, through storm and stress. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said in his letter of 
congratulations to the delegates to the current conference: 
  "The foundation of our party and its development are 
inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic 
party organization." 
  The party cells, the basic organisations of the party and 
militant units directly implementing the party's line and 
policy, have played a very important role in strengthening the 
WPK and victoriously advancing the Korean revolution. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the grassroots 
organisations of the party and expanded them before founding the 
wpk, a revolutionary party of chuche type, and strengthening it. 
  The work of strengthening the party cells as required by the 
party's chuche-based idea of its building has been promoted more 
dynamically in the gigantic undertaking to model the whole party 
and society on the chuche idea under the outstanding and tested 
guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  "On letting the party cell discharge its duty of effectively 
guiding the activities of the party members," "the party cell 
must properly organise party assignments and review them in 
time," "let us strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party 
members in ideology and purpose based on the revolutionary idea 
of the leader" and other works published by the dear leader in 
the early 1960s have served as a highly important guideline in 
improving the work of the party cells and the activities of the 
party members. 
  The dear leader declared the modelling of the whole society 
on the chuche idea the supreme programme of the WPK and laid 
down the policy of modelling the whole party on the chuche idea 
in the 1970s, and guided the party cells to effectively train 
the party members into ardent communist revolutionaries of 
chuche type who are intensely loyal to the party and the leader 
and uphold the leadership of the party centre with loyalty, to 
meet the new requirement of the development of the party and the 
revolution. 
  The national short course for party cell secretaries held in 
may 1991 marked a significant milestone in strengthening the 
party cells. 
  Over the last three years, all the party cells and their 
secretaries have worked hard to make their cells unfailingly 
loyal to the party and the leader in hearty response to "let us 
strengthen the party cells," the historic letter sent by the 
dear leader to the participants in the short course. 
  The members of tens of thousands of party cells sent letters 
to the dear leader, pledging to follow the party wholeheartedly 
and remain loyal to the revolutionary cause of chuche to the 
last, and are carrying their pledge into practice. 
  The party cells have made vigorous efforts to implement the 
party's military line of self-reliant defence to the letter, 
greatly contributing to the increase of defence capabilities of 
the country to smash any formidable enemy at one blow. 
  They are devotedly working to consolidate the singlehearted 
unity of the leader, the party and the masses, the source of the 
invincible might of our socialism. 
  All the party members and people, closely rallied behind the 
party and the leader in one mind and purpose, breathe the breath 
of the party's idea and will, speak the way the party does, and 
march as one at the command of the party. 
  The WPK has been strengthened into an ever-victorious 
revolutionary party deeply rooted among the broad masses and the 
party and people have won victory after victory in the political 
and military confrontation with the enemy hell- bent on stifling 
the cause of socialism. Lurking behind this are the devoted 
efforts and hidden feats of all the party cell secretaries. 
  Hundreds of thousands of party cells secretaries who are 
intensely loyal to the party and the leader and devote 
everything to the country and the people are valuable beings of 
our party and revolution. Our party and people are highly proud 
of having these excellent party cell secretaries. 
  The reporter elaborated on the tasks for a vigorous march 
toward the final victory of the revolutionary cause of chuche, 
the cause of socialism, saying: 
  If all the party cells are to become militant organisations 
remaining intensely loyal to the party and the leader and 
defending and exalting the cause of socialism, they must 
thoroughly fulfill the five major tasks of party cells advanced 
by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his letter of 
congratulations to the delegates to the current conference as 
well as the highly important tasks set forth by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic letter to the participants 
in the national short course for party cell secretaries in May 
1991 "let us strengthen the party cells." 
  All the party cells must continue to maintain it as the 
keypoint of its work to establish the system of the unitary 
leadership of the party, and wholeheartedly uphold the party's 
leadership with loyalty and filial piety, cherishing deep in 
mind the high pride and honour of having the dear leader as the 
centre of unity, the centre of leadership and the supreme 
commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  The party cells must establish a revolutionary habit of 
unconditionally accepting and fully implementing the 
instructions of the great leader and the dear leader and the 
party's line and policy, their embodiment, and train all the 
party members to be iron walls and rifles and bombs to 
resolutely defend the party and the leader politically, 
ideologically and with their lives under whatever condition and 
circumstance. 
  The party cells and their secretaries must educate all the 
party members and other working people to maintain high 
revolutionary vigilance against the war provocation moves of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and make 
full preparations to firmly defend the socialist motherland and 
the gains of the revolution under any unexpected circumstance.

<F P=106> ["President Kim Il-song Sends Letter to Delegates to </F>
National Conference of Party Cell Secretaries"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of the Central Committee 
of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter of congratulations 
today to the delegates to the national conference of party cell 
secretaries. 
  President Kim Il-song in the letter said the conference 
would 
mark an important milestone in strengthening and developing our 
party into an unconquerable party and fortifying the bulwark of 
socialism in our country, by enhancing the function and role of 
the party cells. 
  He further said: 
  Our party is a glorious party which has grown up from deep 
historical roots. It is a revolutionary party of chuche which, 
guided by the chuche idea, struggles for the popular masses' 
cause of independence. 
  The foundation of our party and its development are 
inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic 
party organization. In view of the cell's very important place 
and role in party building and party activities, we have 
consistently paid a close attention to strengthening party cells 
and other grassroots organizations ever since the days when its 
foundation was prepared. 
  In accordance with the policy adopted at the historic Kalun 
meeting in 1930, we conducted the work of founding the party by 
forming the basic organizations first and then increasing and 
strengthening them. Since its foundation, our party expanded 
its ranks by recruiting advanced elements from among workers, 
peasants, intellectuals and other working people, and organized 
its cells in factories, enterprises, farm villages and in all 
other places where there were its members and the masses, and 
strengthened the militant function of its cells to meet the 
actual requirements at each stage of the revolution. Through 
the strengthening of the cells and the enhancement of their 
function and role, our party grew into an invincible party which 
achieved the unity and cohesion of its ranks on the basis of the 
chuche idea and became a harmonious whole with the popular 
masses. 
  In the period when the historic task of modelling the whole 
society on the chuche idea came to the fore, our party put great 
efforts into the work of cementing its cells to meet the 
requirements of a new, higher stage of the revolution. After 
the training course held at the proposal of the Central 
Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries from all 
parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was launched 
to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party under the 
slogan, "Let us make all the party cells loyal cells ", and 
their militant function and role have been enhanced as never 
before. 
  Today, the party cells are performing their noble mission 
and 
duties with credit in further developing the party into a 
revolutionary party of chuche and carrying on and promoting the 
chuche revolutionary cause. 
  The brilliant successes in our party building and in the 
development of our revolution are associated with the silent 
efforts and exploits of the party cell secretaries. With a high 
sense of pride and revolutionary awareness that they are the 
junior political workers of the glorious Workers' Party of 
Korea, the cell secretaries have devoted their all to the 
struggle for the party and the revolution, wishing for neither 
honour nor reward. 
  The most important revolutionary task now facing our party 
and our people is to safeguard and defend the people-centred 
socialism of our own style from the challenge of the 
imperialists and reactionaries and develop it further. 
  The socialism which has been established in our country by 
implementing the chuche idea under our party's leadership is a 
genuine socialism which accords with the people's aspirations to 
independence. Whether or not we defeat the enemy's manoeuvres, 
and defend the socialist cause of chuche and accomplish it 
depends on how we strengthen the party, the general staff of the 
revolution, and how we enhance its leadership role. 
  Party cells are the cornerstones of our party as well as the 
revolutionary posts which guard our socialism. They are the 
base for training party members into revolutionaries and 
assimilating them to the working class, the base for linking 
party members with its Central Committee and establishing 
unbreakable ties between the party and the masses, and the base 
for mobilizing its membership and other working people for the 
implementation of the party's lines and policies. 
  Strengthening party cells is precisely an important 
guarantee 
for increasing the motive force of our party and our revolution 
and firmly defending and developing our socialism. 
  All the party cell secretaries must, with a high sense of 
responsibility and honour, train their cells to be unfailingly 
loyal to the party, to be militant cells which powerfully 
organize the masses for the struggle to defend and develop the 
cause of socialism. 
  The party cells must, above all else, loyally support the 
unified leadership of the party Central Committee. 
  Ensuring the unity of leadership in the party is the 
fundamental principle of party activity. Loyally supporting the 
undivided leadership of the party Central Committee is the 
lifeblood of the party cells. 
  Today the cause of our party, the chuche revolutionary 
cause, 
is honourably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as 
the people's leader. Our party has successfully solved the 
question of ensuring the continuity of leadership to meet the 
requirement of revolutionary development and the desire of the 
popular masses. This is the success in which our party can take 
the greatest pride in its development; this firmly guarantees a 
bright future and a brilliant victory of our party and our 
revolution. 
  All the party cells must keep the main line of effort to 
establish the monolithic system of party leadership. The cells 
must accept the party's lines and policies, its decisions and 
instructions unconditionally and carry them out; they must 
educate and lead the party members and other working people to 
be unfailingly loyal to party leadership. 
  Party cells must be efficient in organizing and guiding 
the party life of its members. 
  The party cells must intensify organizational and 
ideological 
life of the party members to train all of them into staunch 
revolutionaries who are unfailingly loyal to the party and the 
revolution and can unyieldingly fight for the victory of the 
socialist cause in any adversity. 
  The party cells must improve work among the masses and unite 
broad sections of them firmly behind the party. 
  The party cells must efficiently work among the masses to 
give revolutionary education to broad sections of them and rally 
them closely behind the party Central Committee and make an 
active contribution to strengthening the single-hearted unity of 
the whole society. 
  Party cells must push ahead with the ideological, technical 
and cultural revolutions to effect uninterrupted innovations and 
upsurge in socialist construction. 
  Regarding the ideological revolution as their first and 
foremost revolutionary task, party cells must intensify 
education in the chuche idea among the party members and working 
people. 
  We should bring them to cherish an unfailing loyalty to the 
party, staunch revolutionary spirit, unshakable faith in 
socialism, ardent patriotism and noble moral traits, and bring 
into fuller bloom in our society the beautiful communist 
morality of helping and leading each other forward and sharing 
weal and woe on the principle of one for all and all for one. 
  Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the 
cultural revolution so that all the party members and working 
people learn hard and strive to thoroughly improve their 
cultural and technical standards steadily and enjoy to their 
hearts' content the socialist cultural life, with rich emotional 
feelings and a high cultural attainment. 
  Party cells must strengthen organizational and political 
work 
to make sure that the party members and working people 
accelerate the technical revolution and make innovations in 
building the socialist economy. 
  For the present the party cells in all sectors of the 
national economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in 
building the socialist economy by organizing the party members 
and working people effectively for the implementation of the 
party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  Party cells must always pay deep attention to national 
defence. 
  We are striving to build socialism in sharp confrontation 
with the enemy. The imperialists and their lackeys are now 
daily intensifying military threats and provocations against our 
republic, the bulwark of socialism. 
  Party cells must see to it that the party members and 
working 
people sharpen their revolutionary vigilance against the enemy's 
manoeuvres of aggressive provocation, learn military affairs in 
real earnest, and make full preparations for defending the 
security of the country and the socialist gains reliably. Party 
cells must encourage the party members and working people to 
display fully the traditional traits of unity between the army 
and the people and ensure that the Army and the people, as one, 
defend the socialist motherland firmly. 
  First, to support the unified leadership of the party 
Central 
Committee with loyalty, second, to organize and guide party life 
effectively to train all the party members into the 
revolutionaries of chuche type, third, to do work with the 
masses efficiently to strengthen the blood-sealed ties between 
the party and the masses, fourth, to expedite the three 
revolutions in ideology, technology and culture to promote 
socialist construction, and fifth, to defend the security of the 
country and the socialist gains reliably--these are the five 
major tasks party cells must tackle at present. 
  All the party cell secretaries must adhere to these five 
tasks and carry them out to the letter.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 31 March editorial: "The Meeting of Party </F>
Cell Secretaries of the Entire Party Which Will Record a 
Brilliant Chapter in the History of Our Party"] 
  [Text] The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire 
party will be convened, beginning today, amid the great interest 
and expectation of all the people. Our party cell secretaries 
are our party's core elements who assume responsibility for the 
basic infrastructural organizations of our party and primary 
political functionaries who are directly organizing and leading 
the party life of party members. 
  Today, the combat capability of our party cells has 
increased; our party is demonstrating its dignity of being an 
ever-victorious and invincible party; and the singlehearted 
unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses are 
strengthening with each passing day. This is thanks to the 
unheralded efforts of party cell secretaries. 
  Today, all party members and the working people throughout 
the country sincerely rejoice over and extend warm 
congratulations to the fact that party cell secretaries of all 
various sectors--who have actively contributed to strengthening 
and developing our party and to accelerating the revolution and 
construction, cherishing infinite loyalty to the great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja], by enhancing the function and role of party 
cells--gather at one place to convene the historic meeting. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is 
a meeting which is held for the first time in the history of our 
party and is of great significance in strengthening and 
developing our party into an ever-victorious and invincible 
party and in consummating the socialist cause of chuche. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Party 
cells occupy a very important position in strengthening and 
developing the party and in vigorously advancing the revolution 
and construction. 
  The meeting will become a signicant meeting which marks a 
new 
turn in constantly strengthening and developing our party into 
an impregnable fortress and in enhancing by all means its combat 
capability and leadership ability. 
  Party cells are the cornerstones holding up the party and 
are 
the lowest level of combat units implementing the party's line 
and policy. A man becomes healthy only when the cells which 
form his body are strong and healthy. Likewise, only when party 
cells which form the party are sound and their function and role 
are high can the party become strong. Strengthening party cells 
becomes an important factor in strengthening the entire party. 
  Today, our party is taking pride in its existence as a party 
of impregnable fortress, which is unprecedented in history. This 
is because all party cells forming our party have been firmly 
built and their combat capabilities are strong. 
  In the glorious history of our party there has been no 
period 
in the past in which party cells grew up and strengthened and 
the party strengthened like today when the dear comrade leader's 
great party building ideology and theory are being thoroughly 
embodied. 
  Through the current meeting of party cell secretaries of the 
entire party the wisdom of leadership of the dear comrade leader 
who has always paid deep interest to enhancing party cells' 
combat function and role will be vigorously demonstrated and, at 
the same time, all party members and the working people will 
more firmly cherish in their hearts the firm faith that as long 
as the dear comrade leader is with them our party can take pride 
in its dignity of being an ever-victorious party forever. 
  With the current meeting as an occasion the struggle to 
enhance the function and role of party cells and the outstanding 
successes and experiences attained in the work with the masses 
of all strata will be generalized widely and the work to build 
all party cells into cells of loyalty will be more vigorously 
waged among party organizations at all levels. Thus, the current 
meeting will make a great contribution to further strengthening 
our party's might and to deepening all means the single-hearted 
unity of our revolutionary ranks. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party 
under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, is a 
historical meeting which is greatly significant in its struggle 
to resolutely advocate, adhere to, and complete, to the end, 
socialism of our own style which has been elucidated and 
obtained with blood. 
  Socialism of our own style, which our people chose 
themselves 
and built with their own strength by highly upholding the banner 
of the great chuche idea, is the most superior socialism in this 
world. As shown in countries where socialism was frustrated and 
capitalism reinstated, there can only be bitter pains, twists, 
and turns, and a wretched fate for the people who have lost 
socialism. 
  The road to defending and elucidating socialism lies in 
first, second, and third, strengthening the working-class 
party--the general staff of the revolution--and endlessly 
enhancing its leadership role. To achieve this, the party 
cell--the primary-level infrastructural organizations--must be 
strengthened. The party cell must be strong so that the party 
can be strong, and the party must be powerful so that socialism 
can vigorously advance in whatever hardships and without the 
slightest wavering. 
  How to thoroughly embody all lines and policies of the party 
to highly manifest the superiority and might of socialism and to 
change them into a great reality, are largely dependent on the 
role of the party cells who are the primary-level militant unit 
in implementing the party's policy. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is 
a meeting of faith and will that shows our party's firm 
determination to strengthen the party and all the more enhance 
the function and role of the party organizations to smash 
[chitbusigo] all kinds of antisocial and antirepublic maneuvers 
by the imperialists and reactionaries and complete socialism of 
our own style to the end. 
  As long as the imperialists and reactionaries drive the 
situation to a brink of war and viciously carry out the reckless 
provocative maneuver opposing our republic, our party cell 
secretaries will defend to the end, socialism of our own style 
through the might of single-hearted unity firmly united around 
the dear comrade leader. The voice of faith of our party cell 
secretaries will resound vigorously throughout the meeting. 
  At the meeting, our party's firm determination and will 
displayed on the road to advocate, adhere to, and elucidate 
socialism without the slightest wavering and the magnificent 
spiritual world of the members of the Workers' Party of Korea, 
who are endlessly loyal to socialism, will be manifest itself 
vigorously and the revolutionary struggle trait and way of life 
will dominate the whole party and society all the more. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party 
will become a meeting that has epoch-making significance in the 
struggle to bring about a new upsurge in socialist construction 
by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire 
party will enhance the role of the party organizations at all 
levels and party cells to vigorously call forth all the party 
members and workers in the struggle to implement the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy. 
  Through this meeting, the political work and work with the 
people will be carried out all the more vigorously at all 
working places of socialist construction where our party cells, 
party members, and workers are at work, and the justness and 
vitality of our party's method in which it firmly gives priority 
to ideology and revolution will manifest itself wholly. 
  Therefore, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude in all fields of socialist construction will manifest 
itself further, and an infinite number of new miracles and feats 
will be created. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party 
will be brilliantly recorded in our party's history as a meeting 
of loyalty and filial piety enabling the party members and 
working people to become true loyalists and dutiful children, a 
meeting of our party and people's belief and will to complete 
socialist cause to the end with single-hearted might, and a 
meeting of the grand march to effect a revolutionary upsurge in 
socialist construction. 
  The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is 
a proud meeting that could only be held in our country where the 
historic cause of building an ever-victorious iron party 
upholding the great leader [suryong] and the great leader 
[yongdoja] has been most brilliantly achieved. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has led 
the cause of the construction of our party straight to a single 
road of victory during the long period from his early days of 
revolution until today. During those days, he has consolidated 
brilliant and immortal achievements of the century. 
  In our country, the historic cause of grounding the party's 
historical root and founding the party was achieved by the great 
leader, and the endlessly rich and lofty chuche lineage of our 
party was also established by the great leader. 
  Our party, which was founded and fostered by the great 
leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, has been able to more vigorously 
demonstrate its dignity and might by upholding the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il at the fore. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja] of the working class of our time for 
achieving the cause of party construction. The dear comrade 
leader plainly set forth unique party construction ideology and 
theories for building an ever-victorious party and brilliantly 
solved all theoretical and practical problems rising from 
enhancing the function and role of the party cells. 
  Particularly, the dear comrade leader's immortal work "Let 
Us 
Strengthen the Party Cells" released on 10 May 1991 has great 
historical significance. Valuable guidelines have been provided 
for better fostering the party cells as a combat organization 
endlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] due to the 
release of the immortal work, which is a synthesis of the 
fundamental questions of bringing up the party members as 
loyalists and dutiful children, organizing and giving guidance 
concerning party life, carrying out work involving the masses 
well, and of enhancing the role of the party cell secretaries. 
  The ideological theory explained in the work is acquiring 
more vitality day after day due to its correctness and truth. 
Without the tested leadership of the dear comrade leader, who 
has always shown a great interest in strengthening and 
developing the party cells, we cannot talk about our party being 
strengthened and developed into a strong and mighty party 
consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells with strong combat 
capabilities, and we cannot imagine the party cell secretaries 
being loved and respected by the people while excellently 
fulfilling their roles as the core of our party. 
  That is why the participants of today's meeting of party 
cell 
secretaries of the entire party, and all the party members and 
working people are paying their utmost honor to the dear comrade 
leader, who has strengthened and developed our party as an 
impregnable fortress, and are filled with firm resolution to 
share, to the end, the party's destiny, in any storm. 
  Today, we are faced with the task of enhancing the party's 
leading role, smashing [chitpusida] all kinds of antisocialist 
maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and completing, 
to the end, the chuche revolutionary cause in conformity with 
the demand of the developing reality. To carry out the weighty 
and honorable task, all cells that comprise our party should 
excellently carry out their own functions and roles. "Let us 
make all the party cells loyal cells." This is an important 
slogan being put up by our party today, and this is the core 
task to be advocated by party organizations of various levels. 
  On the occasion of the meeting of party cell secretaries 
of the entire party, the party organizations at each level must 
effect a new upsurge in the struggle of implementing the party's 
such slogan. Today, our party members' sense of loyalty and 
dutifulness to the party and the leader [suryong] are very high. 
  All party members are living and working in a revolutionary 
manner by cherishing a firm determination that they want to 
become rifles and bombs in the course of resolutely safeguarding 
the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution and are overflowing with 
conviction of going through fire and water for a struggle to 
implement the party's policy. 
  The party cells must glorify every moment of their lives 
with 
loyalty by cherishing in their hearts a high sense of dignity 
and pride that they are always the party members of the glorious 
WPK led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They must 
properly lead the party members to fully play a role, as the 
vanguard fighters, in the revolution and construction. 
  The might of our party and socialism of our own style is the 
might of the single-hearted unity of the leader [suryong], the 
party, and the masses and, with this, we should vigorously carry 
out our revolution. This is an important purpose of this 
meeting. 
  On the occasion of the meeting, the party organizations at 
each level must actively carry out the work of an ideology and 
indoctrination among the party members and working people and 
lead them to fight on for the leader [yongdoja] at the risk of 
their lives by having a firm position and viewpoint that their 
boundless happiness, future, and socialist fatherland exist 
because there is always the dear comrade leader. 
  Along with this, all sectors and units must always firmly 
continue on the alert in conformity with the demands of the 
present situation. Also, they must lead all party members and 
working people to live and work with an invincible faith and 
revolutionary obligation, just like the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary fighters who resolutely safeguarded the respected 
and beloved comrade commander and the heroic combatants who 
protected the hill of the fatherland at the risk of their lives 
by keeping their pledge of loyalty made to the great leader 
[suryong] at the general meeting of party cell during the harsh 
Fatherland Liberation War. 
  A long time has passed since the first party organization 
was 
formed in period of the dawning of the Korean revolution. 
During this period, our party cell has been developed and 
strengthened more strongly. 
  Our party is great and our revolution's final victory is 
certain because it has the vigorous party cells, which have a 
combatant capacity that cannot be found in any places, in either 
its loyalty to the leader [yongdoja] or its function or role. 
  All of us must hasten the independent reunification of the 
fatherland and the complete victory of socialism by continuously 
making an innovation and by moving forward, thus cherishing deep 
in their hearts the great dignity and pride of embarking upon 
the road of the party's guidance--invincible and 
ever-victorious--under the leadership of the great leader 
[yongdoja].

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates an article titled "Great Encyclopedia Giving Integral 
Systematization of Chuche Idea" to the 12th anniversary of the 
publication of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's historic 
work "On the Chuche Idea" (March 31, 1982). 
  The author of the article says: 
  The dear leader's work "On the Chuche Idea" is an immortal 
work which consummates in an integral system the principles and 
contents of the chuche idea on a profound scientific and 
theoretical basis; it is a great encyclopedia of the chuche idea 
which enriches the chuche idea with a wealth of new ideas and 
theories. 
  The greatness of the ideological and theoretical exploits of 
the dear leader is, first of all, that he established in an 
integral system a true world outlook of the era of independence 
with the popular masses placed in the centre. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "The chuche idea is a new philosophical thought which 
centres 
on man." 
  In the work, the dear leader gave a unique exposition that 
man is a social being with independence, creativity and 
consciousness and, on this basis, systemized in an integral way 
the chuche outlook on the world with the popular masses placed 
in the centre. 
  The philosophical principle of the chuche idea that man is 
the master of everything and decides everything gives a 
scientific exposition of the position and role of man in the 
world on the basis of his essential characters. The 
socio-historical principles of the chuche idea clarify from a 
new angle the essence, character and motive force of the 
socio-historical movement with the popular masses as the driving 
force. 
  As clarified in the work, the philosophical world outlook of 
chuche unifies the view of the world focussing on man and the 
man-centred viewpoint and stand toward the world; the 
socio-historical outlook of chuche closely combines the view of 
the socio-historical principles and law centred on the popular 
masses, the makers of history, with the viewpoint and stand 
approaching historical development and social revolution with 
the popular masses placed in the centre. 
  Thus, the chuche idea convinces the masses of people that 
they are responsible for their own destiny and enables them to 
discharge their duty and role as masters in the revolutionary 
struggle and constructive work to transform nature, society and 
man. 
  The dear leader's scientific exposition of the essential 
characters of man and systematization of the world outlook of 
chuche with the popular masses placed in the centre are immortal 
exploits in that they bring into bolder relief the main 
features, uniqueness and advantages of the chuche idea that 
broke a new ground in the development of mankind's outlook on 
the world, and provide the popular masses with a powerful weapon 
to transform the world positively and actively. 
  The greatness of the dear leader's ideological and 
theoretical exploits is also that he enriched the chuche idea so 
that it may serve as a powerful weapon in the practical efforts 
to shape the destiny of the popular masses. 
  In the work, the dear leader, basing himself on a scientific 
analysis of the founding and development of the chuche idea and 
the rich practical experience of the Korean revolution, 
elucidated the guiding principles in the revolutionary struggle 
of the popular masses to transform nature and society. 
  The guiding principles of the chuche idea -- maintaining the 
independent stand, applying the creative method and placing the 
main stress on ideology in the revolution and construction -- 
make it possible to firmly defend, embody and give full play to 
the independence, creativity and consciousness of the popular 
masses in the revolutionary struggle and constructive work so 
that they can positively transform nature and society and 
actively shape their own destiny. 
  The integral systematization and consummation of the chuche 
idea in conformity with its main features and ideal by the dear 
leader are an immortal exploit in making the chuche idea more 
famous than before as a flawless system of scientific and 
logical ideas and theories and a great guiding idea of the time 
with a new, unique composition and contents. This was an 
epoch-making event which provided the first perfect 
revolutionary world outlook of the working class in human 
history.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean Architects 
Union observed its 40th birthday. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song founded the union in 
March 1954 in the difficult postwar period when everything had 
been razed to the ground. He has clearly indicated the path of 
the union in each stage of the revolutionary development. 
  The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea sent a 
congratulatory message to the members of the union on its 40th 
birthday. 
  The message notes that over the past 40 years the union has 
actively helped to build Pyongyang and other cities and rural 
communities of Korea splendidly and modern industrial 
establishments and grand monumental edifices in different parts 
of the nation for the prosperity of the country and the 
improvement of the people's living standard. 
  The message highly estimates the union members for the great 
feats they have performed over the past 40 years in ushering in 
a brilliant heyday of chuche architecture in Korea. 
  A meeting was held here Tuesday to mark the anniversary.

  [Text] Talks about the Indonesian-Malaysian dispute over 
the Sipadan-Ligitan Islands have registered new results. For the 
first time, the second meeting of the Joint Working Group (JWG) 
approved the issuance of a joint statement saying, among other 
things, that a third JWG meeting would take place in Indonesia 
in May. It was revealed in the joint statement that the two 
sides had agreed to solve the dispute on the basis of 
international legal principles. "Included are relevant treaties, 
conventions, and understandings which involve the two sides," 
the statement said. 
  According to a report filed from Kuala Lumpur by KOMPAS 
reporter Budiarto Shambazy, the second meeting was still 
dominated by a process of "reciprocal legal testing," i.e., 
claiming Sipadan-Ligitan through the study of various documents. 
By studying discussions of this type, it would seem that future 
discussions will also continue at the level of an exchange of 
documents and of each side's response to the legal evidence 
presented. 
  In fact, the two sides are still discussing--or in the 
spirit 
of ASEAN "consulting"--scores of documents to strengthen their 
claim of sovereignty over Sipadan-Ligitan. There is still no 
absolute certainty over who really has the rights to 
Sipadan-Ligitan, even though de facto Malaysia occupies Sipadan 
Island and has developed tourism there. 
  At this second meeting Malaysia offered its responses or 
answers to the legal claims presented by Indonesia at the first 
meeting held in Jakarta in 1992. After this meeting in Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia will be seeking additional documentation to be 
presented at the third meeting to be held in Indonesia in May. 
  "We submitted (the documents) in 1992 and we're only getting 
an answer now. Of course they're looking for additional 
documents to strengthen their position. We are also looking for 
new documents to strengthen (our claim)," said Izhar Ibrahim, 
delegation chairman (political director general of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs), who was accompanied by Hasyim 
Djalal, deputy chairman of the delegation. 
  Neither of the two chairmen was willing to reveal what is in 
the documents, estimated to be more than 50 in number, presented 
by the two sides to legitimate their rights to Sipadan-Ligitan. 
Both Izhar and the Chairman of the Malaysian Delegation Kamil 
Jaafar (secretary general of the Department of Foreign Affairs) 
repeatedly said that it was too soon to reveal what is in the 
documents. 
  "We have made every effort and we have reached the maximum 
possible results, especially since we have agreed on a joint 
press statement. This is as far we progressed at this meeting. 
Each side has also presented a number of new documents, treaties 
and arguments to strengthen its claim for sovereignty over 
Sipadan-Ligitan," said Izhar. 
  In broad outline, Indonesia considers that Sipadan-Ligitan 
is 
within the area of national sovereignty because it was within 
the area under Dutch colonial control. Whereas Malaysia believes 
that the Dutch handed the two islands over to the British, who 
colonized Malaysia. Each side's claim is also based on where the 
border is drawn in the area, about which there is a difference 
of interpretation. 
  Based on a 1969 agreement, the two countries agreed, but did 
not sign a written agreement, to the principle of the status quo 
of the two islands. The dispute arose when Malaysia violated the 
status quo by building tourist facilities under private 
management on Sipadan Island. 
  According to several KOMPAS sources, Indonesia has actually 
requested that the dispute be settled through the International 
Court. But Malaysia disagreed with the idea of 
internationalizing the issue, preferring to carry out bilateral 
talks. 
  "(The talks) are bilateral; we're not thinking yet about 
internationalization," said Izhar, in response to questions 
about the "internationalization" of the dispute. 
  Another important result which Izhar said was also reached 
was an agreement to meet more often and to solve the dispute as 
quickly as possible. "Both sides want to solve this issue as 
quickly as possible. We will hold meetings more often," said 
Izhar. 
  Izhar gave an evasive reply to the question of whether the 
Indonesian delegation had reached its goal at the meetings this 
time. "I can't say we reached the goal, but we tried as hard as 
we could," he said. Referring to Indonesia's position at the end 
of the second meeting, Izhar said, "Of course we're in a 
stronger position. But I can't state what it is yet. We haven't 
finished collecting all the documents." 
  After the meetings were over, on Friday afternoon (28 
January) Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas took the 
opportunity to stop at Subang Airport (Kuala Lumpur) to listen 
to a report from the Indonesian delegation. Alatas received 
Izhar, Hasyim, Sudarmadi (the Indonesian ambassador in Kuala 
Lumpur) and several other delegates in the VIP room of the 
airport for an hour. 
  In the meantime, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas told 
reporters at Sukarno-Hatta Airport on Friday (28 January) that 
the Sipadan-Ligitan dispute would not end in a dead-lock. Even 
though it has not yet moved beyond the stage of studying each 
other's data and documents, the two countries have agreed to 
solve the problem in an amicable way. He admitted that the 
problem requires expertise and time. Nevertheless, he said that 
Malaysia had presented its response to the dispute. 
  In response to questions from reporters, Alatas said that 
Malaysia had given its response. In order to discuss the 
dispute, on his trip from Yemen to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur, 
Alatas received the response in the form of a report prepared by 
the Indonesian team, which is "battling" in Kuala Lumpur under 
the leadership of Drs Izhar Ibrahim, director general for 
political issues of the Department of Foreign Affairs. 
  He said that at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia had 
handed over documents to strengthen their position on Sipadan 
and Ligitan. Indonesia did the same. Alatas said that at the 
meeting Malaysia had presented its response on the basis of the 
existing documents. However, the process will continue. In the 
near future, around May 1994, a high-level meeting (SOM) will 
take place. Alatas did not state Malaysia's response to 
Indonesia in a definite way. 
  In response to the steps that Malaysia has begun to take to 
occupy the two islands, Alatas emphasized that Indonesia and 
Malaysia have very friendly relations now. That is why steps 
that might invite a physical risk should not be taken. 
  "Should we send in our troops and throw them out? How could 
we do that, no way we can do that, we don't live in times like 
that any more, we're friends. We have many interests in common 
with Malaysia. This is a problem, and we're going to solve it, 
but in an amicable way. We're in ASEAN together," he asserted. 
  In response to a question about a possible solution to the 
Sipadan-Ligitan dispute, Alatas said that at this stage 
Indonesia and Malaysia had not yet moved away from studying the 
documentation and the Indonesian and Malaysian legal positions. 
This part of the process is not over yet and would continue. He 
said that Malaysia really has a different position on the issue 
and that is why we have to understand that Malaysia is 
presenting different documents. In this respect, Indonesia will 
continue to look into the best possible way to solve the problem. 
  At one point Malaysia, through Deputy Prime Minister Ghafar 
Baba (KOMPAS 23 December 1992) did ask Indonesia to relinquish 
its claim. He said that Indonesia will not lose anything if it 
gives up the two islands because it has thousands of other 
islands. However, on that occasion officials of the Department 
of Foreign Affairs said that it is not just a matter of an 
island but that it also involves national sovereignty.

  [Text] Various circles think that lifting the American 
embargo on Vietnam will threaten the Indonesian ability to 
attract foreign investments. 
  "Lifting the embargo will have a serious and direct effect 
on 
Indonesia, in addition to the low labor costs there. For that 
reason, Indonesia must really compete with Vietnam," said 
Sanyoto Sastrowardojo, state minister for investment (Meninves) 
and chairman of the Investment Board, at the DPR 
[Parliament]/MPR [People's Consultative Council] building this 
week. 
  Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of the Indonesian Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry; J. B. Bambang Warih Koesoema, member 
of the DPR's Commission VI; Djaf'ar H. Assegaff, Indonesian 
ambassador to Vietnam; and the economic observers Christianto 
Wibisono and Hartojo Wignyowijoto, made similar statements. 
However, Sanyoto said, lifting the embargo will also provide an 
opportunity to export Indonesian goods to that country. 
  At the same time, said Bambang, Indonesia must implement an 
integrated and comprehensive action plan in order to meet the 
increased competition. 
  "Planned and integrated measures must be taken in order to 
meet the increased competition from Vietnam." 
  Dja'far, the new Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam, stated 
that lifting the American embargo on Vietnam should spur 
Indonesia to increase its competitive abilities. 
  "However, we need to think positively, that is, how can the 
two countries take advantage of what each one does best for 
their common good." 
  Dja'far explained that the first step to be taken in 
anticipation of lifting the embargo would be to open up direct 
trade relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. "Indonesian trade 
with Vietnam has never been direct but has had to go through a 
third country. This is inefficient and wasteful." 
  At the same time, Christianto Wibisono, director of the 
Indonesian Business Data Center (PBDI), said that Indonesia 
should not be too concerned about the embargo being lifted. 
  "Indonesia has a 25-year lead so why should we worry? What 
we 
have to do is figure out how to maintain our position." 
  Vietnam, he continued, still has a lot of fixing up to do 
before it can increase foreign investment in the country. 
"Indonesia has a much better infrastructure. Right now Vietnam 
is like Indonesia was in the 1970s." 
  For Hartojo the most serious threat that we have to be 
concerned about is that Vietnam has copied various regulations 
in the field of oil and natural gas mining (Migas). 
  "They have plagiarized our ideas about mining contracts 
exactly, meaning that they are prepared to compete with 
Indonesia in attracting investors who are active in the field of 
Migas mining." 
  Aburizal said that Vietnam can be an extension of 
investments 
from various Indonesian companies.

  [Excerpt] JAKARTA, March 30 (AFP) -- Police here have freed 
14 students who were involved in a demonstration calling for 
justice in a 430 million dollar scam against a state bank, a 
police official said Wednesday. Jakarta police spokesman 
Lieutenant-Colonel Latief Rabar said the students were freed 
late Tuesday after being questioned for several hours over their 
involvement in a rally in front of the Supreme Advisory Council 
(DPA) building earlier in the day. The students were among some 
40 others involved in a rally against the banking scam, which 
allegedly involved collusion between high officials and 
businessmen. 
  Rabar said police confiscated 43 posters the students used 
during the protest to back their calls for quick government 
handling of the "Bapindo" case, so called because the 
state-owned Bank Pembanungan Indonesia (Bapindo) provided what 
turned out to be bad loans totalling 430 million dollars to an 
ethnic Chinese businessman. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Suharto said that administrative 
deconcentration and decentralization, along with economic 
deregulation and debureaucratization, would continue, in line 
with progressive stages of social autonomy. 
  Opening the National Discussions on State Administration 
yesterday at the Presidential Palace, the president said that 
society, both urban and rural, is very receptive to almost every 
policy, strategy, and program initiated by the government. The 
head of state said that various new forces autonomously 
dedicated to increasing and expanding development had begun to 
grow and move in an active way. 
  "The government itself is adjusting to these progressive 
stages of social autonomy. The way to do it is to continue to 
implement government deconcentration and decentralization, along 
with economic deregulation and debureaucratization," he said. 
  At the discussions, which were attended by Minister of 
Reform 
for State Apparatus T.B. Silalahi, Minister of Defense and 
Security Edi Sudradjat, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono, 
the president mentioned that the government's mission is 
basically to foster and create the widest possible conditions 
and opportunities for the growth and formation of social 
initiatives and creativity for development. 
  The various groups within society are expected to forge, 
generate, develop, and cultivate human initiatives and 
creativity in order to autonomously increase the standard and 
quality of life, both physical and spiritual. 
  "Given such cooperation, we hope that we can progress 
rapidly 
in the years to come," said the president. 
  The president said that institutionally the government is 
made up of two basic tiers--the governing political tier, which 
consists of the president, the vice-president, and the 
ministers, and the state administrative tier, which consists of 
officials and agencies under the ministers, which serve from the 
federal level down to the village level. 
  The president said that it is this state administrative tier 
which professionally prepares and implements a set of policies, 
strategies and programs, which are established by the governing 
political tier. Part of the success of national development in 
the past few decades has come from the dedication and 
professional skills of this state administrative tier. 
  "We must build up this state administrative tier. The 
development of the state administration is an integral part of 
our entire national development," he asserted. 
  In another part of his speech, the president suggested that 
the development of the state administration is no less crucial 
to national development than the development of other areas. 
The development of the state administration, said the 
president, could only be done after the governing political tier 
was completely fixed up and it achieved stability in 1969. 
  "Since then we have really been able to build up the state 
administration so that it can fulfill such an important 
function. We have all begun to enjoy the fruits of the 
development of the state administration through the functioning 
of the entire state administrative apparatus," said the 
president. 
  However, the president continued, we should not feel 
satisfied yet. Economic competition between countries will be 
even sharper in the future. That is why society and the state 
administration must be able to increase the efficient and 
effective use of national resources. 
  Before the president's speech, Hendropriyono, General 
Chairman of the National Discussions on State Administration, 
reported that 200 people are taking part in the three-day 
program. 
  The speakers at the meeting will include a number of 
important figures in the administration, such as Awaludin 
Djamin, Bintoro Tjokromidjojo, Minister of Defense and Security 
Edi Sudradjat, and Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman 
Djojonegoro.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (SUARA KARYA)--President Suharto has 
praised the work of village Islamic centers as ideal educational 
institutions. In these surroundings children not only study 
during the school day but also go through an educational process 
outside school hours. Indeed, in the village Islamic centers 
education inside and outside the school is really one and the 
same thing. 
  Integrating the process of instruction and education is very 
important for raising a generation of people who are literate 
and at the same time are of good moral character. The president 
made this statement when he was opening the Fourth National 
Conference of the Nahdatul Ulama (NU) League of Village Islamic 
Centers and the First National Working Session of the NU 
National Sports Institute at the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic 
Center in West Java on 31 January. 
  The opening portion of the program at this rather modern 
village Islamic center in the prosperous residential area of 
West Jakarta was washed out by a heavy rain. However, religious 
officials attending the event, who came from a number of village 
Islamic centers throughout Indonesia, were not discouraged. 
Among these officials were K.H. Zainuddin and R.H. Oma Irama, 
who arrived at the same time in the midst of a heavy downpour 
and received special applause from those attending the program. 
  The president said that in handling future community 
development it is hoped that the role of the League of Village 
Islamic Centers will increase in importance, so that it will be 
more and more mature, particularly in view of the government's 
intention to increase the length of required school attendance 
to nine years. 
  According to the chief of state, village Islamic centers 
have 
done a great deal to develop national life. The fact that the 
village Islamic centers are located throughout Indonesia and 
that their educational charges are low has greatly helped 
village children in their studies. This is especially the case 
since more than a few village Islamic centers have carried on 
formal educational programs, not only at the pre-school level 
373 but have also functioned as public schools. The challenge 
facing them is how to increase the quality of education and 
instruction in these centers. 
  In view of the position and role of Muslim religious 
officials in the community all of those present at the meeting 
were happy to learn that a number of village Islamic centers are 
actively engaged in community development. This situation is 
really in accordance with the practice followed by village 
Islamic centers, that is, integrating learning and practical 
experience. For the village Islamic centers learning without 
practical experience is the equivalent of "a tree which bears no 
fruit." Therefore, the integration of practical experience and 
learning is accomplished through community development activity. 
  Cooperation is needed in the effort to increase the role of 
village Islamic centers in community development, between both 
the village Islamic centers themselves and government and 
private sector institutions. The president said that, in fact, a 
great deal of pioneering work can be carried on by village 
Islamic centers in the field of local community development, 
particularly by raising the standard of living of the local 
people. The chief of state said: "For example, what has been 
done by the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic Center to help small 
businessmen is a model for the direct involvement of village 
Islamic centers in community development. These efforts must be 
adapted to the respective, local situation. The League of 
Village Islamic Centers can and must do a great deal to develop 
and increase the role of village Islamic centers." [passage 
omitted] 
  At the meeting Minister of Religious Affairs Tarmizi Taher 
said that research on the position of village Islamic centers 
needs to be carried out to determine both the strengths and 
weakness of village Islamic centers, both as educational 
institutions as well as centers for carrying on community 
activity, in terms of missionary activity as well as in the 
social and economic field. Honesty in self-evaluation at present 
and in the past will help the leaders of the village Islamic 
centers to identify future opportunities and demands, 
particularly those of the 21st century, an era full of 
challenges which cannot be anticipated in detail as yet.

  [Text] Foreigners do not understand ABRI's [Republic of 
Indonesia Armed Forces] role in East Timor. They think that it 
has the same function as their own military, whose only tasks 
are security and making war, and so they think that that is 
ABRI's function in East Timor. 
  The Governor of East Timor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares made 
that statement in response to questions from reporters in Dili 
yesterday morning after inaugurating and swearing in Drs 
Sudarmadi as the head of the East Timor Regional Office of the 
Department of Information. Sudarmadi is replacing Drs Amir Ali 
Nasution. The inauguration and transfer of power was at the 
direction of Minister of Information H. Harmoko Directive Number 
202-A/SK/BK/JB/1993 dated 19 December 1993. 
  The new official was formerly the head of the Department of 
Information's Surakarta District Office (Central Java), and the 
former official will be transferred to Jakarta. 
  Governor Abilio said that ABRI's presence is still needed in 
East Timor because out of the approximately seven ABRI 
battalions serving in East Timor only one has security duties 
for stabilizing the region and the other six are territorial 
battalions whose function is to aid the villagers. 
  The governor also made this assertion in response to several 
western countries which have warned ABRI to withdraw immediately 
from East Timor. Governor Abilio added that East Timor needs 
ABRI very much. The facts show that ABRI's presence in East 
Timor is helping to advance the welfare of the people in the 
countryside because ABRI lives with the villagers. 
  Antonio Freitas Parada, chairman of the East Timor DPRD 
[Provincial Parliament] made a similar statement when he was 
interviewed by PEMBARUAN at Comoro Airport in Dili before he and 
the governor left for Denpasar, Bali, to attend the Udayana IX 
Military District Command transfer of power ceremony. 
  Parada said that foreigners might still think that East 
Timor 
is like Bosnia or Cambodia and that ABRI is just fighting here. 
On the contrary, ABRI is the people's workmate in the gardens, 
in the rice fields and in the villages. 
  He said that the residents of East Timor have only been 
Indonesian citizens for 18 years. There are still many things 
that the people of East Timor need to learn from ABRI in order 
to become good Indonesian citizens; for example, they are 
learning many things from ABRI's territorial activities in the 
villages about how the land is cultivated in other provinces, 
about how to speak the national language and about Indonesian 
culture, which the people of East Timor must still learn to 
understand. 
  "Believe it or not, the villagers speak better Indonesian 
than the city dwellers because they associate with ABRI every 
day," said Parada.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Saleh Al-Djufri: "Golkar-NU Relations Become </F>
More Distant"] 
  [Text] President Suharto, in his capacity as chairman of 
Golkar's [Functional Groups Organization] Development Board, 
recently called on the leadership of Golkar's DPP [Executive 
Board] to investigate the drop in Golkar votes in the 1992 
general elections. 
  Only a few months after being elected general chairman of 
Golkar's DPP Harmoko took swift action to prepare for a Golkar 
victory in future general elections. Harmoko's acts of 
consolidation were only natural and due above all to the fact 
that Megawati stepped into the position of general chairman of 
the PDI's [Indonesian Democracy Party] DPP and to the 
conjectures that elements of the NU [Islamic Scholars Party] 
would step into leadership positions at the upcoming August 
Party Congress of the PPP [United Development Party]. It seems 
that Harmoko wants to prove that he cannot be taken lightly and 
that he is showing that a civilian can also lead the party whose 
symbol is the banyan tree. 
  The challenges faced by Harmoko in the 1997 general 
elections 
are certainly far more difficult than those of previous 
elections. In the past, ABRI [Republic of Indonesia Armed 
Forces] and the bureaucracy sided firmly with Golkar, the level 
of the people's political maturity was still low and the system 
for running the general elections favored Golkar. In future 
elections, on the other hand, the situation will be very 
different. The strong impetus towards democratization, ABRI's 
neutral position, the people's increased political maturity, the 
quality of the system running the general elections, and the 
consolidation of two political parties are all serious 
challenges which Harmoko will have to face. This list doesn't 
even include the increasingly distant relations between Golkar 
and the NU, the largest mass organization, which played a big 
role in jacking up Golkar's votes in the 1987 general elections, 
Golkar's greatest achievement and one which it would find hard 
to repeat. 
  It is not hard to notice the increasingly distant relations 
between Golkar and the NU. After the tug-of-war between Golkar 
and the NU just before the 1992 general elections, which 
resulted in a drop in Golkar votes, the make-up of the 
leadership of Golkar's DPP for the period 1993-1998, which 
emerged from the Fifth Party Congress and is often called the 
work of Habibie, was seen as the low point in Golkar-NU 
relations. 
  This time Habibie will really play an important role at the 
Party Congress. Habibie's troops are now putting their stamp on 
the Golkar leadership which emerged from the Fifth Party 
Congress. But it is unfortunate that he is probably incapable of 
understanding the political anatomy of the Islamic community and 
so he is not introducing NU figures into the ranks of Golkar's 
leaders. This is really a fatal decision because it is believed 
that it will influence the NU's political position in future 
general elections. The NU is the religious social organization 
with the largest membership in Indonesia. 
  It seems that it will be hard to improve the increasingly 
distant relations between Golkar and the NU in the future. 
Besides that, both Golkar and the NU also want to become 
independent organizations. The NU does not want to depend on 
Golkar's political positions but wants to give its members the 
freedom of political choice. At the same time, Golkar itself 
also does not want to depend on the size of the NU or of any 
other social organization because Golkar's political style is 
clearly not to be dictated to by other organizations, especially 
after learning the lessons of the 1987 and 1992 general 
elections, in which Golkar's rise and fall depended on the NU's 
political positions. The problem is whether Golkar is ready to 
face future general elections by taking those steps. In other 
words, how far down into this society has Golkar moved? 
  In my opinion, the steps taken by Golkar under Harmoko's 
leadership to construct its own independent political base are 
part of Golkar's strategy to win the general elections and to 
move into this society. If we look carefully at Golkar's journey 
since its inception three decades ago, it has gone through three 
stages in its effort to win the general elections. At the 
beginning of the New Order, Golkar, which was helped into being 
by the military and by groups of social organizations whose goal 
was to stem the activities of the PKI [Indonesian Communist 
Party], racked up victories in the general elections through the 
power of the state apparatus. The military and the bureaucracy 
were very effective in spearheading their influence over the 
masses who had experienced political trauma following the 
G30S/PKI bloodbath [September 30th Movement]. 
  At the same time, the government restructured politics by 
narrowing the scope of political party activities and gave way 
to Golkar to seize victory. The masses were made politically 
sterile, which made it easier for the government apparatus, who 
are also members of Golkar, to herd them into voting for Golkar 
in the general elections. It makes sense to say that the Golkar 
government used "bulldozer politics" when the general elections 
were first organized. 
  Golkar, which from its inception was very closely linked to 
abangan [traditional Javanese but not orthodox Muslim] culture, 
did not want to see a religious group, especially one that was 
Islamic in nature, rise to the national political stage. That is 
why for the first 2 decades after its inception the government 
always faced off against Islam. The Islamic masses refer to the 
government as "them," which shows the psychological distance 
between them. Golkar has always been suspicious of Islamic 
political actions, which they say disturb sociopolitical 
stability. 
  The second stage arose when Golkar became reconciled with 
the 
Islamic community, which was mainly signaled by the rebirth of 
the NU into the '26 Line of Action at the Party Congress held in 
Situbondo and the willingness of the Islamic mass organizations 
to accept Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] as the 
nation's sole principle. This reconciliation clearly originated 
with the government (Golkar). It seems that Golkar became aware 
that Islam is potentially its most important political base and 
that it is not possible to win the general elections forever by 
depending on a relaxation of regulations or by force. That is 
why the only way for Golkar to maintain its continued existence 
is a rapprochement with the Islamic masses through its mass 
organizations, especially the NU, which is the biggest Islamic 
mass organization. 
  The outcome of this second movement-into-society stage was 
quite spectacular; it took the form of a conspicuous rise in 
Golkar votes in the 1987 general elections. It was as if Golkar 
had become part of the Islamic community. When it visited the 
Islamic religious schools, the NU base that had previously been 
very much against Golkar, it was greeted with enthusiasm. The 
relations between Islam and the powers that be, in turn, 
gradually thawed out. 
  But it is probably true that large organizations, such as 
the 
NU, which from its inception has been very close to practical 
politics, also hold the key to the strategy of how to relate to 
Golkar. This means that NU's willingness to be close to Golkar 
must be matched by acceptable political concessions. This is 
NU's hope, but Golkar is unwilling to grant those concessions. 
The consequence is that relations have become distant again. 
  Even though Golkar and the NU are far apart again, Golkar 
succeeded in getting close to NU religious circles and religious 
schools with the result that they are no longer willing to 
accept their political line from the NU's PB [Executive 
Committee] just like that. In fact, there are many potential NU 
figures who have always been ignored by the NU's PB; they then 
discovered new places of operation and they moved into the MDI 
[Islamic Missionizing Council], the GUPPI [Association for the 
Improvement of Islamic Education], and other religious 
organizations under Golkar's aegis. The process of Golkar's 
movement into society within the NU, in turn, increasingly 
aggravated the poor relations between NU's elite and Golkar. 
NU's elite probably felt disappointed with Golkar because even 
though they gave concessions for Golkar's size and for its 
rapprochement with religious scholars and religious schools, 
they did not receive a proper political recompense. 
  It is this distant relationship between Golkar and the NU 
that is probably at the base of Golkar's present orientation and 
political strategy, which is at the same time the third stage of 
its political movement into society. Golkar would like to be an 
autonomous and mature party, not dependent on the political 
behavior of other organizations. Since most Indonesians are 
Moslems, Harmoko's attempt to build an independent political 
base is directed towards the Islamic masses. This is, of course, 
a new phenomenon in Golkar's journey. 
  If this hypothesis is true, it means that Harmoko is taking 
a 
courageous step. Golkar has the strategic tricks down pat in 
that it is increasingly accepted by Islamic circles and this is 
very significant for the future existence of Golkar. But this 
obsession with building a political base is probably aimed more 
at the "Islamic middle." 
  Fewer than 50 million members of the Islamic community are 
members of religious social organizations, such as the NU, 
Muhammadiayah, Al-Irsyad or the others. The rest, about 120 
million people, are members of the "Islamic middle," which is 
independent, especially when it comes to its politics. This 
group is more rational and pragmatic and is not so easily swayed 
by political sweet talk. In general they have enjoyed the New 
Order's economic development. This group is a potentially large 
base for Golkar, but keeping them as loyal voters and as a 
potentially large base is not easy. 
  Seen from this perspective, the steps that Golkar is taking 
to embrace Islamic circles, especially the ICMI [Indonesian 
Islamic Intellectuals Organization], is part and parcel of the 
political movement-into-society stage so that it will become an 
independent political party with grass roots. Now that it has 
succeeded in penetrating Islamic mass organizations, it seems 
that Golkar wants to strengthen and maintain its base in the 
"Islamic middle," which is most of the Indonesian population, 
especially since Golkar has proven itself to be the protector of 
the Islamic community, including NU's masses and the religious 
schools. 
  The acceptance of the Religious Jurisdiction Laws, the birth 
of the ICMI and other phenomena are examples of how much 
attention the government is paying to Islam. Before the ICMI was 
formed, many of our Muslim intellectuals were compartmentalized 
and there was no one association they could count on. Golkar has 
also carried out Islamic missionizing in an intensive way in the 
villages and in isolated areas and it tried to eliminate the 
compartmentalization which played the groups off against each 
other by using such terms for the Islamic community as abangan, 
santri [orthodox Muslim], Islam KTP [on their ID card], and so 
on. Under Golkar, Islam flourished. 
  But it is believed that Golkar's obsession with building a 
new base with an Islamic foundation is fraught with challenges, 
both internal and external. Internally, it is believed that not 
all organizations affiliated with Golkar (KINO-KINO [groups 
within the main organization]) agree with Golkar's policy of 
basing itself on the Islamic masses because that will narrow 
their political career paths and will give the Islamic group a 
greater opportunity to follow its career path within Golkar. It 
has often been said that since its inception Golkar has been 
closest to abangan culture. 
  Externally, if Golkar expects the Islamic masses to form its 
base, it must pay closer attention to their political 
aspirations. This will require Golkar to adapt and accommodate 
itself to Islamic aspirations. And I haven't yet mentioned the 
challenges from other organizations, especially the NU, which is 
not willing to let Golkar grab its members just like that. This, 
in turn, will rouse social jealousy between the NU and Golkar, 
which can be observed in Gus Dur's political behavior. In 
addition, the PDI has recently also been launching some 
political initiatives of rapprochement with Islamic circles. 
Practically speaking, the Islamic masses will be primadonnas in 
the next election. 
  Aside from the possibilities of pro and con, to what extent 
have such ideas become Golkar's political strategies? If such 
ideas have become Golkar obsessions, Harmoko will be known not 
only as a successful Golkar figure, but also as an Islamic 
figure. He will be a political figure who succeeds in 
eliminating the partitions between religious movements and who 
integrates santri and abangan cultures within Golkar. It is 
certain that we will not be able to see these achievements and 
ideas until the 1997 general elections. (The writer is director

  [Text] The DPR [Parliament] will continue to `go after' 49 
companies which have non-performing loans at BUMN [State-Owned 
Enterprises] Banks; at the same time, the BKPM [Capital 
Investment Coordinating Board] considers that the construction 
of the integrated chemical industry project owned by the Golden 
Key Group is not yet in the non-performing category. 
  "At the present time, there is only one client who is known 
to have a non-performing loan and the other 49 don't. We will 
continue to pursue them at not just one bank but at all the 
banks involved," said Yahya Nasution, deputy chairman of the 
DPR's Commission VII, when he and A.A. Baramuli (a member of the 
DPR's Commission VII) spoke to the press yesterday. 
  Yahya said that the case is being pursued because it had 
been 
uncovered by Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and the 
governor of the Bank of Indonesia. "Considering that the 
non-performing loan was granted by a bank syndicate with Bapindo 
[Indonesian Development Bank] as the lead arranger, that is the 
bank that we will question first." 
  "From Bapindo's response to Commission VII on Wednesday we 
will find out whether it will be necessary to invite in other 
state banks," said Yahya. 
  At the same time, Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, state minister for 
investment (Meninves) and chairman of the Investment Board, 
stated that the construction of the integrated chemical industry 
project owned by Eddy Tansil in Cilegon--which has been 
mentioned as a cause of non-performing loans--cannot be 
categorized as non-performing yet because it has not yet gone 
past its deadline. 
  "We are continuing to evaluate the three companies. If there 
is a good reason for the arrears, we will give them additional 
time," he told the press on 8 February after a working meeting 
with the DPR's Commission VI. 
  The BKPM, Sanyoto said, is still giving Graha Swakarsa Prima 
(GSP) Inc, Hamparan Rejeki (RP) Inc, and Pusaka Warna 
Polypropilen (PWP) Inc--the three subsidiaries of the Golden Key 
Group supporting the integrated chemical industry--the 
opportunity to continue constructing the plant. 
  The license granted to the three projects is still in the 
form of a Permanent Approval Certificate (SPT), but the BKPM has 
still not granted them a Permanent License Certificate (SIT). 
  "The BPKM will not grant an SIT until the three companies 
have had a trial run. However, it seems that the three companies 
have not had a trial run yet," he said in response to a question 
from Tadjuddin Nur Said, a member of the DPR's Commission VI, 
concerning the integrated petrochemical industry which is 
reported to have 1.3 trillion rupiahs in non-performing loans 
with BAPINDO. 
  Sanyoto said that an SPT was granted to GSP Inc on 5 June 
1989 and renewed on 24 May 1991 with an investment of 228 
billion rupiahs, which included the importation of engines worth 
$96 million. Every year this company produces 120,000 tons of 
styrene monomer, 50,000 tons of polystyrene, 15,000 tons of 
acrylonitrile butadene and 10,000 tons of styrene acrylonitrile. 
  Sanyoto said that GSP Inc had authorized capital of 200 
billion rupiahs, subscribed capital of 60 billion rupiahs and 
paid-in capital of 60 billion rupiahs. 
  The BPKM approved the PTHR [expansion unknown] as a PMDN 
[Domestic Capital Investment] on 28 November 1988 to be 
constructed with at least 214 billion rupiahs in capital, 
including the importation of $96 million worth of engines. The 
source of funding included 60 billion rupiahs of its own 
capital, 154 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital, 200 billion 
rupiahs of authorized capital, 60 billion rupiahs of subscribed 
capital and 60 billion rupiahs of paid-in capital. This company 
plans to produce 40,000 tons of acrylic fibers per year. 
  PWP Inc was founded with a capital of 269 billion rupiahs 
consisting of 169 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital and 100 
billion rupiahs of its own capital. The company will produce 
140,000 tons of polypropylene. 
  According to Baramuli, the problem of non-performing loans, 
which were uncovered right from the start, was reported to the 
chairman of the DPR's FKP [Functional Development Faction]; the 
head of the FKP had never prohibited the problem from being 
revealed, but his faction would go along if they were forbidden 
to speak up. 
  Baramuli admitted that he had received support from the 
businessman Probosutedjo. In fact, he continued, Probosutedjo 
mentioned a figure of one trillion rupiahs in non-performing 
loans, beyond the 1.3 trillion rupiahs, but Baramuli did not 
want to reveal this to the press. 
  A. Sutomo, junior attorney general for special criminal 
matters (JAM PIDSUS), said that his agency had tried to take 
anticipatory steps about the 1.3 trillion rupiahs in 
non-performing loans from Bapindo. "But the Attorney General's 
Office is committed to respecting the bank secrecy mandated by 
law," he said at breaks in his speech to legal-affairs reporters 
here yesterday. 
  Penetrating bank secrecy, he said, cannot be done until the 
Attorney General's Office is sure that a criminal act has been 
committed and is sure who the suspected perpetrator is. This 
means that bank secrecy cannot be penetrated until the Attorney 
General's Office is already at the investigatory stage. 
  Sutomo said that his people are limited right now to 
collecting data and information from various parties about cases 
of non-performing loans taken out by Eddy Tansil. 
  According to banking-law expert Rasjim Wiraatmadja, based on 
the provisions of banking law Number 7 of 1992, collateral for 
loans does not have to be in material form; it can be based on 
the banker's convictions about the debtor. If a banker is 
convinced that the credit granted can be paid back and if he 
knows the debtor very well, according to the provisions of the 
law the credit is justified. 
  "Under Law Number 14 of 1967, in fact, there always had to 
be 
some material collateral in order to grant credit. But under Law 
Number 7 of 1992 that provision was eliminated so that 
collateral can be based on the banker's convictions about the 
projected being funded," he told BISNIS here yesterday. 
  Even though bankers can grant credit on the basis of their 
convictions, material collateral is still required because in 
the February regulation package (PAKFEB) of 1991 there is a 
provision about obligatory reserves which was renewed in the May 
regulation package of 1993. 
  In legal terms, said Rasjim, Law Number 14 of 1967, which 
required material collateral, is no longer valid since it was 
superseded by a later law. Now one must refer to Law Number 7 of 
1992. 
  "In the May regulation package banks are obliged to set 
aside 
a reserve of 0.5 percent for current loans and 100 percent for 
non-performing loans. To meet these provisions, material 
collateral which can easily be turned into cash is really 
necessary." 
  Subagjo Joyosumarto, head of the Bank of Indonesia's Banking 
Development Bureau, said that the way to solve the 
non-performing loan problem is to write the loans which are not 
non-performing off the books. "Another way is for the government 
to order the banks to carry out mergers, consolidations and 
acquisitions," he told the annual meeting of members of the 
Perbanas [Private National Banks] Auditors Club (ACP) here 
yesterday.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Case of the 1.3-Trillion-Rupiah Loan </F>
Becomes Even More Murkier"] 
  [Text] The crisis which has hit the world of banking, 
primarily in the aftermath of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal 
loan, a case which is becoming murkier and murkier, this week 
seems to have turned into a national problem requiring the 
serious attention of the monetary authorities. 
  The case of the loan illegally granted by the Indonesian 
Development Bank (Bapindo) to Eddy Tansil, alias Tan Tju Hong, 
the head of the Golden Key Group, cannot be considered trivial, 
because it is closely tied to the credibility of national 
banking in the eyes of the international banking community. It 
is really a matter of "life or death" for national banking. 
  What is even more disturbing is the allegation that the 
illegal lending, which has been going on for the past two or 
three years, stems from a "magic letter" from an important 
figure in the bureaucracy to the monetary authorities, who are 
also the agents for Bapindo stockholders. That is why the 
1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan "smells of collusion". 
  Meanwhile, the Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as the central 
bank which has the authority to oversee executor bank 
activities, was unable to do very much in this case. This is 
because the mechanism of checks and balances between the Bank of 
Indonesia and the Department of Finance was not running very 
well. 
  But now, in this era of openness which keeps on rolling 
along, it seems that the monetary authorities, both the governor 
of the Bank of Indonesia and the minister of finance, have 
agreed to a thorough disclosure of non-performing loans, 
especially those with BUMN (State-Owned Corporate Bodies) banks. 
  Because they are determined to carry out a thorough 
investigation of all non-performing loans, the monetary 
authorities must not fail to investigate down to its very roots 
the case of the loan which Bapindo illegally granted to the 
businessman Eddy Tansil. Whoever is behind that illegal loan 
must also be uncovered to public view. 
  As a state bank, and therefore a bank belonging to the 
people 
of this country, Bapindo is obliged to disclose the problem of 
the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which has now become a 
national problem. The people must know what is happening in the 
BUMN banks because in fact the funds in those state banks belong 
to the people. 
  Therefore, the minister of finance and the governor of the 
Bank of Indonesia in the previous cabinet must give us a clear 
explanation of how so much credit could have been granted to 
this businessman whose bona fides are not so good, so that the 
case of the illegal loan can truly be opened up. 
  At a hearing which Commission VII of the DPR [Parliament] 
specifically held with Bapindo in Jakarta on Thursday (10 
February), the illegal loan could not be disclosed thoroughly. 
The procedure for granting the loan and the process for settling 
it became even murkier because it was covered up by an 
"explanatory veil," i.e., bank secrecy. 
  It seems that some bankers use Banking Law Number 7 of 1992, 
which includes regulations about bank secrecy, as a "shield" to 
cover up large-scale non-performing loans. 
  Up to now, in fact, very few large-scale non-performing 
loans 
have been thoroughly disclosed, especially if there is even a 
hint that these problem loans are tied to the names of certain 
important figures in the bureaucracy. 
  Nobody can deny that the world of national banking is "sick" 
right now. The period of consolidation, part of the effort to 
repear the weak conditions resulting from the application of a 
tight-money policy, isn't even over yet, and now national banks 
are hit again by the disaster of trillions of rupiahs in illegal 
loans. 
  To heal the national banking world again and to restore the 
confidence of international banking the only option for the 
nation's economic regulators, monetary authorities and 
law-enforcement agencies is to carry out a thorough 
investigation of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan. 
  Everyone thought to be involved must be scrutinized. It is 
important to uncover the part or the process of granting such a 
large-scale loan which violates the regulations or is considered 
illegal. 
  The government must take a firm stand in dealing with the 
1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which Bapindo granted to the 
businessman Eddy Tansil. If it is proved that there was an 
important figure in the bureaucracy involved in collusion, 
action must be taken against him as quickly as possible, for no 
other reason than to restore the image of national banking in 
the eyes of the people of this country and of the international 
banking community.

  [Text] Jakarta, 31 Jan--The government needs to reactivate 
the Small Investment Credit Program (KIK) and the Permanent 
Working Capital Credit Program (KMKP) to help small and medium 
sized business firms to grow. Based on the experience of a few 
years ago, it was proved that the KIK and KMKP programs were 
able to help business firms become strong. 
  This was stated by Sukamdani Sahid Gitosardjono, president 
of 
the Sahid Group of companies, at a seminar on "Indonesian 
Economic and Financial Prospects During 1994," held by HIPMI 
Jaya [Indonesian Young Businessmen's Association of Greater 
Jakarta] in Jakarta on 29 January. 
  According to Sukamdani, one cause of success in extending 
KIK 
and KMKP loans to help small and medium size businesses in 
Indonesia was that the criteria and the objectives were clear. 
These loans were really extended to those who needed them. This 
situation differs greatly from loans extended under the present, 
Small Business Loans Program (KUK), although both programs have 
been aimed at small and medium size businesses. 
  Sukamdani said that the criteria used under the KUK program, 
which replaced the KIK and KMKP programs, were unclear and 
confused. He said: "Loans provided to small businesses under the 
KUK program have an upper limit of 200 million rupiahs. Small 
businesses do not need so much money. In the past a KIK loan for 
one million rupiahs was unusual." 
  He said that previously the government, through the KIK and 
KMKP programs, successfully strengthened small and medium size 
businesses. He asked why these programs were not continued. 
  Regarding the statement of the minister of finance that 
loans 
will be extended to small and medium size businesses through 
government owned banks, Sukamdani expressed the hope that before 
this statement becomes a government regulation a dialogue needs 
to be held. This is because in a dialogue views closer to the 
real situation can be obtained. 
  He said: "The government is `committed' to this program. We 
must 373 provide our inputs through a dialogue. This can also be 
done through the mass media." 
  Later on he said that converting small- and medium-sized 
businesses into large companies is presently difficult because 
there are structural and sectoral obstacles in the way. In 
structural terms the development of small and medium size 
businesses requires the "political will" of the government on a 
continuing basis. In fact the government often follows a "mixed 
strategy." 
  On the one hand the government develops "capital intensive" 
industries, particularly downstream industry. However, at the 
same time small- and medium-sized industries are also encouraged 
to grow. 
  In sectoral terms agricultural products produced on the farm 
and mineral products do not have substantial added value and 
competitive strength in the market. There are still many 
agricultural products which are marketed in raw form. In this 
connection there is no other solution than establishing 
industries based on technological innovation. This needs to be 
done by a working team provided with appropriate guidance, 
consisting of experts and persons with practical experience who 
have different but mutually related skills. 
  Meanwhile, Dr Djisman Simandjuntak, director of the Prasetya 
Mulya Executive Higher Management School, said that, in fact, 
the difficulties facing small and medium size companies in 
developing their businesses have been created by the government 
itself. 
  The government is unfair in providing incentives to 
businessmen. Often already large companies obtain protection and 
incentives more extensive than those extended to small 
businesses. Furthermore, there are many business practices which 
are still common, such as the formation of cartels which only 
benefit big businesses. As a result, the question is not how to 
encourage economic growth of about six percent, rather, it is 
how to stimulate a higher rate of economic growth and, at the 
same time, achieve a balance in all business sectors.

  [Text] The Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid Society 
(LBH) has demanded that the government rescind Minister of 
Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) Number Per-01/MEN/1994 which 
regulates labor unions at the company level, making reference to 
various contradictions between clauses in those regulations. 
  Munir, head of the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid 
Society, said that this year the Minister of Manpower (Menaker) 
has issued a set of labor regulations which were set forth in 
Minister of Manpower Regulation Number Kep. 15A/MEN/1994 dated 4 
January 1994, concerning Guidelines for Resolving Labor 
Relations Disputes and Lay-offs at the Company Level, followed 
up at a later date by Permenaker Number 01/MEN/1994, which 
regulates labor unions at the company level. However, said 
Munir, several clauses in those two regulations are mutually 
contradictory. 
  "These inconsistent regulations are very worrisome, 
especially when we find out that a ministerial board had made 
those regulations," Munir told the press here yesterday. 
  Munir mentioned several contradictory clauses in those 
regulations; for example article 3 (b) of Kep. 15A/MEN/1994 
states that complaints can be resolved either via a leader of a 
labor union registered with the Department of Manpower or via 
another labor organization. And article 4 (a) states that in 
order to reach mutual agreement discussions will be carried out 
with a labor union or an association of labor unions registered 
with the Department of Manpower or another labor organization. 
  "This clause therefore guarantees the workers the right to 
set up a labor union other than the SPSI [All-Indonesia Labor 
Union], which is the organization registered with the Department 
of Manpower. However, Munir explained, the clause is 
contradicted by a regulation issued at a later date, i.e., 
Permenaker Number Per-01/MEN/1994. Article 1 (e) of Section I 
states that the Labor Union is the All-Indonesia Labor Union 
(SPSI). 
  This is where the contradiction lies; one of the labor 
regulations states that a minister can decide that a company can 
have a labor union other than the SPSI, but another regulation 
states that only the SPSI can exist within a company," Munir 
asserted. 
  Not to speak of a clause which, Munir said, is completely 
incomprehensible and has no force as a legal directive. The 
confusing proviso, set forth in article 22 of Permenaker Number 
01/MEN/1994, reads as follows: a business may not forbid a 
company-level union from becoming a labor union. 
  That is why the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid 
Society, in its letter addressed to the Minister of Manpower of 
the Republic of Indonesia, demanded the rescission of Permenaker 
Number 01/MEN/1994, because it considered it inconsistent with 
previously issued regulations. 
  "We have expressed our deepest concern over this 
inconsistent 
policy, which debases the law," Munir asserted. 
  This is especially so in relation to Law Number 28 of 1956 
concerning the right to organize and to hold joint meetings, 
which ratified the International Labor Organization (ILO) 
Convention Number 98 of 1949 and Labor Act Number 14 of 1969, 
which emphasized that in principle workers are free to organize 
themselves in any form of organization whatsoever, not just in 
an obligatory union such as the SPSI. 
  It was stated in the letter, a copy of which was sent to 
President Suharto, that legal developments and improvements will 
be hampered if there continue to be inconsistent policies 
dealing with labor problems. 
  "These contradictory regulations show that the Indonesian 
government is not building a healthy democratic climate which 
acknowledges in a fundamental way the rights of workers to 
organize, as ruled in the Constitution."

  [Text] Maintaining peace and security is the biggest 
challenge faced by countries in the region. The defense 
minister, Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, made this point at the airpower 
conference held in Australia today. He said the ability to 
manage tensions could prevent the Asia-Pacific from turning into 
a basin of turbulence and conflict. Dr. Yeo pointed out that 
the outlook in the region is not an entirely rosy one, with 
North Korea's nuclear ambition and the dispute over the 
Spratlys. With the uncertainties ahead, having a strong defense 
capability is important for each country. Dr. Yeo stressed that 
the relationship between the U.S., Japan, and China are 
instrumental to regional stability.

  [Text] After his visit to Australia from 20 to 23 March, 
Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri began his 
official visit to New Zealand from 24 to 27 March at the 
invitation of Donald McKinnon, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister of New Zealand. The visit is aimed at strengthening 
bilateral relations between Thailand and New Zealand and 
exchanging views with New Zealand leaders on the situation in 
the Asia-Pacific region and the upcoming meeting of the ASEAN 
Regional Forum, or ARF, to be held in Bangkok in July. 
  On the first day of his visit in Wellington, the foreign 
minister paid courtesy calls on New Zealand leaders, namely 
Peter Captain, house speaker and national assembly chairman; 
James Bolger, prime minister; and David Lange, former prime 
minister of New Zealand; and had talks with his New Zealand 
counterpart, Donald McKinnon. 
  The foreign Minister said New Zealand leaders attached 
special significance to the efforts to strengthen relations with 
Thailand, especially regarding trade, investment, and tourism 
cooperation, for they believe that the future of New Zealand is 
closely bound up with Asian countries. In this connection, the 
foreign minister expressed support for New Zealand's Asia 2000 
Program, under which New Zealand business people will visit 
Thailand and other countries in Asia to find ways of promoting 
investment cooperation. 
  The foreign minister suggested an increase in contacts 
between business circles, the setting up of Thai-New Zealand 
business council, and wider dissemination of trade and 
investment information as measures to promote trade and 
investment cooperation between the two countries, and the New 
Zealand side has agreed to take them up for further 
consideration. 
  The New Zealand side expressed its gratitude to Thailand for 
its support for New Zealand becoming a member of the UN Security 
Council in 1992 and expressed interest in joining the Treaty of 
Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, or the Bali Treaty. 
The foreign minister promised to bring the matter up for 
consultations with the other ASEAN member countries. 
  The foreign minister praised the long-standing relations 
between the two countries and thanked New Zealand for the 
excellent reception rendered to Princess Sirinthon during her 
visit to Antarctica. 
  Touching on the ARF meeting, which Thailand will host in 
July, the deputy prime minister of New Zealand said the meeting 
is the most meaningful meeting this year because it will provide 
both an opportunity for leaders of big countries to meet each 
other and a forum for the discussion of the future and stability 
of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The foreign minister noted that there should be a mechanism 
in the region to settle conflicts and act as a guarantee for 
regional stability. The New Zealand side agreed with him. The 
foreign minister also briefed his New Zealand hosts on the 
latest developments in Cambodia and Burma. The foreign minister 
told the New Zealand leaders that he, in his capacity as 
chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, will soon pay a visit 
to Burma at the invitation of the Burmese foreign minister and 
will consider inviting Burma as a guest of the host to attend 
the ASEAN annual meeting to be held in Thailand in July. 
  On the same day, the foreign minister met with Thai 
residents 
in Wellington and briefed them on the latest developments in 
Thailand and answered their questions on tourism promotion and 
the environment in Thailand. During his meetings with the New 
Zealand leaders, the foreign minister asked them to look after 
the well-being of the Thai residents who are there to earn their 
living, pursue higher education, and do business. The New 
Zealand leaders promised that Thai residents would be accorded 
fair and proper treatment. 
  The foreign minister received a warm and respectful 
reception 
during his visit. The foreign minister also extended his 
invitation to the New Zealand foreign minister to visit Thailand.

  [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
speaking over the phone with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
Thursday [31 March] morning, said close cooperation among Seoul, 
Washington and Tokyo is important to settle the North Korean 
nuclear dispute. 
  "I think that, if possible, we should try to invite China to 
participate and that we need Russian cooperation too," he added. 
  In the 33-minute conversation which started at 10 A.M. when 
Clinton called Kim while on Easter vacation in California, Kim 
explained his visits to Japan and China, Presidential spokesman 
Chu Ton-sik said. 
  "I think China will consider our position and will 
eventually 
cooperate with us in the U.N. Security Council," Kim said. 
  He added that Beijing would inform Pyongyang of Seoul's 
policy against the German-style reunification of Korea, with the 
South absorbing the North, and "my firm will to maintain peace" 
on the peninsula. "The Chinese leaders said they oppose not only 
the North Korean nuclear issue standing in the way of South 
Korea-China economic cooperation but also a nuclear presence in 
either of the two Koreas." 
  Clinton said he is well aware of China's concern that the 
U.N. Security Council may adopt a resolution on North Korea, 
while stressing the need to send a strong signal to show "our 
unity" before the North Koreans and the world. 
  He expressed hope that China would not veto a resolution in 
the U.N. Security Council, saying the Chinese are in a 
difficult position but must prevent North Korea from breaking 
the promises it has made. 
  Clinton, admitting that the Stalinist state's nuclear 
program 
is a sensitive problem, stressed the need to make clear "our 
position on this issue." 
  The United States believes that settling the nuclear issue 
through dialogue is most desirable, but realizes the difficulty 
of talking with North Korea, he remarked. 
  Clinton said that because North Korea has not kept its 
promises, the U.S. Government must continue pressing for full 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and 
resumption of inter-Korean dialogue. 
  He added that since Washington does not want the dispute to 
develop into a crisis, it will opt for a gradual and prudent 
approach so that North Korea can talk out a solution with South 
Korea, the United States and the IAEA. 
  Clinton stressed the need for Seoul and Washington to 
cooperate closely on the diplomatic front and take the 
initiative if necessary. 
  Rendering ineffective Pyongyang's policy pitting Washington 
against Seoul is vital, he said, adding that Japanese, Chinese 
and Russian cooperation must be brought to bear. 
  President Kim reiterated the need for additional IAEA 
nuclear 
checks in North Korea and substantial inter-Korean talks, noting 
that China supports "dialogue between responsible authorities of 
South and North Korea." 
  Saying he has invited Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit 
Seoul soon, Kim said Jiang had promised to come before the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting 
slated for November. 
  In his two meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in 
Tokyo, Kim and the Japanese leader agreed that South 
Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation is key to solving the nuclear 
issue, Kim told Clinton.

  [Text] Washington, March 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States agreed to push their plans to adopt a resolution 
at the UN Security Council on the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  The agreement came during a meeting Wednesday morning 
between 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  Han and Christopher decided they would retain the content of 
the draft resolution worked out by the United States but tone 
down the phrasing, informed sources said. 
  At the same time, they did not rule out the possibility of 
going along with a statement by the council president as 
demanded by China, the sources said. The two countries will 
continue to seek a compromise with China, they added. 
  Talking to reporters after the meeting, Han said his 
agreement with Christopher was not just a gesture to facilitate 
negotiations with China. "We have actually agreed to push our 
plans to adopt a resolution," Han said. 
  Prior to the meeting, Christopher had consulted with Foreign 
Ministers Tsutomu Hata of Japan and Andrey Kozyrev of Russia on 
adopting a resolution on North Korea. The foreign ministers are 
still negotiating among themselves, the sources said. 
  "Be it a resolution or a council president statement, the 
security council is expected to adopt it by Thursday," Han said. 
He added, however, that the timing could be put off a little if 
minor problems cropped up. 
  In either case, there would be a deadline for North Korea, 
Han said, hinting that it would be around mid-May when the 
International Atomic Energy Agency could resume inspections. 
  Han said that if the IAEA cannot undertake additional 
inspections, the United States will forget about talks with 
North Korea and enter directly into a phase where the Security 
Council would impose sanctions. 
  Therefore, North Korea will have to respond to the 
resolution 
or the council president's statement, Han said. 
  Han also briefed Christopher on the results of South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and discussed possible 
Chinese cooperation. 
  Han and Christopher discussed follow-up measures to the 
Security Council resolution, as well as problems related to the 
joint military exercise Team Spirit and a third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, the sources said. 
  Later Wednesday, Han met with Samuel Burger, deputy White 
House aide for national security affairs, and they agreed to 
continue maintaining close coordination and cooperation on the 
North Korean nuclear row. 
  Han is scheduled to visit the United Nations in New York for 
talks with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and both 
permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Washington, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Washington and 
Pyongyang recently exchanged letters clarifying their respective 
positions on international inspection of North Korea's nuclear 
facilities and a fresh high-level meeting. 
  Diplomatic sources here said Wednesday that Assistant 
Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert 
Gallucci sent a letter to North Korean Vice Foreign Minister 
Kang Sok-chu several days ago, saying a third round of 
high-level talks would not take place unless Pyongyang met two 
previously agreed conditions -- full inspection of nuclear sites 
at Yongbyon and an exchange of envoys between North and South 
Korea. 
  Gallucci and Kang headed their respective delegations to the 
previous two rounds of high-level U.S.-North Korean political 
negotiations. 
  The letter contained no fresh offers but urged Pyongyang to 
allow additional International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
checks of its nuclear facilities, while reaffirming the U.S. 
position on further talks, a source said. 
  Gallucci wrote the letter in reply to a missive sent by Kang 
in the middle of March. 
  In his letter, Kang urged Washington to hold a third round 
of 
talks as agreed, noting North Korea had permitted IAEA 
inspections. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told South Korean 
correspondents here that further high-level U.S.-North Korean 
talks would not be held until Pyongyang complied with the coming 
UN Security Council action, be it a resolution or a statement. 
  "I don't think it necessary for Washington to have prior 
consultations with Pyongyang regarding additional IAEA 
inspections, "He added, suggesting that the resumption of 
dialogue depends on whether Pyongyang changes its mind on the 
nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Team Spirit' &amp; Patriot Missiles"] </F>
  [Text] The joint U.S.-Korea military exercise Team Spirit 
is intended to maintain the defense capability of the Korean and 
American forces here against a possible North Korean attack. 
So, it was naturally expected that the two allies would conduct 
the annual military drill this year too. 
  However, Seoul and Washington canceled it as a concession in 
the nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and South Korea, the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Now that the hardline Stalinist state has failed to carry 
out 
its half of the bargain, this concession might be expected to be 
withdrawn. But Pyongyang is again threatening to pull out of 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the U.S. and South 
Korea resume the exercise, which Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for 
a nuclear war against the North. 
  China has also come out in support of the North Korean 
position. Although President Kim Yong-sam stated after his 
summit with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin in Beijing that 
the two did not discuss Team Spirit and the deployment of 
Patriot anti-missile batteries in the South, Chinese officials 
made it clear China is as opposed to them as before. 
  A formal Seoul decision on the two matters is expected after 
President Kim's return home, as he promised before his departure 
for Japan and China a week ago. With the two presidents having 
called for a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
problem through dialogue among the parties concerned, Kim is 
likely to weigh the further postponement of the military drill 
in expectation of a change in Pyongyang's nuclear stance. 
  It is our view that suspension of the Team Spirit drill 
needs 
to be considered, lest it provide an excuse for the North to 
translate its NPT pullout threat into action, leaving no room 
for a peaceful solution to the issue. Since Seoul and 
Washington have used Team Spirit as a bargaining chip in nuclear 
negotiations in the past, they may well decide to leave it as a 
card up their sleeves for use in the future. 
  On the other hand, Korea and the U.S. need to positively 
consider the deployment of Patriot missiles, as it is designed 
for defense against the North's Scud missiles. It is illogical 
and unreasonable for Pyongyang to voice its opposition to the 
Patriot deployment in the South, while it produces and develops 
offensive missiles. 
  In a nutshell, the suspension of Team Spirit is 
recommendable 
for the present in order to avoid the worst but the Patriot 
missiles are needed as a war deterrent to cope with the erratic 
and unpredictable North. 
  Our side's unlimited concessions at this point could rather 
encourage the defiant North to continue adventurism and 
brinkmanship that are in no one's interests.

  [Excerpt] The UN Security Council [UNSC], which has been 
discussing measures on the North Korean nuclear issue, began an 
unofficial meeting on the afternoon of 30 March (morning of 31 
March Korean time) in preparation for the plenary meeting to be 
held on the afternoon of 31 March (morning of 1 April Korean 
time). 
  The ROK and the United States agreed to a resolution clearly 
stating the deadline for additional inspections on North Korean 
nuclear facilities and discussion for additional measures. 
  Thusfar, the PRC has insisted on replacing the format with a 
UNSC presidential statement and on not including "binding 
articles" in the content. However, it is noteworthy that the 
PRC expressed its position in unofficial negotiations that it 
might partially accept the demand of the ROK and the United 
States if the format of a presidential statement is accepted. 
  Particularly, the PRC implied that rather than "oppose" the 
moves by the ROK and the United States, it may abstain if the 
issue proceeds to a vote thus expressing that they "do not 
support" the measure. [passage omitted]

  [Text] United Nations, March 30 (YONHAP) -- China 
circulated a draft of the U.N. Security Council president's 
statement Wednesday urging North Korea to accept additional 
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The mildly worded draft statement was being offered by 
Beijing, Pyongyang's only remaining major ally, as an 
alternative to a U.S.- drafted resolution on the North Korean 
nuclear dispute. 
  Although the contents of the statement and the resolution 
are 
similar, the Chinese draft does not set a deadline for the IAEA 
director-general to report back to the Security Council on the 
progress of IAEA inspections. 
  The Chinese version also modifies a clause in the draft 
resolution that says the council will consider follow-up 
measures if necessary, changing it to "the council can consider 
the North Korean nuclear problem again if necessary." 
  Meanwhile, the four other permanent members of the Security 
Council -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- 
circulated the U.S.-drafted resolution among all council members 
after they failed to strike a compromise with China on its 
contents. 
  At Wednesday's meeting, China and such non-aligned members 
as 
Pakistan, Rwanda, Nigeria, Oman and Djibouti said they preferred 
that the Security Council adopt the "consensus" formula, which 
calls for the consent of all members. 
  Since this consensus formula means in effect a presidential 
statement, the council was leaning toward adopting the Chinese 
version after modification of its wording, according to sources. 
  The Security Council is expected to hold another informal 
closed-door meeting Thursday (local time) and, depending on the 
outcome of negotiations on the wording, the council could adopt 
a presidential statement the same day. 
  The Chinese representative at the United Nations, Chen Jian, 
told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that an absolute 
majority of Security Council members favored the consensus 
formula. 
  "This is a positive signal that the Security Council would 
adopt a presidential statement," he added. 
  Chen also reaffirmed that China would never go along with a 
resolution, but he gave no indication that he would veto the 
resolution if the council was forced to vote on it. 
  The council president, Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, said 
negotiations between the United States and its allies and China 
will continue as their positions remain far apart.

  [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- The opposition 
Democratic Party [DP] demanded Thursday that the Seoul 
Government immediately recall Ambassador to China Hwang 
Pyong-tae and reshuffle its entire diplomatic and national 
security team. 
  The DP made the demand on the ground that the team has 
created fear and anxiety among the people by pushing an 
inconsistent foreign and national security policy with regard to 
the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, President Kim was 
at the receiving end of persuasion during his visits to Japan 
and China, the DP said. 
  Moreover, the Kim administration's North Korea policy has 
performed another sudden about-face, from a hard-line position 
to a moderate stance. 
  The opposition party, however, acknowledged that it was 
proper for Seoul to have reaffirmed its position on resolving 
the North Korean issue through dialogue. 
  For its part, the DP again made clear it was against 
imposing 
any sanctions on North Korea through the UN Security Council. 
  DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "The president has to carry out 
a clear policy so that the people don't become confused." 
  "It was a very serious matter when the ambassador to China 
and the senior presidential secretary for foreign and national 
security affairs fought in Beijing, causing confusion," Yi said. 
  "If all members of the government's foreign and national 
security policy team are not changed, similar problems will 
continue to occur." 
  DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "Our country was subjected to 
international shame in China when the ambassador and the 
presidential aide publicly squabbled to grab the policy 
initiative." 
  "The government ought to straighten out its wavering policy 
on the North Korean nuclear issue," Pak said. "And it has to 
recall Ambassador Hwang immediately." 
  Hwang, after attending a summit between Presidents Kim and 
Jiang Zemin of China, briefing reporters, said, among other 
things, that Seoul would henceforth consult with Beijing closely 
on the North Korean issue, placing emphasis on China's role in 
the affair. 
  Hwang said China would actively intervene to end the nuclear 
standoff and North Korea would allow additional International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  His remarks were refuted by Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for foreign and national security 
affairs. The Seoul Government has not changed its policy of 
closely coordinating and cooperating with the United States and 
Japan, Chong said. 
  Meanwhile, some members of the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party also criticized the administration for lacking consistency 
in its policy on North Korea. 
  Rep. Chong Che-mun, chairman of the Foreign Affairs and 
National Unification Committee, said Ambassador Hwang's comments 
were uncalled for, especially while the senior presidential 
secretary was in the Chinese capital. 
  "It is all very well and important to cooperate with China, 
but we have not reached the stage where we should shift the base 
of our foreign policy away from the cooperative arrangments 
among Japan, the United States and South Korea," said Rep. Pak 
Chong-su.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] A Russian diplomat in Washington said on 30 March 
that if North Korea is found to have a nuclear weapon, the 
Russian Government will not help North Korea militarily even if 
a Western country, such as the United States, were to take 
military action, such as preventive bombing, against North Korea 
regardless of UN agreement. 
  The Russian diplomat, who requested anonymity, said this in 
an interview with CHUNGANG ILBO that day. He made it clear that 
if North Korean development of nuclear weapons is confirmed, 
Russia will not give assistance to North Korea even if North 
Korea is attacked militarily because such an attack on North 
Korea will not fall under the provisions of the military 
alliance treaty signed between North Korea and the former Soviet 
Union in 1961. 
  The Russian diplomat explained that although the military 
alliance treaty the former Soviet Union signed with North Korea 
is still valid with Russia's succession to the Soviet Union, 
Russia is not required to provide military assistance to North 
Korea when North Korea provokes a war ahead of the other side. 
Thus, Russia will regard confirmation that North Korea has 
developed nuclear weapons as provocation by North Korea, he said.

  [Text] Relevant officials said on 30 March that North 
Korea had closed its trade office, which has so far issued visas 
in Macao. This office was one of the North Korean overseas 
offices dealing with the visa business throughout the world. 
  Since the mid-1970's, North Korea has operated its trade 
office in Macao. The office has received applications for visas 
since 1991. However, it has not disclosed the reason why it 
closed the office.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Moscow agreed to assume 
responsibility for repaying all South Korean loans, including 
commodity and bank loans, to the former Soviet Union at a 
working-level meeting with Seoul that closed here on Tuesday. 
  In November 1992, Russia agreed to repay all commodity loans 
South Korea had extended to the former Soviet Union. 
  But the two countries differed on how and when Russia should 
repay the loans, agreeing only to meet again in the near future. 
  Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol, who headed the 
South Korean delegation to the meeting, said Russia had insisted 
on a moratorium on the loans, refusing to accept South Korea's 
offer to take repayment of the loans in kind, such as in 
industrial materials. 
  South Korea will push for another meeting on the matter in 
May, he added. 
  Russia proposed that South Korea grant a moratorium similar 
to the one provided for under an agreement reached with the 
Paris Club of 19 advanced nations in April last year. 
  But, Korea rejected the proposal, saying it cannot allow a 
Paris-Club-type moratorium since Korea is not a Paris Club 
member. 
  Under the agreement it made with the Paris Club, Russia must 
repay half of the Paris Club nations' loans to the former Soviet 
Union outstanding as of the end of 1992 by September 1993 and 
the rest in five years after a two-year grace period.

<F P=106> [By Kim Song-sik, MAL Editorial Board member: "Outlook on </F>
Phase-Two Reform Fronts Uncertain"] 
  [Text] President Kim declared the "continuation of 
change and reform to strengthen the nation's competitiveness." 
But bureaucrats continue the foot-dragging while the public 
sentiment shifts from expectation to indifference. Where can 
creative energy for transcending the "Kim Yong-sam-style reform" 
be found, and how? 
  Phase One of the Kim Yong-sam administration saw the 
civilian 
president lead the way with reforms based on his initiative and 
carry out the shifting of power within the ruling group to form 
a new clique. Also in this period, we saw a political world 
making little change in both players and in their performance, 
the vested interest groups persisting in obstinate resistance, 
the bureaucrats continuing the foot-dragging, and the public 
mood shifting, psychologically, from expectation to 
indifference. The first-year reforms, while proving successful 
in various sectors, demonstrated the limitations in strength and 
vision. As they encountered the "upheavals from the blitz" and 
the "post-Uruguay Round political crisis," the need for a 
turnabout in the atmosphere proved to be inevitable. 
  As for President Kim, he must be hoping that his second year 
will be a period for him to expand reforms he launched and, at 
the same time, to prepare for major elections to be held 
successively, beginning in 1995. Consequently, the president is 
expected to maintain his initiative through continued reforms in 
specific sectors, such as those in the political, 
administrative, educational and other sectors, rather than the 
sort of reforms that accompany the shifting of power, and at the 
same time to put emphasis on internationalization and the 
revitalization of the economy. In political management, he will 
try to remove elements of political harassment and to 
focus--through a working-type staff--on intensifying his 
administrative push. On the other hand, the overall enhancement 
of economic logic will result in increased pressures on the 
workers. 
  Kim Yong-sam's decision, announced in the New Year news 
conference held on 6 January, to postpone the national 
convention of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] was a 
multipurpose card. In connection with the postponement, media 
described it as if it had added to the importance of Kim 
Chong-pil, DLP chairman. As for Kim Chong-pil, however, who is a 
veteran politician, he must have sensed that it meant nothing 
more than an extension of his unstable political status, for the 
deferment deprived him of an opportunity to bolster his 
influence through a reelection. Furthermore, the decision seeks 
to prevent the election of a new party chairman from triggering 
a full-blown power struggle within the DLP, and the formation of 
a new party leadership from weakening the president's 
centripetal power. Thus, Kim Yong-sam sees a political 
realignment--in whatever form--as premature. 
  The simple patch-up work with the DLP shows President Kim's 
will to continue his way of political management relying on 
Chongwadae staff and cabinet members. The DLP national 
convention was put off, ostensibly, for "sustained changes and 
reforms to build up the nation's economic strength." It actually 
is a move designed not only to suppress elements of political 
harassment within the DLP but to neutralize offensives from the 
opposition, thereby enhancing the cohesiveness of the executive 
power of the president. Needless to say, how it will work out is 
another question. 
  The underlying tone was in evidence in the way the party and 
cabinet reshuffles were carried out. The late-December 
reshuffles and changes of Chongwadae staff could be viewed as 
the deployment to forward positions of figures close to 
President Kim and personalities of the new regime. They included 
Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Kim U-sok, minister of 
construction; So Chong-won, first minister of state; Yi 
Won-chong, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, 
and Mun Chong-su, a member of the former Democratic Party [DP] 
faction in the DLP who was appointed DLP secretary general. Also 
included were many promoted from among Phase-One staff members 
such as Yi Hoe-chang, who was appointed prime minister; Chong 
Chae-sok, director of the Economic Planning Board; Hwang 
Yong-ha, minister of government administration; Yi Pyong-tae, 
minister of national defense, and Kim Yang-pae, minister of 
agriculture and fisheries. An overall view of this new, 
Phase-Two lineup--including those retained from the previous 
lineup such as Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae secretary 
general--suggests that it is not a compromise arrangement but a 
measure giving priority to a setup that puts Kim Yong-sam more 
strongly in charge for an effective exercise of power. 
  Also, the party and cabinet reshuffles seem to be aimed at 
straightening out the present bureaucratic system. The changes 
in administrative posts such as the new Home Affairs Minister 
Choe Hyong-u, Government Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha, 
and Yi Ui-kun, senior presidential secretary for administrative 
affairs, can be seen as a step to deal with the foot-dragging by 
bureaucrats and prepare for the gubernatorial and mayoral 
elections scheduled for next year. While President Kim is 
expected to take some actions for administrative reforms too, as 
he suggested in his New Year news conference, he seems to be 
also planning to use the local elections for a major step to 
correct the hardened arteries of the nation's officialdom. 
  Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong, 
previously regarded as an influential person, was placed on 
"political probation." While it is in part an aspect of the 
power game within the DP faction, the development demonstrates 
President Kim's firm will to tolerate no potential elements that 
could weaken the president's power. Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong's 
comeback is of course possible but the fact that his associates, 
including some personalities of the 6.3 generation, were left 
out from the new lineup are full of suggestions, in many ways. 
  Put simply, through the reshuffles and the decision to 
postpone the DLP national convention, the president let his 
strong will not to let go of his political centripetal power and 
his political initiative be known. However, the moves were 
passive and defensive ones in nature, rather than positive and 
offensive. As some called it "the DP-faction regime," they were 
tantamount to rearrangements of the line of battle inside the 
closed circuits of the president's men. 
  The moves were made against the backdrops of the 
successes--and limitations--of reforms that were pushed on last 
year, and of the sociopolitical dynamical relationships as 
unveiled in that process. The series of reforms carried out in 
1993 were in fact remarkably successful for the original 
limitations surrounding the regime, thanks largely to the will 
of the president and expectations of the people. Powers were 
restructured through the public disclosures of property owned by 
high officials, the successive audit-and-inspection probes, the 
by-elections, the rush of personnel changes, as well as the 
presidential decree outlawing the uses of aliases or borrowed 
names in financial transactions; as a result, President Kim 
succeeded in dismantling the political military leadership that 
had been the core of power in this country. However, except for 
securing power in the very core of government and implementing 
partial reshuffles in several departments, he failed to deliver 
fundamental reorganizations of power and politics. The fate of 
the probe into property owned by public officials that ended in 
an anticlimax, and the proposed amendments to political laws 
that failed to be acted on, demonstrated this reality 
symbolically. 
  President Kim, preparing for his second year in power under 
such circumstances, had these options: arriving at some 
power-sharing compromises with the vested interest groups; on 
the contrary, bringing in pro-reform forces from outside to 
expand his reform hegemony; or putting off such political 
maneuvers until the political season of candidate endorsing for 
the scheduled elections and, for now, strengthening his direct 
exercise of power through aides close to him. He chose the last 
option, as seen in the party and cabinet reshuffles. The action 
is, of course, based on the consideration that this is the only 
election-free year of his tenure, but it also reflects the 
present situation where the power balance is not in favor of an 
immediate settlement of a political deadlock and where the time 
is not ripe for it either. In the final analysis, the recent 
reshuffles were made not in the direction of expanding the 
reform hegemony, involving either vested interest groups or 
pro-reform forces, but took the form of placing the president's 
men in forward positions; therefore, it became difficult to 
expect an expansion, horizontal or downward, of the power base. 
This also means that there will come a time sooner or later when 
the existing human resources for replacements will be exhausted. 
Considering these factors, it is more appropriate to view the 
recent reshuffles as a passive defense of the existing front 
than as an expression of President Kim's self-confidence. 
  It can be said that Phase One was dedicated, basically, to 
political reforms to liquidate military rule and 
authoritarianism, reforms to end irrationalities in the 
financial and other branches, and to the New Growth economic 
line. The broad framework defining the nature and depth of 
future reforms is not likely to surpass that of the Phase One 
program. However, things noteworthy will be: In his push for 
administrative and educational reforms, how successful will the 
president be in overcoming the reactions of the vested 
interested groups? And what kind of social tensions will the 
pressures on the workers from various internationalization 
programs create? Some observe that a breakthrough in North-South 
Korea relations may emerge as a political factor; however, while 
there may come some partial improvements in relations, it is 
difficult to expect an epoch-making change. After all, the speed 
and intensity of specific reforms will be fluid, not fixed, 
depending on the outcome of competition and cooperation between 
the forces involved. Although big-size reforms on the 
second-year agenda will be fewer than in the first year, the 
offensive and defensive battles will intensify between forces 
over specific reforms--and over how the turf boundaries, left 
ambiguous by the first-year reforms, should be reestablished. 
  I referred, in the opening part of this article, to the 
political world with little change, with the same players 
playing in the same fashion, be it the ruling camp or the 
opposition; the obstinate resistance of the vested interest 
groups; the continued foot-dragging of bureaucrats, and to the 
mood of the public shifting psychologically from expectation to 
indifference. Over the period from the Yellow Sea ferry disaster 
to the furor over the opening of the rice market, we saw 
President Kim's initiative running into difficulties everywhere, 
and a strange mood of indifference proliferating in public 
opinion. It can be said that the Phase One reforms actually 
entered a new critical stage immediately after the financial 
reform--"the reform of all reforms"--was put into effect. 
  As asserted by many, it is true that this situation 
basically 
stemmed from the limitations inherent in the Kim Yong-sam 
government, but such rhetoric alone cannot solve the problem. In 
fact, we see more fundamental limitations with the reform 
capabilities and the vision of our whole society, do we not? 
Debates merely highlighting "the limitations of the president" 
can be a way of political offensive but they do not serve the 
purpose of finding a way for true, in-depth reforms. And it is 
the task of history unaffected by personal interests of any 
individuals that our society needs overall reforms and that they 
have to be more thoroughgoing ones than the Kim Yong-sam-style 
reforms. Criticisms against the ruling party can be effective 
only when backed up by counterproposals superior to theirs 
instead of indulging in faultfinding. A look at the various 
difficulties confronting the reform program shows that we cannot 
afford to sweep everything under the carpet by blaming it on the 
"original sin of the three-party merger" and that we ourselves 
have a great deal of homework to do, namely, self-reforms in 
various fields. 
  So, we will examine a few points in this respect, from the 
viewpoint of how to revitalize the reform capabilities of the 
entire society, let alone the conservative, vested interest 
groups whose ears are "deaf to any preaching." 
  Let's begin with problems inside the civil society. De 
Tocqueville and many scholars after him maintained that the 
civil society is the very stronghold of democracy. Despite 
degrees of difference, the latest line of debate on democracy 
basically holds that we should revitalize the independent, 
critical energy of civil society and intervene in the coming 
onslaught of the logic of power and economy with the principle 
of democracy, forcefully and to the maximum degree. 
  Democratization has become the general trend since the June 
Uprising despite turns and twists. Progress in democratization 
means the process of ending the suffocation of civil society at 
the hands of state power. As democracy advances, the days of 
almighty state power are fading into the past, giving way to an 
era in which the civil society has a distinct role of checking 
antireform reactions of the vested interest groups. 
  However, our civil society today lies in a state of "too 
much 
money power and too little citizen power." In other words, 
vacancies created by the retreating state power are being filled 
not by the sound citizen power but by the exorbitant money 
power. Furthermore, forums and media are largely in the grip of 
established journalism which is weak in its consciousness of 
history and not positive for reform (and is even conservative). 
The logic of citizens for establishing their autonomous, 
collective identity is suffocating under the pressures of 
parochialism and built-in connections, which make rational 
judgment itself impossible. The creative energy of citizens is 
far from being revitalized. 
  Viewing the present situation in this light, we find that 
the 
overall strengthening of the reform fronts through self-reforms 
of the civil society and struggles against the vested interest 
groups entrenched in it, along with the unity of the sound 
energy of the civil society, is our major task. And social 
movements, precisely, provide opportunities for positive 
demonstrations of the autonomous energy and critical power of 
the civil society. There is a need to further develop diverse 
citizen movements, including environmental, consumer, women's, 
civic legislation, media reform, human rights, watch-parliament, 
and political reform movements and movements for economic 
justice, as well as the traditional mass movements such as labor 
and peasant movements. To that end, the government should lift 
not only economic controls but also various other restraints on 
social movements. 
  At the same time, each social movement should make 
self-reforms to ensure support and participation by a majority 
of the people. This process involves the abilities of 
self-reflection and solidarity, including those to reexamine 
one's own vision, stamp out factional vestiges, renew the sense 
of responsibility toward the state and the times, and to wage 
criticism backed up by alternatives. Also, it is necessary to do 
away with the way of thinking that what a certain person says or 
what a certain group does is always right or always wrong, and 
to develop maturity in perception so that we can weigh any 
specific position on its merit. In particular, it is important 
in this period of transition that in countering the resistance 
of vested interest groups, we actively focus on pending reform 
issues. 
  Without changes in the political power and political camps, 
social movements alone have their limitations, in many ways. 
Speaking of political camps, the problems are far more serious. 
Earlier in this article, I pointed out that President Kim 
employed a stop-gap policy toward the ruling camp to preserve 
his centripetal power. 
  The opposition party did the same thing. While the viability 
of Chairman Yi Ki-taek and his faction in the Democratic Party 
remains a question, it also appears difficult for the 
increasingly visible "nonmainstream alliance," led by 
Assemblyman Kim Sang-hyon and Supreme Committee members Yi 
Pu-yong and No Mu-hyon, to free itself from the magnetic field 
of Kim Tae-chung, the former party chairman. Thus, the two-Kim 
era is still on. With a view to keeping their own political 
influence from being weakened, the two Kims are deliberately 
preventing a new leadership from emerging. To make it worse, the 
TK [Taegu-Kyongsang] force says it will carry on the "Taegu 
sentiment," while the Sinjong Party of Assemblyman Pak 
Chan-chong is trying to take advantage of anti-DLP, 
anti-Democratic Party feelings and fish in troubled waters. From 
all this, we can reconfirm a political world in which reforms 
are being stalled because of the same old regional political 
turfs. The Kim Yong-sam administration has entered its second 
year, with no change at all in this respect. 
  A political landscape like this renders it impossible to 
promote a productive competition between a reform plan and its 
alternative. President Kim emphatically stated that his 
administration will seek justice based on facts and promote 
pragmatic well-being. For now, success with the policies is 
difficult to expect, however. They are bound to end up in 
unproductive skirmishes between political forces; moreover, they 
will basically impede the development of a desirable public 
opinion structure in our society. Furthermore, the continued 
presence of the regional political turfs means that there will 
be unopposed elections in many districts once candidates obtain 
party endorsements. Government for the people is simply 
impossible under such circumstances. It also means that the 
rooms are extremely narrow for both the ruling and opposition 
camps to bring in fresh forces from outside. This would even 
disrupt the normal relationships among the state, the political 
communities and the civil society, and we will see only reports 
of the political sphere's foul power games fill up the pages of 
the media. As long as that sort of situation continues, the 
nonresponse of the majority of our people to President Kim's 
reform program--and to the activities of the political 
world--will also continue. 
  The nation's political sector remains least competitive of 
all in this era of internationalization. The problem is that the 
range of possible reform within the established political world 
is extremely narrow. This raises the question: Should we remain 
a spectator to the power games that continue to be waged over 
parochial interests--or pry the established political world with 
a lever of realignment from outside? The civil society is indeed 
faced with the dual tasks to further elevate the levels of its 
movements on one hand and, on the other, to form new political 
forces to usher in a truly new era. This is not to say that the 
established political world should be shunned in its entirety, 
but that there is a need to first establish a leadership to 
speed up its reforms and changes and lead it in a desirable 
direction. 
  What is truly needed at this point of time is a challenge 
and 
practice to bring an end to the era of epigones, rather than 
commentaries on the same old things. If we should seek a career 
in the shadow of existing authority or be content with peace 
within our private castle, we can neither open the horizon of 
reform forcefully nor produce a dignified political leadership 
worthy of a transition period. The need to transcend the era of 
epigones is not confined to political practices. The roaring 
tide of the transition period demands that the administration, 
the legislature, the judicature, businesses, schools, research 
institutes, media, citizen movements and all other organizations 
launch sweeping reform drives. The political world may be adrift 
as it is, but our society, having no surpluses of time and 
resources, cannot afford to delay those reforms in any specific 
sectors. In conclusion, let me add that I firmly believe that 
each and every sector has its reformists with true passions.

  [Text] Reports about the readiness of the Royal Government 
of Cambodia [RGC] and the Khmer Rouge to attend a meeting were 
heard while fighting was underway in northwestern Cambodia. Now 
there is a report that Khieu Samphan is prepared to return to 
Phnom Penh. 
  In Sopheap, the Democratic Kampuchea representative in Phnom 
Penh, has said: We are prepared to meet to solve this problem. 
Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC, was quoted as 
saying on 28 March that the government is leaving the door open 
for talks with the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, Prince Kromkhun 
Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs, said in Bangkok on 28 March: I hope the Khmer Rouge 
will listen to the advice of the king father of the nation and 
sit down at the negotiating table. 
  It is worth recalling that Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut 
recently informed domestic and international reporters of the 
king's desire to see national reconciliation among Cambodians 
and an end to the bloodshed. 
  While the conflicting parties' intent to reach a peaceful 
solution is being heard, there is also a rumor that Khieu 
Samphan, the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, will soon return 
to Phnom Penh. The Democratic Kampuchea official did not 
confirm or deny this report. 
  It is known that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and the 
queen will return to Phnom Penh on 8 April. Prince Kromkhun 
Norodom Sirivut says he hopes that talks with the Khmer Rouge 
will resume at that time. 
  The talks have been adjourned since mid-January following a 
series of futile talks between First Prime Minister Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Khieu Samphan. Nevertheless, 
Samdech Hun Sen has said: Our position remains unchanged. We 
are keeping the door open and are considering the possibility of 
such a meeting when the king returns. 
  Khieu Samphan's whereabouts are currently unknown. A 
military source, however, has disclosed that Pol Pot is staying 
in Kum Rieng village, only a few kilometers north of Pailin. He 
fled Pailin two days before the stronghold fell to the 
government.

be shipped to join their troops in Pailin, at the Kompong 
Chhnang provincial airfield. On 28 March, the people and 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] attacked and 
dispersed the forces, killing nine enemy soldiers and wounding 
more than 10 others. We also destroyed over 10 assorted 
armaments, two control posts, three military buildings, and some 
war materiel. 
  On 28 March, the people and NADK attacked the position of a 
company, which is part of the invading forces in Pailin. We 
killed five enemy soldiers, wounded three, and captured another, 
and seized 15 AK and an AR-15 assault rifles.

  [Text] Here is a continued report on the Pailin 
battlefield from 26, 27, 28, and 29 March: 
  I. On 26 March, the people and National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] further attacked the invading forces. Some 
continued to cut the enemies' throats: 1. from Suosdei to 
Pailin; 2. from Suosdei to Krek; 3. from Phnum Kon Damrei to 
Sala Krau; and 4. completely cutting off the invading forces' 
transport lines from Kamping Puoy and Kap Chen and along the 
Mongkolborei River. Others were split into groups to attack the 
invading forces in many areas -- they especially attacked the 
forces moving along the roads, including tanks and ground 
troops, causing them to sustain constant damage. 
  In sum, the situation on 26 March was that the people and 
NADK initiated attacks on the invading forces by cutting their 
throats, smashing their ground forces to pieces, and attacking 
their tanks one after another, causing them to lose control 
gradually in the perimeters or traps of Sala Krau and Pailin. 
  II. On 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK continued to 
attack the invading forces. Some continued to cut off the 
forces' narrow transport lines, in particular the routes linking 
Suosdei and Pailin, Suosdei and Treng, and Phnum Kon Damrei and 
Sala Krau. As for other roads, they were completely cut off, 
causing the invading forces to lose control. Those in Sala Krau 
and Pailin were surrounded by the people and NADK from all 
directions. In this situation, the people and NADK attacked the 
invading forces in many areas, including those in Pailin, Sala 
Krau, and along the inner roads. We attacked both the ground 
troops and tanks. 
  On 27 and 28 March, the salient situation was that the 
invading forces began to lose control gradually: 
  1. They could not supply fuel, ammunition, and foodstuffs; 
  2. An increasing number of them were afflicted with Malaria 
and typhoid and there was no medicine for treatment; 
  3. Soldiers, especially new recruits, continued to break 
ranks in large numbers, making the invading forces extremely 
short of troops. They were not even able to occupy the tiny 
town of Pailin, the size of which is one square kilometer. They 
ordered hundreds of their troops in Pailin and Sala Krau to 
defend the two areas, but they were not able to because they 
were constantly attacked by the people and NADK. 
  In sum, on 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK killed 67 
invading soldiers and wounded over 70 others. They also 
destroyed 40 assorted guns and seized 27 others. There was a 
significant decrease in the activities of cannons -- during 
these two days only a few rounds were fired. Tanks hardly dared 
carry out activities; they only protected the invading forces' 
bases. As for military leaders of the communist Vietnamese 
puppets and two-headed government, they lamented in their 
conversations over the difficult situation; the lack of 
ammunition, food supplies, fuel, and medicine; and about the 
malaria and diarrhea problem. Some soldiers defied commanders' 
orders to fight in this or that area, while others said they 
could no longer stay and asked for a transfer. This is because 
if the troops, commanders, and tanks remained, they would be 
smashed to pieces. 
  It is worth pointing out that within the perimeters of Sala 
Krau and Pailin, the invading forces can only conduct their 
operations with tanks, which were used as both combat forces and 
as a means of transport. As for the ground troops, many of them 
were killed and wounded every day. This situation terrified the 
tanks because they had no ground support and no other vehicles 
joined them in carrying out operations. As such, there was a 
gradual decrease in the tanks' activities, causing the spirit of 
the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government 
troops, which rely on tanks, to increasingly tumble. Moreover, 
the continued rain downpours caused the invading forces to 
become more terrified because it was extremely difficult for the 
ground troops to move or to carry supplies from this or that 
area. This was due to, on the one hand, the slippery and muddy 
ground and, on the other, mines and attacks constantly mounted 
by the people and NADK to cut them into several segments. 
  III. On 29 March, the people and NADK initiated an assault 
on the invading forces. In particular, they: 
  1. Continued to cut off their supply lines; 
  2. Attacked Sala Krau from three directions -- the east, 
north, and west. 
  In the fighting on the afternoon of 29 March, the people and 
NADK destroyed two tanks and damaged two others, and they killed 
more than 40 enemy soldiers and wounded over 60 others. On 29 
March, it was the beginning of a new battle scene within the 
perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin in a situation where the 
invading forces' throat was completely cut. From now on, it 
will be fighting inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin 
only. It is a battle inside a trap where the invading forces 
are encircled from all directions and completely cut off. 
  The situation which has developed every day until 29 March 
has more clearly demonstrated that: 
  1. The invading forces are unable to occupy Pailin. This is 
in accordance with the concrete situation and also predictions 
and assessments made by international observers since the 
beginning of the attack on Pailin by the invading forces. 
  2. Cutting the invading forces' throat and the beginning of 
the battle inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin, 
especially on 29 March, show that the time for the people and 
NADK to force the invading forces out of the Pailin region is 
nearing rapidly.

  [Text] On 28 March, the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK], in cooperation with the people, launched a 
commando attack on the Sala Krau position, killing seven enemy 
soldiers and seizing seven AK assault rifles. The remaining 
enemy troops were forced to retreat into the jungle. 
  On 29 March, the NADK attacked the 12th Division, which was 
temporarily stationed at Sala Krau. The fighting lasted five 
and a half hours. While the NADK was attacking the unit, four 
T-54 tanks and 200 ground troops were sent to help their 
companions. However, we killed 24 of them and wounded several 
others. We also burned two T-54 tanks, captured two others, and 
destroyed two military trucks. We also recaptured and reoccupied 
the summit of Srang Hill. We will continue to attack and 
destroy the remaining enemy troops at Sala Krau.

  [Text] On 28 and 29 March, the people joined forces with 
the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] in assaults 
against the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets 
and two-headed government that had gathered at the Moung 
District township and the railway station to be shipped to the 
Pailin battlefield. 
  The communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities had 
gathered their invading forces from diverse areas in Moung 
District at the district's township and railway station, from 
where they were to be sent as reinforcements to the Pailin 
region. When the people learned about this, they joined hands 
with the NADK to attack and disperse the soldiers. As a result, 
we killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded more than 40 others. 
Taking that opportunity, many soldiers freshly recruited by the 
communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities fled for home. 
The people and NADK also destroyed five barracks, eight 
vehicles, and 300 meters of railroad. 
  On the same day, the people and NADK attacked and destroyed 
the communist Vietnamese puppet' invading forces. They 
regrouped at Bakan District's township of Trapeang Chong on 
Route National 5, killing 17 enemy soldiers and wounding more 
than 20 others. 
  The state authorities of the communist Vietnamese puppets 
and 
two-headed government in Moung District and at Trapeang Chong 
were terrified and fled for their lives. Some run away to the 
Pursat provincial town, while others hid themselves at Boeng 
Khna in Svay Don Kev. 
  National Route 5 and the railway lines have been cut off 
since 28 and 29 March.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 30 (KPL) -- Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] National Assembly President Saman 
Vi-gnaket, on March 28 evening, hosted a banquet in honour of 
his Malaysian counterpart Tan Sri Datuk Mohamed Zahir bin Haji 
Ismail and his party. 
  At the banquet, the Lao National Assembly president and the 
speaker of the Malaysian House of Representatives exchanged 
speeches describing the growing Lao-Malaysian relations. Other 
Lao National Assembly members and senior government officials 
attended the function. 
  In his speech, Saman Vi-gnaket expressed his belief that the 
successful visit to Laos by the high-level delegation of the 
Malaysian House of Representatives would further strengthen the 
friendly traditional relations between Laos and Malaysia as well 
as between the two legislative bodies. He said the result of 
the visit is a gain of the common effort by the people of the 
two countries, and the personal effort of the Malaysian speaker 
of the house. 
  He also said: Laos and Malaysia are in the same region, and 
have always mutually supported and enjoyed good relations of 
friendship and neighbourly cooperation. The people of the two 
nations have shared similarities in their characters and 
languages. They love peace, freedom, progress and justice, have 
no wish to interfere in other countries' affairs. Malaysia is a 
country within the Nonaligned Movement that observes the 
principles and goals of the movement. This has made the people 
of the two countries understand and trust one another. 
  Saman Vi-gnaket was pleased with the achievements the 
Malaysian Government and people have scored in their national 
development, and thanked them for their support, assistance to 
Laos in the task of national salvation in the past as well as 
that of national development at present. 
  The speaker of the Malaysian House on Representatives 
reciprocated by saying in his speech that he was impressed by 
the Buddha images, especially the earthen one of the sixth 
century, he saw while visiting the Emerald Buddha Shine. They 
served as an evidence of Laos' capability in art works, as well 
as its long history and civilization. 
  He said that they were pleased at seeing that the two 
countries had enjoyed a close relationship and we had tried to 
help one another. He added that Malaysia was ready to provide 
education and training opportunities in Malaysia for Lao 
students. 
  He also said that Laos was implementing its five-year 
development plan for 1991-95 and that the Constitution endorsed 
in 1991 guaranteed commercial production, private properties and 
private investment by both locals and foreigners. Besides 
hydro-power and mineral resources, he said, Laos was abundant 
with other natural resources. All the potentials will lead the 
country to a bright future, he added. 
  The head of the Malaysian delegation also said that in the 
next few weeks, the prime minister of Malaysia will make his 
first visit to Laos to further strengthen relationship and 
friendship between the two countries. The prime minister's 
delegation will include many Malaysian businessmen, who will 
identify economic investment in Laos. He hoped this visit would 
help bring the two people closer to each other. He also invited 
the Lao National Assembly president and its members to visit 
Malaysia soon.

  [Text] Vietnam has rejected Cambodia's request for weapons 
parts and ammunition to replace dwindling stocks used in the 
Cambodian government's offensive against Khmer Rouge bases at 
Anlong Veng and Pailin. A well-placed source said yesterday 
Hanoi "took note" of the request but made no commitment because 
it does not want to be seen as associating with any one 
Cambodian party. The source close to the leadership here said 
Vietnam also wished to avoid accusations of interfering in 
Cambodia's internal affairs. 
  The request was put forward by Cambodian co-defence 
ministers 
Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat in talks here Tuesday. 
  "Vietnam has to be very cautious," said the source. Hanoi 
has enough worries with domestic problems. He said the 
Cambodian defence ministers sought spare parts and ammunition 
for weapons ranging from machineguns to artillery pieces. The 
Cambodian ministers reportedly approached Laos before coming to 
Hanoi, but the Laotians did not oblige. 
  As fellow recipients of military supplies from the former 
Soviet Union, Laos and Vietnam are the only possible sources of 
resupply for the Cambodian army. But Laos and Vietnam only have 
what they describe as "self-sufficient" reserves. 
  The Cambodian defence ministers yesterday morning left Hanoi 
for Ho Chi Minh City where they were to meet with the commander 
of Army Region 7 and the region bordering Cambodia. 
  The disclosure coincided with Hanoi's decision for Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet to go ahead with a planned visit to 
Cambodia. Mr Kiet is to arrive in Phnom Penh on Saturday and 
return to Ho Chi Minh City the next day. Mr Kiet will be

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet by Nguyen Ngoc </F>
Truong, TUAN BAO QUOC TE editor in chief; place and date not 
given: "Foreign Policy in the Period of Renovation"] 
  [Text] In 1993, our country's international 
activities yielded important results. In 1994, Vietnam enters 
a crucial year of renovation and development. Following is an 
interview by TUAN BAO QUOC TE with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on 
a series of issues, namely, the outstanding features of the new 
diplomacy, the key aspects of foreign policy in 1994, and what 
is new in the investment policy. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] May we ask you to evaluate our 
country's 
international activities in the past year? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] Our country's international activities in 1993 
took place in a very rich manner and in many fields -- 
political, economic, cultural, and physical education and 
sports -- and realistically served our goals of peace, 
independence, and development for the sake of prosperous people, 
strong country, and civilized society. The results of these 
activities have contributed to enhancing Vietnam's international 
posture and have favorably allowed us to pursue the economic and 
political goals of our foreign policy in the coming years. 
  The leaders of other countries and international friends 
whom 
I had a chance to meet all advocated Vietnam's foreign policy 
and highly evaluated our renovation. The fact that the country 
was being developed in a stable manner and important 
socioeconomic achievements were being made in the renovation 
effort in recent years served as a basis for our country's big 
advantage in its international activities. Reality has 
affirmed that the domestic and foreign line and policies we are 
developing are correct and suitable for the present trend and 
allow our country to move forward along with other nations in 
the region and in the modern world. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What are the outstanding facts in these 
activities? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] We were walking steadily with both feet: 
building the multifaceted cooperation relations with our 
neighboring countries and countries in the region, and 
diversifying the international relations, including relations 
with the big countries and political and economic centers in the 
world. The good relations we had with the region created 
favorable conditions for us when our country extended relations 
to other parts of the world. At the same time, the fact that we 
had diversified and multilateral relations and had retained the 
traditional relations with the countries that had been 
cooperating with and supporting us created even more favorable 
conditions for us within the region. The efforts to consolidate 
our relations with neighbors and countries in the region were 
linked with the policy of diversifying international relations. 
An important aspect of our diplomatic activities was economic. 
Thus our international activities were both profound and broad, 
were aimed at central and important points, and best served our 
national construction and defense. These could be considered the 
peculiar and new aspects of Vietnamese diplomacy. 
  I would like to add that while we were developing the 
above-mentioned moves, we also did our very best to strengthen 
the friendship and cooperation relations with our traditional 
friends and wholeheartedly supported the struggles of the people 
of other countries for national independence and social 
progress. This fact reflected the principled character of 
Vietnam's indivisible foreign policy and also conformed to the 
Vietnamese people's profound international sentiment. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Can we call what you have just 
mentioned 
the foreign policy of the period of renovation? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] The years and months of the struggle for 
national liberation had given birth to the revolutionary 
diplomacy combining national strength with the strength of the 
era and making great contributions to glorious feats of arms, 
such as the liberation of the South and the reunification of the 
fatherland. The diplomacy of the revolutionary period of 
national liberation had inherited and absorbed the quintessence 
of the millennial diplomacy of national defense and 
construction, and at the same time had been raised by the 
brilliant diplomat, Ho Chi Minh, to the height of the diplomacy 
of the era. This inheritance and development was the law of 
social movement. 
  On the other hand, any foreign policy is determined by an 
actual historical ciscumstance. The world diplomacy is moving 
from one stage to another. The international situation is 
undergoing quick changes, with the grouping of new political and 
economic forces. Vietnam is an underdeveloped country having 
not so vast a land area and average economic potential but it is 
situated in a region that enjoys the most dynamic economic 
development in the world and includes many countries with strong 
economies and important political positions. From now until 
1995 the economies of Asia may reach an average growth of 7 
percent while the world as a whole cannot surpass the rate of 
growth of 2 percent. In and outside of the region, both 
politicians and businessmen are urgently making adjustments to 
accommodate the Pacific Era in the 21st century. 
  The foreign policy of our country is entering a new stage 
switching from serving the national liberation struggle to 
serving the renovation, and, in facing the task of contributing 
to the renovation of the country, setting foreign policy 
guidelines and goals for the immediate and long terms by winning 
more friends and having fewer foes, in accordance with Ho Chi 
Minh thought, and by adopting lively and flexible conduct and 
counteracting formulas. Even in this process, the party and 
state everyday must handle many complex international issues, 
which require that we apply principles and tactics in a correct 
and timely manner in order to gain advantages for the country 
and people and to conform to the common trend. I would need 
more time to review the rich reality, but I think that the new 
foreign policy is capable of combining the national character, 
the traditional diplomacy, and the characteristics of the era. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What is the focus of foreign policy 
activities in 1994? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] In 1993, the process of our country 
normalizing 
and expanding its international relations was basically 
completed. In the years to follow, we need to consolidate and 
raise the quality of these relations and pay attention to the 
key locations. Our political and diplomatic activities must be 
strongly aimed at economic aspects and serve the economic goals 
that have been set. This is not only the work of the 
foreign-affairs organs of the party and state but also the 
responsibility of all sectors and echelons, and has to do with 
the development of cooperation programs in many fields in our 
country. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What about the economic focus of 
foreign 
policy? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] In the last few years, thanks to our policy of 
openness, we were able to attract a large volume of foreign 
investment, to step up exporting, and to some extent to resolve 
the budgetary difficulties regarding sources of revenue and 
mobilizing capital investment for the national economy. In 
1994, we need to continue to increase export by 20 percent, by 
25 percent in 1995, along with gradually improving the 
allocation of export goods, to return to the traditional markets 
in Russia and Eastern Europe, and to have access to new markets. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Please let us know the new aspects of 
the 1994 investment policy. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] The country is entering a new period of 
development. We must attain a rate of growth no less than 8 
percent per year and work hard to double the 1990 GDP level by 
the year 2000. To do so we must have a lot of capital. We have 
been paying attention to mobilizing the sources of domestic 
capital. In the last 3 years, the total investment in 
development came close to 70,000 billion dong; the projected 
total in the next two years will amount to 90,000 billion dong. 
This way we will be able to achieve the goal set for domestic 
capital investment for the years of 1991-1995. However, a lot of 
idle capital exists in the population. In 1993, we were able to 
mobilize only less than one-half of the people's 
capital-contributing capacity. The government is urgently 
drafting a law on domestic investment. 
  About foreign capital, there has been a major gain due to a 
breakthrough in the establishment of our relations with 
international financial and monetary organizations, with the 
ability to acquire capital and then expand new industries. The 
countries and international organizations that participated in 
the International Financial Assistance Conference held in Paris 
have agreed to grant us loans under favored conditions totaling 
1.86 billion dollars in the 1993-1994 fiscal year. The official 
aid for development from a number of industrialized countries 
also has greatly increased. Direct private foreign investment 
continues to increase quickly. The total of such capital being 
put to actual use in 1993 amounted to $800 million, nearly twice 
the total in 1992. However, in the present stage, the ability 
to get foreign capital greatly depends on our ability to accept 
and use it effectively in our country. Therefore, we will give 
priority to investment projects aimed at improving our 
infrastructure, processed goods for export, and manufacturing 
sectors, which will help to resolve the unemployment problem. 
  On this occasion, I congratulate TUAN BAO QUOC TE for being 
published for the first time. As the country is being 
renovated, the press needs to be renovated and modernized. 
  [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Thank you, Mister Prime Minister.

  [Text] The Ho Chi Minh City Fatherland Front Committee held 
a get-together yesterday morning with Catholic fathers and 
clergymen and Catholic representatives to brief them on some new 
developments in the city in connection with current religious 
issues. Over 100 delegates attended, including Catholic 
fathers; heads of various religious orders; clergymen; and 
representatives of the city Catholic Unity Committee, Papal 
Nuncio office, various seminaries, and district and precinct 
Catholic committees. 
  Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh, chairman of the city front committee, 
gave a briefing on the results of the midterm national party 
conference as well as past achievements by our party and people 
in the economic, political, cultural, and social domains. 
  On the current religious situation, Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh 
said: 
It is the policy of our party and state to respect our Catholic 
compatriots' freedom of religion and encourage them to lead a 
life useful to both the region and the people so as to help 
build the country. Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh is a clergyman 
with a high sense of nationalism. He leads an ethical life and 
is highly popular. He has made positive contributions for the 
betterment of Catholic activities in Ho Chi Minh City. 
Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh's ecclesiastical and nationalist 
lines have been followed by a large number of Catholics. 
  Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh also informed the audience of the 
positive results obtained in a meeting between the government 
Religious Affairs Committee and a representative of the Vatican 
Holy See during the Vatican delegation's recent visit to 
Vietnam. This is a welcome sign for the Catholic compatriots in 
the city to feel peace of mind so they can lead a 
Gospel-directed life within national bounds.

<F P=106> [Statement by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh to </F>
TUAN BAO QUOC TE reporter: "National Assembly Is Directly 
Responsible..."] 
  [Text] National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh has 
made a statement to the TUAN BAO QUOC TE reporter on the changes 
in the activities of Vietnam's legislative organ. 
<H5>  The National Assembly belongs to all strata of the </H5>
population. 
  Unlike in Vietnam, other countries do not have superior 
monks 
and bishops in their national assemblies. Vietnam's National 
Assembly brings together representatives of all strata of the 
working population in society. The national assemblies of 
other countries assemble political forces in society, which 
include rightist, leftist, and communist parties. For instance, 
there are no representatives of Buddhists in their national 
assemblies. 
  Our National Assembly now must decide things for itself, for 
nobody else makes these decisions for it. Whether its 
decisions are right or wrong, it must be responsible for them to 
the people. The budget is insufficient. Whereas in other 
countries the national assemblies will be removed if they fail 
to fulfill their responsibilities to the constituents, this does 
not happen in our country yet. However, as it represents all 
strata of the masses in society, Vietnam's National Assembly has 
the foundation on which it can make sure that its decisions 
serve the interests of society as a whole. 
<H5>  The National Assembly contributes to foreign policy </H5>
successes. 
  In late October 1993, a delegation of the National Assembly 
visited many countries in eastern and northwestern Europe. 
National assemblies are the organs that ratify the agreements 
of governments. Through contacts, legislators understand one 
another better and create favorable conditions for the 
implementation of the agreements that have been signed. The 
bilateral and multilateral activities that our National Assembly 
has taken part in would facilitate the implementation of the 
agreements among governments. 
  The timing of the delegation's tour -- the end of October 
1993 -- was also very beneficial. That was the time when the 
national assemblies of those countries discussed their budget 
and the major policies for 1994. Through exchanges of views, 
the national assemblies of other countries seemed to have a good 
understanding of Vietnam's renovation and to lend their support 
and encouragement to increasing investment in Vietnam. 
<H5>  To apply the experiences of other countries' national </H5>
assemblies. 
  In our recent visit in a number of countries, we exchanged 
with their national assemblies our experience in the legislative 
process. We have just begun to do legislative work, which 
other countries have been doing for a long time. The question 
that was raised was how to make laws and how to organize the 
supporting machinery in order to allow it to work effectively. 
In all other countries, legislators are professional people, 
but they are not in Vietnam. This is why when we apply other 
countries' experiences, we must consider Vietnam's actual 
conditions. 
  We will step by step improve the activities of specialized 
committees. Right in the current session, the evaluating 
reports of our committees are judged as being of very good 
quality. Our committees will be strengthened and given more 
specialized work. The supporting component must be made better 
and stronger so as to carry on its work of assisting the 
National Assembly sessions and preparing documents for the 
deputies to read and study in advance. We will also reorganize 
the Office of the National Assembly; improve the ways to 
organize offices, committees, and scientific research libraries 
in regard to jurisdictional issues; and provide the Office of 
the National Assembly with additional modern means.

<F P=106> [Article by Huy Duc] </F>
  [Text] At his press conference on 6 January 1994, Minister 
Le Xuan Trinh answered a number of questions asked by reporters: 
  [Father Truong Ba Can, editor in chief of CONG GIAO VA DAN 
TOC] Many publications in the city and at the central echelon 
have proposed rebuilding the statute and rehabilitating the name 
of Alexandre de Rhodes. Why hasn't the government said anything 
about this? 
  [Trinh] The government has read those articles and is paying 
attention to this. But because this is an historical and 
scientific problem, we must study the matter and get the views 
of more scientists. That is why the government has not yet 
responded to this. 
  [Reporter for Vietnam TV] How will major cases of corruption 
be handled? We welcome the fact that the government has 
"allowed" Vietnam TV's leadership board to "retire." But why did 
it take so long to deal with the negative acts of these people? 
  [Trinh] Corruption has been dealt with too slowly as 
compared 
with the needs and hopes of the masses. The premier, too, is 
unhappy about this. But the government is not the only one 
involved in handling a case. This must be coordinated with the 
organs of control and the courts. Unfortunately, this 
coordination has long been sluggish. 
  There has been corruption at Vietnam TV for a long time. 
Actually, it would have been better if we had dealt with those 
things sooner. But in dealing with cadres at that level and with 
such an important sector, we have to get the ideas of the 
Politburo and the Secretariat. 
  [Reporter for TUOI TRE] The public recognizes that the 
government is resolved to fight corruption and smuggling, but in 
order to do this, does the government have any new measures? 
Recently, a number of vice ministers and chairmen of provincial 
people's committees acted contrary to a number of the premier's 
policies, including the smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and 
the smuggling of "Po-mu" timber in Nghe An. Why hasn't the 
premier dismissed or suspended those cadres involved in this 
based on the authority given him by the government organization 
law? Has he failed to carry out his responsibilities fully or 
has he been unable to carry our his responsibilities? 
  [Trinh] Having effective measures is something that the 
premier is very concerned about. First of all, the government 
will implement a new organizational measures: An anti-corruption 
committee headed by a minister will be established. Although a 
special state anti-corruption commission will not be 
established, the government and the Standing Committee of the 
National Assembly are united, and each month the Standing 
Committee of the National Assembly will hear reports on the 
situation in fighting corruption in order to provide guidance to 
the organs of control and courts. Also, the Standing Committee 
of the National Assembly is requiring that the committees of the 
National Assembly regard fighting corruption as one of their 
tasks in order to monitor this regularly. 
  The Politburo, too, agrees that if a case involving a 
provincial chairman, minister, vice minister, or cadre 
subordinate to a management echelon of the Politburo arises, the 
anti-corruption leadership collective (the Standing Committee of 
the National Assembly, the Ministry of Interior, the organs of 
control, and the courts) have the right to take whatever steps 
are necessary in accord with the law and then report this to the 
Politburo. 
  Last year, a number of the cases that occurred, such as the 
smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and the smuggling of Po-mu 
timber in Nghe An, should have been dealt with immediately. But 
under the old mechanism, the views of others had to be obtained 
first and so things were done slowly and this affected the 
situation in fighting corruption. But in any event, these cases 
have now been dealt with. 
  [TUOI TRE] On what basis will the 1994 administrative 
reforms 
be made? 
  [Trinh] Administrative reform is an urgent task. This will 
be 
carried on based on clearly determining the responsibilities of 
the legislative, administrative, and judicial organizations. In 
our country, the responsibilities of the legislative, 
administrative, and judicial organizations still overlap. The 
responsibilities of the central and local organizations must be 
clearly determined, and there must be a clear distinction 
between the responsibilities of the state management 
organizations and those of the commercial production 
organizations. The administrative apparatus must be reorganized 
to make it smaller but stronger. Most countries have only 12-13 
ministries, but we now have 30 ministries and equivalent-level 
organizations and 30 other organizations. Thus, it's as if there 
are 60 ministries directly subordinate to the government that 
have dispersed administrative powers. Along with this, we must 
build a standardized system of civil servants having clear 
rights and responsibilities. The government has guided the 
committee handling this work. This committee is receiving help 
from the United Nations. 
  [TUOI TRE] As you have admitted, in Vietnam there is still 
much confusion regarding the responsibilities of the 
administrative, legislative, and judicial organizations. 
Actually, there are also many unstable power relationships 
between the premier and local leaders. In view of this, does the 
government's reform program contain any proposals for revising a 
number of the articles in the constitution and government 
organization law? 
  [Trinh] In implementing things, a number of problems have 
arisen. For example, the government organization law stipulates 
that the ministry is to control the commercial units. But we now 
realize that agricultural management must be separated from 
commercial production management and that the concept of a 
management ministry must be abandoned. Thus, we must experiment 
and revise the laws. 
  Administrative reform is related to the problem of 
organizing 
local administration. For example, should there be precinct- and 
district-level people's councils? Issues such as transferring 
and dismissing chairmen of provincial and municipal people's 
committees touch on the constitution, but these issues are being 
studied. 
  [Hong Phuong, deputy secretary of the Municipal Reporters 
Association] Recently, delineating and disbanding things have 
become issues nationwide. Why isn't there a unified policy for 
the entire country? 
  [Trinh] That is a major concern of ours. The government has 
discussed this and agrees that the most effective measure is to 
implement a policy of paying adequate compensation to the 
people. There will be a number of foreign investment projects, 
and much compensation will be paid to the people. This morning, 
at a government meeting, Vice Premier Phan Van Khai said that 
there have been cases in which the compensation paid to the 
people has been reduced. The government is requiring that the 
localities and sectors refrain from reducing the compensation of 
these people. 
  [TUOI TRE] The constitution has stipulations on buying 
assets 
of the people. Why hasn't the government submitted a purchase 
law instead of continuing to use that disbanding and 
compensation form, which is not unified? 
  [Trinh] To date, no organization has submitted a draft 
purchase law. In my view, the constitution stipulates this and 
so there must be a law to provide guidance. [Trinh ends] 
  Minister Le Xuan Trinh also said that the premier is very 
concerned about other issues raised in the press. TUOI TRE, 
THANH NIEN, LAO DONG, and PHU NU have published stories about a 
number of negative cases and losses at various corporations such 
as Liksin, the Ben Thanh Tobacco Corporation, and the Hung Vuong 
Refrigeration Corporation. The premier is directly guiding the 
Municipal People's Committee which is reporting on and dealing 
with these cases. In particular, the premier is very interested 
in the series of stories on the customs office that have 
appeared in TUOI TRE. The premier has ordered that the customs 
office be reorganized. Minister Le Xuan Trinh also criticized a 
number of newspapers that have published inaccurate stories. 
Some newspapers have published corrections, but others have not 
yet done so.

  [Text] Editor's note: At the end of 1993, Minister of 
Energy Thai Phung Ne answered a number of reporters' questions 
about the implementation of the 1993 plan and the 1994 tasks of 
the energy sector. The following are some of the ideas of the 
minister. 
<H5>  I. The Implementation of the 1993 Plan </H5>
  1. On electricity production and supply: 
  In 1993, both production and commodity electricity supplied 
to satisfy economic and social needs exceeded the plan and 
increased as compared with 1992. Production electricity reached 
10.641 billion kwh, 5.29 percent above the planned norm and an 
increase of 10.25 percent as compared with 1992. Commodity 
electricity reached 7.794 billion kwh, 4.14 percent above the 
planned norm and an increase of 12.45 percent as compared with 
1992. 
  The program to overcome electricity shortages in southern 
and 
central Vietnam was carried on actively. In the south, as a 
result of adding another 100-mw gas turbine and filling the 
reservoirs of the Tri An and Da Nhim hydroelectric plants at the 
end of last year and because of the measures used to mobilize 
the various sources of electricity, both production and supply 
electricity exceeded the plan and increased greatly as compared 
with 1992. Specifically, production electricity exceeded the 
plan by 9.18 percent and increased 16.48 percent as compared 
with 1992, and commodity electricity exceeded the plan by 8.71 
percent and increased 16.69 percent as compared with 1992. This 
ensured a normal supply of electricity during the dry season and 
prevented electricity blackouts as in previous years. In central 
Vietnam, too, the distribution of electricity improved because 
of the use of measures to strengthen obtaining electricity from 
the northern system and bring electricity to Quang Ngai and Binh 
Dinh in conjunction with regulating the diesel sources of 
electricity among the regions. Because of this, as compared with 
1992, the electricity received and produced increased 18.48 
percent and commodity electricity increased 17.6 percent. 
  Bringing electricity to rural and mountainous areas has 
continued to expand. At present, more than 81 percent of the 
districts and more than 55 percent of the villages in the 
country are receiving electricity from the national electricity 
network. 
  The sector has coordinated things with the localities in 
order to expand the program to reduce electric energy losses. 
Very encouraging initial results have been achieved in key 
areas: In Haiphong City, January energy losses in Haiphong City 
amounted to 52.66 percent, but by November the figure had 
dropped to 29 percent. In Hanoi, January losses amounted to 31.4 
percent, but by November, this had declined to 23.5 percent. 
  Using many guidance and control measures, the sector has 
striven to reduce the planned deficit as much as possible. In 
addition to the 100 billion dong contributed to reduced the 
deficit, efforts have been made to further reduce the deficit in 
order to create sources of investment capital for a number of 
urgent capital construction projects. 
  The sector must continue to strive to reduce the electricity 
loss norm (in the north it is now higher than the norm set); 
reduce failure rates, improve safety, and increase the prestige 
of the electricity network, particularly that of the electricity 
distribution network; and control the price of electricity sold 
retail to consumers in rural areas. 
  2. On coal production and supply: 
  Even though there are many difficulties concerning 
distribution markets (within the country, the thermoelectric 
plants still use very small amounts of coal, and coal exports 
are limited because of many factors), because the coal sector 
has used many control measures, such as increasing internal 
sales to households outside the electricity sector and exporting 
small amounts and gradually raising domestic coal prices to 
almost the level of production costs, the amount of washed coal 
produced and sold has exceeded the planned norm and increased as 
compared with 1992. The amount of washed coal produced reached 
4.768 million tons, which is 100.5 percent of the planned norm 
and a 6-percent increase as compared with 1992. The amount of 
washed coal sold reached 5.032 million tons, which is 100.3 
percent of the planned norm and a 3.7-percent increase as 
compared with 1992. The value of coal sales revenues increased 
5.4 percent as compared with the plan, thereby contributing to 
reducing the difficulties with respect to financial balance in 
production and the incomes of the laborers. 
  The sector and localities have coordinated things to 
continue 
restoring order in coal production and circulation based on mine 
boundaries. 
  There are many reasons for the problems now confronting the 
coal sector. In particular, because of fluctuations in the world 
coal market in 1993, coal exports did not reach the planned norm 
and declined as compared with 1992. Because of the lack of 
financial balance, it has not been possible to remove the volume 
of overburden and dig the number of shafts in accord with the 
technical requirements in the mining process, and this has 
affected the preparation of natural resources. 
  3. On capital construction: 
  In 1993, with the concentration of state investments, the 
energy sector implemented a large number of capital construction 
projects: 
  Sources of electricity: Turbines 6 and 7 of the Hoa Binh 
hydroelectric plant were put on line, and preparations were made 
for putting the final turbine into operation by the beginning of 
1994. The Thac Mo hydroelectric project blocked the Be River in 
December 1993. Together with the Vinh Son hydroelectric plant, 
construction on this plant is progressing based on a schedule of 
putting turbine 1 into operation in June 1994 and completing 
construction on the project by the end of 1994. Construction on 
the Yaly hydroelectric project got underway at the beginning of 
November 1993. Electricity projects to support the 1994 dry 
season in the south, which include the Ba Ria 100-mw gas turbine 
group and the Ba Ria-Long Binh 220-kv landline, are being 
constructed at a rapid pace. Three large projects to help 
satisfy electricity needs during the period 1996-2000 and in the 
future are the Phu My thermoelectric project (600 mw), the Pha 
Lai II thermoelectric project (600 mw), and the Ham Thuan-Da Mi 
hydroelectric group (472 mw). Efforts have been concentrated on 
carrying out procedures in order to take ODA [Official 
Development Assistance] loans from the Japanese Government. 
  The electricity network: Construction on the 500-kv 
north-south electricity carrier system has been stepped up. The 
technical plans have been completed, and an overall estimate has 
been submitted to the premier. Contracts for importing materials 
and equipment have been signed, and except for the electric 
cable, which arrived late, almost all of the project materials 
and equipment arrived on time. As for construction, in December 
1993, the foundation was completed, and the pillars were erected 
(including the reinforcements). Stretching the carrier lines and 
lighting arrester lines was basically completed. Some of the 
construction work on the four transformer stations, one 
compensation station, and national electricity moderating center 
has been completed, and some of the equipment has been 
installed. Along with the rate of construction on the 500-kv 
system, construction is urgently being carried on on the 
connecting projects, landlines, and synchronized 110- and 220-kv 
stations with the above sources in order to use the 500-kv 
carrier system to supply electricity to southern and central 
Vietnam and the Central Highlands. In 1993, many projects to 
supply electricity to localities in northern, central, and 
southern Vietnam were completed. This included many projects to 
supply electricity to rural and mountainous areas. 
  The coal sector has invested using the loan mechanism in 
order to remove overburden and dig shafts. Work has begun on the 
Nam Cau Trang tipple and the Tay Khe Sim tunnel, preparations 
have been made to build the La Hien cement plant and plants to 
produce explosives and process coal, and a number of other 
support projects have been built. 
  In the capital construction activities of the energy sector, 
the sector has begun broadly implementing a bidding mechanism 
and welcoming competition in supplying materials and equipment 
in order to reduce costs, ensure quality, and maintain the rate 
of construction on the projects. 
  4. On machine production: 
  The production of the machine installations has continued to 
be shifted in the direction of manufacturing equipment to 
support the projects to develop energy and vary the products 
based on market needs, such as machining and electroplating 
electric rods for the 500-kv and 110- and 220-kv carrier 
projects, producing carrier lines, lightening arrester lines, 
and insulated cable, machining pressure tubes for the 
hydroelectric plants, manufacturing high-voltage circuit 
breakers, spare parts, annexes, and so on to support the 
production and construction activities of the electricity and 
coal sectors. 
  5. Other spheres: 
  Finances: State budget receipts have been maintained, and as 
mentioned above, an effort has been made to reduce the planned 
deficit by hundreds of billions of dong. 
  Fighting corruption and opposing negative aspects: 
Inspections have been conducted, and 18,698 cases of corruption 
and other negative activities have been dealt with. Among these 
were 8 cases of embezzlement, 293 cases of people intentionally 
damaging state property, and 18,397 violations in supplying and 
using electricity (most involved stealing electricity or helping 
others steal electricity for personal interests). A total of 
19.451 billion dong has been recovered for the public fund, and 
635 people have been disciplined, 11 of whom were prosecuted by 
judicial organizations. Those disciplined included 11 enterprise 
directors and deputy directors, 3 corporation directors and 
deputy directors, and 16 heads and deputy heads of corporation 
and enterprise offices. 
  Management organization: the enterprises have been 
reorganized and registered. In the entire sector, there are 20 
state enterprises, with the electricity and coal sectors each 
having 10 enterprises. 
<H5>  II. 1994 Guidelines and Tasks </H5>
  In order to hit the targets and complete the tasks of the 
1991-1995 five-year plan in the remaining 2 years and contribute 
to successfully implementing the resolution of the seventh 
congress, in 1994 the energy sector will strive to hit the 
following targets and carry out the following main tasks: 
  1. Electricity production and supply: 
  The completion of the 500-kv north-south electricity carrier 
system will create a unified national electricity system, and 
electricity capacity will increase by almost 600 mw. The 
electricity sector will be able to maintain the supply of 
electricity based on the needs of the secondary carriers in the 
north, eliminate "electricity shortages" in the south (after 
phase 1 of the 500-kv carrier project is implemented at the 
beginning of the 2d quarter of 1994) and in central Vietnam 
(after the 500-kv carrier project is completed based on the 
designs at the end of 1994). 
  The 1994 plan estimates production electricity at 11.535 
billion kwh, an increase of 8.4 percent as compared with 1993 
and commodity electricity at 8.598 billion kwh, an increase of 
10.3 percent as compared with 1993. 
  Developing new secondary carriers will be encouraged, and 
the 
program to electrify the rural and mountainous areas in order to 
support rural area economic and social development based on the 
spirit of the resolution of the Fifth Plenum of the CPV Central 
Committee will continue to be carried on. The results achieved 
in 1993 will be maintained and exploited, the program to 
eliminate the use of contract electricity will continue to be 
promoted, and electrical power losses, with Hanoi being the key 
point, will be reduced. The quality of operations control will 
be improved, the electricity networks will be repaired in order 
to reduce failure rates to the lowest level possible, and safety 
and confidence in supplying electricity will be increased. Along 
with the localities, the problems concerning rural electricity 
prices will gradually be solved. 
  2. Coal production and supply: 
  Domestic coal consumption needs will be satisfied, and 
emphasis will be placed on supplying coal to support the rural 
and mountain areas. The traditional coal export markets will be 
solidified, and new markets will be opened. The sale of coal in 
a disorderly manner will be overcome, and the preparation of 
base commodities will be maintained in order to stabilize the 
content capacity of the export coal. The amount of overburden 
removed and the number of shafts dug will be increased in 
preparation for production based on the technical requirements. 
Things will be coordinated with the localities in order to 
regularly maintain order in coal mining. The main coal 
production and supply norms for 1994 are: Washed coal for 
distribution, 4,885,000 tons, including 1.5 million tons for 
export; washed coal for production, 4,935,000 tons; overburden 
removed, 16,696,000 cubic meters; and shafts dug in preparation 
for production, 41,461 meters. 
  3. Capital construction: 
  Things will coordinated with the integrated state 
organizations in order to overcome the difficulties concerning 
capital and, in particular, the difficulties in switching to a 
mechanism in which entities borrow investment capital on their 
own. The main targets of the 1994 capital construction 
investment plan are: 
  Electricity: As for the 500-kv north-south carrier project, 
efforts will be made to complete phase 1 by the beginning of the 
2d quarter of 1994 and complete phase 2 by the beginning of the 
4th quarter. The Hoa Binh hydroelectric plant: Turbine No 8 will 
go into operation in the 1st quarter, and construction will be 
completed in 1994. The Thac Mo and Vinh Son hydroelectric plant: 
Turbine No 1 will go into operation in the 2d quarter and 
construction will be completed in 1994. The Yaly hydroelectric 
plant: Construction will proceed as scheduled, and turbine No 1 
will be put into operation in 1998. The program to restore the 
Pha Lai, Uong Bi, and Ninh Binh thermoelectric plants will 
continue, and work on converting the Thu Duc thermoelectric 
plant to gas will be carried on. Work will get underway on the 
Phu My thermoelectric plant, and preparations for building the 
Ham Thuan-Da Mi hydroelectric plant and the Pha Lai 
thermoelectric plant will continue. Connecting projects and 
110-220 kv networks will be constructed in line with the rate of 
construction on the 500-kv carrier system and other sources 
mentioned above. Investments will be concentrated on developing 
and expanding the electricity network in the rural and mountain 
areas in accord with the program to implement the resolution of 
the Fifth Plenum of the CPV Central Committee. Projects to 
improve the electricity networks in Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh 
and Ho Chi Minh City will be developed using loans from the 
World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and SIDA [Swedish 
International Development Agency]. 
  Coal: Efforts will be concentrated on removing overburden 
and 
digging shafts in order to ready raw materials to satisfy needs 
in the coming years. Construction on the Nam Cau Trang tipple 
project, the Tay Khe Sim tunnel, the La Hien cement plant, and a 
number of other support projects will be stepped up. 
  4. Other sectors: 
  Machine production: A program to manufacture equipment for 
the 35-kv electricity network and equipment for 20-kv voltage 
levels will be implemented. Quality will be improved, and 
product production costs and machining and manufacturing costs 
will be reduced. 
  Based on reviewing things and gaining experience, 
anti-corruption activities will continue at all echelons and in 
all management and work spheres in the sector. 
  The policies will be studied in detail, and plans to 
organize 
strong state enterprise groups that can operate independently 
and effectively in a mechanism in which the ministry does not 
manage the energy sector will be formulated. 
<H5>  The Energy Sector--Four Major Events in 1994 </H5>
  1. Phase 1 of the 500-kv north-south carrier system will be 
completed at the beginning of the 2d quarter, and the entire 
project will be completed by the 4th quarter. 
  2. The final turbine (turbine No 8) of the Hoa Binh 
hydroelectric project will go into operation in the 1st quarter. 
The plant has a planned capacity of 1,920 MW. 
  3. Turbine No 1 of the Vinh Son hydroelectric project (with 
a 
capacity of 66 MW) and the turbine of the Thac Mo hydroelectric 
project (with a capacity of 150 MW) will be put into operation 
at the end of the 2d quarter. Construction on these two projects 
will be completed in 1994. 
  4. An effort will be made to block the Se San River at the 
Yaly dam, Yaly hydroelectric project.

<F P=106> [Article by Tan Duc] </F>
  [Text] In 1993, another 92 units with foreign investment 
capital and 1,425 private enterprises were established in Ho Chi 
Minh City, bringing the total number of joint enterprise and 
investment units to 288 and the total number of private 
enterprises to 2,208. The rate of increase in the number of new 
enterprises in these two spheres is almost double that of 1992. 
If the 288 joint enterprises and 2,208 private enterprises carry 
on operations simultaneously, they will certainly consume a huge 
amount of electricity. If Ho Chi Minh City's electricity 
distribution network can't satisfy the needs, everyone knows 
what will happen. 
  According to data disclosed by the Ho Chi Minh City Electric 
Power Service, the carrier capacity of the city's existing power 
net is approximately 420 megawatts, which is about 80 megawatts 
below consumption needs. Thus, there is already an imbalance 
between needs and carrier capacity. This is one of the things 
that has led to a drop in pressure and unexpected power outages, 
which has caused large losses for many production, business, and 
service installations. The Ho Chi Minh City Electric Power 
Service has calculated that electricity consumption in the city 
will increase to 600 and 700 megawatts by the end of 1994 and 
1995 respectively. Because of this, unless immediate action is 
taken, Ho Chi Minh CIty will find itself in a situation in which 
it "doesn't know whether to laugh or cry." Because on one hand, 
the supply of electricity will have increased greatly, but on 
the other hand, electricity needs will have increased but the 
carrier capacity of the distribution network will not have the 
capabilities to satisfy those needs. Managers are aware of this, 
but it is beyond their power to do anything about it. 
Fortunately, since 1993, financial capabilities have allowed Ho 
Chi Minh City to begin implementing plans to make improvements 
on a large scale. On 31 March 1993, the Ministry of Energy 
finished examining the economic and technical arguments 
concerning the project to improve and expand the municipal 
electric power network, 1992-1995 phase. At the beginning of 
September 1993, the city decided to spend 151 billion dong to 
implement eight projects in the plan to improve and upgrade 
things in order to increase the carrier capacity of the electric 
power network to 700 megawatts. The project got underway during 
the 4th quarter of 1993 and will be completed by the end of 1994. 
  Tran Minh Quy, the man in charge of implementing the 
electric 
power network improvement project of the Ho Chi Minh CIty 
Electric Power Service, said that this is a major improvement 
project. The electric power sector is urgently implementing 
this. The things that must be done include: 
  Building thirty 15-kv lines from the intermediary stations, 
which includes 4.7 km of underground cable and 61.5 km of 
above-ground landlines. 
  Improving and upgrading 195 km of 15-kv landlines and laying 
another 40 km of new landlines. 
  Upgrading the low voltage from 100 volts to 220 volts for 
600 
zones. 
  Replacing 60 breakers and installing 91 controllers and 70 
relays in order to improve eleven 15-kv breaker stations. 
  Besides this, in order to improve electricity safety among 
the people, the electricity sector will install an additional 
5.9 km of 15-kv landlines and 48 km of low-voltage landlines, 
improve the other 55 km of low-voltage landlines, and build 62 
low-voltage, 9,885 kva, stations. As part of the project to 
improve the electricity network, electrification will be carried 
out in six villages in six rural districts: Xuan Thoi Thuong in 
Hoc Mon District, Long Hoa in Can Gio District, Phuoc Kien in 
Nha Be District, Trung An in Cu Chi District, Binh Hung Hoa in 
Binh Chanh District, and Long Truong in Thu Duc District. In the 
villages in Xuan Thoi Thuong and Long Truong districts, 
construction got underway at the end of 1993. 
  As mentioned above, once the improvement project has been 
completed, the capacity of the Ho Chi Minh City electricity 
network will increase from 420 mw to 700 mw. But according to 
Tran Minh Quy, with just 151 billion dong, only one of the five 
problems now facing the city's electricity network can be 
solved, that is, the problem concerning carrier and distribution 
capabilities to satisfy electricity consumption needs and 
receive power from the new sources of generation. Only minor 
improvements will be made with respect to the other problems, 
that is, the quality of the electric power supplied, the 
confidence in the power supply, safety in electricity supply and 
use, and losses. In order to solve the above problems and ensure 
that consumption needs, which will reach 1,300 mw by the year 
2000, are satisfied, the electricity sector has about 10 more 
projects that must be built, which will require investment 
capital of more than 2.4 trillion dong. The work to be done in 
1995 will cost 470 billion dong. 
  The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the requirements 
imposed on the electricity sector are rather great. Obtaining 
capital to implement the plans is still a difficult problem. At 
present, the electricity sector is looking only at supplemental 
power funds and a small sum allocated from the municipal budget. 
Recently, representatives from the World Bank came to Ho Chi 
Minh City to survey things and study the capabilities for 
financing the projects to improve the municipal electricity 
network as part of the general financial program for the 
Vietnamese energy sector. In December 1993, World Bank 
representatives returned and issued a notice that the World Bank 
will send specialists to study the plans for improving and 
expanding the electricity network at a total cost of $44 
million, of which the World Bank will finance $33 million. The 
draft study phase will conclude in 1994, and preparations for 
actually implementing things will get underway in 1995. With 
this financial aid, when added to the efforts of the locality, 
it is hoped that by the year 2000 Ho Chi Minh City will have the 
desired electricity carrier and distribution network.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is in favour of 
setting up nuclear power plants, saying the growing demand for 
electricity will inevitably force Thailand to adopt the nuclear 
option. 
  "Nuclear power is a sensitive issue and something very new 
for our country. People may not understand and accept it but we 
should not overlook it," he said. 
  Chuan presided over a seminar entitled "Nuclear Power 
Plants," held at Parliament yesterday. He said nuclear power 
could not be rejected since it is a vital new resource for 
generating electricity. 
  He said nuclear power had been used elsewhere for more than 
20 years due to increasing demand for power worldwide. 
  Chuan said that 20 years ago, Thailand consumed only 1,000 
megawatts of electricity. This year, demand has risen to 9,800 
megawatts. 
  "And in 15-20 years, demand will be 30,000 megawatts," he 
said. 
  At present, Thailand has to import electricity from Laos and 
natural gas from Malaysia, Vietnam and Burma. 
  Although there were many other fossil fuels for electricity 
generation, the world was concerned about their environmental 
impact. He quoted the greenhouse effect, and acid rain as 
examples of problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels. 
  "The government is interested in nuclear power as one of a 
number of options for the future," he said. 
  He said he had instructed the Sciences Technology and 
Environment Ministry to amend the laws concerning nuclear power 
plants and to formulate an organizational structure to supervise 
the new industry. 
  "Everything must comply with international standards. We 
want to be sure people will be safe and that it will not affect 
the environment," he said. 
  He stressed that public sentiment over the issue was the 
most 
important factor. 
  "The government will study the positive and negative aspects 
of nuclear power plants. And we will pay prime attention to the 
public's feelings," he said. 
  The chairman of the House committee on energy, At-ong 
Chumsai 
na Ayutthaya, recently insisted on the need to build nuclear 
power plants and criticized an opposing conclusion reached by 
the House environment committee. 
  "We have to select the best and safest system. Don't take 
bad examples which rely on one-sided information," he said. 
  A Phalang Tham Bangkok MP, At-ong said before deciding 
whether or not to build nuclear power plants, it is necessary to 
study the size of the country's remaining energy reserves. 
  "We have to accept that the energy demand is rising. The 
consumption of electricity increases by 1,000 megawatts yearly." 
  "We are not talking about a change which will happen today 
or 
tomorrow but we are focusing on the situation in 50 years, when 
other energy sources have already gone," he said.

  [Text] The Royal Thai Army has firmly denied the 
accusation that it has supported the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in 
their fight against Cambodian forces along the Thai-Cambodian 
border. 
  The Spokesman of the Royal Thai Army Colonel Phalangkun 
Klahan has made it clear that the Thai Government and the Royal 
Thai Army have always respected the UN resolution on the 
political solution to the war in Cambodia. The spokesman said 
the Royal Thai Army has not banned site inspections by foreign 
diplomats at any time. He added the Royal Thai Army has 
provided humanitarian aid to displaced Cambodians who fled from 
the fighting into Thailand and that the army did not forcibly 
repatriate those Cambodians. It is the Cambodian Government's 
responsibility to take care of its people affected by civil war 
or those who are displaced in their own country.

  [Text] Commenting on the sabotage of a train in the south, 
Army Commander in Chief General Wimon Wongwanit said that rifts 
among the ethnic people in the south are being exploited as a 
pretext to stage acts of terrorism. He said officials are doing 
their best in terms of suppression: 
  [Begin recording] [Wimon] I would like to say this -- 
suppression alone cannot solve the problem of terrorism, 
regardless of the country. We must try to cut their external 
support, and we will only be able to cut external support by 
negotiating with those countries on a government-to-government 
basis. Meanwhile, local people and soldiers must cooperate in 
safeguarding public security and protecting natural resources 
along the border. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Was it an attempt to create 
confusion? 
  [Wimon] There is no confirmation of that. I have only 
received a report on the incident. It is still too early to 
determine what group was responsible for this attempt. We have 
to wait for more information and more evidence. [end recording]

  [Text] Interior Minister General Chawalit Yongchaiyut has 
said that several bombing incidents as well as the sabotage of a 
train in Songkhla Province today are aimed at toppling the 
government. 
  This afternoon Gen. Chawalit called an urgent meeting of 
officials concerned with security issues. Afterward, he said 
the meeting agreed that more measures are needed to strengthen 
security in areas that could be targets of sabotage, 
particularly the four southern border provinces and Bangkok. 
The meeting also held that the motive behind the bombings is to 
destabilize the government. It did not discard the possibility, 
however, that these events are the work of separatists. 
  [Begin Chawalit recording, in progress] ...the situation 
occurred in areas that are probably target areas for harassment 
by the opposition. These target areas are Bangkok and the four 
southern provinces. Before setting clear measures to prevent a 
reoccurrence of these incidents, everyone at the meeting agreed 
that the main objective of the movement behind these events is 
to create confusion and worry and damage the government. [end

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 14 Feb (BERNAMA)--Plans are now being 
made to fly 10 Hawk 100 planes to Malaysia at the end of this 
month, a Royal Malaysian Air Force (TUDM) officer said today. 
These are modern jet trainers that have been by bought by 
Malaysia. TUDM pilots will fly the planes from Britain to the 
TUDM air base at Butterworth. The officer said British 
Aerospace (BAe) will deliver nine more Hawk 100 planes in stages 
before the end of this year. 
  The first ten of the two-seat planes were accepted by Air 
Force Commander Lieutenant General Datuk Abdul Ghani Abdul Aziz 
from Kevin Smith, director of BAe Military Aircraft Division, in 
a short ceremony at Wharton Aerodrome at Preston in Britain last 
month. 
  The Hawk 100 planes were bought under a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) worth 2.4 billion ringgit signed by Malaysia 
and Britain in 1988. The TUDM also ordered 18 Hawk 200 planes 
under the same contract. The TUDM will be the first air force 
in this region to use the British-made planes. Indonesia 
reportedly will buy planes of that type, too. 
  Both the Hawk 100, a modern all-weather jet trainer, and the 
Hawk 200, a light fighter plane with one seat, use Mk 871 Rolls 
Royce Adour engines. The first Hawk 200 will be flown here in 
July. Deliveries of the plane will begin in May and will be 
completed in February 1995. 
  The MOU also provided for training facilities for TUDM 
pilots 
and airport staff, including technicians, under a reciprocal 
program. As many as 69 TUDM technicians will attend 20 types of 
courses. Four selected TUDM pilots, who have completed a 
three-year training program, will be instructors in a new 
squadron to be formed at Butterworth Air Base. They are now at 
Wharton to accept the Hawk 100's. 
  In December 1990, Malaysia reached an agreement under a 
similar MOU for a 400-million-ringgit reciprocal contract 
involving the transfer of technology to Malaysian 
defense-related industries such as the Malaysia Explosives 
Company, a producer of military equipment in this country, and 
Airod Sdn. Bhd. [limited corporation], a privatized facility for 
overhauling aircraft. 
  The reciprocal program for the supply of domestic airborne 
military equipment and weapons (bombs and guided missiles), 
support equipment, and repair and overhaul facilities provides 
Malaysia with adequate support for Hawk planes. 
  Meanwhile, preparations for creating support facilities at 
Butterworth Air Base have been moving smoothly since the arrival 
of replacement equipment for Hawks at Klang Port last July. BAe 
and suppliers of other Hawk components, such as Rolls Royce and 
Westinghouse (radar systems), will provide field service to the 
TUDM for 24 months after the planes are received.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 8 Feb--The Minister of Defense will 
revise the periods of service of those who hold the post of 
Armed Forces commander to enable them to serve longer despite 
reaching retirement age. 
  Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said that 
under 
this revision, a person serving as Armed Forces commander may 
hold the position for at least three years. Because of 
compulsory retirement, the periods currently served sometimes do 
not reach a year. 
  "Although the present period of service is fair for 
everyone, 
it will be improved in two years, when the Armed Forces 
commander will be given at least three years to direct the 
Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM)," he said. He said this as a 
special guest on the Forum program aired by TV 1 tonight. 
  As an example, the new Armed Forces commander, General Tan 
Sri Borhan Ahmad, will have the opportunity to lead the Armed 
Forces for only 11 months, because he is scheduled for 
retirement at the end of this year. Similarly, the previous 
commander, General Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, had the 
opportunity to lead the Armed Forces for only a year because of 
retirement. 
  In this connection, Najib said that although the present 
term 
of service of the Armed Forces commander is short, it will not 
hurt ATM planning. 
  "This is because those who are to be promoted to replace the 
Armed Forces commander when he retires were also involved in 
earlier planning. This means that whenever we make a decision 
at the Ministry of Defense, it is not the decision of one 
commander alone but is a collective decision," he said. 
  In the interview, Najib did not reject the possibility that 
in the future the post of Armed Forces commander will not be 
limited to candidates from the Army only. 
  He said that in order for an Air Force commander or Navy 
commander to become Armed Forces commander in the future, both 
positions will be raised to the rank of general to be on a par 
with the Army commander. 
  "At present, the Air Force commander is a lieutenant general 
with three stars, and the Navy commander is a vice admiral with 
three stars, whereas the Army commander is a general with four 
stars," he said. 
  When asked when the Air Force commander or Navy commander 
will hold the post of Armed Forces commander, he said that it 
depends on time and conditions. 
  "We need time to apply new doctrines, and this will be 
implemented when the doctrines have become established," he said. 
  He said that appointments to Armed Forces commander have 
focused on candidates from the Army because in the past Malaysia 
concentrated its attention on eliminating communist terrorists. 
  "In the future, however, attention will be more on 
conventional warfare, involving combinations of the three ATM 
services. Therefore, the future designation of Armed Forces 
commander will be based on the personal qualifications and 
capabilities of the candidates," he said. 
  The forum was chaired by BERITA HARIAN reporter Mohamed Shah 
Abdullah, while panel members were UTUSAN MALAYSIA reporter 
Zulkiflee Bakar and BERNAMA reporter Mohamed Fuad.

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, 13 Feb--The ruling party, the Sabah 
United Party (PBS), has never been serious in its efforts to 
develop and advance the state. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the 
matter 
is evident from the attitude of the PBS, which has never made 
any request of the Federal Government regarding development and 
progress for the benefit and comfort of the people of Sabah. 
  "In the more than four years since the PBS left the National 
Front (BN), the PBS has never made any clear or serious request 
for the purpose of developing the State of Sabah," he told 
reporters today at Papar Mosque, about 50 kilometers from the 
state capital, when interviewed at a meeting with the public to 
break the fast. 
  Also present at the meeting were Osu Sukam, BN candidate 
from 
the Kawang District, and Rahim Ismail, BN candidate from the 
Buang Sayang District, who are, respectively, president and 
deputy president of the UMNO [United Malays National 
Organization] Papar Division. 
  Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said that from the 
time the PBS stabbed the BN in the back until now, the Central 
Government has never received any letter from the party for the 
purpose of obtaining allocations for development for the benefit 
of the people of Sabah. 
  "All that the Central Government received from the PBS was a 
request for privatization projects, including the privatization 
of Sabah Forest Industries (SFI), which would benefit merely a 
few PBS leaders," he said. 
  On the same subject, Anwar advised the people of Sabah to be 
cautious of PBS political propaganda as the election approaches. 
He said the people of Sabah must not let the PBS buy their 
dignity during the "election fever" season before the eighth 
Sabah State Legislature election, now only about four days away. 
According to Anwar, the PBS will soon use its money 
"distribution" tactic among the people of Sabah. 
  "I will not be surprised if the PBS soon distributes two or 
three hundred ringgit to every Sabahan. But what is the value 
of that amount of money over five years? Where are our national 
values and what is the value of our dignity if our eyes are 
closed by two or three hundred ringgit distributed every five 
years?" he asked. 
  Anwar called on the people of Sabah to eliminate the PBS in 
this election in order to move in a more meaningful direction in 
the future. He said the people of Sabah who are Muslims have no 
choice other than to bring down the PBS, which does not respect 
Sabahans who follow Islam.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "MCA [Malaysian Chinese </F>
Association] Carves New Image"] 
  [Text] The MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association], which this 
year celebrates its 46th anniversary, has presented a new 
concept by opening the door of membership more widely to include 
anyone with blood connections or ties with those of Chinese 
ancestry. This step changes the scope of the MCA struggle from 
an entirely Chinese "gallery" to a more liberal position for the 
sake of people who have ties with the Chinese. MCA members have 
accepted the motto "One heart, one outlook," as embodied in a 
resolution passed by the party's 40th general assembly last 
year. It also demonstrates the MCA effort to rebuild its image 
after facing a number of crises. 
  In truth, this step by the MCA is consistent with the way in 
which the people of this country solve problems through 
compromise and tolerance. It is also the principle used by the 
National Front (BN) leadership, which has proved itself 
successful in creating communal harmony in this country through 
the unity of parties in the Peninsula, Sabah, and Sarawak. The 
BN not only emphasizes political stability but also ensures 
economic development for every citizen in an equitable way. 
  Groups with Chinese ancestral blood ties, who previously 
found it difficult to select a party, are given opportunity to 
join the MCA, now that differences of names, ethnic group, and 
religion have been eliminated from the party's policy. We 
believe that in the past many such groups asked for membership 
in the party but were blocked by the party's strict policy. They 
chose the MCA or other BN component parties because they did not 
want to join opposition parties, which are clever at talking but 
are bereft of any implementation of concepts for advancement of 
the people. The statement of BN Chairman Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamad that component parties were free to open their 
memberships to anyone as long as they promised to adhere to the 
principles of the BN's struggle further encouraged MCA leaders 
to carry out their plan. 
  We believe that the MCA's action to increase the party's 
membership, which is now 620,000, is for the sake of political 
stability and communal harmony. We believe that other parties in 
the BN support the MCA's efforts. This is the second phase in 
the MCA's campaign to add members from people of the same 
communal group. Of the 6 million people of Chinese descent in 
this country, many faced problems in joining the party because 
of this identity obstacle. Until now, the MCA has tried to find 
more professionals or Chinese fluent in English to join the 
party. The MCA realized that it could not keep such an expensive 
requirement for membership, because social conditions in society 
have greatly changed. 
  The people were thinking far ahead, while restrictive 
policies had not yet been adapted to conditions. They could not 
allow a large number of people with blood ties to drift without 
protection. In our opinion, changes in the party's membership 
requirements will not change the MCA's identity, although they 
may include changes in the party's policies. This was proved to 
UMNO [United Malays National Organization], which opened 
membership to Bumiputra [Malays and other indigenous peoples] in 
Sabah and in the Portuguese and Thai communities. 
  In the MCA's efforts to take a positive, progressive, and 
constructive initiative, it had to open new dimensions for the 
communal group of its own race that had no party representation. 
Their presence can help the country make sociopolitical changes 
by cooperation under a single outlook. The important thing is 
that in the next 26 years prior to 2020, each citizen will be 
able to enjoy the rapid economic growth for which we have been 
striving together. Actually, this is the aspiration of every 
individual in this country, regardless of communal status. 
  This, of course, differs from the attitude of the opposition 
parties, which in practice have a negative attitude and take 
destructive action. If there is a dissenting voice from the 
opposition parties after this, it will be a voice of 
disappointment over losing their opportunity to influence groups 
without party representation and that now have a safer refuge. 
The opposition parties are good only at empty rhetoric and do 
not make any constructive contribution to the people as a whole.

  [Text] The property sector will continue to be the first 
choice of investors throughout 1994 because of the various land 
and building development projects now being implemented and the 
large number of projects scheduled for this year. Several 
market analysts predict that spending in the land and building 
sector in Malaysia will remain high and that construction will 
continue to experience rapid double-digit growth over the next 
three years. 
  One analyst said that construction of the Kuala Lumpur 
International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang alone will cost 8 billion 
ringgit. The giant project will spawn many construction 
contracts worth more than any in the past. 
  The analyst listed IJM Corp. Bhd. [Limited], Pelecon 
Engineering Bhd., Sungei Way Holdings Bhd., and United Engineers 
Malaysia Bhd. as the three construction companies best prepared 
to compete for the contracts. He said the selection of a 
company will be based on the company's capabilities as shown by 
previous accomplishments, financial and management performance, 
and preparedness from the aspect of capital and skills. 
  Another analyst said that the property "counter" will 
continue to have bright prospects for investment portfolios 
because the industry will be affected by a positive synergism. 
  He said current factors consist of six principal projects 
now 
under way: a series of roads worth 1 billion ringgit in the 
Kuala Lumpur area, roads and highways in the eastern part of the 
Peninsula (500 million ringgit), Tenaga Nasional [National 
Power] Bhd. electric power plant and transmission cable projects 
(11 billion ringgit), a Telekom Malaysia Bhd. project (8 billion 
ringgit), a water supply project (2 billion ringgit), a twin 
runway project, and KTM [Malayan Railways] Bhd. electric trains 
(1.2 billion ringgit).

<F P=106> [By Dr. Johan Saravanamuttu] </F>
  [Text] Lately, there has been an upbeat air about Malaysia 
peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the United Nations. 
The reason for this foreign policy approach is rather different 
from Malaya's purported original purpose in sending some 1,413 
soldiers to the Congo in its first UN peacekeeping operation in 
1960. Then it was to prop up a besieged UN Secretary-General in 
his fledgling peacekeeping role which a small nation like Malaya 
felt could blunt the edge of Cold War politics. 
  Today, it would seem more like the manoeuvrings of an 
aspirant middle power flexing its political sinews on behalf of 
itself, the Third World, the South and Islam, whichever way one 
chooses to look at it. 
  On March 12 this year, Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun 
Razak made it a point to advertise Malaysia's contribution to UN 
peacekeeping operations in a ceremony bestowing a national award 
to all soldiers and personnel who had served with the UN in such 
operations. Some 2,555 officers and men are currently serving 
in UN peacekeeping duties in Bosnia (1,512), Somalia (982), 
Mozambique (19), Liberia (17), Cambodia (11), West Sahara (6), 
Iraq and Kuwait (5), Angola (1) and at the UN in New York (2). 
  The three most prominent recent and current peacekeeping 
operations in which Malaysia has been involved include actions 
in Cambodia, Somalia and Bosnia. Most recently. Malaysia's UN 
peacekeeping role has gained a significant fillip for better or 
worse as Malbatt II (Malaysian Battalion II) in Somalia prepares 
to take over from the Americans when they pull out of Mogadishu 
on March 31. Today, Malaysia's foray into Bosnia-Herzegovina 
represents not only its current largest involvement but arguably 
its most difficult mission both from the military and political 
standpoints. 
  In that regard, Malaysia's particular posture and current 
actions in UN peacekeeping are calculated to match its vision to 
become a developed country by the year 2020, which is also part 
of a trajectory towards middle power status in world politics. 
Notwithstanding this, in behaving as a nation-state, Malaysia 
acts not merely at the direction of its leaders but is 
demonstrably sensitive to and constrained by its domestic 
situation and the ever-changing international environment. 
  The end of the Cold War has brought about a rash of UN 
peacekeeping and would-be peacekeeping operations which has put 
not only an unprecedented strain on the UN's budget but has also 
taxed the tempers of its members. 
  The US-led coalition's actions against Iraq during the Gulf 
War of 1991 generated angst among Muslim populations, including 
Malaysians, and this has now gravitated to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It takes little explaining as to why a country like Malaysia 
has cried foul over the excruciatingly tardy pace at which the 
West has deemed it fit to act with force in Bosnia, and that too 
on a scale and level well below that of the action in the Gulf. 
Malaysia's strident stance on the Bosnian issue stresses this 
"double standard" of the West, which, it hopes, rests on 
economics (the oil factor of Kuwait) and not Western 
ethnocentrism or xenophobia (the birth of an Islamic Balkan 
state). 
  Thus, it may be argued that Malaysia' involvement in the 
Unprofor (the UN Protection Force) operation in Bosnia is as 
much motivated by politics geared or targeted either at the 
international Islamic audience or the predominantly Muslim 
population at home. This is not to say that humanitarianism is 
not a factor in such policies but perhaps altruism dovetails 
well here with political motivation. The politics, one hastens 
to add, is borne of a genuine concern with Western callousness 
and double standards on human rights and its lack of 
appreciation of Islamic perspectives. 
  In contrast, the Cambodian action which now counts among one 
of the UN's successful peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations 
presented no political dilemmas to Malaysia or conflict with the 
West. Indeed, Asean's high profile in the Cambodian conflict as 
well as in its resolution phase meant that participation in the 
peacekeeping effort was almost a foregone conclusion for 
Malaysia. Add to that Cambodia's geographical proximity and 
potential economic links with Malaysia which have now been 
firmly established through air links, banking, trade and other 
flows. Two Malaysian soldiers perishing in the line of duty 
(succumbing to Malaria, not the bullets of the Khmer Rouge) were 
from the country's viewpoint, a small sacrifice for the winding 
down of the last serious international political conflict in 
Southeast Asia. 
  All said, Malaysia's foray into UN peacekeeping and 
peacebuilding operations has been approached with calculated 
expediency even as Malaysia has in a real sense taken to heart 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for effective 
preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping in his 
"Agenda for Peace" speech at the 1992 47th Session of the 
General Assembly. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, in 
his vision to turn the country into a developed country is 
clearly aware that the principle of noblesse oblige applies in 
domestic as well as in international affairs. The economic 
development and rising affluence of Malaysia has made it 
possible to pursue such a principle wherein one of the ways is 
to contribute to maintaining international security. Doing so 
through the UN is the least controversial and perhaps the most 
prestigious approach. 
  In championing the cause of the Southern countries and the 
Third World, it would also seem fitting that a country like 
Malaysia should consciously engage in UN actions which would 
otherwise come under the direct purview or control of major 
powers should the smaller states opt out of them. 
  Indeed, as is perhaps becoming more evident in a situation 
such as in Somalia, the presence of smaller powers is often less 
counter- productive to that of big powers, which tend to elicit 
accusations of ulterior motives. This said, one must quickly 
caution that playing the role of UN policeman in these turbulent 
times may certainly enhance national status but it is often a 
dismal task in which the dividends are few and the frustrations 
legion.

  [Text] In the High Court today, the appeal of Michael Peter 
Fay was dismissed. Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that he was 
satisfied that the district judge had taken into consideration 
all the relevant facts. Michael Fay had appealed against the 
sentence of four-month jail and six strokes of the cane for two 
counts of vandalism. 
  The chief justice said he had duly considered the 
psychiatric 
report and the background of the accused. He said he could not 
accept that the pre-sentencing report, which could call for 
probation, should have been made. This has been suggested by 
the Queen's Counsel, Mr. Michael Sherrard. Twenty charges had 
been taken into consideration, in which 16 were for acts of 
vandalism. The chief justice said he considered that Michael Fay 
had committed the acts of vandalism deliberately and willfully, 
which amounted to a calculated cause of criminal conduct over 10 
days.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel V. Ramos on his arrival from a </F>
three-day official visit to the SRV at Ninoy Aquino 
International Airport -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] 
  [Text] Mr. Vice President; former president and Mrs. 
Diosdado Macapagal; Speaker Protempore of the House of 
Representatives Raul Daza; and the distinguished members of the 
Senate and of the House of Representatives; your Excellency, 
Archbishop Morene; the dean of the diplomatic corp.; your 
excellencies of the diplomatic corp.; particularly the charge of 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Mr. (Hoa Phuc Chinh); 
co-workers in government, beloved countrymen: It's 
good to be back home. At the close of our three-day journey 
across the South China Sea to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 
it is gratifying to come home with our report of mission 
accomplished. And I thank you for your good wishes for a 
successful visit, and your prayers for our safe journey home. 
  When this administration came to office in June 1992, I set 
as one of our key priorities the restructuring and reorientation 
of our foreign relations in keeping with the changes that have 
taken place in our country and in the world. And central to 
this new thrust was the emphasis on our relations with our 
neighbors in Southeast Asia -- both the members and the 
non-members of the Association of Southeast Nations or ASEAN. 
My journey to Vietnam continues this effort in a new way, since 
this is my first visit to a Southeast Asian state that is not a 
member of ASEAN. For reasons of geography, history, and shared 
interest and concerns, Vietnam today is particularly crucial to 
the building of a viable structure for regional security, 
stability, and peace in our part of the world, a goal which 
intimately involves the progress and prosperity of all of the 10 
nations of Southeast Asia. 
  In the discussions and exchanges that took place during our 
visit, Vietnam's leaders and the Philippine delegation addressed 
bilateral, regional, and global issues and concerns, and these 
have resulted in significant agreements, new initiatives, and 
fresh understanding between our governments. Like our own 
leadership, Vietnam's top leaders -- President Le Duc Anh, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet, and Party General Secretary Do Muoi -- 
attached great importance to regional stability. 
  They seen it the breathing spell after two generations of 
bloody conflict with which to set their own economy on the road 
to self-sustaining growth. [sentence as heard] In this regard, 
the Vietnamese leaders expressed their government's readiness 
and intent to participate fully in the meeting of the 
forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum in Bangkok -- a unique regional 
mechanism for dealing with security issues. 
  We discussed ways to reduce tensions in East Asia, including 
the need to rid the entire region of nuclear arms and the threat 
of nuclear warfare. The conflicting claims to areas of the 
South China Sea are of acute concern to both our countries. We 
explored and exchanged ideas about new avenues for cooperation 
among the claimant states and the other countries of Southeast 
Asia, cooperative endeavors that can help to reduce tensions and 
build confidence in the area. 
  On our part, I proposed that the countries involved jointly 
undertake a study of the possible demilitarization of the area, 
and of freezing all destabilizing activities in that area. I 
also proposed that the resources in the South China Sea Islands 
be considered as the common heritage of all the nations and 
people on its periphery. At the very least, the Vietnamese 
leaders and I agreed that the status quo with respect to the 
question of sovereignty and the status quo in regard to the 
strength of the military garrisons be frozen for the moment. 
  We also agreed on the desirability of cooperative ventures 
in 
such matters as marine scientific research; air and sea borne 
rescue; environmental protection; and, the installation of 
navigational aids. These ventures would not only be beneficial 
in themselves, but also would help to build confidence and trust 
among the countries of the region. As another 
confidence-building measure, both sides saw merit in an exchange 
of visits among commanders and units stationed in the islands 
and atolls of the South China Sea. 
  We shared the conviction that if the countries concerned 
fully explore these, as well as other friendly approaches, we 
can transform the South China Sea from waters of contention to 
an area of cooperation. 
  I reaffirmed the Philippines' support for Vietnam's early 
entry into ASEAN as a full member, and our readiness to help in 
easing the way to Vietnam's membership. 
  My visit illuminated the vast potential for economic 
cooperation between our two countries, and served as an occasion 
for the expansion of trade and other forms of economic 
interaction between us. 
  Vietnam and the Philippines stand at similar, though not 
identical, points in their quest for modernization. Both 
countries see their development as anchored on their ties to 
other countries and the global economy. And both are today in 
the midst of restructuring and reform on a very intensive basis. 
  Our delegation briefed the Vietnamese leaders on our 
Philippines 2000 Program, which, among other things seeks to 
open our economy to free market forces, and improve our global 
competitiveness. 
  In turn, Vietnam's leaders explained to us the workings of 
Doi Moi, which is their own economic renovation and adjustment 
program, and which has brought Vietnam high growth rates during 
the past three years. 
  We agreed on specific measures to fulfill the great 
potential 
of our economic relationship. Our trade ministers signed a 
trade protocol that pinpoints the products that can be 
profitably traded between our two countries. For a similar 
purpose, we opened an office of the Philippine International 
Trading Company, or PITC in Ho Chi Minh City. 
  Several joint venture agreements were signed between several 
top businessmen in our delegation and Vietnamese enterprises -- 
undertakings that will in themselves benefit both economies 
while opening the way to expanded economic activities with 
multiplied effects to us both. It is estimated that such 
business agreements could increase our bilateral trade by at 
least $150 million in the near future. 
  To promote the tourism industry, which both countries 
consider as extremely important to their development programs 
and people-to-people exchanges, our foreign ministers signed a 
tourism agreement and a cultural agreement which provide the 
framework for intensive cooperation in these areas. 
  The Vietnamese leaders expressed Vietnam's interest in 
receiving training from the Philippines in a wide range of 
disciplines -- from banking and management, to economics and 
accounting; from aquaculture and agricultural research, to the 
English language. We shall explore ways in which to translate 
into reality our willingness to cooperate with Vietnam in this 
regard. 
  The improved economic situation in Vietnam has considerably 
brightened the prospects for the orderly repatriation of some 
3,100 Vietnamese asylum seekers still remaining in the 
Philippines who have been denied resettlement in third countries. 
  The Vietnamese leaders assured us of their utmost 
cooperation 
in encouraging the return of their people to Vietnam and 
reintegrating them harmoniously into Vietnamese society. 
  We also agreed to strengthen the relationship between our 
two 
Armed Forces through the exchange of visits between senior 
defense officials and military officers; study tours by defense 
and military students; and, the opening of slots in the 
Philippine Military Academy to Vietnamese cadets. 
  Finally, and as bottom line, we established a joint 
commission to deal comprehensively with the whole range of our 
relationship, and to nurture its steady expansion for mutual 
benefit and support. 
  In both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, we met with the Filipino 
expatriates working in Vietnam as professionals and technicians, 
and who are helping to build that country. I brought them 
greetings from our beloved Philippines and urged them to learn 
as much as they can from that great country that is their 
temporary home. Our country can be proud of all of them. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, in assessing the significance of this 
visit in the light of our national concerns and our national 
interest, we must look beyond its immediate economic benefits. 
Although we can confidently foresee such benefits in the near 
future. 
  We must also see this visit as the building of an enduring 
bridge to the Vietnamese people, thus contributing to the 
edifice of stability, peace, and prosperity that both our 
nations and our neighbors in ASEAN are helping to construct in 
Southeast Asia. 
  Both the Philippines and Vietnam have known the last of 
colonialism and the struggle against imperialism and foreign 
occupation. This fact of our national lives has strengthened 
our historic kinship, and makes the act of cooperation with each 
other a natural undertaking for both. 
  Moreover, as countries striving for development and 
modernization, we have much to learn from each other. 
  The exchange of knowledge and experience that we have begun 
with this visit and the close cooperation that we have pledged 
to promote between Vietnam and the Philippines promise to bring 
incalculable benefits to both our people and beyond our 
bilateral partnership. 
  The forging of strong bonds between us will surely enhance 
the stability and progress of our Asia Pacific Region. This 
certainly is the Philippines' intention and the perceived 
intention of Vietnam and her leaders. 
  In the final analysis, this is the lasting significance of 
our visit to Vietnam -- the agreements that we have forged are 
in every way important for raising the level of our political 
and economic collaboration. But even more significant are the 
understandings that we have received as partners in making our 
way in the world, and in reinforcing peace and stability in our 
region. 
  We return today to our beloved Philippines confident that we 
have significantly advanced the interest of our nation and 
contributed to the welfare of our region. 
  We thank the good Lord for keeping the Philippines united 
and 
secure, and in the spirit of the Lenten Season, we continue to 
pray for our people's welfare and progress. 
  Thank you to all of you. Long live the 
Philippines.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry today answered questions put by KCNA about 
the attempt of the United States to justify its campaign for 
pressure on the DPRK by distorting facts with the allegation 
that the DPRK did not allow a proper inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  [KCNA] The United States is now justifying its campaign for 
pressure on the DPRK with the allegation that the DPRK did not 
allow a full inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. Please tell me about the truth in detail. 
  [Spokesman] The United States is contending that the DPRK 
must accept a full IAEA inspection, alleging that the recent 
inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by the IAEA was not 
satisfactory. But this is quite contrary to the fact. 
  We are in a unique status after a temporary suspension of 
the 
effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) [haengmugi chonpabangji choyak 
taltoe hyorok palsaengul imsi chongjihan tuksuhan chiwie innun 
urinun]. So we are not obliged to accept a full inspection by 
the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. Moreover, we have 
never agreed with the United States and the IAEA on it. 
  We agreed with the United States and the IAEA only to an 
inspection for maintaining the continuity of safeguards. 
  When the scope of the IAEA inspection was agreed upon at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York in late December last year, the 
sides promised that it should be a strictly limited inspection 
[chehan sachal] for the maintenance of the continuity of 
safeguards, not a routine and ad hoc inspection [chonggi mit 
pijonggi sachal] pursuant to the safeguards agreement. 
  At that time, the U.S. side asked the DPRK not to announce 
to 
the world that it would be a limited inspection to save its face. 
  At the New York contact in February, the U.S. side clarified 
its position that if an IAEA inspection was made, it would come 
out to the third round of talks with the DPRK, irrespective of 
the results of the inspection. 
  The United States which had promised a limited inspection 
and 
asked the DPRK not to open it to the public and stated it would 
have talks with the DPRK, irrespective of the results of the 
inspection, is now urging the DPRK to accept an additional 
inspection, charging that it refused to accept a full inspection 
by the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. This is a 
self-contradictory act. 
  This fully shows how faithless the United States is. 
  [KCNA] What does the United States really seek in reversing 
the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and kicking up a row of 
pressure on the DPRK? 
  [Spokesman] I think it was motivated by the U.S. trite 
hostile policy toward the DPRK [kutaeuiyonhan taejoson choktaesi 
chongchaek]. 
  Admittedly, we have honestly discharged our obligation 
according to the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and 
the United States at the New York contact. 
  The United States, however, had made false promises and it 
took no action in actuality. 
  Nevertheless, the United States is resorting to pressure on 
the DPRK and war provocation moves, alleging that the DPRK has 
failed to implement the agreement. How can it be construed 
otherwise? 
  As we have declared more than once, if the third round of 
the 
DPRK-U.S. talks had been held and the nuclear issue resolved in 
a package deal [haengmunjeui ilgwal tagyorani songsa 
toeoddoramyon], the IAEA's routine and ad hoc inspections of the 
DPRK would have been resumed and the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and the South would have been possible. 
  But the United States intentionally foiled the third round 
of 
the talks, which would be the key to the solution of the nuclear 
issue, setting unjustifiable preconditions. This clearly proves 
that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear 
issue through negotiation and it is only using the talks to 
stifle the DPRK and, further, promote its strategic interests in 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
  [KCNA] Now that we have undergone an inspection enough for 
the continuity of safeguards as we had agreed with the IAEA, the 
UN Security Council has no reason or justification to discuss 
our issue, does it? 
  [Spokesman] Of course not. The continued discussions of our 
issue at the UN Security Council under this situation only give 
the impression that the international organisation is courting 
the favor of a country. 
  And this may be a living example that even international 
organisations are used for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic 
aim. 
  The IAEA Secretariat made haste with the adoption of a 
"resolution" distorting the results of the inspection after 
carrying out the inspection of enough scope for the continuity 
of safeguards, and now the UN Security Council is discussing our 
issue. All this is manipulated behind the scene by the U.S.-led 
forces to stifle [apsal] the DPRK. 
  If the UN Security Council follows the United States, it 
will 
seriously harm its authority as an international organistion 
whose lifeblood is impartiality. 
  If the UN Security Council truly wants to discharge its 
mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue 
about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put 
pressure on it. 
  If the UN Security Council, departing from the principle of 
impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the 
reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure 
upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the 
small countries will no more trust the United Nations. 
  The UN Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for 
putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear 
issue. 
  [KCNA] What measures are needed in your opinion for paving 
the way for a solution to the nuclear issue? 
  [Spokesman] The United States must no more pursue a hostile 
policy toward Korea, first of all. 
  Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused 
by 
the U.S. policy to stifle our system, as mentioned above, if it 
is to be solved, the United States must take measures first for 
removing the nuclear threat to us and giving up the hostile 
policy. 
  Still today when the nature of its anti-DPRK moves has been 
brought to light, the United States is resorting to the row of 
pressure against us, calling for UN "resolution" and the like. 
This cannot be justified with anything. 
  The South Korean authorities must ponder over the lot in 
which they would find themselves while running about reckless, 
not knowing their position as now. 
  The United States must sincerely implement the agreed 
conclusions reached at the contact with us. 
  It is a violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and a 
mockery of our sovereignty for the United States to demand a 
full inspection of the DPRK by the IAEA and the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and the South, not implementing 
its own obligations at all. 
  Pressure can never be a way of the solution of the problem 
but it only makes the situation complicated. 
  It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional 
inspection since we have already accepted, fairly and squarely 
[chongjong tangdanghage], an inspection of a scope enough for 
the continuity of safeguards according to our agreement with the 
United States and the IAEA. 
  If the United States continues to misuse [agyong] our 
sincere 
efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin 
hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and will counter [massonagal gosida] 
any pressure to the end. 
  But if the United States put a stop to the international 
pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the 
reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. talks we 
would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue through 
negotiations. 
  Consistent is our position to resolve the nuclear issue 
through dialogue. 
  The future developments and a peaceful solution to the 
nuclear issue entirely depend on the attitude of the United 
States.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Now that we have 
undergone an inspection enough for the continuity of safeguards 
as we had agreed with the IAEA, the United Nations Security 
Council has no reason or justification to discuss our issue, 
declared a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today. 
  The continued discussions of our issue at the U.N. Security 
Council only give the impression that the international 
organisation is courting the favor of a country and this may be 
a living example that even international organisations are used 
for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic aim, the spokesman said. 
  Answering questions put by KCNA about the attempt of the 
United States to justify its campaign for pressure on the DPRK 
with the allegation that the DPRK did not allow a proper 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards, the spokesman went 
on: 
  If the U.N. Security Council truly wants to discharge its 
mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue 
about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put 
pressure on it. 
  If the U.N. Security Council, departing from the principle 
of 
impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the 
reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure 
upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the 
small countries will no more trust the United Nations. 
  The U.N. Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for 
putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear 
issue. 
  In order to pave the way for a solution to the nuclear 
issue, 
the United States must no more pursue a hostile policy toward 
Korea, first of all.

the U.S. policy to stifle our system, if it is to be solved, the 
United States must take measures first for removing the nuclear 
threat to us and giving up the hostile policy. 
  It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional 
inspection, the spokesman said, and went on: 
  If the United States continues to misuse our sincere efforts 
to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin hope on the 
DPRK-USA talks and will counter any pressure to the end. 
  But, if the United States put a stop to the international 
pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the 
reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-USA talks, we 
would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue.

  [Text] Indonesia, as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement 
(NAM) will propose initiatives for an International Conference 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina. For that purpose, President Suharto has 
instructed the head of the Chairman's Administrative Board of 
the Nonaligned Movement (BPK NAM) to look into possible ways of 
implementing this. In addition, Indonesia is planning to open 
diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indonesian wishes 
in these matters were revealed at talks held between President 
Suharto and Alija Izetbegovic, the president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the presidential palace in Jakarta 
yesterday. 
  Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters that the 
two 
parties gave serious consideration at the talks, which lasted 
from 9:30 to 10:30 AM, to the possibility of holding an 
International Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Murdiono said 
that President Suharto gave direct instructions to Nana 
Sutresna, the head of the BPK NAM, to look into and make 
preparations for a possible conference. More particularly, 
President Suharto asked Nana Sutresna to instruct the Indonesian 
ambassador to the U.N. in New York to discuss this matter with 
the NAM Coordinating Bureau. 
  Besides that, as chairman of the NAM, Indonesia will ask the 
international community to treat Bosnia fairly. The 
minister/state secretary said that the fact that the 
international community has been treating Bosnia unfairly is 
clear from the embargo, which has also been imposed on Bosnia, 
since Bosnia is far less powerful militarily than Serbia. 
  In response to questions from reporters about holding a 
conference, Murdiono said that he could not yet imagine what the 
composition of such a conference would be. "Would Indonesia be 
the host or not?" he said. 
  The idea must be developed and gain positive and wide-spread 
support. He asserted that the idea of holding an international 
conference is an Indonesian initiative, in President Suharto's 
position as chairman of the NAM. 
  Murdiono went on to say that both heads of state agreed to 
immediately open diplomatic relations. This means that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have an ambassador to Indonesia. An 
Indonesian ambassador would be accredited to Bosnia or to 
Sarajevo. However, he said that the matter cannot be resolved 
as easily as that because it is a high-level decision and would 
take time. "As an example, the Bosnian ambassador would not 
necessarily be located in Jakarta and the Indonesian ambassador 
would not necessarily be located in Sarajevo. But, as I said 
earlier, he could be accredited and he could be posted to 
Jakarta," the minister said. 
  As for the possibility that Indonesia would send military 
aid, Murdiono said that the matter had not been discussed at 
this meeting. "I only want to remind you that humanitarian aid 
has been sent there in the past," he explained. 
  Murdiono once again emphasized that the reasons behind the 
effort to lift the weapons embargo on Bosnia are that Bosnia is 
in a weaker position, from the point of view of the balance of 
power. That is why in the past President Suharto, as chairman of 
the NAM, instructed the ambassador and permanent representative 
of Indonesia to the UN to fight for the lifting of the embargo. 
Murdiono admitted that the fight had not yet been successful. 
  At the same time, at a news conference held after the talks, 
President Alija Izetbegovic said that Indonesia is a large and 
very influential country which is now in the position of 
chairman of the NAM from 1992 to 1995. Indonesia, he continued, 
is also influential in the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO). 
  Therefore, Izetbegovic respectfully asked President Suharto 
to use his influence in the NAM to lift the weapons embargo 
against Bosnia. "Because the embargo is really aimed at 
Yugoslavia, and Bosnia isn't Yugoslavia," said Izetbegovic. 
  Izetbegovic made his official remarks in English. But when 
he 
answered reporters' questions, he used his native language, 
which his son Sabina Berberovic then translated into English. He 
was accompanied by Subrata, director general of the PPG [Press 
and Graphics Development]; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign minister 
ad interim; by A. Tahir, ambassador-at-large for the European 
Region of the NAM; and by Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian 
ambassador and permanent representative to the UN in New York. 
  He said that the only way to achieve peace is through a 
balance of military power. Without this balance of military 
power, every negotiating technique will end up dictating against 
Bosnia. "That is why the Geneva peace talks failed," he said. 
  "That is also why I am asking President Suharto to use his 
influence with the ICO to continue their political support and 
humanitarian aid to Bosnia," added Izebegovic. He said that if 
the aggression goes on for a long time, the weapons embargo must 
also be matched by the imposition of an air embargo. This step 
is important in opposing Serbia and the other forces which are 
hampering the shipment of humanitarian aid to Bosnia. 
  Izetbegovic said that Bosnia is very similar to Indonesia in 
several respects. "Bosnia is also a multicultural, 
multireligious nation and a pluralistic society," he said. "We 
think that perhaps Indonesia and the Indonesian people alone can 
understand our problems," he added. 
  The talks between President Izetbegovic and President 
Suharto 
lasted from 9:30 to 10:30 AM West Indonesia time. At the same 
time, talks also took place between Nana Sutresna, the head of 
the BPK NAM, and Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador and 
permanent representative to the UN. 
  Izetbegovic considered his meeting with President Suharto to 
be very useful and constructive. Izetbegovic familiarized 
President Suharto with all aspects of the present situation and 
the history of the Bosnian crisis, especially its political and 
military aspects. In particular, he conveyed his thanks to the 
Indonesian nation and people, who have always supported the 
Bosnian people's struggle. 
  Murdiono said that President Suharto in turn familiarized 
his 
colleague from Bosnia with the history of the struggle of the 
Indonesian people from the time they obtained their freedom 
until they received international recognition. President Suharto 
emphasized that the struggle for Indonesian freedom required a 
combination of military struggle and diplomatic struggle. 
  After these private talks Izetbegovic prayed at the Istiqlal 
Mosque. Then, at about 12:00 noon, he kept to his promise to 
meet with reporters. Unfortunately, before the reporters could 
finish asking their questions, Director General of the PPG 
Subrata ended the meeting saying that President Izetbegovic had 
to leave for Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. 
  Earlier, the Indonesian Islamic Committee for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Al-Irsjad Institute had contributed 
money in the form of a check for $94,000, 64 rings, 15 necklaces 
and 33 earrings. All of these contributions, which were 
collected spontaneously, were handed over by Anwar Haryono, 
chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Missionizing Board and 
accepted by President Izetbegovic. 
  When he was saying his midday prayers at the Istiqlal 
Mosque, 
President Izetbegovic expressed his gratitude to the Islamic 
community, which had always taken part in the 
Bosnian-Herzegovinian struggle. He also expressed his admiration 
for the attitude of the Indonesian people, who have always 
helped and supported the Bosnian people's struggle. 
  He said that his visit to the Istiqlal Mosque had not been 
on 
the list of events or part of state protocol. He admitted that 
he had known of the existence of the Istiqlal Mosque for a long 
time. "That's why since I'm in Indonesia why not pray here and 
see this glorious mosque for myself," he said. 
  The Bosnian presidential party arrived at Istiqlal at 1:00 
pm 
West Indonesia time and that is why they prayed as a group. In 
one row there was President Izetbegovic hemmed in by Tarmizi 
Taher, minister of religion; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign 
minister ad interim; by Achmad Tahir, ambassador-at-large to the 
NAM for the European Area; and by Irfan Ljubijankic, the Bosnian 
foreign minister, who acted as prayer leader.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam telephoned U.S. President 
Clinton on the morning of 31 March and explained the result of 
his visit to Japan and China and discussed ways to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Following is a report by Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae 
[presidential residence]: 
  [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] In a telephone conversation 
with President Clinton this morning, President Kim revealed that 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, close cooperation 
between the ROK and the United States and establishing a 
cooperative system with Japan are important, and that, if 
possible, it is necessary to make efforts for China to take part 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  President Kim said that as revealed in the summit talks with 
President Jiang Zemin, he thinks that China will convey to North 
Korea that the ROK will not achieve reunification through the 
absorption of North Korea and that it has a firm will for 
maintaining peace. President Kim told President Clinton that 
cooperation with Russia is also necessary. 
  President Kim said that in the ROK-China summit talks, 
President Jiang Zemin emphasized that China believes that 
security on the Korean peninsula is most important, and that to 
achieve this, dialogue between the parties concerned is very 
important. While denying that some reports are false, President 
Kim stressed that the issue of deploying Patriot missiles and 
the Team Spirit exercise were not mentioned at all in the 
ROK-China summit talks. 
  In this connection, President Clinton said that he agrees 
that it is important to make efforts to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue by obtaining cooperation from China. President 
Clinton said that there is no objection to the fact that the 
resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue is the most 
desirable. He pointed out that it is difficult to hold dialogue 
because North Korea is not fulfilling its promises. 
  President Clinton said that the U.S. Government thinks that 
it must continue to demand that North Korea receive sufficient 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and resume 
North-South dialogue. He said that since it is not desirable to 
bring about a worst-case crisis regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue, we must deal with this issue prudently and step 
by step. 
  Today's telephone conversation started at 1000 [0100 GMT], 
lasting for 33 minutes. 
  This has been Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae. [end recording]

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak wants 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to include 
Australia and New Zealand in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), 
without giving them membership of the association. 
  Dr Suphachai revealed yesterday it was possible Australia 
and 
New Zealand would be asked to join AFTA, despite not being 
members of ASEAN. 
  Thailand will chair the ASEAN Economic Ministers' meeting 
this year and one of the issues to be discussed may be inviting 
new countries to join AFTA, he said. 
  Dr Suphachai said he personally believed the AFTA should 
include more countries, particularly Australia and New Zealand, 
to expand its multilateral trading opportunities. 
  If Thailand could compete effectively in terms of trade with 
Singapore, it was not out of the question that it could compete 
equally well with the developed Australia and New Zealand. 
  Both countries are potentially large markets for Thai 
exports 
which are produced at low cost such as chicken and textiles. 
  The issue may meet with resistance at the meeting as 
Malaysia 
and Indonesia had made it clear long ago that they did not want 
non-Asian countries to join the group. 
  Speeding up the implementation of AFTA, very likely from 15 
years to 10 years, ought to be approved in principle by all 
members. The terms and conditions, such as those involving 
exclusion lists and local content, may call for further 
discussion, he said. 
  It was widely believed that China may dominate all 
Indochinese and ASEAN countries in the future because of its 
strong potential and relationships with the people of these 
countries. Market expansion as a result of this may prove 
beneficial for Thailand since China is one of the largest 
markets in the world.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 31 Jan--The government will create an 
army capable of waging modern, conventional war in addition to 
developing an air force and navy as good as the country's 
financial resources permit. 
  Najib Tun Abdul Razak, the minister of defense, said that 
the 
government intends to undertake the balanced development of the 
three services, the army, navy, and air force. 
  He said: "We want balanced development in all of the 
services 
in the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM), in accordance with the 
concept of modern, conventional warfare. This is to make sure 
that the strength of the three services in the Malaysian Armed 
Forces is suitable and that they can support each other. The 
only problem is that our financial resources do not make it 
possible to develop the three services simultaneously. We will 
concentrate on the development of the Malaysian Army in the 
future." 
  He made this statement to reporters in Kuala Lumpur after 
receiving a visit from Gen Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, the 
commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, who will retire on 1 
February. 
  Najib said that the development of the Royal Malaysian Air 
Force (TUDM) is only the first phase in the development of the 
Malaysian Armed Forces as a whole. 
  He said: "In the future we will concentrate on the 
development of the army in accordance with the concept of 
modern, conventional warfare and the combined arms approach, 
which is very important for achieving a service which we can be 
proud of." 
  According to Najib, in the initial phase of achieving this 
objective the government will be forced to budget its available 
resources to increase the strategic assets of the Malaysian 
Armed Forces. 
  He said: "In the initial phase many of these strategic 
assets 
will involve the combat capability of the air force, because in 
conventional warfare the control of the air is very important, 
although it is not decisive. The function of the army is the 
final step in supporting the air force. However, the state of 
readiness of the army is also important. The government is aware 
of this, but our financial resources do not permit us to carry 
out simultaneous development. This will take time," he said. 
  At a preceding news conference Gen Abdul Rahman said that 
the 
development of the three services in the Malaysian Armed Forces 
needs to be balanced to permit all of them to carry out their 
respective functions effectively, if we become involved in war. 
  He said: "It is true that the army has been left behind, 
compared to development in other elements of the Malaysian Armed 
Forces, particularly during the last several years. This is 
because previously we emphasized resources, and army equipment 
for carrying on operations consisted of items left over from the 
struggle against the communist terrorists [1948-1960]. The army 
is not very well provided for in terms of its equipment. 
Therefore, we need to purchase more appropriate equipment for 
the army. To achieve the basic objective of national defense, we 
must improve the equipment of our armed forces in all aspects, 
including the army," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Fuji Photo Film Co. on 
Thursday [31 March] criticized the U.S. Government's decision to 
impose stiff penalty tariffs on its color photographic paper 
sold in the United States. 
  Washington imposed tariffs of 360.95 percent Wednesday, 
based 
on a preliminary ruling by the Commerce Department that Fuji 
Photo Film was selling the products in the U.S. at less than 
fair market value. The decision stems from a petition filed by 
Eastman Kodak Co. of the U.S., charging the Japanese company 
with selling photographic paper in the U.S. at only a quarter of 
the prices it charges for identical products in Japan. 
  A Fuji Photo Film executive said, "it is Eastman Kodak that 
can decide prices in the U.S. market and we cannot understand 
the allegation that Fuji is dumping its products to harm the 
U.S. industry." Regarding the huge margin of the penalty 
tariffs, he said the way they were calculated was not clear. 
  As reasons for the lower prices of the products in the U.S., 
the official cited the yen's appreciation against the dollar, 
sales incentive rewards, and costs of other services for 
processing laboratories in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan will continue to 
restrict exports of technology to countries that are considered 
likely to be involved in regional conflicts, after the 
disbandment of Cocom [Coordinating Commitee for Multilateral 
Export Controls], the western monitoring body of sensitive 
technology exports, government officials said Thursday [31 
March]. The officials of the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) said it is necessary to retain some curbs on 
technology which can be used for military purposes after Cocom 
dissolves. 
  They said the ministry will especially closely examine 
technology exports to countries which are likely to face future 
conflicts. 
  The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls 
will conclude its 45-year-old history Thursday midnight, having 
been made redundant by the ending of the Cold War. 
  A more broadly-based, flexible organization will succeed the 
agency by October. In the meantime, each nation will 
voluntarily retain curbs similar to those that were previously 
in place. 
  The MITI officials said technology exports to North Korea, 
Libya, Iraq and Iran will be strictly controled, while curbs on 
shipments to former communist nations will be relaxed. 
  They also said Japan, the United States, and the European 
Union (EU) will resume discussions in late April on the details 
of the new system, for example studying which items are to be 
controlled.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan is preparing to 
revise its export control order in April as the 17 members of 
Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], 
the Western agency to monitor sensitive technology and equipment 
exports, have agreed to terminate the organization on Thursday 
[31 March] midnight, the government said. 
  The revised cabinet order, however, will call for strict 
curbs on sensitive technology and equipment exports to North 
Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq as in the case of the United States 
and main European states, Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] officials said. 
  Curbs on shipments to former communist nations will be 
eased. 
  The amendment will retain the global export licensing system 
for the 113 items, covered by the list of the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), in 
preparation for possible regional conflicts, the officials said. 
They include high-technology computers and machine tools. 
  Under the system, however, applications to export such goods 
will be basically approved instead of prohibited, in principle. 
  Confirmation of the final destination for shipments of 
sensitive technology and equipment has so far been mandatory for 
exporters. Such a requirement will be abolished. 
  However, the export of 20 highly sensitive items like 
decoders and high-technology machine tools, will continue to be 
subject to strict global controls, the officials said. 
  Big trading house officials said, however, that the 
relaxations would not bring about a rapid increase in shipments 
of ex-Cocom embargo items to former communist states. They 
said there will be no big demand for such items in such 
countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe voiced support on Thursday [31 March] for Japan's 
bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council 
[UNSC] with veto rights, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
Juppe, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day 
stay, expressed his support in a meeting with his Japanese 
counterpart Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. 
  Juppe said in a meeting with Hata it is necessary to enlarge 
the Security Council and the number of its permanent members to 
reflect the current world situation, they said. "In this 
context, it is natural for Japan and Germany" to acquire 
permanent seats, he was quoted as saying. 
  Juppe added that France does not want to create new 
categories for permanent members such as creating permanent 
members without veto power. "France wants to maintain the 
current system," he reportedly told Hata, adding it is necessary 
to enlarge the council but also to maintain its efficiency. 
  He also noted the need to take into account regional 
allocations when considering enlargement of the permanent 
members, the officials said. "In any case, France's position is 
flexible," Juppe was quoted as saying. 
  Juppe's remarks were the clearest support yet by a French 
Government official for Japan's bid for a permanent seat, 
according to the officials. 
  Hata said Japan would carry out its responsibilities within 
its capacity. 
  Turning to problems involving North Korea's alleged 
development of nuclear weapons, Juppe and Hata agreed on the 
need for the international community to take a firm stance to 
tackle the issue, the officials said. Juppe told Hata that 
France, which currently chairs the U.N. Security Council, 
considers the problem very important and is very concerned, they 
said. 
  Touching on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum, Juppe said France wants to have some kind of dialogue 
with APEC because it has close relations with the region, 
according to the officials. Hata replied that Japan thinks APEC 
should be open and wants to promote transparency of APEC's 
activities, the officials said. 
  Also during the meeting covering a wide range of topics, 
Hata 
urged France to continue to refrain from conducting nuclear 
tests, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- A record number of 
Japanese Diet members have signed a letter to be sent to the UN 
chief calling for freedom for Nobel peace prize winner Aung San 
Suu Kyi and civilian rule in Myanmar [Burma], the Burmese 
Association in Japan said Thursday [31 March]. 
  Of a total of 763 Diet members, 403 have already put their 
signatures to a petition to be sent to UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the association said in a press release. 
Similar signature campaigns are being carried out in 108 
countries around the world, it said. 
  A copy of the letter said the legislators will urge the 
United Nations to do all in its power to see that Suu Kyi and 
all political leaders are unconditionally released. It also 
called for a "swift and complete implementation of a transition 
to civilian rule." 
  The group hopes to receive 500 signatures of Diet members 
through the good offices of United Social Democratic Party 
leader Satsuki Eda by the time the letter is sent, said 
association president Win Naing. 
  This is the second such letter to Butrus-Ghali. The first 
plea by 374 Diet members was delivered to the secretary 
general's office in March 1993 by Eda. 
  Last April 422 Diet members urged the government to put 
pressure on Myanamr for Suu Kyi's release. 
  A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which 
won the 1990 election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been under 
house arrest since July 1989. She was scheduled to be freed 
next July but the ruling military junta extended her detention 
period for another year.

  [Text] Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, now on an official 
visit to Japan, has urged that country to relocate in Bangladesh 
its industries which have become commercially disadvantageous. 
She was addressing the inaugural session at the seventh meeting 
of Bangladesh-Japan Committee for commercial and economic 
cooperation. Begum Zia said due to fast progress in technology 
and high labor cost some industries have ceased to be 
commercially viable in Japan. Bangladesh offers to host these 
relocations to the mutual benefit of both our countries. The 
prime minister said excellent bilateral political relations 
between the two countries (?naturally) translated into 
increasingly active and mutually beneficial economic 
cooperation, trade and tourism. She said the promising 
opportunities in Bangladesh for Japanese investors and 
entrepreneurs need to be materialized for the benefit of the two 
countries. Begum Zia drew the attention of the Joint Committee 
to the increased cooperation between the two countries in the 
fields of trade, investment and tourism. 
  Highlighting the present social-political conditions in 
Bangladesh, the prime minister said it has been able to 
establish social-political stability through democratically 
elected government. She said the present government is fully 
committed to further strengthening and broadening the democratic 
basis of the society. 
  Listing the success in the economic policies of the country, 
Begum Zia said international financial organizations, like World 
Bank and the IMF, have appreciated the economic policies of 
Bangladesh. She said increased food production, faster growth 
of export-oriented industries and the recent interest of foreign 
investors in Bangladesh testify to the soundness of nation's 
macroeconomic management. Begum Zia said in Bangladesh 
privatization is being encouraged through new policies and 
institutions. Bangladesh's economy is now thriving in the midst 
of market forces. The prime minister said liberalization of our 
trade has moved at a rate much faster than that of country's 
immediate neighbors. She said new opportunities have been 
created for foreign trade and investment. The prime minister 
said Bangladesh encourages the strong role for the private 
sector and strengthening its banking system and stock markets. 
The country's laws fully protect foreign investment. Begum Zia 
said the Joint Committee can play a further significant role in 
disseminating in Japan the relevant information on attractive 
investment opportunities in Bangladesh. She hoped the committee 
will continue to play a dynamic and innovating role in 
generating increasing interest among Japanese traders, investors 
and tourists of Bangladesh.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Bangladesh Prime Minister 
Begum Khaleda Ziaur on Thursday [31 March] reiterated her 
country's support for Japan's "legitimate aspirations" for a 
permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council [UNSC]. Ziaur, 
speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, said 
Japan deserves "a more effective institutional role" in the U.N. 
system in general and in the Security Council in particular by 
virtue of its status as an Asian "economic superpower." 
  The 48-year-old premier, one of only three women now serving 
as head of an Islamic country, said Bangladesh's support stems 
from its belief "that the leadership and positive posture of 
Japan are important for further strengthening the role of Asia 
in international relations." 
  Ziaur earlier made a considerably stronger declaration of 
support at a dinner banquet hosted by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday, in which she told her host country, "We are 
totally behind you in your effort to be a permanent member of 
the Security Council." 
  In summit talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, she was quoted as 
offering to drum up support for Japan's bid among other 
countries with which Bangladesh maintains close relations. 
  Ziaur told reporters that ties between Bangladesh and Japan 
are "excellent." Expressing appreciation for Japanese 
assistance, she noted that it has so far been aimed at 
supporting democratic progress, economic reforms and social 
development. In an implicit request for continued aid, 
especially grants, she added, "We expect continued Japanese 
support for social sectors such as primary and mass education, 
primary health care, poverty alleviation and environmental 
development." 
  Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for an official visit, 
is scheduled to return home via Osaka on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Prime Ministers Morihiro 
Hosokawa of Japan and Begum Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh issued a 
joint press statement Thursday [31 March] saying Zia's official 
visit to Japan has served to strengthen bilateral relations. 
The statement said that in summit talks on Tuesday, Hosokawa 
hailed Zia's efforts for democratization and economic 
development. 
  Zia outlined her government's achievements in consolidating 
democracy, implementing economic reforms and pursuing social and 
economic development, it said. She explained her policies aimed 
at alleviating poverty, creating rural employment and improving 
primary education and basic health care. 
  Zia expressed gratitude for Japan's economic assistance to 
date and for its new offer to cofinance a major bridge spanning 
the Jamuna River, which should serve to promote economic 
development in the northern areas of Bangladesh. 
  The statement said Hosokawa urged Bangladesh to take care to 
ensure that Japan's official development assistance (ODA) is 
implemented promptly and smoothly. 
  It said the two countries agreed to start negotiations on 
concluding a bilateral agreement concerning the encouragement 
and protection of investment. 
  Zia, who arrived in Japan on Monday for a five-day official 
visit, reconfirmed Bangladesh's support for the permanent 
membership of Japan on the UN Security Council, the statement 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan loaned more than 1 
trillion yen to 27 countries in fiscal 1993, a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said Thursday [31 March]. It also provided a 
record high of 999 million yen in small-scale aid grants to 54 
nations and one region, the official said. 
  Japan extended a total of 1.034 trillion yen in loans, down 
13 percent from the previous fiscal year, the official said. Of 
the loans that covered 111 projects in 27 countries, 812 billion 
yen, or 80 percent, went to Asia, the official said. 
  Japan extended loans totaling 6.5 billion yen to Kyrgyzstan, 
making it the first Central Asian nation to receive Japanese yen 
loans. Japan also extended a 52.3 billion yen loan to Vietnam 
for the first time. 
  Yen loans for environmental projects reached 148.7 billion 
yen, the official said. 
  Japan's small-scale grassroots assistance to recipients such 
as nongovernmental organizations, medical and educational 
institutions was up 42.8 percent from the previous year. 
  The aid covered 258 projects in the educational, medical and 
environmental fields, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- A senior government 
official said Thursday [31 March] the yen's recent spurt against 
the U.S. dollar does not reflect the economic fundamentals of 
Japan. Hideaki Kumano, vice minister for administrative affairs 
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), also 
said the yen's advance will have a negative impact on both the 
Japanese and global economies. 
  The Japanese currency has steadily gained ground in recent 
sessions on speculation that Washington may talk up the yen to 
extract further concessions from Japan on stalled bilateral

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Food Agency announced 
Tuesday [29 March] that Japan will import another 150,000 tons 
of rice from the United States, Australia and China by the end 
of August, to bring the total amount of emergency imports of the 
grain to 2.65 million tons this year. 
  The emergency step is aimed at making a sufficient supply of 
rice available to consumers in the preharvest period, agency 
officials said. Japan suffered the worst rice harvest in 
postwar days last year, necessitating the emergency imports. 
  The officials said blended rice will be sold at a ratio of 
70 
percent domestic rice to 30 percent imported rice from 
September, with domestic rice taking a dominant share compared 
with the 30-70 percent ratio expected in April through July. 
  From October, consumers are expected to buy domestic brands 
almost entirely, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- An electric appliance 
discount chain store without a license to sell rice decided 
Wednesday to call off the planned rice sales next Sunday [3 
April] after discussing the matter with the Food Agency and the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government. "The three sides concluded the 
talks by deciding we should donate the rice," said Toshio 
Miyaji, president of the Tokyo-based Jonan Denki Co. 
  About 15 tons of rice the company has bought from farmers in 
Ogata, Akita Prefecture, will be donated to old people's homes 
with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government helping in its 
distribution. 
  Jonan Denki's store in Tokyo's Suginami ward sold rice last 
Sunday in defiance of the Food Agency's warning that selling 
rice without a government license is a violation of the Food 
Control Law. About 2,000 people lined up to buy about 12 tons 
of brand-name rice produced in Ogata. 
  The bad weather last year has made domestically grown rice 
scarce, and consumers have been queuing and paying high prices 
for domestic rice since February.

  [Text] Kumamoto, March 31 KYODO -- The head of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture has said 
he received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa when Hosokawa ran for the 
governorship on the LDP ticket. 
  Kenshi Yonehara, head of the LDP's Kumamoto chapter, said in 
an interview that he does not know whether the money was part of 
the 100 million yen Hosokawa said he borrowed from the 
scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co. around that time. Yonehara 
said he received the money in December 1982 from a senior member 
of the chapter who had worked to put Hosokawa on the LDP ticket 
for the election in February the following year. 
  Yonehara said the 1 million yen was handed over after the 
LDP 
approved Hosokawa as its official candidate in the race, 
reversing the initial decision to field then Gov. Issei Sawada 
as the party's candidate. Hosokawa won the election and served 
for two consecutive four-year terms until February 1991. 
  Hosokawa has said that he borrowed the money in September 
1982 to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home 
in the prefecture in western Japan, and repaid it by January 31, 
1991. The premier has insisted there were no illegalities in 
the loan. 
  The LDP, ousted from 38 years of unbroken rule last August 
by 
the coalition administration of Hosokawa, and the Japanese 
Communist Party have been holding up debate on the budget in the 
Diet by demanding Hosokawa submit detailed documents on the loan. 
  The opposition has also demanded Hosokawa's former secretary 
testify before the Diet on the affair, which had stalled Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget for three weeks. 
  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct member of the Sagawa 
Kyubin group, was embroiled in a money scandal involving 
gangsters and political figures, including fallen LDP kingpin 
Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax evasion last March.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [31 March] reiterated his denial of 
allegations that he obtained funds in a dubious way from a 
scandal-wrecked trucking firm and through stock transactions. 
Hosokawa was speaking at a meeting of the House of Councillors 
budget committee. 
  Answering questions from Tatsuo Shimizu of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa denied suggestions that he had 
not repaid 100 million yen he received in 1982 from the Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking group and that the money was not a loan but a 
secret political donation. 
  Hosokawa said he has collected as much evidence as he could 
and submitted it to the Diet. The documents he has submitted 
were enough to prove "the fact that I borrowed 100 million yen 
and repaid it," he said. 
  The premier has said he has lost the receipt for the loan 
repayment, and had the Sagawa Kyubin group submit related 
documents, including a photocopy of the receipt, to the Diet 
last December. Shimizu suggested the submitted documents are 
fakes. 
  Hosokawa said the fact that he had offered his vacation 
house 
in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, as collateral and later had 
the company return the collateral shows that he repaid the loan. 
  Shimizu, however, said collateral can be canceled upon an 
agreement between the lender and the borrower, thus a 
cancellation does not necessarily mean Hosokawa repaid the money. 
  The prime minister also denied allegations that he 
personally 
had a hand in the 1986 purchase of 300 shares of 
telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT). "Even supposing it was my deal, what's wrong with that?" 
the premier retorted, prompting uproar and a temporary halt in 
the Diet deliberations, which were held ostensibly to debate the 
fiscal 1994 provisional budget program. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly told the Diet that the share 
transaction was conducted by his late father-in-law. 
  Stock consultant Shuzo Fujiki said Wednesday the NTT deal 
was 
Hosokawa's. The premier told the House of Representatives 
budget committee on Wednesday that he has never met, nor sought 
advice from, Fujiki. 
  Fujiki said he arranged a 418 million yen loan for a then 
aide of Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help 
finance the purchase of 300 NTT shares in 1986, just after NTT 
went public. 
  According to Fujiki, the stock investment financing company 
agreed to allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at 
the request of Hosokawa's Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama. 
  Shimizu asked the committee to summon Fujiki as a witness. 
He also reiterated demands to summon Miyama. 
  Hosokawa repeated his objection to summoning Miyama, saying 
such testimony may violate the human rights of the former 
secretary's family. 
  When Shimizu compared the Hosokawa allegations to the 
Whitewater scandal afflicting U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
his wife, Hosokawa responded by saying that the political 
systems of the two countries are different. 
  Hosokawa commented that he is obliged to appear before the 
Diet, while the U.S. presidential system does not mandate 
comparable appearances by Clinton. 
  During the lunch break of the committee deliberations, 
Hosokawa denied to reporters the truth of a statement by the 
head of the LDP chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture who said he 
received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Hosokawa's 
race for the prefectural governorship on the LDP ticket at the 
time. 
  Hosokawa came to power last August, promising change in 
Japan's money-driven politics. But his political foes in the 
Diet have been relentless in their attempts to prove his alleged 
involvement in a series of money scandals involving NTT, Sagawa 
Kyubin and other businesses and parties. 
  Hosokawa has rejected demands from the LDP and the Japanese 
Communist Party to produce more data pertaining to the Sagawa 
Kyubin affair and other related cases.

<F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Candidates with high 
English-speaking ability may have the edge when the new central 
bank governor is appointed in December, bank sources said. 
  Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor Yasushi Mieno himself hinted 
that such language skill is one key element to fulfilling his 
post during Japan's growing role in the global financial scene, 
according to sources close to Mieno. Mieno's four-year term 
comes to a close on December 16. 
  A former senior Finance Ministry official said, "Mieno once 
told me that interpreters are available during official regular 
meetings of the BIS (the Bank for International Settlements) but 
not at such unofficial occasions as luncheons." The 
international organization based in Basel, Switzerland, acts as 
a bank for central banks of major industrialized nations. 
  "Without confidence in English ability, Mieno said that one 
becomes very tired after desperately listening and being 
concerned about missing important points," said the official who 
requested anonymity. 
  Meetings among the finance ministers and central bankers 
from 
the Group of Seven (G-7) major nations and financial leaders for 
the Washington-based International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank are numerous. "Mieno attends meetings without interpreters 
case by case because he has a sufficient command of English," a 
BOJ source said. Mieno once served as the central bank director 
stationed in New York. 
  Indeed, many instances have proven that English conversation 
skill provides advantages to Japan in global monetary affairs. 
An international financial source said unofficial talks -- 
rather, chatting -- are important now that policy coordination 
has become the centerpiece at international gatherings, 
especially in sounding out one another's true intentions. 
  He also cited frequent round-the-clock contacts through 
telephone hot lines amid increasing cross-border dealings in 
currency and other markets. 
  For the past five terms, former vice finance ministers and 
career BOJ officials have taken turns filling the post of BOJ 
governor. As to the candidates most likely to succeed Mieno, 
recent Japanese press reports have narrowed down the list of 
four former vice finance ministers to two -- Yasuo Matsushita 
and Yoshihiko Yoshino. 
  Informed sources said Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank, 
is 
tipped as the top candidate because Yoshino, president of the 
Japan Development Bank, maintains his stance on rejecting strong 
recommendations from some senior BOJ and Finance Ministry 
officials. 
  Matsushita, 68, served as vice finance minister -- the 
ministry's highest post for career bureaucrats -- for two years 
from June 1982. Yoshino, 63, assumed the post from 1986 to 1988. 
  In terms of a command in English, Matsushita is known for 
his 
superb ability among the four candidates.

  [Text] Fukui, March 30 KYODO -- Activists of the 
international environmental organization Greenpeace arrived 
Wednesday [30 March] aboard the patrol boat MV Greenpeace in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to protest the start-up of Japan's 
prototype fast breeder reactor Monju there. 
  During the 10-day port call at Tsuruga, Captain Arne 
Sorensen 
and 18 Greenpeace activists will inform local residents of the 
dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo 
exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman Etsuko Ikeda said. 
  The fast breeder operated by the governmental Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. will soon reach what is 
called "criticality," the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is 
self-sustaining. Ikeda said Greenpeace estimates Monju will 
reach criticality on April 8. 
  The reactor, which uses a mixture of highly toxic plutonium 
and enriched uranium as fuel, will then produce 280,000 
kilowatts of electricity. 
  In a recent report, Greenpeace warned that Monju "could 
explode like an atomic bomb, killing thousands and contaminating 
most population centers in Japan and neighboring countries." 
  Greenpeace also alleged that the Japanese Government is 
withholding important data on the safety risk posed by Monju. 
Noting that the original safety assessment for the fast breeder 
was undertaken over 10 years ago, Greenpeace called for a new 
safety review and a full environmental impact statement. 
  On its previous mission last October, the MV Greenpeace 
monitored nuclear waste dumped into the Sea of Japan by Russia 
and the former Soviet Union.

  [Text] After four rounds of official and unofficial 
discussions, the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted and 
announced today a presidential statement urging North Korea to 
comply with the obligations of the nuclear safeguard accord. 
The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from UN 
headquarters. 
  [Begin Nam recording] The UNSC held a plenary meeting on the 
morning of 1 April Korean time and unanimously adopted a 
presidential statement urging North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections. Saying that the statement was adopted upon 
agreement of all the UNSC member states, Jean-Bernard Merimee, 
president of the UNSC, read the statement in which indirect 
expressions replaced precise wordings of additional measures on 
North Korea and a negotiation deadline. 
  In the presidential statement adopted today, the clause 
regarding additional measures on North Korea was mildly 
expressed by stating that additional evaluation will be made on 
the compliance of the agreement with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] if North Korea refuses nuclear inspections. 
  As to the negotiation deadline, which was one month, no 
specific date was fixed, but the IAEA secretary-general is to 
report the result of negotiations with North Korea to the UNSC 
at the next inspection. The presidential statement comprises 
five articles including that the UNSC will continue to deal with 
the North Korean nuclear issue and urge North-South dialogue. 
  Today's statement was a presidential statement, which is 
milder than a binding resolution, without any strong expression 
including sanctions or measures on North Korea. It is analyzed 
that China had strong influence on the statement and the United 
States, United Kingdom, and France made considerable concessions. 
  However, a high-ranking official of the ROK mission to the 
United Nations, said that the United States explained the draft 
statement to the ROK in advance and evaluated that it is more 
meaningful to adopt a presidential statement with the 
participation of China and have China actively involved in the 
North Korean nuclear issue in the future than to adopt a 
resolution and exclude a few countries from measures on North 
Korea. [end recording]

  [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said here on Friday that the just-adopted 
statement of the U.N. Security Council president constitutes a 
strong message to North Korea over the nuclear question. 
  In a press conference at the Watergate Hotel where he was 
staying, Han said the statement would be a "tremendous pressure" 
on North Korea especially because China is supposed to take part 
in next-phase steps set to be taken if North Korea does not heed 
the message. 
  "The statement is highly significant in that it was 
unanimously approved by the whole 15 member nations of the 
Security Council," Han said. He was on a visit here to discuss 
nuclear-related follow-up steps with Washington officials. 
  On the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of additional 
inspections, Han said the statement did not give it but Hans 
Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), reported that there should be additional IAEA 
inspections within six months. 
  Discussing the background that led China to change its 
initial stand and agree to include a clause on additional steps 
in the statement, Han said President Kim Yong-sam's talks with 
the Chinese leadership during his recent visit to Beijing, had 
paid off. 
  "There were communications between South Korea and China 
during the Security Council meeting, too," Minister Han said. 
  China, Han said, gave word that it would play a role in 
support of Korean peninsula's denuclearization and peace and 
stability on the peninsula. 
  "China expressly showed it (through deeds) by supporting the 
statement," Minister Han said.

  [Text] Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United 
Nations, told reporters after the UN Security Council adopted 
the president's statement on North Korea that, since North Korea 
has fulfilled its duties under agreements with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will not allow any kind of 
inspection by the IAEA from this point of time [hyon sijomeso 
oddon hyongtaeui IAEA sachalto hoyonghaji anul pangchimirago]. 
  Ambassador Pak Kil-yon insisted that the adoption of the UN 
Security Council president's statement will not help to resolve 
the nuclear issue and he stressed the need to resume high-level 
talks between North Korea and the United States, saying that 
only North Korean-U.S. negotiations will help in resolving the 
nuclear issue. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the North Korean Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs reacted negatively [pujongjogin panung] to the 
Russian proposal for holding eight-party talks on the North 
Korean nuclear issue, expressing concerns about the possibility 
that it will complicate the issue.

  [Text] Moscow, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov, declaring that Russia's position on the North 
Korean nuclear dispute remains unchanged, has said that North 
Korea must fulfill its obligations as a member of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  In an interview published in the daily IZVESTIYA Friday, 
Panov said Moscow would support the U.N. Security Council in 
adopting a resolution demanding outside inspection of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities. 
  Commenting on his earlier statement that Russia would have 
to 
intervene automatically to militarily assist North Korea under a 
bilateral treaty if North Korea was attacked, Panov said his 
remark had been distorted by the press. 
  The Russian position on the military assistance treaty 
between the former Soviet Union and North Korea has not changed 
from what it was a year ago, he said. 
  Panov said Russia would decide whether to fulfill its 
obligations under the 1961 treaty with North Korea after 
considering the differences between then and now and analyzing 
the situation on the basis of Russia's national interest, while 
bearing in mind its international obligations including the 
non-proliferation treaty. 
  Panov stressed there is no threat of any unprovoked attack 
on 
North Korea at present, thus hinting that Moscow has no ground 
for providing military support to Pyongyang, the newspaper said. 
  Russia tries to make use of the Korean situation to 
strengthen its position in Asia, the paper said. But Russia 
does not want a conflict with Seoul and Washington over this 
issue, it said, noting that Russia, unlike China, is ready to 
support a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Thousands of North Korean 
loggers in the far eastern area of Russia have been working at 
nearby vegetable fields lately, Radio Moscow reported on 
Thursday. 
  According to the NAEWOE PRESS here, the radio said about 
7,000 North Korean loggers were working at vegetable fields in 
the Khabarovsk Province after Russia and North Korea failed to 
resolve the issue of renewing their logging agreement that 
expired at the end of last year. 
  It went on to say that the internal affairs authorities of 
Khabarovsk urged the North Korean consulate general in the area 
to strictly abide by rules on foreigners employment while a 
large fine was imposed on a Russian industry for employing the 
North Korean loggers without a proper permit. 
  The Khabarovsk authorities fear that the North Korean 
loggers 
may become "second Vietnamese," said the radio, reminding that 
tens of thousands of Vietnamese people who worked in Russia in 
the past scattered all across Russia as illegal traffickers.

  [Text] Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek strongly 
denounced on April 1 U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's remark that 
the United States is prepared to stop North Korea from 
developing nuclear weapons even at the risk of war. He said 
such remarks are aggravating the risk of war on the Korean 
peninsula just as much as North Korea's mentioning Seoul as a 
sea of fire. 
  Chairman Yi Ki-taek met with journalists this morning and 
said that Defense Secretary Perry's remarks may be one of the 
double-faced, hard and moderate tactics of the United States but 
are intimidating the people of the ROK. 
  Chairman Yi Ki-taek also said that diplomatic and security 
policy regarding sanctions on North Korea should not cause 
confusion and that the president should have a clear picture of 
the situation and replace inharmonious diplomatic and security 
policymakers.

  [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
made a telephone call to Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa Friday afternoon to exchange opinions on recent 
developments of common interest. 
  In the telephone conversation that lasted 14 minutes 
beginning 4:30 P.M., President Kim explained about his recent 
visit to China and exchanged views on the U.N. Security Council 
president's statement adopted earlier in the day on the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said 
the president stressed during the call that there is no change 
in his conviction that there absolutely needs joint efforts 
among South Korea, United States and Japan to resolve the 
nuclear issue. 
  Kim expressed satisfaction at the U.N. Security Council 
president's statement, saying that since the statement reflected 
opinions of China. China is expected to make closer cooperation 
in getting the nuclear issue settled. 
  The president also said that during his recent visit to 
China, he made it clear that South Korea does not want to see 
North Korea isolated from the rest of the world nor is Seoul 
interested in achieving unification by absorbing North Korea. 
  Hosokawa said in the telephone talks that Japan, too, 
supports the U.N. Security Council president's statement 
because he said it calls for what North Korea ought to do. 
  The Japanese premier said he expects there will be full 
exchange of opinions when South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu visits Japan on April 3, the Chongwadae spokesman said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Japan has not detected 
any signs that North Korea is about to provoke a war against the 
South, despite rumors of a crisis on the peninsula caused by 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program, a Japanese newspaper 
quoted a Defense Ministry source as saying Friday. 
  The source, who has collected and analyzed various data on 
North Korean military moves, said the communist state is not in 
a state of extreme tension nor is it taking any preparatory 
action for war, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported. 
  "There is no strange sign in North Korea. We cannot catch 
any change in communications or frequency in North Korean 
military bases. They did not stop periodical reconnaissance 
flights either," the source was quoted as saying. 
  Defense Ministry staff do not think an emergency will arise 
at this stage, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Does the Government Change Its North </F>
Korean Nuclear Policy again?"] 
  [Text] The government's North Korean nuclear policy is 
shaking once again. After meeting with the Chinese leaders, 
President Kim Yong-sam -- who promised in a meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa to "closely cooperate with 
Japan" to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue -- is moving in 
the direction of "resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue." 
This happened only five days after he visited China. 
  When President Kim Yong-sam left Seoul for China, it was the 
government's position that it would persuade China to stand with 
the other permanent member states of the UN Security Council to 
discuss sanctions against North Korea. According to the outcome 
of the ROK-PRC talks, however, President Kim was likely to be 
persuaded by President Jiang Zemin with China's logic that North 
Korea must not be aggravated. 
  Regarding the government's policy change, the government 
said 
that it would expect China -- as the only state that can 
persuade North Korea to accept the nuclear inspections -- to be 
a mediator in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  There may be some reasons for the government's change of 
policy, but what makes the people at home and abroad feel 
embarrassment regarding the issue is that its uncertain policy 
can cause harm to the country' reputation, as well as badly 
affecting its security system. This is why we worry over the 
government's uncertain policy. 
  We must, first, consider relations with the United States, 
as 
well as Japan with which we have cooperated in strengthening the 
joint effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, 
the government may lose its credit in diplomatic circles because 
it has decided to delay all ongoing meetings regarding the UN 
Security Council's sanctions against North Korea. Even the 
United States has denounced the government's unfixed nuclear 
policy toward North Korea. 
  In addition to this, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK ambassador to 
China, said that "we would discuss the issue with the United 
States, as well as with China," and that "we would even work 
together with China to resolve it." We cannot but be stunned by 
his remarks. These remarks indicate that the government will 
introduce China's active participation in the settlement of the 
North Korean nuclear issue. Up to now, the United States, South 
Korea, and North Korea have mainly made efforts to resolve the 
issue. Also, this can cause confusion in our country's security 
system, as well as in the basic direction of our diplomacy, 
which we have so far carried out centering on the United States 
and Japan. 
  We wonder how the ambassador -- even though he is neither 
the 
relevant official in charge of policy affairs nor the 
responsible official in charge of diplomatic affairs -- could 
make such remarks at an ambassador-level position. This 
indicates that there are some problems in the diplomatic 
organization. 
  The present international trends around the Korean peninsula 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue look like the ones in 
which the great powers struggled against each other in the late 
period of the Yi Dynasty. There are even signs regarding these 
trends. China has already pressured the ROK Government 
regarding ROK policy under the pretext of its influence over 
North Korea. Recently, Russia, which had so far remained silent 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, proposed to hold an 
eight-party international conference. Even an organ published by 
the National Defense Ministry reported that Russia should take 
the lead in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. On the 
other hand, the Russian deputy foreign minister suddenly said 
that the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and 
North Korea, a military treaty, can be initiated [paltong] when 
North Korea is invaded. 
  This means that all great powers concerned with Korea will 
competitively participate in the Korean peninsula issue. A 
century ago, we already had a bitter experience with these kinds 
of struggles conducted by the great powers regarding the Korean 
peninsula. The country's main pillar must not be shaken because 
of a diplomatic issue such as the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy F. Kunadze has 
warned that the South Korean decision to resume its joint 
military exercise with the United States, Team Spirit, and to 
deploy the Patriot antimissile system might be taken by North 
Korea as "provocative" and therefore, lead it to misjudge the 
South's real intentions. 
  "If they do see these steps as provocative, won't they make 
some final conclusions on the basis of that kind of opinion?" he 
said in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD. 
  The envoy also doubted whether the decision to take the 
steps 
would be effective in ensuring North Korea's full acceptance of 
international nuclear inspections. 
  "From the viewpoint of a citizen of a third country, I would 
say that I wonder about the strategic value and military 
importance of these exercises and these missiles to be 
introduced into South Korea," he said. 
  Kunadze called for more efforts toward a peaceful solution 
of 
the problem, saying that related countries still have time to 
explore additional possibilities to persuade North Korea to be 
"reasonable." 
  He said efforts not to further isolate North Korea are as 
important as strong and decisive actions against it. 
  But he does not agree with the so-called package deal 
between 
North Korea and the United States, which implies a linkage in 
negotiations. 
  "Out of my personal conviction as a diplomat and also a 
student of international relations, I'm not in favor of package 
deals. I'm not in favor of a linkage as a tool of diplomacy." 
  Russia, however, would not oppose a U.N. Security Council 
decision to impose punitive actions against North Korea, he said. 
  He said the council needs a consensus among members in order 
to decide any measures concerning Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
  The Russian government is not going to stand in the way of 
consensus at the council, "whatever this consensus is," the 
ambassador noted. 
  Kunadze came here in January but had been well-known in 
Korea 
before then. He had visited here six times as a senior 
researcher of the Institute of World Economy and International 
Relations (IMEMO) and as a vice foreign minister later. 
  He was one of the Russians who arranged Moscow visits in 
1989 
and 1990 by President Kim Yong-sam, who was then a political 
leader. 
  "My modest part can be described as facilitating the 
meetings 
between Mr. Kim Yong-sam and Soviet leaders," he said about his 
role. 
  Kunadze said the President said he would like to visit 
Moscow 
this year when he met him at Chongwadae in February to present 
his credentials. But he did not reveal when Kim plans to go to 
Moscow. Earlier reports said the visit will occur sometime in 
June. 
  The ambassador hoped that Seoul and Moscow conclude 
negotiations on financial compensation for the land that was 
owned by the Russian Legation from the end of the 19th century 
but now belongs to the Korean government or individuals before 
the President visits Russia. 
  Kunadze reaffirmed that Russia, despite its friendship and 
mutual assistance treaty with North Korea, would not help it if 
the Communist country attempted some kind of attack on another 
nation. 
  But he made it clear that Moscow would not discard the 
treaty, saying, "Russia, being a successor state to the former 
Soviet Union, is not in the position to abrogate any kind of 
international agreements" that it had concluded with others. 
  The treaty signed between the former Soviet Union and North 
Korea in the 1960s provides a security guarantee for North Korea 
in case of unprovoked attacks from the outside. 
  Kunadze claimed that this pact would not encourage North 
Korea to commit itself to any irresponsible behavior. 
  Concerning the issue of North Korean refugees who fled from 
logging camps in Siberia, the ambassador said Moscow has never 
been formally consulted by Seoul on that matter. 
  He said Russia would not object if South Korea decides to 
accept the refugees. 
  He said Moscow does not consider this issue in a political 
context but sees it as a matter related to human rights. He 
said Russian laws do not restrict travel by foreigners with 
valid passports, and therefore the Seoul government is the one 
which should make a decision. 
  The envoy called on South Koreans to study the Russian 
offers 
to repay Seoul's $1.47 billion loans on a purely commercial 
basis. 
  He said in any commercial deal, what counts most are quality 
and price. That apparently includes deals in Russian weaponry 
provided it is competitive in price and good in quality. 
  "I do not think any political strings should be attached to 
the forthcoming deals either on the side of the Russian 
government or on the side of Koreans," he said. 
  He does not see any political obstacles to developing 
relations with Korea in any fields including military technology 
transfer, the envoy added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- U.S. trade pressure on 
South Korea this year will focus on the country's annual 1.1 
million-car market, Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry 
officials said Friday. 
  In a comprehensive survey of the practices of its trading 
partners called the National Trade Estimate (NTE) released 
recently, the U.S. Government designated South Korea as a 
country erecting unfair barriers in the automobile sector -- a 
target of investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative under 
the revised Super 301 Trade Provision -- the officials said 
after analyzing the NTE report. 
  Less pressure is expected on the country's services and 
intellectual property markets. 
  Washington demanded that Seoul remove or lower such trade 
walls as auto import duties, car taxes and national campaigns 
against luxury imports that limited automobile imports to 1,463, 
or 0.2 percent, of the 1.1 million-unit market last year. 
  Early this year, the government lowered car import duties to 
the European union level of 10 percent, yielding to U.S. 
pressure, but Washington continues pressing for a further cut to 
2.5 percent, the same as the American rate. It also demands 
removal of restrictions on foreign car advertising and dealers. 
  The officials said the U.S. call for a further cut in car 
import duties is unacceptable because Washington "is putting 
this demand to Korea only, putting aside many advanced 
countries." 
  They admitted, however, that the 15-percent acquisition tax 
on cars priced 70 million won or more is too high compared with 
the 2-percent tax on autos worth less than 70 million won, 
suggesting that the tax on luxury cars will be lowered. 
  Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su will meet 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during talks on economic 
cooperation slated for April 4-5 and again during the GATT 
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial meeting 
opening in Morocco on April 12. He will also visit Washington 
in May in a bid to ease trade friction over automobiles. 
  Meanwhile, trade circles expect American pressure for a 
broader opening of the services market, intensified protection 
of intellectual property rights and a further reduction in 
export subsidies to ease somewhat, as many of the U.S. demands 
related to these issues were met during the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade negotiations last year. 
  But Washington will include South Korea in the priority 
watch 
list being announced at the end of April to push for a wider 
Korean market opening.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government 
welcomed Japan's announced market-opening measures in a 
commentary Wednesday, saying it looks forward to a more concrete 
and effective follow-up in June. 
  Although Japan's market opening package requires further 
study, it proposes specific ways to reduce the country's trade 
surplus, increase public investment and advance deregulation, a 
Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "We evaluate highly the sincere efforts for market opening 
by 
the Japanese Government, such as expansion of domestic demand 
and increasing imports," he said. 
  "We hope that the plan's specific contents will be wrapped 
up 
in June and include more concrete and effective opening 
measures," the commentary said. "And also that such steps by the 
Japanese Government will improve South Korean entry to the 
Japanese market and contribute to rectifying the trade imbalance 
between South Korea and Japan."

  [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
send a mammoth delegation of about 30 officials to a ministerial 
conference set to be held in Marrakech, Morocco April 12-15 to 
sign the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  An official at the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
on Thursday that a large delegation will be needed since he said 
various talks are scheduled during the meeting period to discuss 
environmental and trade problems. 
  The delegation would comprise senior officials from the 
Economic Board and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Trade, 
Industry and Energy; Finance; and Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries. 
  Some officials from related organizations like the Trade 
Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) will also be included, he said. 
  The Untied States is expected to send a 200-member 
delegation 
and Japan a 80-to-120-member team to the meeting, respectively. 
  Korea plans to take the occasion to hold trade ministers 
meetings with about 10 countries, the official added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae apologized on Friday over an 
amendment to the country's final Uruguay Round schedule. 
  "I feel sorry for failing to publicly discuss the amendment 
in advance," he said. 
  Testifying at the National Assembly Agriculture, Forestry 
and 
Fisheries Committee, the minister said the lack of its advance 
public discussion was due to a "strategic need" to prepare 
against verification by other countries. 
  Minister Kim also said he now thinks that if a little more 
efforts had been made, the country would have gained some more. 
  He said there are no secret agreements the government made 
with any specific parties. 
  "The so-called behind-the-scene agreement with the United 
States refers to the mere letters exchanged by the two 
countries' ambassadors to guarantee the implementation of what 
have already been agreed to," Kim said.

here Friday and agreed to form a working-level team to discuss 
further development of a "special partnership." 
  The ministers said their countries first developed a special 
partnership at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
summit in Seattle last November. 
  They agreed to hold the first meeting of the working-level 
team headed by assistant ministers this month. 
  Kim called on Maclaren to extend Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) status for Korean exports to Canada, scheduled 
to expire at the end of June, and Maclaren vowed to consider the 
matter positively. 
  The ministers also decided to form a Korea-Canada industrial 
technology cooperation committee to boost bilateral links in 
these areas.

  [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- An overseas South Korean 
clergyman's plan to visit the home country is doomed to fail due 
to objection by government authorities. 
  The government is loath to allow the home visit of Rev. Yi 
Yong-pin, 68, active in Germany, on the ground that he had 
engaged in pro-North Korean activities abroad. 
  Yi, an outspoken critic of the past authoritarian regimes, 
had not been allowed into the country for decades in the past. 
  An official of the "committee for the promotion of Rev. Yi 
Yong-pin's return home" in Seoul said his committee on Thursday 
received a notification that the government would not allow Rev. 
Yi's return home unless he repents in writing of the "seditious 
activities" he made while visiting North Korea. 
  "The government notification is something unexpected. But, 
we will go ahead with the plan to have Rev. Yi come to Seoul on 
April 4," he said. 
  Rev. Yi who went to West Germany in 1955 for study, is noted 
for his struggles against the authoritarian governments of the 
past, and also for arranging talks between South and North 
Korean Christian leaders since early 1980s, in the course of 
which he visited Pyongyang in 1980.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "U.S. Unhappy With Package of </F>
External Economic Measures"] 
  [Text] On 29 March, the Japanese Government decided on a 
package of external economic measures. The U.S. Government 
reacted by criticizing the package as "insufficient" and made it 
clear that it would not go along with Japan's call for a 
resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
The Japanese Government is trying to accept the U.S. reaction 
calmly, noting: "Their reaction is somewhat tougher than we had 
anticipated" (according to a top official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry). The U.S. Government has 
criticized almost all aspects of the package including 
management of Japan's macroeconomic policy and the automobile 
and auto parts sector. As a result, attention will focus on 
whether the Hosokawa government will be able to map out another 
package of more concrete measures opening up the Japanese market 
and relaxing bureaucratic regulations, while overriding 
resistance from the business community and concerned ministries 
and agencies, and overcoming the rift in the ruling coalition 
parties before July when the summit talks of major 
industrialized nations (the Naples summit), which will mark a 
juncture in Japan-U.S. relations, are held. 
  At a 30 March session of the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor is not disappointed with the package; it 
is a first step. I have heard that he will pay attention to how 
Japan maps out another package of measures in June." 
  The government itself has acknowledged that it had decided 
to 
delay taking more concrete measures on opening up the Japanese 
market and relaxing regulations by the end of June. The prime 
minister had expressed hopes for resuming the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks when the package was announced. But, 
the consensus in concerned ministries and agencies is that "it 
would be impossible for the package to open the way for resuming 
the framework talks." 
  U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has said, "The ball is 
still 
in Japan's court," but it is not easy for Japan to hit the ball 
back into the U.S. court. With regard to the macroeconomic 
measures--the focal points of which are the continuation of tax 
cuts and an increase in public investment--Japan needs to settle 
the issue of raising the consumption tax. With the waning 
unifying force of the Hosokawa government, the issue of raising 
the consumption tax will undoubtedly develop into an issue that 
could shake the Hosokawa government. 
  As one of the conditions for resuming the framework talks, 
Mr. Kantor has cited "the use of qualitative and quantitative 
indexes to determine whether opening the Japanese market is 
successful in the individual sectors." In this way, he has 
hinted that the United States would again bring up "numerical 
targets" for discussion; this was one of the causes for the 
break off of the framework talks. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Mondale has criticized plans 
compiled by Japanese automakers to boost their purchase of 
foreign-made auto parts, pointing to "their low growth rate." 
Saying "I am especially disappointed" with the automobile sector 
in the package, the U.S. ambassador has called on Japan to take 
more concrete measures to boost its imports of not only 
foreign-made auto parts, but foreign-made automobiles. 
  However, it is difficult for Japanese automakers to 
drastically increase their purchase of foreign-made auto parts. 
The government has kept the door to compromise with the United 
States on the numerical targets closed and there is no room for 
the government to concede to the United States in the individual 
sectors. The United States is expected to ask Japan to take bold 
steps to relax regulations and give foreign firms more access to 
government procurement. 
  Finance Minister Fujii, MITI minister Kumagai, and Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura are all in charge of mapping out the 
measures for opening the Japanese market and relaxing 
bureaucratic regulations. While Fujii and Kumagai are affiliated 
with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Mr. Takemura is affiliated 
with Sakigake [Harbinger]. Some point out that the ongoing 
delicate confrontation within the ruling coalition parties is 
making it difficult for the coalition government to deal with 
external issues.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Package Is Device Designed To Get </F>
Framework Talks Restarted"] 
  [Text] On 29 March the government decided on a package of 
external economic measures. Commenting on the package, a 
government official said: "The package is a `device' to resume 
the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." 
  In response to the package, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said: "The package is not enough to resume the stalled 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." 
  He made clear the U.S. negative reaction to the package. 
  The points of contention between Japan and the United States 
are: 1) macroeconomic measures needed to stimulate the Japanese 
economy; 2) the issue of opening up the Japanese market; and 3) 
the handling of objective criteria. 
  As far as macroeconomic policy and the issue of market 
opening are concerned, Japan's view is that "it has done its 
utmost in the package." 
  On objective criteria, the most contentious issue between 
the 
two countries, the Japanese package carries no good answers to 
the U.S. demands. It is being said, however, that the lack of 
good answers on the issue is a hidden device. 
  On Japanese voluntary measures for three priority sectors 
that were discussed at the framework talks, the package far from 
satisfies U.S. demands in the automobile sector, but clearly 
indicates specific objective criteria that Japan considers the 
best option in present world economic conditions and in view of 
the current business activities of Japanese automakers. On the 
issue of government procurement, the package provides 
"statistics and related information" in an abstract form, but it 
does not touch on insurance at all. 
  The handling of objective criteria varies from sector to 
sector. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
said: "We intend to look for a way to settle the issue while 
presenting the United States with three alternative proposals." 
  Japan's tactic is that it will search for clues to the 
resumption of framework talks by narrowing the gap between the 
two countries over the interpretation of objective criteria 
while playing its "insurance" and "government procurement" cards 
on which it has left room to make concessions. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official said: "The United States 
has not rejected contacts with Japan on the resumption of 
framework talks." 
  Both Japan and the United States are expected to resume 
framework talks when they find areas of agreement, and the issue 
of handling objective criteria was a primary cause of the 
stalemate in the framework talks. Will Japan's tactics really 
work as they hope?

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 1 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The preliminary draft of the "Fiscal 1994 Unfair 
Trade Report" compiled by the Industrial Structure Council (an 
advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry), which has been examining the unfair trade policies 
and measures of the United States, and other major trading 
partners of Japan, was made public. 
  With regard to the United States, the draft report 
criticizes 
its trade policy of setting numerical targets and expresses 
serious concern about the unilateral measures it takes, such as 
those based on the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act 
(on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty 
of unfair trade practices). It suggests that Japan should make 
full use of GATT conflict settlement procedures to resist such 
U.S. actions. It also points out that to dissuade the United 
States from adopting such policies, Japan needs to promote the 
introduction of more transparency into government procurement 
procedures, the abolition of nontariff barriers, and the easing 
of regulations. 
  This report, which will be issued in May, is the Japanese 
version of the "Global Trade Barriers" report issued by the U.S. 
trade representative on 31 March. Since Japan-U.S. economic 
frictions have been intensifying recently, the United States is 
expected to react strongly to the Japanese report. 
  The report is divided into two sections, the first part is 
an 
overview and the second part goes into specific issues. The 
overview discusses: 1) what constitutes unfair trade policy; 
2) major trade partners; 3) a general discussion of each trade 
partner; and 4) responses to unfair trade policies. The report 
determines unfairness based on the Uruguay Round general 
agreement to be signed by participating nations in Marakkech, 
Morocco, in mid-April and the basic principles of international 
law. The section on major trade partners includes the United 
States, the European Union (EU), ROK, Hong Kong, Australia, and 
five other countries and areas with which Japan conducts most of 
its trading activities. 
  The second section deals with 13 unfair policies and 
measures--such as quotas, antidumping measures, and subsidies, 
respectively--pointing out the problems and the countries 
adopting those policies. 
  According to the draft report, the United States is guilty 
of 
unfair practices in nine of the 13 areas, repeating its record 
in fiscal 1993. The EU is brought to task in four areas (six in 
1993) and the ROK, five (six in 1993). 
  In the case of the United States, the report stresses that 
it 
takes unilateral measures, abuses antidumping measures, and 
gives priority to U.S. products in government procurement. In 
particular, the paper takes issue with such unilateral measures 
as the revival of the Super 301 provision and the financial 
retaliation bill. 
  The report also takes up the U.S. trade policy of setting 
numerical targets, which the United States strongly demanded at 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, expressing strong 
criticism. It states that setting numerical targets for the 
future to ask Japan to increase imports "is not only lacking in 
economic rationality, but also runs counter to the spirit of 
GATT." 
  Apart from the 10 major countries and areas, the report also 
discusses China and Taiwan, which are preparing for GATT 
membership, for the first time, pointing out "barriers to be 
rectified." For China, the report asks for consistency and more 
transparency in its systems and improvement in the areas of high 
tariffs and import and export quotas. In the case of Taiwan, 
high tariffs, the service trade, and subsidies are cited, with 
the request that it take timely measures.

  [Text] The government, which announced on 29 March a 
package of external economic measures aimed at opening the 
Japanese market and slashing Japan's current account surplus, 
intends to use the package as a momentum to resume the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which broke off without any 
agreement. Prime Minister Hosokawa is said to have been eager 
to display his leadership in mapping out the package by adding 
specific figures to a draft package. Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura shows confidence in resuming the framework talks, 
saying, "(The United States) appears to have been surprised that 
the Japanese Government has mapped out this good package in a 
short period." With many issues, including the issue of tax 
cuts, left untouched, however, the government will certainly 
face a rough sailing in working out a set of concrete measures 
to implement the package by the end of June, and it is 
unpredictable how the government will patch up relations with 
the United States which remain chilly following the breakoff of 
the framework talks. 
  Explaining to a group of Japanese reporters at the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 29 March why 
the package envisions the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account 
surplus to the GDP at 2.8 percent, the prime minister said, 
"Although some have argued that it would be difficult to set 
such a figure, we would be unable to have the United States 
understand the package if we do not present such a figure in the 
package." A top government official has said: The figure of 2.8 
percent was once excluded from the draft package in the face of 
backlash from bureaucrats who asserted that "the figure may be 
taken as Japan's international commitment." The figure, however, 
was resurrected on the morning of 28 March in respone to strong 
instruction from the prime minister's official residence. 
  The package, however, only indicates a direction and that 
the 
government will have a rough way in working out a set of 
concrete measures to implement the package by the end of June 
shortly before the Naples summit (the summit talks of 
industrialized nations) is held. As for tax reform, the 
government, in the package, clearly indicates that "it will seek 
to reform the current tax system within this year" on the basis 
of decisions the ruling coalition parties will make at the end 
of their consultations during June, and it reveals the intention 
to continue cuts in the income tax. Speaking at a news 
conference on the evening of 29 March, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura called the reform of the current tax system "Japan's 
commitment to the United States," saying the government will 
"assume the responsibility" to make a decision on reforming the 
current tax system during June. However, what sort of decision 
the ruling coalition parties will make on the reform of the 
current tax system remains uncertain because of backlash within 
the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan. 
  In the macroeconomic area that the United States has most 
strongly demanded, the Finance Ministry has opposed reviewing 
the plan for public investment, citing financial difficulty, and 
as a result, the package does not indicate a specific amount of 
increase in the public investment. While the package envisions 
the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account surplus to the GDP at 
2.8 percent, the United States has insisted on 1 percent. In 
this way, there is still a wide perceptional gap between the two 
countries. 
  The prime minister's reputation was slighted following the 
breakoff of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. If the package 
contributes to restoring his reputation, it would serve as a 
leverage for him to overcome difficulties on the domestic 
agenda. His leadership will again be tested in working out the 
set of concrete measures to implement the package.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Japan Should Learn From Recovery of U.S. </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] Japanese industrialists, who had said until recently 
that they had nothing to learn from the U.S. economy, are now 
voicing the need to learn once again from the U.S. economy. 
They have lost their self-confidence, and its loss has come too 
abruptly. It is important, however, for them to humbly verify 
how the U.S. economy has recovered and to learn from the 
recovery to revitalize Japan's economy. 
  The U.S. economy has shown a remarkable recovery by 
registering a high, 7.5-percent growth rate during the 
October-December quarter. During the same quarter, the Japanese 
economy posted negative growth of 2.2 percent, thus 
demonstrating a large gap in the growth rates between the 
Japanese and U.S. economies. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB), 
which had stuck to a monetary policy of keeping real interest 
rates low, has returned to a tight monetary policy by twice 
raising the interest rates for federal funds (FF). 
  The Clinton administration's macroeconomic policy basically 
aims to spur the U.S. economy by keeping interest rates low 
through cuts in the federal budget deficit. Plants' rate of 
production soared to 83 percent of capacity, and this has caused 
concerns that the U.S. economy could become overheated and be a 
bubble economy. It is a matter of course for the FRB to shift 
to a tight monetary policy. The Clinton administration, which 
sought a low-interest-rate policy, has no choice but to accept 
the FRB's shift. 
  Looking at the world economy, the so-called 
"English-speaking 
economic group" of the United States, Britain, Canada, and 
Australia was in the grip of a serious recession shortly after 
the end of the cold war. FRB Chairman Greenspan once revealed a 
sense of crisis, saying, "The U.S. economy is about to face 
unprecedented difficulties." Meanwhile, the economies of a 
united Germany, the European nations, and Japan remained notably 
robust. 
<H5>  Structural Shift Through Revitalization of Market Function </H5>
  The English-speaking economic group is now enjoying a 
booming 
economy after coming out of a recession, thus throwing cold 
water on Japan and Germany, which are still mired in recession. 
This phenomenon of a reversal cannot be explained simply by a 
time lag in the economic cycle. 
  The recovery of the English-speaking economic group, 
especially the United States, has occurred after it made its 
economic system, which emphasizes the market, function smoothly, 
and it has accomplished a shift in its economic structures 
during a recession in a relatively short period. 
  Major U.S. industries, including the automobile industry, 
have studied the management strategy of Japanese enterprises 
from various angles. They have thoroughly restructured 
themselves to improve productivity and to bolster 
competitiveness with the aim of outstripping Japanese 
enterprises. General Electric Chairman Jack Welch once said, "I 
intend to `imbue the spirit of a small corporation' in order to 
revitalize our bloated organization." In this way, U.S. 
corporations have streamlined their management. 
  Major U.S. banks, like their Japanese counterparts, were 
saddled with bad loans because of the financial and real-estate 
recession, but their performance is now improving after writing 
off these bad loans. Bank loans have become more available than 
ever, thus smoothing the flow of money. The market has given 
high marks to U.S. corporations' cuts in dividends and their 
paying off of debts as part of their efforts to streamline 
management, and this has made it possible for them to speedily 
write off their bad loans. Citicorp Chairman John Reed and other 
many other U.S. bank executives have been highly praised for 
fulfilling their management responsibilities rather than being 
blamed for writing off their bad loans to streamline their 
banks' management. 
  U.S. corporations and banks have been able to thoroughly 
restructure themselves because deregulation has kept open the 
opportunities for new businesses. In the information and 
telecommunications sector, which is said to have the potential 
of generating explosive demand, deregulation has removed the 
fence between telephone firms and cable television firms. Vice 
President Gore has announced plans to build an information 
superhighway. New plans, which can be assessed as being a 
little overoptimistic, have been announced. 
  Unlike the Republican administration, which despised 
industrial policy as a "filthy term," the Clinton 
administration, which has handled the economy as a priority 
policy task, has begun implementing its industrial policy 
centering on basic industrial technology. The administration 
recently announced a new program of private-public sector 
cooperation to develop the next-generation semiconductor. 
  A shift in the structure of the U.S. economy has begun 
taking effect in concert with restructuring efforts by 
corporations and banks and with the Clinton administration's 
strategy. The change in the economic structure has resulted in 
high unemployment. The jobless rate has soared to 6.5 percent, 
and the United States has yet to escape its jobless growth. 
Labor Secretary Reich once attacked corporations for sharply 
cutting their work forces, saying, "U.S. corporations have cut 
too deeply into their hearts." 
  U.S. manufacturing industry, which is eager to improve its 
productivity, is trying to reduce its work force as much as 
possible. The absorption of workers by the service sector still 
remains weak. Even if jobless persons who used to serve in the 
military or work in high-tech industries find service-sector 
jobs, they complain about low wages and consider service-sector 
work to be not worthwhile. They are highly depressed mentally. 
<H5>  Japan Urged To Create New Businesses Through Deregulation </H5>
  What should Japan learn from the recovery of the U.S. 
economy? The blind introduction of the U.S. method of cutting 
the work force would cost society too dearly. Japan has no 
choice but to grope for its own coordinated method of 
employment. Strengthening the market function through 
deregulation and creating new demand would be the way to rid 
Japan of its recession. It can be said that excessive 
regulations are keeping both Japan and Germany from escaping 
their recessions. 
  Deregulation is a policy goal of the Hosokawa government, 
which is seeking economic reform. In fact, however, deregulation 
has made little headway because the government has only named 
the sectors to be deregulated. Deregulation will be 
incorporated in a package of measures that the government will 
formulate in late March to open the Japanese market. If each 
ministry and agency makes a piecemeal deregulation proposal in 
order to share the pain, deregulation thus would be meaningless. 
  It would be more effective for the government to set policy 
goals for sectors, as was done for the 
information-telecommunications sector in the United States, and 
to announce steps to relax the current regulations governing 
such sectors. It is important for the government to consider 
relaxing the regulations with specific purposes in mind instead 
of stressing aimless deregulation. 
  Industrial policy should be reviewed sweepingly. It is 
necessary for this policy to stop taking measures for 
enterprises which could lead to managed trade, and it is 
necessary that it emphasizes assistance to the research and 
development of basic industrial technology. In the present 
world economy, developing countries in Latin America and Asia 
are now equal with the industrialized nations in the 
manufacturing area. To raise the level of technology, which is 
the foundation of Japan's economy, both the government and 
private sector need to rebuild the current research and 
development system. 
  In the post-cold war world economy, there is no dominant 
economic superpower as the United States was in the past. Just 
as U.S. corporations have learned from Japanese enterprises' 
management, Japanese enterprises should embrace the merits of 
U.S. corporations' management and cost consciousness. Both 
Japanese and U.S. enterprises have entered an age in which they 
learn from each other and give an impetus to each other.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Neutrality"; part one of </F>
a continuing series entitled "Beleaguered Myth of the 
Bureauracy"] 
  [Text] Kasumigaseki [the center of ministerial bureaucracy 
in Tokyo] maintains its silence. 
  "Two years ago, the ministries would be excited about a 
forthcoming election. The neutrality of the bureaucracy would, 
of course, be forgotten, and endless requests for money, 
personnel, office space, cars, and name lists would come from 
officials of the bureau director general rank. Right now, 
nobody is saying anything." 
<H5>  Ministries Cannot Now Engage in Organized Election Campaigns </H5>
  A bookkeeper at a leading general contractor which deals in 
the construction of ports and similar public works projects, 
testified to the change in the Ministry of Transport in the 
above terms. This is true not only of the Transport Ministry. 
The same thing is happening in the Ministries of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries, Posts and Communications, Construction, 
and Education, and the Defense Agency. Even officials at 
ministries and agencies where former colleagues are now members 
of the upper house, elected from the proportional representation 
districts, tend to shut up when the topic of conversation turns 
to the election next year. 
  Former Administrative Vice Minister of Transport Toru 
Nakamura told a senior bureaucrat at the bureau director-general 
level last August, "your candidacy will not be possible." 
  This was soon after the inauguration of the Hosokawa 
administration. Former Transport Ministry officials were 
planning to have the senior official run as a Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] candidate. However, an incumbent lower house member 
with Transport Ministry links, Shinya Izumi, had defected from 
the LDP to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and in view of the 
change in political regime, the atmosphere was considered 
unsuitable for his candidacy. 
  The situation is even more serious for ministries where 
former officials are incumbent LDP Diet members. The National 
Land Improvement Political Alliance, which traditionally 
supported former officials from the Agricultural Structure 
Improvement Bureau of the Agriculture Ministry stopped short of 
endorsing lower house member Ryotaro Sudo at its regular general 
meeting in February. The reason was officials of land 
improvement groups nationwide were defecting from the LDP, and 
it was not possible to reach a consensus on which candidate to 
endorse. Shinseito leaders are also applying pressure on 
ministries and agencies unscrupulously, saying "do you still 
want to supply candidates to the LDP?" 
  There are currently 69 members of the House of 
Representatives, and 42 members of the House of Councilors who 
are former bureaucrats. In the first decade after the war, 
bureaucrats not only joined the conservative parties; some even 
joined the Socialist Party. However, after the founding of the 
LDP, the bureaucracy became an exclusive source of candidates 
for this party. Particularly in the proportional representation 
elections, close links between the bureaucracy and businesses 
traditionally produced hundreds of thousands of new LDP members, 
together with their membership dues. It was an impregnable LDP 
fortress. However, this fortress is also disintegrating. 
  During upper house elections two years ago, the LDP put up 
six new former bureaucrat candidates, and five were elected. 
Hideyuki Aizawa, director general of the LDP Election Bureau, 
says that now, however, "lavish election spending, and the 
recruitment of party members through the mobilization of entire 
business sectors will not be allowed." 
<H5>  "Ozawa Scheme" Seen as Threatening </H5>
  Last December, Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Hiroshi Kumagai forced Masahisa Naito, director general of the 
Industrial Policy Bureau and number-two man in the Trade 
Ministry's bureaucratic hierarchy, to resign over preferential 
promotions for ministry officials intending to run in elections. 
The repercussions of this incident are still being felt three 
months later. 
  Unlike in the United States, where officials above the 
rank of bureau chief are replaced in the change of 
administration, the Japanese bureaucracy is more permanent. 
However, since the unwritten rule that "bureaucratic personnel 
matters are sacrosanct" has been violated, officials now fear 
politicians may have the last say on personnel appointments 
every time there is a change of administration. Such a sense of 
crisis is not wholly groundless because the incident coincided 
with a plan by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa to 
appoint more than one parliamentary vice minister to each 
ministry, and to send more than 150 political councilors from 
the ruling parties to participate in policymaking. 
  The objective of the "Ozawa scheme" was to do away with 
"bureaucratic control of the administration," and to allow 
politicians to regain the initiative. Ozawa believes that 
bureaucrats should be "politically `neutral' and assist the 
politicians." That is, he wants bureaucrats merely to indicate 
the policy options, and let politicians make the decision. 
  As a matter of fact, when the plan was presented to the 
ruling coalition parties last October, senior government 
officials wrote a paper opposing the scheme, claiming they 
represented the general consensus in Kasumigaseki. The gist of 
the document was that "if policies are formulated through 
lobbying by politicians for various interests, there can be no 
`neutrality.'" 
  In the name of "neutrality," Ozawa wants to tighten control 
on the bureaucrats, while the bureaucrats are trying to keep the 
politicians from interfering. The idea of dispatching political 
councillors met with particularly strong resistance from the 
bureaucrats, and was eventually scrapped. 
  Admittedly, in a parliamentary cabinet system, where 
policies 
are decided through consultations between the cabinet and the 
ruling parties, these policies are inevitably influenced by 
partisan interests. The question is: How far the bureaucrats, 
who are not directly responsible to the people, should be 
involved in policymaking, and to what extent the policy process 
can be made open. 
<H5>  Leading Role in Policymaking </H5>
  After the change of regime, the old pattern under which 
bureaucrats supplied information only to the LDP has been 
interrupted. In place of this, there are an increasing number 
of cases where bureaucrats themselves, rather than politicians, 
have spoken out publicly. 
  According to a former finance minister, this signifies not 
only that bureaucrats are overexerting themselves, but also that 
"politicians are losing influence." 
  During the briefings prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa often asked the bureaucrats 
briefing him, "What am I supposed to do then?" 
  This has become the talk of the Foreign Ministry. 
Essentially, the old pattern of policymaking has not changed 
since then.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Keeping the National Interest"; </F>
part two of a continuing series entitled "Beleaguered Myth of 
the Bureaucracy"] 
  [Excerpts] "That was, in fact, one of our ideas." This is 
the claim of some Finance Ministry officials who recently 
revealed the background to the "agreement on tax cuts and tax 
system reform" which was reached among representatives of the 
ruling parties on 8 February following a dispute within the 
coalition over the proposal by Prime Minister Hosokawa to 
introduce a national welfare tax. 
<H5>  Trouble Settled as Planned </H5>
  At a meeting of representatives of the ruling parties which 
began 7 February, Hiroyuki Sonoda, who represents Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP], after holding a 
meeting with the Finance Ministry, presented a tax system reform 
plan almost identical to the prime minister's. 
  He said: "We propose to introduce a 7-percent national 
welfare tax from 1997. It is possible the tax rate will change." 
  Although this proposal was scrapped because of opposition 
from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], an agreement 
was eventually reached among the ruling parties to "discuss tax 
system issues--tax cuts and how to secure revenue sources, 
including the possible new taxes--and enact a tax system reform 
bill at the Diet by the end of this year." The final agreement 
gave the impression that the Hosokawa and Finance 
Ministry-sponsored proposal had been rejected by the ruling 
parties. However, the situation went according to the Finance 
Ministry's plan. 
  Finance Ministry Tax Bureau Chief Tadashi Ogawa joined the 
meeting as it was about to conclude. 
  He said: "We will carry out 20-percent tax cuts, but this 
will be limited to one fiscal year because there are no revenue 
sources to make up for a loss resulting from tax cuts." His 
comments stressed the ministry's position that it could not 
maintain tax cuts unless revenue sources were secured. 
  Administrative Vice Minister of Finance Jiro Saito directed 
Tax Bureau Chief Ogawa and the Director of the Finance Ministry 
Secretariat Takeshi Komura to hold a behind-the-scenes meeting 
with Mr. Sonoda and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa to lay the groundwork for an 
agreement among the ruling parties. 
  Mr. Komura said that in behind-the-scenes moves they held 
many meetings at a "certain place in Tokyo," at the offices of 
the finance minister and administrative vice minister, and 
eventually worked out a draft agreement. 
  Finance Ministry bureaucrats feared that "unconditional tax 
cuts" might be carried out without revenue sources being 
secured. To prevent this happening, they stuck to the position 
that tax cuts should be carried only on condition that revenue 
sources are secured. Although it was a considerable concession 
for them to issue deficit-covering bonds to cover the loss 
resulting from tax cuts, they performed a spectacular feat in 
limiting tax cuts to one year and getting the "political 
security" of a future tax increase. Senior Finance Ministry 
officials said "we had no choice but to coordinate tax policy 
because politicians tend to take the easy way out." Such a 
remark reflects their self-conceit in thinking they have 
protected the national interest. 
<H5>  Policymaking Process Faces Public Criticism </H5>
  The United States, however, which wanted to see the tax cuts 
implemented three years ahead of a tax increase, expressed 
disappointment at the agreement. On 17 February, following the 
failure in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, U.S. President 
Clinton criticized the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] for "controlling Japan's 
policies for several decades." Although Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, speaking at the Budget Committee session of the House 
of Representatives, defended the ministries by saying that 
"officials in charge of tax policy did a good job in protecting 
the national interests," the "prominence held by bureaucrats in 
Japan" is becoming a major factor that is damaging "cooperation 
with foreign nations" which is, in turn, the foundation of 
efforts to protect the interests of the nation. 
  In the wake of a political confusion over the idea of 
introducing the national welfare tax--which was proposed by the 
prime minister at a late night press conference but finally 
withdrawn, the public, too, began to have doubts about the 
bureaucrat-led policymaking process. 
  Vice Minister Saito had no choice but to indicate a flexible 
attitude, saying: "I will give careful attention to criticism 
in a humble way." 
  According to a U.S. diplomatic source, the question has 
arisen both at home and abroad "whether such policies really 
serve the purpose of protecting the national interest." Yukio 
Noguchi, former Finance Ministry official and currently a 
professor at Hitotsubashi University, points out that there is a 
harmful influence in Japanese financial policy that places too 
much emphasis on ensuring financial security. 
  He says: "Promoting the national interest means to improve 
the people's living standard by drastically increasing public 
works projects in preparation for the aging of society. Solely 
relying on tax increases to raise the revenue is a questionable 
practice. The government should not grudge issuing more 
deficit-covering bonds." [passage omitted on Tokyo-based 
company's attempts to sell domestically made rice without a 
license, and the Food Agency's reaction] 
  At a meeting of members of the Rice Price Council (an 
advisory body to the agriculture minister) at a branch office of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] on 25 
March, one of the members stressed that the Food Control 
Act-based administrative system for rice supply had to be 
drastically overhauled. 
  He said: "More than 50 percent of rice held by rice farmers 
flows to the black market. The Food Control Act, which is 
supposed to control rice supplies, is in ruins." Even within 
the MAFF, there is the view that "now that government-controlled 
rice is not available, there is no reason to maintain the Food 
Agency." 
<H5>  More Emphasis Placed on Protecting Ministry Interests </H5>
  The Food Control Act was enacted in 1942 amid intensified 
government control of the economy as part of preparations for 
all-out war. More than 50 years have passed, and it now seems 
there is no need for the Food Control Act to protect the 
national interest. 
  Nevertheless, bureaucrats stick to the view the act should 
be 
maintained. 
  According to MAFF Administrative Vice Minister Toshihiko 
Tsuruoka: "If we had no Food Control Act, the rice supply 
situation would have been worse." 
  Judging from his remark, one can see that the bureaucrats 
are 
trying harder to protect the interests of their ministries than 
the interests of the nation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bureaucrats Make No Mistakes"; part </F>
three of the ongoing series entitled "The Beleaguered Myth of 
the Bureaucracy"] 
  [Excerpts] On 2 March, four lawyers, including Makoto 
Toyoda of the "National Liaison Council of Minamata Disease 
[industrial pollution-induced mercury poisoning in the 1950's] 
Victims and Their Lawyers"--which is composed of plaintiffs 
involving Minamata disease lawsuits--called on Environment 
Agency [EA] Director General Wakako Hironaka at her office. 
With a Fukuoka high court ruling on the Minamata lawsuits close 
at hand, they intended to urge EA Director General Hironaka 
again to "settle the litigation prior to the ruling" because she 
was trying to break the deadlocked situation. For example, she 
has indicated an idea within the government of providing "money 
as a token of the government's sympathy" to Minamata disease 
victims. 
  Because Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his 
governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture, had asked the central 
government to conclude an amicable settlement, the plaintiffs 
expressed great hopes that the central government would change 
its policy on Minamata disease lawsuits. However, EA Director 
General Hironaka just repeated: "Now that I have joined the 
government, it is difficult for me to have things my own way. I 
am sorry." 
  Throughout court trials, the government has maintained that 
there were no legal grounds at that time for the government's 
possessing the authority to control industrial water, and that 
hence it has no responsibility to compensate the plaintiffs for 
the failure to prevent the emergence and spread of Minamata 
disease. The plaintiffs have maintained that the government 
should be held liable for this. Later, EA Director General 
Hironaka explained why "she cannot have her own way in dealing 
with the issue." She said: "While the Ministry of Finance 
[MOF], which has authority over financial affairs, does not 
intend to agree on [compensation], the Ministry of Justice, 
which is in charge of lawsuits, is not saying `yes.' Because 
the administrative organizations are united, I cannot make a 
move unless the administration as a whole says `yes.'" 
<H5>  Senior Officials Opposed a Proposal Made by a Minister </H5>
  "We should tackle the Nagara River project." It was summer 
of 1990 when EA Director General Ishimatsu Kitagawa of the 
second Kaifu cabinet made that proposal during a meeting with 
senior EA officials, including (then) Administrative Vice 
Minister Tadashi Yasuhara. [passage omitted on review of the 
Nagara Dam construction project and residents' opposition to the 
project] 
  (Then) EA Chief Kitagawa was ready to use the "EA director 
general's right to issue recommendations" based on the law 
establishing the EA in a bid to suspend the dam's construction. 
Senior EA officials, however, unanimously opposed him, saying: 
"Minister, please set aside your plan." Kitagawa stood isolated 
and had no choice but to give up his intention. [passage 
omitted on comment by unidentified official] 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi put his signature to a 
document opposing the dam's construction three years ago when he 
was an opposition party member and was regarded as a "dissenter" 
against the project. When he met with Prime Minister Hosokawa 
prior to his inspection of the Nagara River at the end of last 
year, Construction Minister Igarashi made a proposal that an 
organization be set up within the government to review 
large-scale public works projects formulated under the Liberal 
Democratic Party administration. This is as far as he can go. 
However, the Construction Ministry and the EA "have done 
nothing" about the proposal since then (as stated by a senior 
Construction Ministry official). 
  The Government "Delayed in Dealing With" Comfort 
Women Issue 
  An MOF division chief stated: "If we do not do our best, the 
ideal picture of the state cannot be maintained." However, it 
may be said that such a self-conceit has led to bureaucrats' 
having the following view: "There are no mistakes in our work." 
And, as a result of being hung up about the practice of making 
no mistakes, bureaucrats may see their greatest value as 
"maintaining order" by adjusting their policies to past policies 
and existing laws. 
  Their obstinacy sometimes delays a political decision and 
this aggravates the situation. 
  In December 1991, former Korean comfort women [who were 
forced to serve as prostitutes during World War II] filed 
lawsuits against the Japanese Government for compensation. This 
resulted in a major issue pending between Japan and South Korea 
of how far the former Japanese Imperial Army was involved in 
collecting and controlling comfort women. The issue concerns 
Japan's shameful acts. Originally, the government stated that it 
was unable to "confirm the incident" under the pretext that 
there were no documents which would provide evidence. 
Nevertheless, "documents" were found one after another by 
researchers. [passage omitted on statements by former chief 
cabinet secretaries on the comfort women issue] 
  Before the Japanese Government admitted the fact that the 
Japanese Imperial Army forced Korean women to serve as 
prostitutes, the government gave the impression that it was 
compelled to make efforts to deal with the issue under pressure. 
[passage omitted on a statement by a South Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman and an editorial on Korean paper TONG-A ILBO] 
<H5>  "Bureaucrats Are of Good Quality But Take a Narrow View of </H5>
Things 
  "Is the Diet the supreme organization of state power?" Mr. 
Masaharu Gotoda, who became a politician after serving as 
commissioner-general for the National Police Agency and deputy 
chief cabinet secretary, is now writing a book on the theme of 
"politics and bureaucrats." Mr. Gotoda intends to put the above 
question, which concerns Article 41 of the Constitution, in the 
introduction of his book, and intends to discuss how relations 
between politicians and bureaucrats ought to be. 
  He said: "It goes without saying that government officials 
are well-intentioned people and are of good quality. However, 
they see the world only from the viewpoint of a government 
office. It is politics that makes the final decision. If 
government officials take an attitude of sticking to one 
direction, they go to extremes."

  [Text] The Okinawa Prefectural Assembly's special 
committee on issues related to the U.S. bases (with chairman 
Moritada Kikumura) met on 28 March. Regarding a court decision 
on a lawsuit against Kadena Air Base [KAB] noise pollution, 
Prefectural Governor's Office Chief Choko Takayama said: "There 
should be no difference in treatment between Okinawa and 
mainland Japan when dealing with base issues." Then, he 
indicated that after conducting a comparative study on noise 
pollution at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) and KAB, "requests will 
be made to the Japan-U.S. joint committee, the central 
government, and the United States" to restrict night flights. 
  At this meeting, Yoshihide Isa (of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party]) pointed out that an agreement was reached by a 
Japan-U.S. joint committee to restrict night flights at the 
Yokota and the Atugi bases (in Kanagawa prefecture). He asked 
how the prefectural government will deal with the issue, saying: 
"It is not acceptable that only Okinawan people have to suffer 
from discriminatory treatment." In response, Takayama mentioned 
the fact that the court did not acknowledge certain damages 
caused by noise pollution and said: "We plan to fully examine 
the court's decision and compare results with the decision on 
the Yokota suit." 
  Moreover, Hironori Teruya (of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan) said: "The problem is the fact that regarding the noise 
pollution created by the U.S. military bases on Okinawa, we are 
at the mercy of the U.S. military's self-imposed regulations. 
The prefectural government should take a firm stance and demand 
a ban on night flights." Takayama replied: "After the 
comparative study, we will ask the Japan-U.S. joint committee, 
the central government, and the United States [to impose a ban 
on night flights]." In this way, he hinted at the possibility 
of taking further steps to deal with the issue. 
  Regarding the emergency landing of a Cessna airplane which 
belongs to the KAB aeroclub, at Blue Beach in Kin-cho on 26 
March, Takayama expressed his regret and said: "It is a 
violation of the Japan-U.S. Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA) to 
allow civilians aboard their planes. We will deal with the 
issue after thorough investigations."

<F P=106> [Interview with former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, </F>
defector from the Liberal Democratic Party, by reporter Koichi 
Obata; place and date not given; last paragraph is TOKYO 
SHIMBUN conclusion] 
  [Text] [Obata] Now that some quarters of the ruling 
coalition parties are moving toward formation of a new party, 
you are becoming active as you are called "catalyst politician." 
What is your goal? 
  [Yamaguchi] My life work as a politician is to create two 
major political powers to run Japan's politics. My effort in 
the Shyinjiyu [New Liberal] Club were not successful, but the 
experience should be utilized now because we are undergoing a 
period of confusion. I am often criticized as a puppet of Mr. 
Ichiro Ozawa, but, actually, Mr. Ozawa and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa are working on my behalf. (laughter) 
  [Obata] Then, what is your tangible plan for the "new 
party"? 
  [Yamaguchi] The coalition parties should work together 
starting with a joint policy study group, and then the group may 
discuss the "new party." Even if coalition parties unify their 
floor groups in the process, cooperation in the Diet may not 
immediately result in tie-ups in election campaigns. In this 
sense, the formation of the joint floor group seems to be a 
waste of time. The Democratic Socialist Party's action plan is 
calling for a "unification of all coalition parties," and I 
think this is the most favorable direction. Some newspapers 
said lower house candidates cannot receive multiparty support 
unless they join the policy study group. This is nonsense. 
  [Obata] Yet, some coalition parties are wary of the study 
group since it is likely to be developed into the "new party." 
  [Yamaguchi] While the Sakigake [Harbinger] takes a prudent 
stance toward the policy study group, I do not see any 
difference in policies between the Sakigake and other 
conservative parties. The Sakigake's attitude is really rigid, 
and it seems to me that the party is trying to demonstrate its 
presence. Yet, I will call for the Sakigake's participation 
again and again. 
  [Obata] What would you do if they refuse the study group to 
the end? 
  [Yamaguchi] We will keep sending a message calling for 
cooperation and unity. However, if they really do not 
understand that, the coalition would inevitably have a bipolar 
structure of "united reformists" and "social-democratic 
liberals." In that case, the two groups may jointly support the 
coalition government without discussing unnatural unification. 
The position of "social-democratic liberals" may be like that 
of Germany's Free Democratic Party (FDP), which takes part in a 
coalition government led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 
and the Christian Social Union (CSU). However, Japanese voters 
are severer than Germans. Such a minor power would be certainly 
weeded out. 
  [Obata] It appears you are really frustrated with Sakigake. 
What is your comment on this point? 
  [Yamaguchi] The coalition won in the Ishikawa gubernatorial 
election. While the victory was won by the unity of coalition 
parties, only Mr. (Masayoshi) Takemura (chief cabinet secretary 
and head of the Sakigake) does not acknowledge this. We cannot 
fawn on him forever. While Mr. Takemura says "a merger between 
the Sakigake and the Japan New Party should be discussed before 
the study group," Mr. Hosoakwa made that promise before he was 
inaugurated as the prime minister. Now that he has much heavier 
responsibility to lead the nation, he cannot afford to stand by 
old friends. 
  [Obata] How would you involve the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] in the second stage of political realignment? 
  [Yamaguchi] Members of the LDP Dietmen's League for 
Promotion of Political Reform took cooperative attitudes toward 
the coalition when the political reform bills were enacted. Now 
we need an interparty mechanism for tax and economic reform. 
Mr. (Michio) Watanabe is a man capable of leading the entire 
political circles on economic policies. I have great 
expectations for the meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
Mr. Watanabe, which was reportedly held last month. 
  Of later Mr. Yamaguchi has been actively working to pave the 
way for the political realignment. He calls himself a 
"catalyst" for the realignment. In our interview, he stressed: 
"I am not obsessed with any status or power. I can leave 
Nagata-cho when I carry out this task." 
  Some politicians say "it is questionable if he really can 
accomplish such a difficult task." He is facing a crucial 
moment to demonstrate his real value as the "political catalyst."

right to carry out examination on certain cases. At the session 
approved were the outcome of the official visit of the president 
of the country P. Ochirbat to several countries of Asia. As the 
newspaper informs, the session considered the final wording of 
the law on regulation of currency. 
  The newspaper publishes an information of the government 
press-service about the government last sitting. At the sitting 
considered was the final wording of the draft law on statistics 
and it was decided to preserve the central statistical body 
within the main structure of the government, envisage a 
possibility of foundation of the non-staff national council on 
statistics. 
  It was decided to submit the draft law to the State Great 
Hural for consideration. The sitting has got acquainted with 
the information of the government members E. Gombojav and C. 
Ulaan about the meeting with the representatives of veterans of 
the capital. The government instructed the corresponding organs 
to consider and solve the issues connected with living standards 
of the veterans. It was decided with participation of the 
Ulaanbaatar governing organs to carry out a checkup work over 
realization of laws and provisions and statements of the 
government, organize in the near future a work on solution of 
problems of veterans. 
  As the newspaper informs, the State Great Hural member, 
Chairman of the Mongolian Social Democratic Party R. Gonchigdorj 
has laid claims to the court of the Suhbaatar District of the 
capital for restoration of his honour and dignity. These claims 
have been laid in connection with the materials published in 
press accusing him of corruption. 
  The Mongolian Social Democratic Party newspaper "UG" 
publishes an information about the second session of the 
congress of this party. At the session discussed was the present 
situation in the country and adopted was the statement on 
regulation of the parliamentary crisis and an immediate

S.B. Chimitdorjiyev whether the Buryats have jointed Russia 
voluntarily'' [quotations as received] the author considers 
that, judging by the historical documents, there are no grounds 
to speak about voluntary joining of the Buryat tribes Russia. 
  At the same time, in his view, it should not go to extremes 
of another kind, considering that the Buryats everywhere were 
coming out against the Russians. As the author writes, the 
process of joining Russia by the majority of the Buryat tribes 
was going on up to the 60s-80s of the 17th century. In the 
article it is said that prior to that time many Buryat tribes 
were under the rule of the Mongolian Haans.

Enddo, who accompanied the president of the country during his 
official visit to several countries of Asia.

Bayasgalan about the destiny of A.F. Kerenskiy, who in his time 
was heading the provisional government of Russia. The author 
considers that he has fallen a victim of the Bolshevik plot in 
1917.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 31 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs that the State Great Hural (SGH) 
spring session set to consideration of the draft law on state 
service. The draft law has been submitted for consideration to 
the SGH session by the Minister of Justice N. Lubsanjav. 
  As the newspaper informs, the Mongolian delegation headed by 
the Vice Premier L. Enebish has visited Hungary, where has got 
acquainted with methods and forms of privatization of property 
in this country, activity of the stock exchange and the exchange 
of securities. The delegation has been received by the Prime 
Minister of Hungary P. Boross. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the chief 
of 
the National Coordination Bureau on Realization of the Project 
"Tasis" C. Ulaan announces that the European Union has decided 
to grant to Mongolia in 1994-1995 fiscal year 8 mln [million] 
ECU [European currency unit] within the framework of rendering 
technical assistance. These means will be spent on training of 
specialists capable to work under market conditions, on 
elaboration of projects of development of small and medium 
enterprises on processing agricultural produce, and also of 
projects of development of power industry. 
  As the newspaper informs, at the government regular sitting 
the Prime Minister P. Jasray has given concrete orders to the 
members of the Cabinet of Ministers on timely realization of the 
unfulfilled tasks. These tasks are connected first of all with 
restoration of the production level, foundation of 
infrastructure meeting the market economy conditions, 
strengthening of discipline and order and others. 
  Interpreting some theses of the speech made by the President 
P. Ochirbat at the opening of the State Great Hural spring 
session, the head of the president's press service Ch. 
Chuluunbaatar, in particular, notes that the president in many 
respects proceeded from necessity of regulation of the crisis of 
activity of different parties in the parliament. The concrete 
proposals of the president, which have been submitted on the 
basis of concordance of views of different parties, were 
accepted by the parliament. On the other hand, as Ch. 
Chuluunbaatar notes, some remarks of the president, directly 
addressing the parliament leadership and the prime minister, 
have been directed to liquidation of infringement of some 
provisions of the labour code. 
  The Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) newspaper ERH 
CHOLOO informs that the party General Council has adopted a 
resolution, concerning activity of the State Great Hural. In 
the resolution it is noted that the supreme legislative organ of 
the country does not reflect a real balance of political forces, 
because of which the parliamentary crisis is continuing, the 
state democratic system is being violated. The Mongolian 
National Democratic Party General Council suggested its 
representatives in the parliament to demand on behalf of the 
party to submit to the spring session additions and amendments 
in the law on State Great Hural, define in detail methods and 
forms of organization of the parliament majority and the 
minority, their rights and duties, establish the principles of 
propaganda of the parliament activity specifying the rights of 
the minority, revise the law on elections. 
  In case the demands of the MNDP General Council are not 
accepted the party representatives are recommended to abstain 
from participation in the parliament activity. 
  The newspaper publishes the demands of the Mongolian 
Democratic Union (MDU) to the government. These demands concern 
a support for national producers and engagement of citizens in 
production activity an increase of rates and timely delivery of 
pensions and allowances to the vulnerable section of the 
population, stopping of misfirings in electric energy supply, 
reinforcement of the state control over quality of goods, 
effective use of credits and assistance of foreign countries and 
international organizations. The Mongolian Democratic Union has 
demanded also to ensure priority development of education, 
create new work-places and stop the growth of unemployment, 
create socio-economic conditions for prevention of the growth of 
criminality. 
  The newspaper publishes an article devoted to problems of 
oil 
extraction in the country. In the article it is noted that 
Russia's interest in exploration of oil deposits in many 
respects has a political character and is connected with her 
wish not to lose her influence in Mongolia. The author of the 
article B. Bayarmagnai considers that for exploitation of oil 
deposits of Mongolia the modern technology is necessary, the 
technology, being used in Russia, does not meet the present 
requirements. 
  The newspaper informs about participation of the leader of 
the Mongolian National Democratic Party D. Gandold and the 
member of the MNDP General Council in the regional conference of 
the International Democratic Union, being held in Sydney. 
  The newspaper informs that the conference has admitted the 
Mongolian National Democratic Party to the membership of the 
International Democratic Union.

  [Text] Hanoi, March 31 (CTK) -- Parliamentary 
representatives of Vietnam and the Czech Republic are reviewing 
economic and trade agreements before Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec's visit to Vietnam, Vietnamese deputies told CTK. 
  A Czech parliamentary delegation is currently on a four day 
visit to Vietnam, led by parliament chairman Milan Uhde. 
  The need to update existing agreements has arisen from the 
Czech Republic having undergone substantive changes in economy 
and foreign trade, a subject discussed with the Vietnamese side 
by Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy during his 
visit to Vietnam last November. 
  An agreement is being drawn up on settling the Vietnamese 
debt worth 92,3 million XTR (interchangeable rubles) and $7.4 
million. 
  Vietnamese deputies agreed with the Czech proposal that 
bilateral agreements on double taxation and the protection of 
investments be signed, Czech deputy Jan Krycer said, adding that 
use might be made of the knowledge and expertise of the 
Vietnamese who had received Czech training and worked in the 
Czech Republic.

  [Text] Hanoi, March 31 (CTK) -- The Czech parliamentary 
delegation currently on a four-day visit to Vietnam today met 
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh.

democracy and human rights, adding that Southeast Asia could 
become a market for Czech goods. He also spoke in favor of 
Czech-Vietnamese parliamentary cooperation. 
  The Czech delegation then met Vietnamese Premier Vo Van 
Kiet, 
"the man who carries the burden of the Vietnamese economic 
reform," Uhde told journalists, adding that the two sides spoke 
about the need to sign bilateral agreements on investment 
protection, double taxation, and tax evasion. 
  Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's visit, due in

that the current visit managed to do away with a "certain 
silence and unease."

<F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 31 (AFP) -- Having captured the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] stronghold at Pailin last week, the Cambodian 
Army will aim next at the guerrillas' mountain base on the Thai 
border, home to their top commanders, a Cambodian general 
declared in a report Thursday. 
  The base, on a mountain called Phnom Malai, is where up to 
30,000 Cambodian refugees were repatriated by the Thai military, 
after fleeing the fighting at Pailin, with the assurance that 
they would be safe there. 
  Not far from the northwest Aranyaprathet-Poipet border 
crossing, Phnom Malai is believed to be the permanent home of 
Khmer Rouge second-in-command Ieng Sary, as well as the 
part-time residence of the clandestine leader of the radical 
guerrillas, Pol Pot. 
  Border intelligence reports reaching Phnom Penh indicate 
that 
Pol Pot divides his time between his house in Phnom Malai, a 
second residence in a compound just inside the border from the 
Thai town of Trat, and a third in the Thai capital, Bangkok. The 
fanatical Maoist is responsible for the deaths of a million 
Cambodians in the "Killing Fields" during his rule in the 1970s. 
  "We are waiting for orders from the Royal Government. Then 
we 
can attack Phnom Malai at any time," said General Lay Vireak, 
quoted in the daily Khmer-language REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA newspaper. 
"The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are ready to capture Phnom 
Malai, which is a stronghold of 5,000 Khmer Rouge fighters," he 
said. "It is not as easy to attack as Pailin, because it is a 
real Khmer Rouge soldiers' base, whereas Pailin is only an 
economic base." 
  Pailin's ruby and sapphire mines and its rich hardwood 
forests provided an estimated one million dollars per month in 
revenues to Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who allowed concessions to 
Thai mining companies. 
  Although invading government troops have found several 
hundred tonnes of weapons hidden around Pailin, its primary 
purpose was economic and strategic rather than military, 
diplomats and observers here say. The road to Phnom Malai is 
paved on the Thai side of the border, but on the Cambodian side, 
the mountainous, jungle-covered and malarial slopes will pose a 
formidable challenge to government troops already under pressure 
as they hold onto Pailin. In addition, the government is still 
using its resources in an attempt to retake parts of the Khmer 
Rouge's base in northern Cambodia, at Anlong Veng, which it 
captured and lost in February, diplomatic sources say. 
  Co-premier Hun Sen, who controls the Army, is likely to wait 
until the areas are more secure, before ordering the opening of 
another front, according to diplomats. Khmer Rouge troops at 
Phnom Malai shelled government troops reinforcing Pailin -- 
about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) to the south -- for one hour on 
Monday, the newspaper said. It reported 62 Khmer Rouge and 
seven government soldiers dead, three Khmer Rouge captured and 
600 AK-47s seized, but did not give the time frame for the 
fighting. 
  Another general reached by telephone denied a claim on Khmer 
Rouge radio that guerrillas had completely surrounded the 
government troops at Pailin and at a second location, Sala Krau. 
"We are not in the Khmer Rouge trap," he said. "We don't need 
to worry. We can match any manpower of theirs with our own.

  [Text] The Cambodian People's Party [CPP] will soon operate 
its own television and FM radio stations. According to a 
high-ranking party official, the Information Ministry granted 
permission last week for the television and FM radio stations to 
be set up and air their programs to the public. 
  Mr. It Samheng, deputy cabinet director of the CPP, 
stressed: 
Technicians have made all the necessary arrangements to proceed 
with the construction as soon as possible. They are awaiting 
the final decision on the selection of a site. The technicians 
have to choose between two locations for the station. The first 
is the present party office compound and the second is the 
former party office, located behind the Botumvaddei Monastery. 
It is likely they will pick the current party office as the 
site for the television and FM radio stations. 
  The official went on to reveal that the television and FM 
radio stations will not be the CPP's exclusive property. They 
belong to a private company operating under the name ABK, which 
is completely locally owned. No details have been made 
available, however, on the shares the CPP holds in ABK or the 
duration of the venture. The party official affirmed that the 
television and radio transmissions will not be used as a tool 
against television and radio stations belonging to any other 
party. They will contribute toward serving Royal Government 
policy and the king's national reconciliation policy and will 
propagate news of all kinds to serve socioeconomic development 
in the interest of the general public. 
  Although he did not mention any economic considerations, 
some 
economists have observed that television and radio stations are 
prime sources of considerable income from commercial 
advertisements. 
  Some circles have expressed concern that these particular 
television and radio stations might become rivals to Radio FM 90 
megahertz and Television Cambodia, widely known to be run by the 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party. Others have said it 
is merely a CPP attempt to get even with FUNCINPEC, especially 
in preparation for the elections in the next 4 or 5 years. 
  It is understood that the television and radio stations of 
the State of Cambodia, formerly under CPP control, were returned 
to government hands the day the election results were announced 
last June. 
  This CPP television will be called "Television Angkor, 
Cambodia." No one knows yet how powerful this television and FM 
radio station's transmitter will be. According to Mr. It 
Samheng, it has been projected that in the initial stage the 
station will have the same power as TVK, the present 
government's national television network. In the future, its 
transmitting power will be enhanced to equal that of IBC 
[International Broadcasting Corporation]. 
  It should be noted that the power of the present 
government-run television station is about 1 kilowatt, while 
IBC's is about 10 kw. 
  When the CPP's television and FM radio stations become 
operational, there will be four television stations and five [as 
published] radio stations in Cambodia: the government's 
television and radio, IBC television, FUNCINPEC television and 
FM radio, CPP television and FM radio, and Phnom Penh's radio. 
Not long ago, it was rumored that Kandal Province was planning 
to run its own radio station. This project has since been 
aborted.

  [Text] Responsible Burmese Government personnel have said 
that cease-fire talks with the Mon delegates in Moulmein ended 
successfully earlier this week. The Burmese Government said 
both sides had a frank and cordial exchange of views, explained 
their own positions, and discussed their differences of opinion. 
This is the second round of cease-fire talks; the first was 
held last December. According to Rangoon public opinion, the 
Burmese military leaders did not expect to reach a cease-fire 
agreement at the present talks. The next round of talks are 
scheduled to be held in Moulmein before the end of next month, 
but the Mon group does not seem too eager about the talks. 
According to sources among the ethnic groups at the 
Thai-Burmese border, the talks ended when it became clear that 
Burmese Government troops will not be withdrawn from 
Mon-controlled areas -- a matter the Mon group has been pursuing 
since the end of the first round of talks with the Burmese 
Government last year. 
  According to Burmese and Mon sources, the main topic of 
discussion was border demarcation. It seems the Mons have 
exaggerated the region they claim to control. The Burmese 
military government delegates -- although not objecting outright 
-- say the cease-fire implementation should be based on the 
areas presently controlled by both sides, a stance they have 
maintained all along. The cease-fire agreement will officially 
recognize the end of military operations; troop withdrawal 
should not interfere with it. The government side pointed out 
that the withdrawal of troops will be the last thing discussed. 
  Five senior Mon officials from the New Mon State Party 
[NMSP] 
arrived in Bangkok from Moulmein yesterday and had dinner with 
the Burmese military attache last night. According to Mon 
sources, the parties will meet again in (?Ranong) on the 
Thai-Burmese border in a few days to discuss the outcome of the 
Moulmein talks and draw up future programs, with more talks 
expected in the near future. Burmese Government officials have 
always accepted that it was never easy to hold talks with 
internal ethnic rebel organizations. Discussions were held on 
many occasions for more than a year before the cease-fire 
agreement was signed with the Kachins. The NMSP does not expect 
the cease-fire talks to take that long, but both sides agree 
that more talks are needed before the cease-fire agreement is 
signed. 
  According to responsible Burmese Government personnel, the 
second round of peace talks with the Karenni National 
Development Party is scheduled to be held soon in Loikaw, 
capital of Karenni State. The first round of talks was held in 
January. Another Karenni group, the Karenni National People's 
Liberation Front, announced they had agreed on a regional 
cease-fire in February, but responsible Burmese Government 
officials claim the Karenni group has not yet made any such 
arrangements.

<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>
  [Text] The armed ethnic Mon group announced yesterday there 
had been "slow progress" in its ceasefire talks with the Burmese 
junta and several more rounds of meetings will be needed to 
reach a truce. 
  The second round of negotiations took place from March 20 to 
28 at the Burma Army's Southeast Command Headquarters in 
Moulmein, capital of the Mon State in southern Burma. 
  While the five-member Mon delegation tabled a 14-point 
agenda 
at the first meeting which ended January 3, both sides 
eventually agreed to concentrate first on a ceasefire 
arrangement. 
  The Mon announcement came amid strong speculation that talks 
between the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Burmese junta, 
known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), 
had broken down. 
  The Mon is one of the three remaining ethnic guerilla 
movements, which the Slorc has urged to enter peace negotiations. 
  While the Slorc has already met with the Karenni group, It 
has not yet opened talks with them. 
  The Karenni, the largest armed ethnic group of Karen, have 
insisted that ceasefire talks take place outside Burma. 
  In an interview on Wednesday after their return from 
Moulmein, two members of the Mon negotiating team, Nai Tin Aung, 
NMSP foreign affairs chief; and Nai Soe Myint, NMSP governor of 
Thatun District. said both meetings focused on the military 
demarcation line separating territories controlled by Mon forces 
and Burmese troops. 
  They specified five particular areas where the group wants 
to 
have full control --- the central area of NMSP near Tavoy, 
Moulmein, Mergui District, Tavoy District and Thaton District. 
  The identified territory is home to several hundreds 
thousand 
ethnic Mon, many of whom support the armed movement. 
  Although "different points of view" over the demarcation 
still existed, Nai Tin Aung said he believed the two sides "can 
overcome" their differences. 
  "The ceasefire is linked to demarcation of Slorc and NMSP 
troops. We are still dealing with this. 
  "So far no agreement has been reached, but slowly we have 
made some progress," he said. 
  A date for the next meeting has been fixed. Nai Tin Aung 
said his team has to report back to the NMSP central committee 
before a new round of talks could be convened. 
  The Mon team was led by Maj-Gen Htaw Mon, NMSP secretary of 
the war commission. 
  It also included Col Kaw Rot, a member of the war commission 
and Nai Lavi Mon, education department chief. 
  Burmese Commander for Southeastern Command Maj Gen Ket Sein 
headed the Burmese delegation to the two peace forums. 
  Other delegates were Deputy Commander for Southeastern 
Command, Col Aung San, Col Kyaw Win, deputy director of the 
powerful Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence (DDSI), 
Burmese Military Attache to Bangkok, Col Thein Swe; Lt Col Kyaw 
Thein of the DDSI; Southeastern Command Chief of Staff, Lt Col 
Soe Htay, and Maj Myo Myint, a senior officer of Military 
Intelligence in Moulmein. 
  After the talks were inaugurated on March 20, the meeting 
was 
suspended while the Mon negotiators took two days to visit 
relatives and local Mon, Nai Tin Aung and Nai Soe Myint sald. 
  "We explained to them the necessity to enter separate talks 
with the Slorc to end the civil war which has been going on for 
45 years ...militarily, that is why we entered talks with Slorc 
separately," Nai Tin Aung said. 
  He said political turmoil in Burma needed a two-pronged 
approach, first to get a military ceasefire with various armed 
ethnic forces, and second to settle political problems with the 
participation of all parties concerned. 
  "But to have peace in Burma, we have to have a political 
settlement which must be done collectively by all parties 
together," he said. 
  Despite its pledges to adhere to the principle of collective 
peace negotiations with the Slorc laid down by the Democratic 
Alliance of Burma. [paragraph as published] 
  It is a loose umbrella organization of a dozen armed ethnic 
and dissident Burmese groups, the NMSP central committee agreed 
last November to engage in separate talks with the Slorc. 
  Nai Tin Aung said the Mon decision was in response to 
overtures by Burmese junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and that the 
group wanted to "test his sincerity." 
  We considered very deeply his invitation. We think since he 
was talking about peace we should accept it. 
  "We need to test his sincerity," he added.

    [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in 
Burmese at 1300 GMT on 29 March carries a 50-minute report on 
the 29 March plenary session of the National Convention to draw 
up the basic principles for drafting the new state constitution 
held in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence 
compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The report includes recorded 
extracts of the proposal papers read by eight delegates from the 
political parties. 
  First, U Kyar Har Shei of the Lahu National Development 
Party 
presents his party's report. He proposes that statehood be 
granted to national races other than those who have already 
obtained the status of region and state; or the status of 
special division could be granted if a national race is not yet 
qualified to obtain the statehood. He also calls for direct 
access to the central government. He also proposes that 
self-administered regions and self-administered states be given 
the right of "self-administration and self-determination" in 
order for them to carry out the necessary legislative and 
administrative work. 
  He says Lahu nationals are spread out throughout the Shan 
State, especially in areas east of Salween River, and live 
together with Shan, Akhar, and Wa. He proposes that "Mong Ping, 
Mong Hsat, Mong Ton Towns be merged and formed into the Lahu 
National Self-Autonomous Zone" which will remain under the Wa 
State or Wa Special Division. 
  Continuing, he proposes that Yangon [Rangoon], as the 
capital 
city of the nation, be placed under the administration of the 
region concerned and not under the direct administration of the 
president, as proposed by some delegates. 
  Addressing the chapter on head of state, he proposes that 
the 
president be assisted by a vice president. 
  Next, U Saw Than Aung, deputy chairman of the Karen National 
League presents his party's proposal paper. He first presents 
an important issue affecting the Karen nationals -- "fifth 
principle on the state structure, which says national races 
other than those who have already achieved the status of region 
or state" shall be entitled to a self-administered division or 
self-administered zone. Citing the distribution of Karen in the 
country, he asks the convention that the Karen State be made an 
exception to that principle. He says "the population of Karen 
in the Karen State constitutes only one fifth of the total 
population of Karen living throughout the country and that four 
fifths of Karen population live in other regions and states." 
He asks that the self-administered areas for national races 
with a population of between 100,000 and 500,000 be determined 
by the delegates during the duration of the convention. 
  He suggests that Pa-o, Palaung, Danu, Lahu, Akhar, Wa, 
Kokang, Mro or Khami, Naga, Lisu and others be granted 
self-administered area status if they so desire. 
  He says if the population of the Karen State is 1 million, 
there are 7 million estimated to be living outside the Karen 
State. With a view to solving the Karen national issue during 
the current period, he suggests that the ministry of national 
races affairs be set up in the central government to attend to 
the needs of Karen and other nationals. He also suggests that 
the constitution include a provision for the formation of the 
Karen Affairs Council with Karen members of Parliament from the 
Karen State and from other regions and states in order to solve 
the Karen problem. He also proposes that a Directorate of Karen 
Affairs be formed under the council. 
  Addressing the chapter on head of state, he proposes that 
the 
electoral college be formed with three groups of members from 
the two chambers of Parliament. 
  The meeting goes into recess at 1100 and resumes at 1200. U 
Phu Kwe Si of Kokang Democracy and Unity Party presents his 
party's report. He suggests that "in recognition of the 
historical, geographical, and cultural background of Kokang 
nationals, it is proposed that the social, economic, and 
administrative affairs of Kokang be managed by the Kokang, who 
are familiar with own customs and traditions." Addressing the 
issue of state structure, he proposes that that "the Northern 
Shan State Special Region-1 be granted the status of 
self-administered division or self-administered zone." 
  Addressing the issue of head of state, he suggests that the 
electoral college be formed with three groups of members of the 
two chambers of Parliament to elect the president and two vice 
presidents. 
  Next, U Marcos alias U Sai Lon of the Wa National 
Development 
Party reads his party's report to the plenary session. He says 
he again presents the proposal to prescribe the Wa State for Wa 
and other related races -- (Em), Palaung, (Shan Tau), (Ainkyin), 
Duwai, Lawa -- living in Tangyan, Mong Hsu, and an area between 
south of Nam Ting Creek and areas on eastern bank of the Salween 
River, including Mong Ton and Mong Hsat. He also suggests that 
new states, self-administered divisions, and self-administered 
zones of the Union be given the rights of self-administration 
and self-determination. 
  He also suggests that legislative, judicial, and 
administrative powers be enjoyed by legislatures of the regions 
and that states be also granted self-administered divisions. He 
proposes that the government form commissions composed of 
experts and leaders of national races concerned in order to 
determine the self-administered divisions and self-administered 
zones. 
  Continuing, U Marcos says the Wa want direct access to the 
central government, rather than through parliament of a region 
or state, in attending to local political, economic, social, 
administrative, and development matters. 
  He also suggests that special union territories under the 
direct administration of the president shall not be formed 
unnecessarily. Regarding the issue of head of state, he suggests 
that the president and vice president be elected by the Union 
Parliament. He concludes his party's report by asking for the 
delegates' pardon if the report contains any mistake or offends 
any person or organization. 
  Next, U Khin Maung, Panglong, of the National League for 
Democracy [NLD] presents his party's report. He notes the 
present time is the period for all national races to consult 
patiently among themselves as in a family, without any mutual 
suspicion. He says "It is very important for all to work in 
unity in order to raise high the banner of national 
reconciliation and march toward the emergence of a new 
democratic state." He says he agrees with the four principles 
on the state as explained by the chairman of the National 
Convention Convening Work Committee [NCCWC], but he would like 
to add the following provision: "Myanmar [Burma] is a 
motherland, where all indigenous national races reside" and that 
"this land is the motherland and country of all indigenous 
national races." He says "the perpetuation of the Myanmar 
Motherland depends on national unity. In recognition of this 
fact, the aforementioned provision should be included in the 
state constitution to further strengthen national unity. He 
adds: "As Myanmar is a motherland which jointly belongs to all 
indigenous national races, there is no reason for national races 
to be divided and to secede." 
  Next, U Nyunt Wai, elected representative from Pegu 
Division's Toungoo constituency-2, continues to read the NLD 
report. Addressing the issue of state structure, U Nyunt Wai 
says: "Extra care should be given in prescribing 
self-administrative zones in order to prevent the 
Yugoslavia-like scenario in the country." He expresses the hope 
that national races will work together. He suggests that the 
issue of granting self-administered status be determined by a 
government-appointed commission composed of national leaders as 
well as local leaders. 
  Regarding the status of the state capital, U Nyunt Wai 
suggests that Rangoon should retain its present status. He 
suggests that strategic places, such as the Coco Islands, be 
placed under the direct administration of the central government. 
  Next, U Lwin, secretary of the NLD, continues reading the 
NLD 
report when the session resumes at 1440 after a recess. U Lwin 
says: "It is the NLD policy to practise the federal system [two 
preceding words given in English] and to share and distribute 
the three sovereign powers with organs of power at different 
levels." He reiterates "the NLD policy that the system of 
administration of the state shall be based on democracy." 
  Addressing the issue of self-administered divisions and 
self-administered zones, he suggests that the legislative bodies 
of the self-administered divisions and zones should be 
democratic and should be formed with members who have the 
mandate of the voters in their respective constituencies. He 
expresses his concern that "if this is not practised, genuine 
democracy cannot be achieved and will amount to a 
self-infringement of the objective for a multiparty democratic 
system." Quoting political scientists, Jacobson and Lippmann, 
he says "the wishes of the voters constitute political sovereign 
power. Therefore, the legislatures concerned should only be 
formed with representatives elected by the people themselves." 
  Next, U Aung Shwe, NLD chairman, continues reading the NLD 
report. He says the NLD accepts the provision as explained by 
the chairman of the NCCWC that the president shall be a person 
capable of preventing disintegration of the Union and national 
unity and contributing to the perpetuation of national 
sovereignty and the progress and prosperity of the nation. He 
notes the NCCWC chairman also stipulates "the person to be 
president must be well versed in the political, administrative, 
economic, and military affairs of the state." I Aung Shwe says 
that although he agrees with the provision for loyalty toward 
the nation and its citizens, he asks "whether it is practical to 
prescribe the aforementioned qualifications." He says such 
qualifications can create problems for those standing for 
elections. Moreover, he says "the qualification to be well 
versed in military affairs would further limit the candidates as 
the majority of women who have won equal rights as men and 
worked side by side with them through various eras will not be 
able to stand for elections." He says: "All males and females 
who meet the citizenship requirements should be able to stand 
for elections." 
t] Continuing, U Aung Shwe refers to the national convention 
convening work committee chairman's proposed basic principle of 
electing a president by three parliamentary groups. He notes 
that the union parliament has been entrusted with the mandate 
[preceding word rendered in English] of the people. He says 
there is a need to have the participation of all the national 
races nationwide and to be within the framework of democracy in 
electing a president who will have the mandate of the entire 
populace. He proposes that "The first group be composed of 
members of the chamber of parliament who are elected based on an 
equal representation from regions and states; the second group 
be composed of members of the chamber of parliament who are 
elected based on population; the third group be composed of 
members of the two chambers of parliament elected by the people 
from the states, divisions, and self-administered zones." He 
suggests that there should be only one chamber in the state and 
division parliaments and reiterates that the National League for 
Democracy is fully aware of the six national convention 
objectives. 
  He then proposes that "the groups should each select a 
presidential candidate either from among the parliamentarians or 
from outside. A presidential candidate select committee 
composed of senior members of the union parliament should 
scrutinize the qualifications of the candidate. If the 
candidate is found to be ineligible the candidacy should become 
invalid and a new candidate must be selected. After approving 
the presidential candidates, the union parliament should elect 
one of the candidates as president by sacred ballot. The 
candidate who received the second highest number of votes would 
become the vice president."

    [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in 
Burmese at 1300 GMT on 30 March carried a 50-minute report on 
the 30 March National Convention Plenary Session to draw up the 
basic principles for drafting the new state constitution, held 
in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence 
compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The report includes recorded 
extracts of proposal papers read by six delegates from the 
political parties. 
  First, U Sai Soe Nyunt, a member of the Central Executive 
Committee of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD], 
presents his party's proposal paper on the chapter headings 
relating to the state, state structure, and head of state. 
Referring to the chapter heading on state structure, he recalls 
that "at the National Convention Plenary Session held on 13 
August 1993, the SNLD proposed that the Union of Myanmar be 
composed of Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamah [Burmese], Mon, 
Rakhine, and Shan States, which are equal. In other words, the 
Union should be comprised of eight states. The chairman of the 
National Convention Convening Work Committee prescribed that 
under the new constitution, the existing seven divisions should 
be formed into seven regions and the seven existing states 
should be formed into seven states, and that the said seven 
regions and seven states should have equal status. Therefore, 
this principle is different from our policy." 
  He suggests some nomenclature changes to be made to suit the 
times. He proposes that Union state [pyi-daung-su pyi-ne] be 
changed to national state [amyotha pyi-ne], autonomous state 
[ko- paing ok-chok-ya pyi-ne] be changed to autonomous region 
[ko-paing ok-chok-ya de-tha], and ethnic state [lu-myo-zu 
pyi-ne] be changed to national area [lu-myo-zu ne-mye]. He 
proposes that members of the Union should be organized into 
these three categories. 
  Addressing the issue of power sharing, U Sai Soe Nyunt 
suggests that "union states who are members of the Union shall 
be given political autonomy. The states shall not be allowed to 
exercise sovereignty, however." He proposes further that 
"autonomous regions be given administrative autonomy," and that 
"national areas be given cultural autonomy." 
  He says: "The principle of a Union based on equal 
opportunity and status and the second point relating to full 
self-determination for the states are two issues that constitute 
the very heart of the Union. In other words, it is the very 
essence of the spirit of Panglong, and it should not be left 
out. Therefore, every time the issue of the Union is raised, it 
is necessary to scrutinize constantly whether it is based on the 
spirit of Panglong. The Panglong Treaty was signed in a spirit 
of unity." 
  U Sai Soe Nyunt explains that "in order to ensure checks and 
balances between the two chambers of Parliament, it is necessary 
to have Bamah State, which is comprised of seven regions. Only 
then can the two chambers control and balance each other and 
serve the country's interests by legislating laws acceptable to 
all." 
  Continuing, he says if some national races are granted 
autonomous regions for various reasons while other national 
races are not given the same status, despite meeting the 
requirements, the latter will be resentful and it will not 
benefit the Union. He says: "The British used the 
divide-and-rule strategy, and we will be accused of using the 
tactics of separate-and-rule in our era." Therefore, it is 
proposed that if the status of autonomous region is to be 
granted at all, it should be based on common criteria and 
fairness. 
  He says it will be necessary to consider the wishes and 
demands of the national races who were ignored when the 
constitutions of 1947 and 1974 were drafted. "These national 
races are the Tai Lai, Tai Nae, Tai Mau, Tai Sar, Tai Hkamti, 
Tai Kadu, Tai Kannan, and Tai Kuan -- various groups of Tai Lian 
race -- who are spread throughout upper Sagaing Division and 
lower Kachin State." The Tai Lian are a non-Kachin race whose 
existence has been ignored. They were known as a Shan-Bamah 
race living along the railway line in Sagaing Division and 
Kachin State and their original name of Tai Lian has been 
forgotten for over 40 years. He says these groups of Tai Lian 
meet the requirements to have a Tai Lian autonomous region. He 
"appeals for the third time publicly that the following areas be 
declared as constituting the Tai Lian autonomous region: All 
plains in Bhamo, Momauk, Mansi, Shwegu in Bhamo District; in 
Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Mogaung, Mohnyin, Kamaing, (Mumkuam) of 
Tanai in Myitkyina District; the former territory of Wuntha 
Sawbwa in Katha, Indaw, Tigyaing, Banmauk, Kawlin, Wuntha, and 
Pinlebu in Katha District; Kale, Paungbyin, Tamu, Kalewa, 
Mawlaik, and (Mokang) in Kale District; and the former territory 
of Hkamti Sawbwa in Hkamti, Homalin, and Namyun." 
  He then proposes that a commission composed of honorable and 
impartial persons be formed by the state in order to ascertain 
the genuine wishes regarding self-administered areas. He says 
if self- administered divisions are granted legislative power 
they should have a legislature. In such cases, there will be 
too many legislatures and it will contradict the principles 
mentioned by the work committee chairman -- each region and 
state should have their own legislature. Therefore, he proposes 
self-administered divisions not be given legislative power. 
  Addressing the chapter heading on head of state, U Sai Soe 
Nyunt says: "We accept the principle that the president is the 
head of state. We differ in opinion, however, on the 
president's powers. We want the president as a ceremonial head 
of state as in the 1947 Constitution. We want the parliamentary 
form of government headed by a prime minister." Continuing, he 
says: "If it is determined that the presidential system is the 
most suitable for our country, it is suggested that the 
president be elected directly by the people, as in the United 
States and the Philippines. A person eligible to be elected as 
a member of parliament should also be eligible to become 
president. Therefore, we should prescribe the principle that a 
person who meets the age requirement and whose parents are both 
citizens meets the requirement for the post of president. There 
should be no other requirements." 
  U Sai Soe Nyunt concludes his report by saying that "it is 
the firm belief of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy 
that members of state organs who are to administer the people 
should be freely elected and appointed by the people themselves." 
  Next, U Thein Tun, a member of the group representing 
elected 
representatives from the National Unity Party, reads his paper. 
He first discusses the chapter heading on the state and 
requirements for self-administered areas to be formed in the 
regions and states under the new constitution. He suggests that 
a decision on the matter first be obtained from the convention. 
He supports the proposal that "the capital city of Yangon 
[Rangoon] be declared a union territory under the direct 
administration of the president." 
  Continuing, he expresses his support for the procedures for 
electing the president suggested by the work committee chairman. 
He suggests that the president and vice presidents be allowed a 
second term, that they not be allowed to accept any other 
professional posts or allowed to hold shares in economic 
enterprises, and that they be allowed to declare a list of their 
assets and those of their family to the Union Parliament each 
year. 
  He concludes his report by offering to work for the success 
of the National Convention through consultation and cooperation 
and with magnanimity and mutual trust. 
  After a recess, the plenary session resumes at 1210. U San 
Hla, a member of the elected representatives delegate group from 
the Union Pa-O National Organization, reads his group's report. 
He supports the formation of the state as a union. He points 
out the imperfections of the prime minister as a head of state 
in previous administrations and endorses the proposal for a 
presidential system of government. 
  Next, independent representative U Htaung Kho Htan reads the 
first part of a collective report by himself, U Yankyin Maw of 
the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party, and independent 
representatives Dr. Hmu Tang. He expresses the need to prohibit 
racial and religious discrimination in the new democratic state. 
His group report proposes that the name region not be used, and 
that all 14 states and divisions should be called states. He 
supports the basic principle on the formation of 
self-administered divisions or self- administered zones and 
proposes the need for prescribing "self- administered areas for 
the Kokang, Danu, Pa-O, Palaung, Bamar, and Wa nationals from 
Shan State; Chin, Kuki Chin, and Naga Chin nationals from 
Sagaing Division; and Asho Chin nationals living in Magwe 
Division and Arakan State." He also suggests the formation of a 
commission to determine self-administered areas. 
  Dr. Hmu Tang reads the second part of the report. He 
proposes that the capital should be Rangoon and that is should 
consist of Sanchaung, Bahan, Kemmendine, Hlaing, Insein, 
Mingaladon, Dawbon, Yankin, Tamwe, Thaketa, Thingangyun, South 
Okkalapa, North Okkalapa, Mayangon, Ahlone, Pazundaung, 
Kyauktada, Mingalataungnyunt, Dagon, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, 
Botataung, Latha, Seikkan, and Kamayut townships. The capital 
should be a union territory administered by a mayor, elected by 
the people residing in the townships, and a city council. He 
says the basic principle of the president being the national 
leader of all national races should not be adopted, explaining 
that the status of national leader does not belong to a person 
just because he is a president. It is a status automatically 
designated by the people to honor heroes for their selfless 
service to the people and country. He also objects to the basic 
principal that the president should live in the country for at 
least 20 consecutive years to be eligible for election. He says 
it only depends on "loyalty to the country and people, love for 
the country, and goodwill toward the country." If the 20-year 
rule is adopted, it will be like closing the door of opportunity 
on the 20 million Burmese women who will never be able to get on 
the political stage. He proposes electing a president or vice 
president by rotating among the elected representatives based on 
equal representation from the Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamar, 
Mon, Arakan, and Shan. He finally proposes that any vice 
president who is not subsequently elected should not serve as 
vice president. 
  U San Tha Aung, an elected representative from the Mro, or 
Khami National Solidarity Organization [MKNSO], is scheduled 
present his report next. Becuase he is a member of the panel of 
chairmen, he is excused from reading his report, and with the 
approval of the alternate chairman his report is put on record. 
The television announcer presents extracts of his report. The 
report proposes that the Wa; Pa-O; Palaung; Mro, or Khami; 
Kokang; Lahu; Naga; Rawan; Kayan; Akhar; Lihsu; and Danu 
national races should be allowed to have self-administered 
divisions. The report says the Mro national race has lived in a 
congruous territory in "Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, Mrauk-U, Buthidaung, 
Maungdaw, Rathedaung, and Kyauktaw townships of Northern Arakan 
State, and Paletwa township in Southern Chin State, with an 
estimated population of 150,000." The report also proposes that 
a Mro self-administered division should be established not by a 
commission but by the delegates. In the report, he supports the 
work committee's proposals on electing the president and vice 
presidents and adds a proposal that "in accordance with the 
constitution, the president and vice presidents should be given 
suitable remuneration, benefits, and housing." 
  The plenary session ends at 1415.

<F P=106> [By Fel V. Maragay] </F>
  [Text] President Ramos inaugurated yesterday the $128 
million diesel power plant at the Subic Bay Free Port which will 
boost power reserves by 116 megawatts and further minimize the 
possibility of brownouts during the summer months. 
  The opening of the plant, the chief executive said, 
disproves 
the apprehensions of some quarters that Luzon and other parts of 
the country may be hit by power outages lasting about five hours 
daily during the dry months. 
  "Today, we also deliver a strong message to our people that 
there will be enough electric power this summer to meet the 
needs of households and large industrial users alike, and 
debunk, through action and accomplishment, the delusions and 
fears of some doubting Thomases in our midst that power 
sufficiency will not be possible at this time," Mr. Ramos said. 
  This is the fifth power plant to be inaugurated by the chief 
executive in three weeks. 
  Earlier, Mr. Ramos opened four power facilities with a 
combined generating capacity of 285 MW -- three plants for Luzon 
and one for Mindanao. 
  The three power projects in Luzon with a combined capacity 
of 
240.73 MW which the President had switched on were the Kalayaan 
Pump Storage Power Plant Unit II in Laguna de Bay (150 MW), the 
Macban Binary Power Plant between Mt. Makiling and Mt. Banahaw 
in Laguna (15.73 MW) and the Bacman I Unit II and Bacman II Unit 
I geothermal plant (75 MW) in the boundary of Albay and Sorsogon. 
  The Subic Power Plant was built by Enron Power Philippines 
Corp. in partnership with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. 
headed by Chairman Alfonso Yuchengco, House of Investments, and 
Pan Malayan Investment and Management Corp. under the 
build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme. 
  The president said it was propitious that the Enron power 
plant was inaugurated on Palm Sunday, marking the "light-filled 
entry" of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. 
  "This power plant comes as a fitting reminder that from 
suffering comes redemption and that we can triumph if we have 
the will, and call upon God's help to achieve," he said. 
  Mr. Ramos recalled that he had vowed last year to end power 
outages by December. He said he had also promised that in the 
following months, his administration will take further steps to 
strengthen the power sector and build up the power reserves to 
cope with the peak demands of summer. 
  "We have made good on that promise," the president said. 
"And beyond that, continue to reinforce that commitment by 
augmenting our power reserves -- because the people deserve 
nothing less. 
  "The full operation of the Enron plant will make the Subic 
Free Port self-sufficient in power and therefore more attractive 
to investors. 
  "We moved closer to our vision of transforming the Subic Bay 
Free Port into one of the major launching pads of our economic 
take-off with every company and facility getting established," 
the president said. 
  This is the second power project of Enron in the country. 
The first was the 105-MW power plant built for the Batangas 
Power Corp. in Pinamucan, Batangas. 
  Mr. Ramos noted that the United States-based Enron Corp., 
the 
parent firm of Enron Power Philippines, Corp., operates the 
longest pipeline in North America, and has constructed and is 
operating many power plants in four continents of the world. 
  The president said it is "heartening to know" that Enron has 
seen fit to strike a partnership with the Yuchengco Group, which 
he described as a "very stable, well respected group of Filipino 
companies." 
  "The Enron-Yuchengco partnership speaks well of Enron's 
commitment to a long-term presence in the Philippines and of the 
Yuchengco Group's willingness to venture into the promising area 
of power generation," he said. 
  Under the agreement signed by the National Power Corp. 
[Napocor] and Enron, the 116-MW plant, with a life span of 40 
years will be operated by Enron for 15 years after which it 
shall be turned over to Napocor without cost. 
  Present during the inauguration were Subic Bay Metropolitan 
Authority [SBMA] Chairman Richard Gordon, and his wife 
Catherine, Enron officials led by its president and Chief 
Operating Officer Kenneth Lay, SBMA personnel and volunteers, 
and other government officials.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Manuel Yan, chief government </F>
negotiator with the Moro National Liberation Front and 
concurrent presidential adviser on the peace process, by Frank 
Longid and Manny Mogato under the rubric "Face to Face"; place 
and date not given: "The Peace Process Is Moving Forward"] 
  [Text] How do you assess the current state of the 
peace process? 
  I believe the peace process is moving forward. Not 
spectacularly, but moving forward steadily, and we have to 
continue the efforts of he OPAPP (Office of the Presidential 
Adviser on the Peace Process) and try to see if we can still 
further accelerate the pace of the peace process. But it is 
doing quite satisfactorily, and it is a factor in the 
improvement of the peace and order situation. That's why the 
president is really keen on seeing to it the peace talks of all 
the three panels will be further enhanced. On our part, on the 
part of the panel dealing with the MNLF (Moro National 
Liberation Front), we will have our second mixed committee 
meeting in Zamboanga after holy week and then in the middle of 
the month of April we go to Jakarta for the second round of 
formal talks. 
  Exactly how will do you propose to accelerate the pace 
of the peace process? 
  On the part of the holding of the peace talks, we will 
depend 
on the chairmen of the other two panels also to try to dispose 
of the obstacles in the way of the holding of exploratory talks 
or resuming the ongoing negotiations insofar as the military 
rebels are concerned. 
  When you say the peace process is moving forward, this 
statement seems to apply only to the talks with the MNLF. 
  That is why as I said the president has appealed to the 
other 
chairmen to try to ride over the existing obstacles there are in 
the way of having formal negotiations or resuming the 
negotiations if they have been stalled. And that's the reason 
why he said we should not rely so much on legal technicalities. 
We have to do everything in order to move the talks. 
  There are now reportedly three communist rebel 
groups. 
  So far the panel of Ambassador (Howard) Dee is dealing with 
the main group headed by Joma (Jose Maria) Sison and Mr. (Luis) 
Jalandoni. Because Jalandoni has been recognized as their chief 
negotiator and spokesman. So that's why Ambassador Dee is doing 
his best. 
  Are there any concrete plans to start dealing with any 
of the rebel factions? 
  Maybe later on. Just like our panel: we are now having 
talks with the MNLF, but we are also committed to later on 
negotiate with the MILF. Because these are all elements of our 
society so we have to try to do our best to have talks with them 
and to have an agreement with them and come to terms with them. 
That's the only way we can have peace, really, because these 
are all elements of Philippine society, the Philippine community. 
  How long do you think the peace process will take? 
Oh... Another six years? 
  I don't know. We cannot really give a time cap on these 
negotiations. In our case, you know that the Tripoli Agreement 
was signed in 1976. So we are now still in the process of 
elucidating and clarifying the issues that remain to be 
discussed, for further or later discussion. 
  How will you deal with the apparent impatience of some 
groups, such as the RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa; 
Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] which has repeatedly rated 
the pace of the peace process as too slow. 
  All we can say is we would like to conclude these 
negotiations as soon as possible. But as I said it's very 
difficult to put an exact date. 
  On what does the success of the peace process depend 
on? 
  It will hinge first of all on the sincerity and 
determination 
of both panels in each of these areas to really move the talks 
forward. Secondly, it will depend also on the support given to 
the holding of these talks by all agencies of government, the 
bureaucracy. 
  And then in the final analysis, it will depend on all the 
support given to it by the people themselves -- by the NGOs 
[nongovernmental organizations], and the people in the different 
communities. 
  And that's why on our part, for instance, in the panel 
dealing with the MNLF, we want to have different meetings, in 
different places in Mindanao. That has the beneficial effect of 
acquainting the people in each of these areas with the ongoing 
peace process. 
  How can the people interact? 
  For instance, in making preparations for the holding of the 
talks in certain communities, we first contact the local 
officials, and then inform them of the site where the talks will 
be held. Later on, when the talks are going on, both panels, 
will have the opportunity to meet with people's organizations, 
the NGOs. For instance before, Congresswoman Lobregat in 
Zamboanga City had objected to our holding talks there. Now 
they have offered to host, and Congresswoman Lobregat is even 
offering her own place for the second meeting. 
  How will your new job as acting chief of the OPAPP 
affect the talks with the MNLF? 
  It will certainly help because first of all it enhances my 
own status in the eyes of the MNLF and also in the eyes of the 
Indonesian government. 
  We have already established a close rapport with Nur Misuari 
and I'm sure he will welcome this development and he will be 
happy to deal with us better. 
  What extra powers or authority come with the 
office? 
  The extra authority is, I have the authority now to 
supervise 
and coordinate the talks of the other panels. 
  Will it give you more power to offer concessions to the 
MNLF? 
  No. Whatever concessions I will offer will still have to 
depend on the president. Because he was the one who made that 
commitment that we are going to elevate the talks to a higher 
level in order to show his commitment to the peace process as a 
whole and to the success of our negotiations with the MNLF. 
  What is the ideal role of the presidential adviser on 
the peace process? 
  The ideal role? The role of the presidential adviser on the 
peace process covers a very wide scope, so it is difficult to 
put the pin on just one area. But in general we have to see to 
it that there will be a satisfactory progress in the area of 
negotiations with the three groups. 
  Secondly, we also have to look after the welfare and 
rehabilitation of those who will decide to surrender and come 
within the fold of the law. In our case, one of our primary 
objectives in the talks with the MNLF is to attain the objective 
of their return to Philippine society as members of the 
community. 
  Will there be any major policy changes with regard to 
the peace process? 
  I don't think there will be any major changes in policy. We 
will have to follow the same guidelines and policies that have 
been prescribed by the president to the defunct NUC (National 
Unification Commission) and the OPAPP since it was set up last 
year. 
  The negotiation panels have their own respective 
instructions 
from the president and I intend to sit down with the other two 
chairmen in order to get a more detailed briefing of the 
progress of their negotiations and how they come up to the 
compliance with instructions to the president. 
  On our part we have our own manual of instructions which 
have 
been approved by the president. 
  What innovations, new ideas will you introduce at 
OPAPP. 
  I still have to go to my of office. After I take my oath of 
office I'll go there and get a feeling of the set up there. 
  What is important is first of all to motivate the people in 
the OPAPP to discharge their duties not only properly but with 
the proper spirit. And the same goes for all the personnel 
involved in the peace process. 
  Later on I'll contact also the other agencies in the process 
like the convenors in the provinces and the representatives of 
the different sectors. 
  Won't your duties at OPAPP take up too much of your 
time which would in turn adversely affect the talks with the 
MNLF? 
  I don't think so because there is an existing office 
organization there, a secretariat, and as a matter of fact they 
have been working in that line of activity since a few years 
ago, since the time of Cory [President Corazon Aquino], that 
group was there. Then they were converted to NUC when President 
Ramos came in and now the OPAPP. But more or less the key 
people are there. 
  What are the remaining obstacles to the peace 
process? 
  Well they're not really obstacles. Maybe we really have to 
find out whether there are adequate funds and resources for the 
further advancement of the peace process. Now when I say 
further advancement we want the acceleration of the peace 
process because we want the peace process to be able to 
contribute meaningfully towards our economic takeoff especially 
in Mindanao. Mindanao is part of the East Asean Growth Polygon 
that President Ramos wants. So if we want the Growth Polygon to 
really become a working concept then we have to do our part in 
achieving that comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Mindanao. 
  And the other two elements, the other two negotiating 
panels, 
the same: whatever will enhance the peace and order and 
security situation in the Philippines will certainly help in 
further improving our economic image. 
  What will the additional funds be used for. 
  We need funds for the conduct of the talks, and funds for 
the 
rehabilitation of those who will apply for amnesty, funds for 
the conduct of consultations with the communities all over the 
country. 
  Is the budget for the peace process inadequate? 
  Well in our experience, the budget that we have requested is 
adequate but we would like to request for more prompt and speedy 
release of funds. 
  Rebel personalities often accuse government of 
insincerity. Exactly how will government convince them of its 
sincerity? 
  That is also a two-way proposition. As they say it takes two 
to tango. If one side perceives insincerity then of course the 
other side will have to make extra effort to prove that they are 
sincere in holding these talks. That is the key, precisely, to 
the success of the negotiations: the sincerity and 
determination of both sides to proceed with the talks in order 
to attain success. Because success will redound to the interest 
of both sides. 
  Does government have any new ideas on how convince, for 
example, Luis Jalandoni and Jose Maria Sison? 
  What I am sure of is Ambassador Dee and members of his panel 
are really very sincere and determined and keen on meeting with 
the NDF/CPP/NPA [National Democratic Front/Communist Party of 
the Philippines/New People's Army] panel. Only that there have 
been some extraneous issues introduced into the picture. For 
instance, they are supposed to have these exploratory talks. I 
see no reason why we cannot have that, it's just exploratory. 
But right now they are involved in discussion of issues, like 
the Constitution. 
  What about the RAM? 
  The RAM now is willing to go back to the negotiating table. 
They had been holding formal negotiations already but they are 
suspended because of some demands on the part of the RAM. But 
now I think they have become aware of their commitment also to 
participate in these peace talks, to move it forward. 
  How will government prevent them from withdrawing 
again? 
  Mayroon silang mga hiningi [They have], certain demands, so 
the panel is now studying how to meet some of these demands 
without sacrificing our integrity and our sovereignty and 
provided they are done within the framework of our laws. If it 
is within the scope of the law, I see no reason why the 
Philippine panel will not agree to it. 
  Can government continue to bend over backwards just to 
entice rebel groups to participate in peace negotiations? 
  On our side we are going on with our discussions, whatever 
agreements have been reached were all within the framework of 
our laws. So that's our principal guidance. 
  I know they are now studying the requests of the RAM to see 
how far they can meet the requests -- still within the framework. 
  What can we expect from the peace process. Will there 
be any concrete developments within the year? 
  Within the coming year we would expect a little more, some 
more developments. 
  Do you foresee formal talks with the NDF occurring 
within the next six months? 
  Well, formal talks in the case of the panels which are 
already in it and in the case of other panels, exploratory talks. 
  Will exploratory talks with the NDF begin within the 
next six months? 
  Yes, I think it's very probable that can be brought about.

  [Text] Resumption of the peace efforts with the National 
Democratic Front (NDF) remained uncertain as the leftist 
organization said it will not engage in talks with the 
government unless the latter removes the "obstructions" in the 
negotiations. 
  In a statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairman for 
international affairs, said the obstructions include the 
issuance of Executive Order No. (EO) 125 which sets the 
Philippine Constitution as the framework for the peace talks, 
the alleged coddling by the government of persons who broke away 
from the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines, 
the continued detention of political prisoners, and lately, the 
government's inaction on the plight of 10,000 victims of human 
rights violations seeking monetary claims on the Marcos estate. 
  Jalandoni also criticized President Ramos' "lack of 
sincerity 
in seeking serious peace talks" when the latter declared the 
impending collapse of the New People's Army during the 
graduation rites of the Philippine Military Academy. 
  "His predecessors, Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino, had made 
similar pronouncements. Now Mr. Ramos indulges in the same 
wishful thinking. The revolutionary movement is strong and 
fighting for the just cause of the people throughout the 
country," the NDF official said. 
  The organization blamed the government for the delay in the 
talks, saying, "It is the unilateral decisions of the Ramos 
regime in contravention of the Joint Declaration signed in The 
Hague on 1 September 1992 that have caused the delay in the 
talks between the NDF and the GRP Government of the Republic of 
the Philippines." 
  The joint declaration said the two sides would not set any 
condition for the talks. The NDF considers the issuance of EO 
125 as a condition set by the Philippine Government. 
  "The NDF stands by its commitment to seek a just, enduring, 
and liberating peace. But it will never agree to the GRP 
Constitution as the framework of the talks and it remains firm 
in calling for the removal of the obstructions placed by the 
Ramos regime," Jalandoni said.

  [Text] Zamboanga City -- The Abu Sayyaf has warned of more 
terrorist acts, including bombings, kidnappings, and attacks on 
police stations and detachments, if the military continues 
operations against it. 
  The warning was contained in a letter sent to the Southern 
Command by Ustadz Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, leader of the 
Sulu- based extremist group. 
  Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, chief of the Southern Command, 
earlier ordered Col. Ponciano Millena, 2d Marine Brigade chief, 
to disband the group at all costs. 
  The military reportedly planned an offensive against the Abu 
Sayyaf, now said to be holed up in the villages of Takes Jakil 
and Buhangiran in Patikul, Sulu. 
  The group was reported to have joined forces with the "lost 
command" group of Commander Redjulan. 
  Regional Police Director Roberto Lastimoso has placed all 
police personnel here on alert and ordered the setting up of 
checkpoints in the city's strategic entry points. 
  "We cannot be intimidated by the Abu Sayyaf," he said. 
  The group abandoned its main headquarters in Basilan last 
June and sought sanctuary in Patikul after the military launched 
an all-out operation after the kidnapping of Fr. Bernardo Blanco 
and six-year-old Luis Anthony Biel. 
  Blanco was able to escape, while Biel was later freed by his 
captors. 
  The Special Action Group of the Philippine National Police 
arrested on Friday a suspected member of the Abu Sayyaf along 
Governor Lim Avenue here. 
  Police identified him as Jalilul Amin, 31, of Jolo, Sulu. 
  Seized from Alalin's possession were a .357 Magnum revolver 
and a handheld radio.

  [Text] The military rebels are holding fast to their 
"dreams." "Our dreams shall never die," renegade Lt. Col. 
Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said when asked to comment on the two 
proclamations signed by President Ramos last Friday granting 
general but conditional amnesty to communists, separatist 
Muslims, and military coup plotters. 
  The "dream" consists of electoral reforms, reforms in the 
military, nationalist economic policies, social justice 
programs, and good government. "Not amnesty," said Honasan. 
  "It's a PR (public relations) program. The government knows 
the rebels will not go for it. Amnesty at this point will not 
solve the problem," he added. "Amnesty was never the issue. It 
is skirting the issue. It ignores the root causes (of 
rebellion). 
  "Giving amnesty shows a lack of understanding of the peace 
process. The substantial portion of the peace talks is only 
starting. Why is the government giving out its last card? It's 
a sign of desperation." 
  Honasan's position contrasts with that of the president who 
issued Proclamations 347 and 348 on general amnesty for all 
rebel groups because, he declared "The time for talking is over. 
The time to decide and act now has come." 
  The government peace panel is still in the process of 
devising a mechanism for the peace talks proper after the 
10-month tenure of the National Unification Commission (NUC) 
which held preliminary talks with the military rebels. 
  The NUC headed by Haydee Yorac held talks with the military 
insurgents from 1 September 1992 to 31 July 1993, at which time 
the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Revolutionary 
Nationalist Alliance], Soldiers of the Filipino People, and the 
Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) presented to the Yorac panel 
its dream package of reforms as their five talking points, and 
they have since stuck to it. 
  "What was the whole point of the P11 [Philippine pesos] 
million NUC exercise? It issued a five-inch thick report. What 
happened to that report?" Honasan demanded. 
  RAM sources claimed the NUC report which has not been made 
public recommended unconditional amnesty for the rightist 
rebels. It drew up its report to submit to Mr. Ramos after 
nationwide consultations with all sectors. 
  The president said the amnesty proclamations came after 
almost two years of consultations with various sectors. 
  "We will not apply for amnesty," Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan 
said 
on behalf of the leaders of the RAM-SFP-YOU. 
  To be granted amnesty, rebels have to apply with the newly 
formed National Amnesty Commission within six months of the 
proclamation's effectivity starting when Congress concurs. 
  The INQUIRER learned that while the leaders of the 
RAM-SFP-YOU reject the amnesty offer, they will "unofficially" 
encourage their rank-and-file to avail themselves of it. 
  Ex-Capt. Danny Lim, YOU chairman and spokesman of the 
RAM-SFP-YOU peace panel, said the government should seriously 
address "the fundamental issues" that have beleaguered the 
military. 
  "Amnesty is not even on the agenda," said Malajacan, member 
of the military rebels' peace negotiating panel. "We are not 
asking for it." 
  Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to all persons who in 
pursuit 
of political beliefs may have committed crimes punishable either 
by the Revised Penal Code or special laws. 
  These crimes include rebellion, inciting to rebellion and 
sedition, illegal assembly, resistance and disobedience to a 
person in authority, unlawful use of means of publication, and 
illegal possession of firearms. 
  Proclamation 348 grants amnesty to military and police 
personnel who may have committed acts punishable under the 
Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War, or special laws. 
  Not covered by the amnesty are crimes such as torture, 
arson, 
massacre, rape, and robbery. 
  Under both proclamations, an amnesty extinguishes any 
criminal liability for acts committed by the grantee. But an 
amnesty does not free him from any civil liability for injuries 
or damages inflicted on a victim. 
  The amnesty restores the grantee's civil or political 
rights. 
The National Amnesty Commission shall be composed of a chairman 
and three regular members to be named by the president; the 
secretaries of justice, defense, and interior and local 
government as ex-officio members. 
  The proclamation states that the surrender of firearms by 
the 
rebels is not a precondition for amnesty.

<F P=106> [By Jerry Esplanada] </F>
  [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] yesterday appealed 
to communist and military rebels to take advantage of the 
government offer of a general but conditional amnesty. 
  The leftist National Democratic Front and the rightist 
Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist 
Alliance] have rejected the amnesty proclamations signed by 
President Ramos last Friday. They said any such plan should be 
the result of peace talks between the government and the rebels. 
  But Press Secretary Jesus Sison said the amnesty 
proclamations were necessary because "we have to have peace," 
adding that the president has issued them "in good faith." 
  Leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front and other 
Muslim rebels have yet to issue their position on the amnesty 
program. 
  Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday acknowledged that some 
rebel leaders were likely to reject the president's amnesty 
offer but that their followers were ready to apply. 
  De Venecia also said there would be another amnesty 
proclamation after the conclusion of the peace talks between the 
government and the various rebel groups. 
  At least 25,000 rebels are expected to apply for amnesty, he 
said, adding that the Ramos proclamations are sure to pass the 
House of Representatives. 
  "The realpolitik of the amnesty is that there is a 
wide-scale 
acceptance from the lower and middle echelons because they are 
the ones fighting the war, they are the ones dying, famished, 
and unable to see their families," he told a news conference. 
  "The other leaders who are more adversarial to the amnesty 
can wait until the completion of the peace talks, but they 
should not prevent their comrades from availing themselves of 
the amnesty now," he added. 
  Sison said Mr. Ramos, in issuing Proclamations 347 and 348, 
"reached out to unify the divided forces of the nation." 
  "The next step is up to the rebels to take advantage of them 
amnesty proclamations," he said. 
  Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to all persons who in 
pursuit 
of political beliefs may have committed crimes punishable either 
by the Revised Penal Code or special laws. 
  It applies to all rebels, but it requires them to apply 
first. 
  Proclamation 348 grants amnesty to military and police 
personnel who may have committed acts punishable under the 
Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War or special laws. 
  Leftist groups rejected the amnesty program, saying it did 
not result from peace talks. 
  Renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said amnesty was 
not the answer to the problems that gave rise to military 
rebellion. 
  Rightist rebels are more interested in pursuing their call 
for electoral reforms, reforms in the military, social justice 
programs, and good government, "not amnesty," he said. 
  Mr. Ramos, in issuing the two proclamations, said "the time 
for talking is over" and "the time to decide and act has come." 
  "These grants of amnesty are only part of the actions 
contemplated by the government in its unrelenting quest for a 
just and enduring peace for our country and people," he said. 
  "This does not preclude and is without prejudice to any 
legal 
arrangement that may result from a negotiated settlement which 
the government is still pursuing with the various rebel groups 
which I am hopeful will materialize soon," Mr. Ramos added. 
  But rebel leaders and other sectors cited several 
objectionable features of the two proclamations. 
  -- The amnesty program is placed ahead of social reforms 
"which should be the government's primary concern." 
  -- It does not guarantee that the rebels will be granted 
amnesty because their application can be opposed by anyone. It 
is at best a long, tedious process. 
  -- It does not cover common crimes which most of the 
political prisoners are charged with or convicted of. 
  -- The amnesty plan for soldiers and police allows human 
rights violators among them to be freed from liability as long 
as their offenses were committed in the course of the 
anti-insurgency campaign . 
  Under both proclamations, an amnesty extinguishes any 
criminal liability for acts committed by the grantee. But it 
does not free him from any civil liability or damages inflicted 
on a victim. 
  The amnesty also does not cover crimes such as torture, 
arson, massacre, rape, and robbery. 
  Rebels may apply with the newly formed National Amnesty 
Commission within six months after Congress concurs. 
  The Senate and the House of Representatives are on a 
two-week 
Lenten recess since last Thursday. Congress resumes sessions on 
11 April. 
  De Venecia dismissed speculations that the proclamations 
might face rejection in Congress. 
  "Amnesty is a popular issue, why should we reject a program 
wanted by tens of thousands of people who are asking for peace?" 
he said.

<F P=106> [By Marichu Villanueva] </F>
  [Text] Senator Rodolfo Biazon yesterday brushed aside 
objections to the second round of amnesty proclamations 
President Ramos issued last week especially the possible 
coverage of the convicted killers of U.S. Col. James Rowe and 
those of the late Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. 
  Biazon pointed out that the two suspected communist hitmen, 
Juanito Itaas and Donato Continente, who were convicted of the 
Rowe assassination, and the 28 soldiers serving life terms for 
the Aquino-Galman double murder can not be covered by the two 
latest presidential amnesty proclamations. Biazon made his 
statement yesterday before he joined President Ramos in the 
state visit to Vietnam. 
  Biazon, chairman of the Senate committee on peace, 
unification, and reconciliation, classified the convicted Rowe 
killers and the Aquino assassins as criminals charged with 
"common" crimes or crimes committed not in furtherance of their 
political beliefs. 
  "For the common criminals, such as the convicted killers of 
Aquino and Galman and the convicted killers of Col. James Rowe, 
the president may consider granting them Executive pardon which 
does not require a concurrence of Congress for it is a private 
act of the president," Biazon clarified. 
  Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the grant of amnesty 
by the president is subject to concurrence of both chambers of 
Congress. 
  The Congress had earlier concurred with Presidential 
Proclamations 10 and 10-A that Mr. Ramos issued granting amnesty 
to all rebels who applied for it on or before 31 December 1992. 
  Biazon started Saturday his committee's public hearings on 
Presidential Proclamations 347 and 348 that Mr. Ramos issued 
last week which sought to grant amnesty to all rebels charged 
with common crimes in pursuit of their political beliefs and 
agents of state charged with human rights violation in relation 
to their counter- insurgency operations, respectively. 
  However, the latest round of amnesty grant's was not 
welcomed 
by leaders of communist insurgents as well as by military rebels 
who said they preferred an amnesty grant as a result of their 
peace negotiations with the government. In the case of Rowe's 
killers, the U.S. government is against their coverage of the 
amnesty grant. 
  "The objections of the rebel leaders to the amnesty are 
irrelevant because they have no right to decide for those who 
are already out of their control and influence because they have 
already returned to the folds of the law," Biazon pointed out. 
  Biazon disclosed that about 4,000 of these rebels from both 
the left and the right have come down from the hills but were 
forced to return to the underground because they were being 
charged with common crimes by relatives of their victims. 
  These rebels, he said, failed to avail themselves of the 
first round of amnesty grants which expired 31 December 1992. 
  Thus, he explained, Presidential Proclamation 347 aims to 
grant amnesty only to rebel returnees who have already come out 
and opted to lead a peaceful life but are not covered by 
Proclamations 10 and 10-A.

  [Text] Malaysia and Thailand have agreed to change the 
orientation of the General Border Commission (GBC) in the era 
following the end of the communist threat. 
  The two countries will make the GBC a commission that 
emphasizes social and economic development for the sake of 
finding a way to resolve the various security problems faced by 
residents of the border area. 
  Malaysian Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Mohd. Najib Tun 
Razak, who attended the 38th GBC Conference in Bangkok on 7 
February, told UTUSAN that the main issue to be reviewed is the 
future role of the GBC. 
  One of the subjects discussed was the threat of Islamic 
separatist groups, such as the Pattani United Liberation 
Organization (PULO) and the Pattani Malay National Front (BRN). 
  Najib said that in the high-level talks between the armed 
forces commanders of the two countries, Malaysia stressed that 
the problems faced by Thailand are internal ones. 
  "We also stated that we will not help, support, or protect 
Islamic separatist groups. If we find Islamic separatist groups 
in Malaysian territory, we will take action, such as arresting 
them under Malaysian laws. 
  "This matter is rather complex, however, because of the 
existence of family ties among the border residents of the two 
countries. 
  "Free movement in and out of each country's territory can 
make the problem more difficult," Najib explained. 
  He feels that the problem is one of perception, because some 
Thai military leaders suspect that the Malaysian Government is 
doing something secretly to help the Islamic separatist groups. 
  "I wish to state that we have never had any secret or 
clandestine contacts that could be interpreted as helping those 
groups. 
<H5>  Military Action </H5>
  "It is our viewpoint that the way out of the problem is to 
seek resolution through talks. This problem absolutely cannot be 
ended by military action. 
  "The only way to resolve the problem is to include and 
involve all parties in the socioeconomic development process," 
he said. 
  Najib said that if Muslims in southern Thailand want a 
better 
future, they must seek a way to have talks with the Thai 
Government. 
  This will enable them to get more benefit from the 
development process and to find a way that will permit them to 
have a more effective part. 
  He said terrorist activity is no longer an approach that can 
help determine the future. 
  These subjects are among the main agenda items to be 
discussed by the two countries throughout this year, and he 
hopes that prior to the 39th GBC Conference next year Malaysia 
and Thailand can find points of agreement to serve as future 
guidelines for the GBC. 
  With regard to the comment by General Kitti Rattanachaya, 
chief of the Fourth Army Division, that there are Islamic 
separatist bases in Kelantan and Perak, Najib said such bases do 
not exist. 
  "It is clear that Malaysia does not give protection to those 
groups. 
  "If we find that they have fled into Malaysian territory, 
however, and if we can track them down, we will take action 
according to Malaysian law."

  [Excerpts] All five persons charged with violating the 
Official Secrets Act were today found guilty of all the charges 
brought against them. They are fined between [Singapore dollar] 
$1,500 and $2,000 on each of the charges (?brought) against 
them. [passage omitted on names of defendants] 
  In passing judgment, Senior District Judge Mr. Richard 
Magnus 
said the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the 
charges brought against them while the defense had not rebutted 
beyond reasonable doubt those charges. The offenses arose as a 
result of a BUSINESS TIMES article in June 1992, which carried a 
flash estimate for the second-quarter economic growth that year. 
  In making the mitigation plea, lawyers for the accused 
persons urged the court to impose only a fine and not a 
custodial sentence. Replying, the attorney general, Mr. Chan Sek 
Keong, noted that all the five accused persons had distinguished 
careers. He said he would not go so far as to say that a 
custodial sentence is a correct sentence.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 1 March PASASON: "A New Milestone in </F>
Lao-Malaysian Relations"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly [NA] of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Tan Sri Datuk Mohamed 
Zahir bin Haji Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives 
of Malaysia [HRM], led a high-level HRM delegation to pay an 
official friendship visit to the LPDR from 27 to 31 March 1994. 
  During their visit to the LPDR, the speaker of the HRM and 
the delegation paid courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime 
minister of the LPDR. The delegation laid a wreath at the 
monument of unknown combatants and visited a number of economic 
and cultural establishments in Vientiane Municipality and Xieng 
Khouang Province. 
  An official meeting between the LPDR NA delegation and the 
HRM delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall to 
exchange views and discuss the situation with each other under 
an atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. 
At the meeting, the two sides informed each other of certain 
prominent developments in their respective countries and 
exchanged a common direction for strengthening the relations and 
cooperation between the legislative organizations of Laos and 
Malaysia for their common and unilateral interests in the 
immediate and long-term future. 
  The two sides were proud of the development of the fine 
relations and cooperation and multifaceted mutual assistance 
between Laos and Malaysia and were unanimous to continue 
multiplying and enhancing the said relations and cooperation on 
the basis of the five-point principle of peaceful coexistence. 
They regarded the agreement on economic, scientific, and 
technical cooperation, the agreement on air transportation, and 
the agreement on the promotion and protection of investment 
signed between the Governments of Laos and Malaysia in early 
December 1992 as a symbol of utmost significance in the 
Lao-Malaysian cooperation in the new period. The two sides 
unanimously agreed to exchange visits by delegations at various 
levels to draw lessons from one another and to organize 
technical training programs and study tours beneficial to both 
sides. Regarding international relations, the two sides 
unanimously agreed to further promote an atmosphere of peace, 
friendship, and cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world. 
  The success of the visit to the LPDR by the speaker of the 
HRM and the delegation constitutes a new glorious milestone in 
the relations between the legislative institutions of Laos and 
Malaysia and, at the same time, an important contribution to the 
building of peace, stability as well as relations and 
cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world. The multiethnic 
Lao people wholeheartedly hail this event of great significance 
to Lao-Malaysian relations and pledge to do to the best of our 
abilities to contribute to making the exisiting relations of 
friendship and good cooperation between the two countries and 
peoples of Laos and Malaysia more fruitful so as to bring 
benefits to our two peoples.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 31 (KPL) -- The sub-committees for 
cooperation in border security of Laos and Thailand yesterday 
morning held their first annual meeting in the Thai province of 
Nong Khai. 
  The meeting was chaired by Lt. Gen. Phisan Suprawat, vice 
president of the Thai-Lao Sub-Committee for Cooperation in 
Border Security. The head of the Lao side to this meeting was 
Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit, president of the Lao-Thai 
Sub-Committee for Cooperation in Border Security. 
  The meeting ended with the signing of its minutes. The head 
of the Lao side informed Lao and Thai mass media that this type 
of meeting scheduled every three months, was to discuss the 
cooperation in keeping security along the common border of the 
countries and other issues concerning the sub-committees. He 
said the sides were unanimous on the assessment of the situation 
along the common border of the two countries and that the Lao 
and Thai people have a good mutual understanding about the 
loophole (?leading to) goods smuggling and illegal activities by 
bad elements affecting security and order along the common 
border of the two countries. 
  He also said that the sides agreed to increase their 
cooperation in preventing such activities and that they would 
continue to educate the people living along the common border to 
be more cooperative with the local authorities in order to make 
the common border one of genuine peace and friendship. 
  The head of the Thai delegation also told the media that 
this 
meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual understanding. He 
said each side raised border issues for discussion at the 
meeting, particularly the illegal immigration that the sides 
would further consider its solution to ensure more security and 
order along the common border. He also said that the Thai Army 
would increase its assistance to Laos in technical training of 
the Lao military and also in study tours for the Lao military, 
and provide a number of medical equipment for Hospital 103 of 
the Lao People's Army.

  [Text] Thai Ambassador to Rangoon Mr Wirasak Futrakun said 
its time to Salween River was turned from the river of conflict 
into the river of cooperation which would provide both Thailand 
and Burma with mutual benefits. 
  Mr Wirasak said Thailand and Burma have been haunted by the 
"legacy of distrust" for a long time and that needed to be 
changed. 
  At present, Thailand and Burma are in the process of 
creating 
mutual trust the ambassador said. "We are trying to help Burma 
break political isolation by inviting them to be a guest country 
at the ASEAN meeting in June. And at the same time we 
facilitate the attempt of Burma to talk with the minority groups 
and stop the fighting." 
  "Thailand maintains a non-intervention policy. However, we 
hope that Burma and the minority groups will eventually reach a 
peaceful settlement. The border between Thailand and Burma 
should be the border of cooperation and not the border of 
conflict. The fighting between Burma and the minority groups 
along the border also adversely affects our country and our 
people." 
  The envoy said only when Burma settles the problem with the 
minority groups will that country will be able to start 
focussing on development. "The situation has somewhat inched 
towards peace as Burma has developed a more flexible stance when 
dealing with the minorities," he added. 
  The diplomat said Burma has tried to improve its image and 
that will take some time before it finds acceptance. "When I 
first arrived in Burma, it was under martial law. Curfew was 
imposed. Now there is more freedom. A number of political 
prisoners were released and Burma has somewhat decentralised its 
power." 
  "It has also drafted a new constitution which will have the 
presidency system. However, the military will continue to play 
an important role in that country. It's just like Indonesia. 
If we can accept Indonesia, why don't we accept Burma?" 
  He said he has eyed Burma with an Asian point of view. "I 
admit that I had in the past looked at Burma from the 
westernised viewpoint and I had misunderstood that I know the 
neighbouring country well. In fact, I came to realise that I 
knew very little about Burma which has a different political 
culture. Let's look at our neighbour from the Asian point of 
view, like people in the same region should think of." 
  Burma should be allowed to find its own political solutions, 
he said. 
  Thailand has initiated a number of projects to help Burma in 
the areas of public health in the rural areas, he said. 
  Apart from Thailand, many countries have approached Burma 
for 
its rich natural resources.

  [Text] The special joint meeting of the National Assembly 
for 1994 began deliberating the draft constitutional amendments 
at 0940 today. National Assembly President Marut Bunnak chaired 
the session. After various matters were acknowledged, Praman 
Adireksan, the opposition leader in the House, proposed that the 
agenda be changed by advancing the ninth item on the agenda to 
the beginning. The ninth item dealt with the draft 
constitutional amendments of the combined opposition parties. 
Originally, the first item on the agenda was the draft 
constitutional amendments of the government parties. The 
government parties' draft calls for amending eight points in the 
Constitution, while the opposition's motion involves amending 25 
points. The government parties opposed the change in the agenda 
order, but the change was approved by a vote of 342 to 199. 
  Extensive debate by Assembly members continued without a 
break. In the afternoon, the prime minister, sitting among the 
Democrat Party's seats, stood to counter the allegation by 
certain senators about the government's violent and excessive 
suppression of the people. The prime minister said the 
government does not have a policy of resorting to violence and 
administers the country according to law. It intends to 
preserve democracy and prevent disunity. Regarding the alleged 
suppression, the prime minister said the officials on duty were 
working under extreme pressure and had to protect themselves. 
  The debates continued until 1800, when the session was 
adjourned by a vote of 351 to 176. A procedural roll call was 
then taken on the first reading on whether or not to accept the 
amendment proposals in principle. The voting ended at 1920 with 
a count of 369, with 194 abstentions, to accept the draft 
constitutional amendment of the opposition parties. The session 
ended at 1930. 
  The National Assembly totals 625 members -- 360 members of 
parliament and 265 senators. 
  The session will reconvene at 1000 tomorrow to consider the 
government parties' draft constitutional amendments.

  [Text] The Senate and opposition rammed a new draft charter 
through its first reading in Parliament yesterday and threatened 
to kill government-backed constitutional amendment bills today, 
plunging the administration into its worst political crisis. 
  All senior government officials and military leaders in the 
Senate, including Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak and Army 
Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit, gave solid support to the 
opposition's controversial draft, criticized by government MPs 
as plagued with errors and "dictatorial" clauses. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai tried to play down the 
government's embarrassing failure, but calls mounted even 
within, his coalition for a House dissolution to stop what was 
described as a dangerous Senate-opposition conspiracy to bring 
back the "NPKC [National Peacekeeping Council] shadow". 
  Many government MPs, academics and political action groups 
called the development a "silent coup" by remnants of the 
National Peacekeeping Council, which seized power in 1991. A 
bloody pro-democracy uprising the following year disintegrated 
the junta. 
  The present Senate was appointed by the NPKC and has 
strongly 
opposed the Chuan government's attempts to whittle it down in 
size and reduce senators' powers. 
  The opposition, which took a promilitary stand prior to the 
1992 upheaval, proposes maintaining the status quo while 
slightly increasing the size of the upper House. 
  Prime Minister Chuan said he did not expect any major 
political change. "I have said all along that changing the 
Constitution is not the government's duty. It's Parliament's," 
Chuan said. "The government has only 193 votes, which are not 
enough (to unilaterally pass government-sponsored amendments)." 
  The joint sitting of Parliament voted 369 in favour of 
passing the first reading of the opposition's draft bill, 
against 194 abstentions -- mainly government MPs with a few 
senators. 
  The meeting then was adjourned, with threats to shoot down 
the government's eight amending bills today. 
  Chuan said he would not take action against Defence Minister 
Wichit who supported the opposition's draft. "I have told 
non-MP government officials that changing the charter is not an 
administrative matter and they were free to use their 
judgement," he said. 
  But other government MPs talked about a House dissolution, 
which some of them believed was imminent. 
  "I don't know what is going to happen next," government 
spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa told reporters. "This is a bad 
situation." 
  Ominous signs for the government came as soon as Parliament 
began an extra-ordinary session to deliberate charter reform 
yesterday morning. The Senate-opposition alliance outvoted 
government MPs, moving the opposition draft charter to the top 
of the agenda and sidelining the administration-sponsored 
amendment bills. 
  A tumultuous debate ensued. Government lawmakers outlined 
one "flaw" after another in the opposition's proposed charter 
and attacked Parliament President Marut Bunnak for violating 
parliamentary rules by not giving Parliament enough time to 
study the Senators and opposition MPs responded by accusing the 
government of jumping the gun by assuming that the Senate was 
not wanted by the public. 
  After the opposition's draft sailed through its first 
reading, Parliament set up a special panel of 45 members to vet 
the bill over the next month. Government representatives are 
outnumbered by opposition MPs and senators on the panel. 
  Parliament adjourned until 10 am today, when it will 
consider 
the government bills. 
  The Phalang Tham Party reemphasized its belief that Chuan 
should dissolve Parliament if charter reform proposals become 
deadlocked. But sources who attended the party's meeting 
yesterday said members were of an opinion that Chuan would be 
unable to justify a House dissolution and should instead resign. 
  "We are proud of the Senate," said Chat Phatthana leader 
Chatchai Chunhawan. "I think the Senate voted for us because we 
are sincere with the people." 
  Ratsadon leader Chaiphak Siriwat said the 
bureaucrat-dominated Senate's move meant the Chuan government 
had lost control of the bureaucracy and should resign. 
  Solidarity MP Khanin Bunsuwan, a government whip, said the 
opposition, in its "blind attempt" to topple the coalition, had 
been "used" by the anti-reform Senate. 
  Senator Somphop Hotrakit warned the government to withdraw 
the eight bills from Parliament or they would be rejected by 
senators today. 
  "We, senators, aren't slaves. We have warned the government 
not to trample on others' dignity," Somphop said. 
  "The military obviously wants its power back," said Phalang 
Tham spokesman Sutham Saengprathum. "The goverment will have to 
do something. But only the prime minister can say where the way 
out is. My duty is only to apply to run in an election." 
  Solidarity leader Uthai Phimchaichon said though the 
government had lost face, it was the opposition which would 
later suffer a major political backlash. "The ones who cheat 
will lose," he said. 
  Opposition leader Praman Adireksan was buoyed and adamant. 
"You I asked me whether the opposition's draft fulfills the 
wishes of the people. My answer is you must understand that 
this Parliament represents the people. Everything passed by 
this Parliament has passed a democratic process," Praman said. 
  Nine pro-democracy groups deplored yesterday's development 
and vowed to campaign to publicize the "bad points" of the 
opposition draft. Some of the movement's leaders suggested 
Chuan dissolve Parliament but others wanted the charter reform 
process to be completed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Government Lost the First Round"] </F>
  [Text] The 31 March special session of the National 
Assembly, called to amend the Constitution, will probably go 
down in the history of the Thai parliament as the first time the 
government was defeated by the opposition from the very first 
issue on the agenda. That is, the opposition proposed an urgent 
motion to advance its draft amendments covering the entire 
Constitution to the top of the National Assembly agenda. The 
opposition and government had previously proposed drafts that 
would amend only eight and 25 items in the Constitution. 
  A heated debate preceded the vote on whether the 
opposition's 
draft should be moved to the top of the agenda. The government 
cited procedural regulations in its argument, while the 
opposition cited tradition and previous decisions by the 
parliament president. The reasons cited by both sides seemed 
acceptable, so the parliament president called a vote, which the 
opposition won overwhelmingly thanks to support from nearly the 
entire Senate block. The government could only muster the votes 
of the coalition parties. 
  Certain people believe the government's defeat in the first 
round was caused by poor intelligence, a problem the prime 
minister has often complained about. The government was 
clueless about the opposition trick that occupied the government 
with whether the draft should cover eight or 25 points. The 
government decided only a couple of days before the scheduled 
parliament session to agree to the 25 points proposed by the 
opposition, hoping to win popularity among the people. Less 
than 24 hours before the session, however, the opposition sprang 
a surprise by proposing the amendment of the entire 
Constitution, using the 1978 Constitution as a basis and 
including some of its 25 points. The government could not 
adjust in time and was defeated in the first round. 
  Judging from the debate, one major issue the opposition did 
not touch was the status of senators. It even opened the door 
to increasing the number of senators in proportion with the size 
of the lower house. The Senate's power would also increase, 
making it more than just a rubber stamp. This resulted in the 
opposition receiving overwhelming support for its draft from the 
senators. The opposition's draft also removed the ban against 
politicians or bureaucrats becoming parliamentarians if they are 
judged to have engaged in corruption or amassed abnormal wealth. 
  The point we wish to emphasize to politicians -- government 
and opposition alike -- is that the amendment of the 
Constitution should not be an issue they must try to win at all 
costs or turn into a political game. They should consider what 
people throughout the country will gain from the amended 
Constitution.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Senate Revolt Is a Lesson for the Chuan </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] The opposition parties scored a political victory 
over the Chuan government yesterday by joining hands with the 
Senate to ram through a controversial charter draft which they 
claimed was aimed at national unity. It plunged the fragile 
coalition into its most serious political crisis. 
  Members of the coalition were evidently embarrassed when 
senators and the opposition collaborated to defeat the 
government on a procedural vote over which amendments to take 
first. They eventually voted together to get the opposition's 
bill adopted by the Parliament in its first reading. Two days 
before the extraordinary session was due to begin, the 
opposition tore up a gentleman's agreement made on Feb 15 -- 
that eight of the 25 proposed amendments would be introduced 
first, and after they had been passed, the others would be 
considered. 
  What happened yesterday was indeed an eye-opener. That the 
opposition is serious about national unity is certainly a joke. 
Promoting democracy is definitely the last thing on their mind 
and wanting to give a facelift to the Constitution so that it 
incorporates the aspirations, rights and liberties of all Thais 
was, and never has been, on their agenda. The many technical 
flaws which are obvious in the hastily drawn-up charter draft 
only dilutes the opposition leaders' claim that it was a serious 
piece of legislation. 
  Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan, who is also the 
opposition 
leader, said the opposition was not bargaining for anything in 
introducing to Parliament a new charter draft. The opposition 
has carefully studied the changes for the people's interests, so 
he claimed. 
  We have to take this with a pinch of salt. 
  The opposition has chosen the 1978 Constitution as a model 
for a new charter because it would benefit senators, bureaucrats 
and political parties. Ordinary citizens come last. 
  The 1978 Constitution sets the size of the Senate at three- 
quarters that of the Lower House, which means that the number of 
senators would remain at 270 and not be reduced to 120, as had 
been agreed upon by the government and opposition on Feb 15. It 
allows senators to submit interpellations to Cabinet members and 
allows a nonelected official to become prime minister. 
  The opposition in fact baited the Senate to garner its 
support and it comes as no surprise why the Upper House fell 
hook, line and sinker for it. Without doubt, the interests of 
senators, many of whom are military men and senior bureaucrats 
whose vocabularies do not include the word democracy, would be 
protected. 
  On Tuesday, the opposition announced it wanted to do away 
with the-present Constitution because it was a legacy of the 
National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC) which staged the February 
1991 coup. The irony of ironies is that yesterday they had no 
qualms about joining hands with the Senate which was appointed 
by the military junta in early 1992. Rather embarrassing to our 
fledgling democracy, which was won on Rachadamnoen Avenue in May 
1992, has been the Senate which has been described as an 
unwanted legacy of the NPKC. 
  They have, all this while, withstood any attempts to revamp 
their selection methods, curb their powers and reduce their 
numbers. 
  As the saying goes: Birds of a feather flock together. That 
the "satanic" character of the opposition should again rear its 
ugly head is indeed no surprise. 
  In 1992, some of them were clearly in the NPKC camp and, 
prior to the shootings of prodemocracy demonstrators on 
Rachadamnoen Avenue, were backing then prime minister Suchinda 
Kraprayun to the hilt. The fact that all the key military 
leaders, including Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak and Army 
Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit, voted for the 
opposition's draft yesterday should have a far-reaching impact. 
But it is too early to draw a conclusion that they are 
deserting the coalition in favour of the opposition. 
  Technically speaking, with only 193 votes in Parliament, the 
government is really in for a hard time, especially when it can 
no longer count on the Senate for support. However, it has to 
be remembered that this is the government for which blood was 
shed in May 1992. In the September 1992 elections it was voted 
into power on a mandate of popular support. 
  The Senate's revolt yesterday should serve as a rude 
awakening for the Chuan government. Its initial vacillating 
over the amending of the charter has disappointed many people 
and paved the way for the opposition's offensive. The coalition 
has to take equal blame for what happened yesterday. 
  It is obvious that the opposition's ultimate aim is to force 
Chuan to dissolve the House with the hope that it can return 
with more seats in a snap election. Of course, it would be 
foolish to believe that a new election will bring in a new 
generation of MPs with an "angelic quality". The sure bet is 
that most, if not all, of the politicians associated with money 
politics will be able to buy their way right back into 
Parliament. 
  Our hope is that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and his 
government learn a lesson from this latest political episode. 
It is still not too late for him and his coalition members to 
leave behind political bickerings to seriously set their sights 
on tackling issues besetting the nation. Only through serious 
work can the coalition hope to regain the public's faith which 
is fast dwindling. What can save the Chuan government now is 
not how it can outsmart the opposition, but how it can win over 
the hearts of the people.

  [Text] Commenting on the Bank of Thailand's policy of 
encouraging Thai commercial banks to increase baht loans to the 
Indochinese countries, Banthun Lamsam, managing director of the 
Thai Farmers Bank, said his bank's Vientiane branch office has 
been unable to release many loans to local entrepreneurs because 
Lao law does not facilitate such bank operations. Meanwhile, 
Cambodia does not have any law to protect bank credits. 
Therefore, operations in that country are rather risky. 
  Banthun noted that current measures applied by the 
government 
to control the amount of loans are incompatible with the free 
trade market system. In other words, the measures are 
impractical because the demand for bank loans in Thailand is 
still high. 
  Banthun said: "In implementing the state bank's policy of 
increasing the baht's role in this region, the open market 
mechanism -- that is, interest rates -- must be allowed to 
control the demand for bank loans completely." 
  He indicated that the amount of trade among countries in the 
region will determine the expansion of the baht's role. The 
baht is, however, widely used as a medium of exchange in Laos. 
The Thai Farmers Bank will continue to make loans in 
neighboring countries provided it does not have to assume too 
much risk. 
  The managing director of the Thai Farmers Bank said the 
countries in which the baht is well recognized are Laos, Burma, 
and southern China, because they are engaging in the quadrangle 
economic development scheme. But the baht's access to Cambodia 
is hindered by the lack of legal support in that country. 
  Banthun said: "The baht has bright prospects in the 
quadrangle economic zone. It will be used as a common medium of 
trade by all parties participating in the development scheme.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet recently held a working 
session with specialists from Australia's (PTI-Service) 
Consultancy Group to exchange views on tasks that must be 
completed to ensure the 500-kv north-south powerline is 
completed on schedule. 
  According to the group's report to the prime minister, the 
general objectives and project timetable are as follows: 
  -- Construction and installation of the transmission system, 
power transformer network, and national control center will be 
basically completed by late March or early April 1994. 
  -- Testing of all power transformer stations will be 
completed on 25 April. 
  -- Combined testing will be completed by mid-May, allowing 
the transmission of 500 kv of electricity from Hoa Binh to Phu 
Lam to begin. 
  (PTI-Service) specialists are now working at all power 
transmission and power transformer stations to carry out project 
quality control. According to the latest inspection results, all 
project quality control requirements have been met. The prime 
minister reminded the specialists of the need to work out 
positive measures to guarantee the best results in terms of 
project quality and technical safety, in both the short and long 
term. 
  The specialists suggested that steps be taken in the days 
ahead to ensure close coordination among the group's 
specialists, the technical cadres of the 500-kv powerline 
project, the technical cadres of the Post and Telegraph General 
Department, and specialists of the [words indistinct] Company. 
In this way, difficult problems with communications and signals 
along the project can be tackled in a timely manner. 
  The prime minister also reminded the Ministry of Energy of 
the need to make sure the specialists and units in charge of the 
500-kv powerline project place top priority on project quality 
and technical safety. At the same time, it is necessary to make 
every effort to complete the remaining work to ensure that the 
overall project can be commissioned at an early date.

  [Text] Hanoi, April 1 (AFP) -- Vietnam has announced tax 
incentives as part of its campaign to encourage overseas 
Vietnamese to return and set up businesses here, a report said 
Friday. 
  Profit taxes for businesses owned by overseas Vietnamese, 
known as Viet Kieu, will be cut by 20 percent from April 16, the 
Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing a circular from the State 
Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI). 
  Investment projects that already have a 10 percent reduction 
from the SCCI will not benefit from the tax incentive for 
overseas Vietnamese until after the period the "priority 
project" expires, the circular said. 
  Vietnam has been trying to follow China's success in winning 
investment from its overseas community but the results have been 
mixed so far despite the government's encouragement. 
  More than one million Vietnamese living in the United States 
are now free to invest here following the lifting of the US 
trade embargo in February but of those who have returned, most 
have come as business consultants rather than investors. 
  While overseas Chinese have often been resident abroad for 
generations, most Viet Kieu left here after the reunification of 
the country in 1975 and have not had the time to build up enough 
capital for investment projects here. 
  Political problems also persist on both sides, as many 
returning overseas Vietnamese are treated with suspicion by the 
authorities here and face opposition to their return from 
anti-communist Viet Kieu communities.

  [Text] The government held its regular meeting in Hanoi 
from 30-31 March to assess its performance during the first 
quarter of 1994; to discuss its work schedule for the second 
quarter; to evaluate the initial results of the implementation 
of directives on the movement for thrift and against 
extravagance, corruption, and smuggling; and to review a number 
of draft laws and regulations. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
presided over the meeting. 
  On behalf of the prime minister, Minister and Director of 
the 
Government Office Le Xuan Trinh presented a report on the 
results of the government's activities during the first quarter 
of 1994 and on a number of top priority tasks for the second 
quarter of the year. Interior Minister Bui Thien Ngo briefed the 
participants on the situation concerning corruption and on the 
results of the anticorruption campaign. Finance Minister Ho Te 
presented a report on the movement for thrift. Trade Minister 
Le Van Triet briefed the participants on the situation 
concerning smuggling and antismuggling activities. 
  The participants unanimously concurred that during the first 
quarter of 1994, in overseeing and managing state affairs, the 
government focused its efforts on key tasks and scored many 
results. Prompt efforts were made to grasp the opportunities 
offered by the outside world. Continued progress was made when 
it comes to balancing the state budget, mobilizing capital, and 
making payments. There was no indications of unexpected price 
increases. The industrial production continued to expand at a 
rate of more than 10 percent. Generally speaking, the 
socioeconomic development continued to bring about positive and 
steady results. In the meantime, efforts were made to improve 
the quality of cultural, social welfare, information, public 
health, and educational services. All those achievements have 
created a new momentum for the movement against social vices. 
Vigorous efforts were also made to step up diplomatic and 
external economic relations as well as firmly maintain political 
stability and public security and order. 
  Prompted by a high sense of responsibility toward the people 
and the implementation of the National Assembly's resolutions, 
members of the government seriously examined the shortcomings 
and weaknesses they displayed in handling national affairs, 
especially in overseeing and directing the implementation of 
resolutions and directives of the National Assembly and the 
government. 
  The ministers analyzed difficult problems in many fields, 
including the generation of capital for production promotion, 
reception of foreign investment capital, financial management, 
handling of budget overspending, and so forth. On pre-Tet and 
Lunar New Year's Days, positive steps were taken to deal with 
corruption, smuggling, and extravagance as well as encourage 
everyone to practice thrift. Nonetheless, only limited results 
were recorded. Extravagance remained rampant. Social vices 
continued to develop to a serious degree in some areas. Slow 
efforts were made to improve the administrative apparatus and 
administrative procedures. 
  The government devoted much time to discussing and deciding 
on top priority issues to be resolved in the second quarter of 
1994. For example, it is necessary for ministries, sectors, and 
localities to seriously implement the prime minister's 
directives on a number of tasks as follows: It is important to 
formulate plans to initiate the movement for thrift and against 
extravagance, work out measures to establish the capital market 
and draw investment capital for planned projects, make 
preparations for the stock market, take steps to perfect 
guidelines to the implementation of the local investment 
promotion law, prepare a draft law on tax reform, renovate the 
book- keeping system, apply the auditing system, regulate the 
currency exchange rate system and foreign currency control 
regulations, zone off targeted areas for economic development 
projects and other projects involving key sectors, prepare and 
adopt plans for the use of ODA[overseas development 
aid]-provided funds for the 1994-95 two-year period and the 
ensuing years, and accelerate the administrative reform program. 
Particularly, it is necessary to take resolute and urgent 
measures to improve administrative procedures. 
  Also during this session, the government reviewed and 
adopted 
a number of draft laws and draft regulations to be submitted to 
the National Assembly Standing Committee. They include the 
draft law on amending or supplementing the law on military 
service, the regulations on the income tax to be levied against 
high-income earners, and the regulations on the rights and 
duties which go with the use of land in Vietnam by foreign 
organizations or foreign nationals. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
emphatically said: Because of their sense of duty toward the 
people and the National Assembly, all members of the government 
must review the ways they handle affairs falling under their 
responsibilities, intensify supervision and control workd a step 
further, and discover and take timely action against violations. 
It is necessary for all ministers to uphold the sense of 
responsibility toward the campaign against corruption, 
smuggling, and extravagance. It is important for them to exert 
tight control over budget revenue and spending, practice thrift, 
and renovate the financial and accounting management mechanisms 
to make them consistent with the new situation. It is 
imperative for all ministries and sectors to review budget 
revenue and spending sources, and adopt measures to increase 
budget revenue and do away with all indications of extravagance. 
  The prime minister urged all ministries and sectors to 
remain 
sensitive to market demands, work out policies and mechanisms to 
stimulate production and make it appeal to the taste of local 
consumers, thereby effectively contributing to getting rid of 
smuggling activities. 
  The government stressed: As far as the second quarter of 
1994 is concerned, it is necessary to focus efforts on applying 
five major measures aimed at increasing budget revenue, 
stabilizing currency exchange rates, attracting foreign 
investment capital, carrying on the movement for thrift and 
against extravagance and smuggling, intensifying the 
administrative reform program a step further, and stepping up 
project implementation direction and project quality control 
work, thereby contributing to successfully implementing the 
seven groups of major tasks that the Government has set forth 
for the year 1994.

  [Text] The Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization 
convened a two-day midterm party conference from 29-30 March. 
Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the 
conference. 
  The delegates evaluated the results of party-building work 
in 
accordance with the third midterm national party conference 
resolution and discussed measures to ensure that party 
organizations and party chapters fulfill two objectives 
satisfactorily; namely, building themselves into units that are 
firm, strong, and pure in terms of politics, ideology, and 
organization and satisfactorily carrying out their political 
role as advisers to the party Central Committee and state on 
matters related to the implementation of the renovation process. 
  Regarding orientations and tasks for the next two years, the 
conference set forth the following main objectives: 
  -- It is necessary to guide cadres and party members in 
satisfactorily directing the implementation of each agency's 
political tasks and intensifying efforts to make the party firm, 
strong, and pure. 
  -- Steps must be taken to foil the peaceful evolution 
strategy and encourage everyone to contribute toward the 
successful implementation of the third midterm national party 
conference resolution. 
  -- Measures must be adopted so that the entire party 
organization fully grasps all party resolutions and state 
policies and lines. 
  -- Efforts are needed to build firm, strong, and pure 
party chapters in terms of both politics and organization. 
  -- Positive steps must be taken to fulfill satisfactorily 
the party organization's advisory role in suggesting general 
leadership patterns. 
  -- Special measures must be worked out to institutionalize 
party policies and lines aimed at building the socialist 
Vietnamese state into a law-governed state that belongs to, 
comes from, and works for the people. 
  On behalf of the party Central Committee Political Bureau 
and 
Secretariat, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi welcomed and 
commended the Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization for its 
achievements during the first half of its term. These 
achievements are positive contributions toward the common 
success of the renovation process and the implementation of the 
seventh party congress resolution. 
  He stressed: Because of the fact that a large number of its 
personnel work with organs in charge of providing support 
services to the party Central Committee, state, National 
Assembly, and government agencies, the Central Agencies Bloc 1 
party organization performs a very important role and has a very 
great duty to uphold. To be worthy of this important role and 
heavy responsibility, everyone must pay due attention to the 
task of making the party firm and strong in all fields. It is 
necessary to step up educational activities aimed at 
strengthening the ideological concepts of cadres and party 
members so they can firmly grasp the party organization's 
policies and lines and set a good example for others to follow. 
Practical plans must be worked out to help party members learn 
how to improve their professional skills and intellectual 
background as well as take the lead in the movement against 
corruption, waste, misappropriation of public funds, bribery, 
red tape, authoritarianism, and the tendency to distance oneself 
from the masses.

  [Text] The governor of the State Bank, Mr. Cao Sy Kiem, 
recently signed a decision to adjust the rate of capital 
reissued by the State Bank to commercial, investment, and 
development banks, to 95 percent. The rate is 85 percent to the 
Agriculture Bank. 
  The rate of capital reissued will be calculated in 
accordance 
with the interest rate applicable on projects to be reissued 
with capital. For special cases the governor will make separate 
decisions. 
  The Gold, Silver and Precious Stones General Company will 
lend capital to supplement working capital at the interest rate 
of 1.6 percent per month. This interest rate is effective 1 
April 1994. 
  Interest rates for other types of capital lending between 
the 
State Bank and State Treasury and other credit organizations are 
unchanged and are still regulated by the decision dated 30 
September 1993. Compulsory deposits of commercial banks that 
exceed the legal limit determined by the governor will receive 
an interest with the rate twice as high as the current interest 
rate applicable for savings of credit organizations deposited 
with the State Bank.

<F P=106> [Article by Le Huu Nghia: "Maintain Political Stability and </F>
Renovate the Political System"] 
  [Text] Over the years, we have made initial yet very 
important achievements in maintaining political stability and 
renovating the political system despite a very complex 
international and domestic situation caused by the crumbling of 
socialism in the Soviet Union and East Europe, the increase in 
sabotage against our regime by hostile domestic forces, and the 
occasionally acute difficulties with the economy and everyday 
life. The maintenance of political stability as it has been in 
the past has become a prerequisite for ensuring success in the 
renovation process. Political stability is also an essential 
factor in broadening international relations and attracting 
foreign investment capital. Political stability prevents people 
from losing confidence in the party and state. 
  The past few years have seen changes for the better in the 
organization and mode of operations of the party and state. 
Political and social organizations have developed in a more 
diversified fashion and their social character and dynamism have 
increased. The process of democratization has been initiated 
within the party and in society. Democracy has become more 
lively in political, cultural, and ideological activities. The 
roles of the National Assembly, various mass organizations, and 
the mass media have increased sharply. 
  Without our economic renovation achievements, the 
aforementioned achievements would have been impossible. Recent 
achievements in economic renovation have emerged as the most 
prominent ones. It is because of economic renovation that we 
have maintained political stability and renovated our political 
system in accordance with economic development requirements. 
  Our achievements in maintaining political stability and 
renovating the political system are the result not only of 
economic renovation, but of other important factors as well: 
  -- The role of various factors in the political system, 
especially the role of our party, which has been quick to come 
up with a correct renovation policy that suits the objective 
reality and meets the aspirations of the masses, and which knows 
how to undertake renovation in accordance with principles and 
appropriate steps. 
  -- Our people and our nation have a tradition of following 
the party. They voluntarily recognize party leadership. They 
do not want political instability or the collapse of the 
socialist regime. All of our people desire political stability 
so they can "earn their living," achieve economic development, 
and improve their livelihood. They do not want political 
pluralism or multiparty opposition, as this will only create 
social disturbances. 
  -- Our Army and security forces are also loyal to the party 
and the people. They have a lot of experience in defending the 
fatherland and maintaining political security, public order, and 
safety. They are taking the initiative in effectively fighting 
attempts at "peaceful evolution" by hostile forces. 
  In addition to the achievements we have already made, there 
are many issues yet to be tackled: 
  -- Recent economic achievements have only been preliminary. 
The market economy has just taken shape. Efforts to set a 
socialist course for the market economy are still uncertain and 
unclear, both in theory and practice. There is no way that the 
development of the market economy and the multisector economy 
can avoid creating an impact on the social and class structure, 
thereby affecting the political system. It is likely to create 
new complications in the political field. In addition, hostile 
forces are exploiting our effort to open ourselves economically 
and culturally to carry out sabotage activities aimed at 
creating political instability conducive to a change in our 
political course. 
  -- Our state's ability to regulate and manage the market 
economy is still poor and weak, thus creating occasional 
confusion in the socioeconomic situation and encouraging 
activities that violate the law and good ethics (including tax 
evasion, production of fake goods, embezzlement, smuggling, and 
so forth). This only benefits opportunists and speculators who 
work hand-in-glove with degenerate officials in various state 
agencies. It should be noted that this is the main cause of 
corruption and smuggling. 
  -- A segment of our people -- including cadres, party 
members, and especially our youth -- have not firmly grasped the 
real concept of the socialist ideal and orientation. 
  -- Renovation in the organization and activities of the 
party, state, and mass organizations has not been effective. 
Likewise, renovation of the political system has not paralleled 
that of the economic domain, especially the strengthening of 
organizations and mechanisms. It can be said that bureaucratism 
and cumbersomeness are still prevalent in our state apparatuses. 
Our legal system is still poor and inconsistent, while law 
enforcement is carried out loosely, thus encouraging violations 
of laws and regulations. 
  -- Our party activities to promote the market economy are 
inconsistent, while many issues related to the building of a 
law-governed state have not been resolved. The working 
mechanism designed to delegate authority and define duties and 
responsibilities between the law-building, law enforcement, and 
administrative agencies in the market economic system has not 
been fully established. 
  -- A number of adverse factors have emerged that may cause 
political instability and promote the schemes of "peaceful 
evolution," sabotage, rebellion, and overthrow being carried out 
by reactionary forces at home and abroad. We should not 
belittle these factors. Instead, we should carefully study 
their complexity, dangers, and consequences in order to 
formulate active measures to prevent, overcome, and stop them. 
  Through our efforts to maintain political stability and 
renovate our political system in past years, we have drawn on 
some experiences and deem it necessary to carry out the 
following tasks: 
  1. Resolutely maintain party leadership while renovating 
party activities; reject political pluralism and the multiparty 
system, because this will allow the enemies of the class 
struggle to have a chance to compete with our party, thereby 
causing political instability and rebellion against our system. 
  2. Strive to combine correctly the economic renovation task 
with that of renovating the political system, taking the former 
as the main task. 
  3. Continue to take economic renovation as a basis for 
developing the economy and resolving various pressing problems 
in people's daily lives. Through these tasks, we will be able 
to restore people's confidence in the party while promoting 
ideological and psychological work. 
  4. Strive to resolve various social issues to create healthy 
social conditions for renovating and stabilizing the political 
system. To attain this goal, we must strive to: overcome 
promptly such pressing problems as corruption and smuggling; 
prevent decadent culture from coming into our country in various 
forms; oppose social injustice; create more jobs for the people; 
narrow the gap between rich and poor; settle the land problem in 
the countryside satisfactorily to prevent "serious causes" that 
may create social conflict; strengthen vigilance against the 
"peaceful evolution" scheme; and foil resolutely all sabotage 
and rebellious activities by reactionary forces at home and 
abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by Le Xuan Tung: "Some Thoughts on the Danger of </F>
Disorientation From Socialism in the Renovation Process"] 
  [Text] At the Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC], with 
a fine capacity for planning and making correct forecasts, our 
party referred to one of the first experiences of the renovation 
as: "We must maintain the socialist direction in the renovation 
process." At that time, this experience was mainly aimed at 
criticizing manifestations which denied the achievements 
recorded by socialist regimes and considered that socialism has 
all type of inevitable shortcomings. These manifestations will 
distract us on the goal and path to socialism in our country. 
The origin of these manifestations lay in the fact that 
socialism was facing great difficulties in Eastern Europe and 
the USSR and our country was in a critical socioeconomic crisis. 
  At present, after three years of implementing the SNPC 
resolution, we have recorded very important achievements both in 
national issues and external affairs. The stature and strength 
of our revolution is improving. An absolute majority of our 
people have increased their confidence in the party and state's 
line and policy, the socialist path, and the bright national 
future. 
  However, we still have many shortcomings, weaknesses, and 
newly arising problems. One of the newly arising problems, as 
mentioned in the political report of the Mid-term National Party 
Conference, is "the danger of disorientation from socialism if 
deviations in the line and policy and in the implementation of 
the line and policy are not overcome". This also proves that 
the lesson "We must firmly maintain the socialist direction in 
the renovation process" mentioned in the SNPC is still correct. 
On the other hand, this lesson has a new application, 
reflecting the real situation in recent years: that is, in 
addition to our fine and correct actions, we must be vigilant to 
prevent the danger of disorientation from socialism in the 
renovation process. 
  Does this danger exist? Is it a real danger or an 
exaggeration?. Is it contradictory when we mention the danger of 
disorientation at the same time as referring to our achievements 
of the past years, because these achievements are the result of 
the correct line and policy and the efficient execution of our 
line and policy in life? Looking squarely at the truth, we must 
admit that the danger is real. That is not an exaggeration. 
  To say that our entire renovation undertaking, from all 
socioeconomic platforms and strategies to the line and policy 
and their implementation, is disorientated is totally incorrect 
and not in conformity with our great achievements. But it is 
also not correct if we say that everything has been fine, 
without chaos and confusion in any field or anywhere, and that 
we do not need an alarm about any danger. The truth is that, in 
the process of organizing the implementation of the renovation 
line, deviations, mistakes, and shortcomings have emerged. If 
we do not sufficiently prevent and overcome them with suitable 
measures, then who dare say that in the future the 
disorientation will not become bigger with unpredictable results? 
  Manifestations of disorientation have appeared, are 
appearing, and possibly will appear in the fields of the 
economy, politics, theory, ideology, culture, society, cadre 
organization. 
  There will be stronger manifestations of disorientation 
appearing in the implementation process due to an incorrect 
understanding of the line and policy. 
  Manifestations of disorientation may also appear in the 
process of outlining practical guidelines and policies to 
execute the socioeconomic platforms and strategies. 
  Manifestations of disorientation can not only appear in 
people who doubt our national advancement path. It is worth 
noting the possibility of unconscious disorientation in our 
cadres -- though we have no doubt about their loyalty to the 
regime -- due to their poor understanding, bureaucratism, and 
lack of responsibility in their work. 
  Negativism, especially corruption, is a fertile ground for 
those who act against the socialist direction and overlook the 
most correct line and policy for money. 
  Disorientation occurs on two sides: left and right. Both 
sides will cause damage. At present, we have to pay more 
attention to the rightist disorientation, especially when 
external forces are trying to impose this type of disorientation 
on us for their "peaceful evolution" goal. 
  It is difficult to fully cover all the types of 
disorientation within the limitations of an article. The 
disorientation from socialism has appeared at different levels. 
The economy is one of the fields that has shown such a sign. 
  In this field, there is no less incorrect understanding and 
wrong action, especially in the market economy. Some opinions 
have it that, in the market economy, capitalism and socialism 
are just the same with no differences, and speaking of the 
market economy under the socialist direction is coercive. 
  In fact, in both theoretical and practical contexts, the 
socialism-oriented market economy bears both similarities and 
differences to the capitalist market economy. Being 
market-driven economies, they both use the market as the basic 
tool in distributing and consuming economic resources; prices 
are to be determined in accordance with the rules of value and 
supply and demand; competition replaces monopoly; economic units 
are to be independent in production and business operations; 
production elements must circulate in the market, and different 
types of markets will come into existence. 
  The difference between the two is for whose interests state 
intervention in a market economy is supposed to serve -- for the 
laboring people or for the exploiting minority. Production 
resources ownership is another difference. In socialism, the 
all- people and the collective ownership have gradually become 
the basic concepts, and the state-run economic sector is a 
leading element in a multisectoral economy where ownership is 
displayed in various forms. In distribution, socialism uses 
labor as the main criterium. 
  These differences are domains where disorientation from 
socialism in the economy occurs. 
  Can we afford to continue to leave the situation as it is 
now 
regarding the heavily differentiated prices between industrial 
products and services, and agricultural products? Prices 
reflect economic relations and relations of interest. The 
existing price scale puts peasants in a disadvantaged position. 
While carrying out recent operations in various localities, 
many state trading establishments and trading cooperatives left 
the battlefield open to private traders in a number of areas 
such as production supplies, fertilizers, some agricultural 
products -- rice, coffee grain, pepper grain, coconut -- thus 
causing losses not only to producers but also consumers. These 
practices cause harm to the relations within the worker-peasant 
alliance. It also shows how important the state regulatory role 
is for a market economy. 
  Development of a multisectoral merchandise economy is the 
main concern in the renovation process of our party. We have 
completely eliminated the antipathy, prejudice, and prohibition 
against private capitalist and individual economic sectors, thus 
creating conditions for all production forces to develop for the 
sake of the country and the people. But deviations have come. 
Many people are now advocating the privatization of the 
economy, considering it the only path for the economy to take 
off. Equitization is also being seen as privatization. The 
various forms of production resources ownership are being 
regarded only as the means for economic development, and it is 
not essential to pay attention to the difference between state 
and collective ownership. 
  These are the points that a number of foreign forces would 
like to see developed in our country. The CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 
MONITOR journal in last January's edition carried an article by 
an overseas author saying: "The key of the political reforms in 
Vietnam lies with the private business sector.... The 
Vietnamese communists have braved all military attacks from the 
French and the Americans, but they cannot survive for long with 
the positive conditions created by private business." That 
shows too well what they want. 
  We all know that each society possesses not only the 
ownership forms it inherited from the society which existed 
before it, but it also has its own ownership relations which 
constitute particularities of that society. This is also true 
for our society. While we encourage the development of other 
economic sectors, we cannot pay any less attention to the 
consolidation and development of the role of state-owned, 
collective, and cooperative economic sectors. 
  Consolidation does not mean disorderly development without 
control and consideration for consequences. And development of 
the sectors does not mean we have to increase the proportion of 
these sectors to the highest percentages in all domains of 
industry and trade. Reality shows that we have not done enough 
to keep the state-managed business sector worthy of its leading 
role in production and distribution. Again, to encougage 
development of the state-managed business is not to compensate 
losses and subsidize it from the national budget, as we used to 
do before. The same principle applies with the collective and 
cooperative economic sectors. 
  Among all agricultural cooperatives countrywide, only 12 
percent of them satisfactorily operate. The operation of small 
business and handicraft cooperatives has been mostly 
spontaneous, leading to the current uncontrollable chain 
collapse of these cooperatives. In Hanoi alone where there used 
to be over 70,000 cooperative members, we now have less than one 
tenth of that figure. We do not want to maintain old-styled 
small business and handicraft cooperatives since they are no 
longer fit to exist. Cooperatives need to be revived with new 
vitality, and the state plays important role in this task. We 
should not use the simplistic distinction between state and 
nonstate business establishments as an excuse for neglecting 
these economic sectors, as the party platform clearly 
stipulates: The state and collective economic sectors are the 
foundation of the national economy. 
  Nonetheless, there is still much room for improvement. It is 
not our policy to apply an equal income distribution system 
because such a move would destroy the motives behind production 
and business operations. At the same time, we do not accept a 
very wide income gap, especially when it comes to income 
illegally earned. According to investigation results, nearly 18 
percent of the households in the countryside and in 
high-altitude, remote, or former revolutionary base areas are 
still listed as poor. The average value of the assets of rich 
family members stands at 60 million dong each whereas that of 
poor family members in the countryside is less than one million 
dong each. In many cases, people who have made the most 
meritorious contributions to the revolution survivors of fallen 
combatants, war invalids, members of the Armed Forces, retirees 
are also the very persons who experience the greatest 
difficulties in life. There are some business sectors which 
generate very high income compared with the general level of 
income distribution in society. There are many cases in which 
"some people have more than they need whereas others do not know 
how to make ends meet." This phenomenon is at variance with the 
nature of our society. If we do not work out appropriate 
measures to deal with this situation, the gap between the rich 
and the poor will be widened and social conflicts will increase 
in intensity. Here, the role of the state as a regulator is of 
great important significance. 
  Some people maintain that because we opt for the market 
economy, we must accept its negative aspects. It is true that 
besides positive aspects, the market economy also displays many 
negative phenomena. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily mean 
that we must adopt a negative attitude. Instead, we must 
persist in our struggle to limit, contain, and gradually 
eliminate those negative aspects from social life. This 
undertaking requires much manpower and time. As far as the 
market economy is concerned, money has a very great role and 
effect. Nonetheless, there is no way we can accept a lifestyle 
in which we do anything to get money, regarding it as "God," and 
worse still, let it affect our conscience, honor, and human 
dignity. We may not use the market mechanism or customers' 
taste to justify our attempts to commercialize cultural and 
artistic activities. This would give rise to the development of 
unhealthy cultural and artistic activities. Realities indicate 
that such incidents have occurred. We may not interpret the 
elimination of the state subsidization system in a simplistic 
and indiscriminate manner. We may not use openness and cultural 
exchanges with the outside world as a pretext for allowing 
miscellaneous and harmful publications to penetrate our country. 
Such phenomenon have occurred. Prompted by goodwill, a foreign 
friend warned us: If you do not take timely counter-measures, 
you will be subjected to a massive invasion by material 
civilization. Nothing is more frightening than cultural 
invasion. You have won the war for national defense, which was 
rife with difficulties. Yet, in my opinion, that war is easier 
compared with the war on the cultural front in the days ahead. 
You should remember that if you lose your culture, you will 
lose our country as well. That poses a real danger if we do not 
heighten vigilance. 
  We must guard against disorientation even in party-building 
work. Disorientation occurs if party organizations belittle 
their leadership role and the principles governing democratic 
centralism, collective leadership and individual responsibility, 
and criticism and self-criticism. It also occurs when there is 
a lax observance of discipline and a low sense of unity and 
singlemindedness. If party organizations fail to assume their 
role as political nucleus, other political and ideological 
concepts will fill the gap. Of course, if party organizations 
take charge of everything, give orders to everybody, and fail to 
respect the law and other operating procedures of mass 
organizations, then that is another form of disorientation. It 
is the very objective of the current movement to renovate and 
revamp the party to overcome both of those two forms of 
disorientation. 
  It is necessary to point out that it is not easy to set a 
clear cut boundary between socialist disorientation and a firm 
grasp of socialist orientations at the initial stage. This is 
particularly true with the renovation process when things do not 
take well-defined forms at an early stage of development. 
Instead, this process requires time, research, and experiments 
before correct conclusions can be reached. Only by stepping up 
efforts to inspect, review, and draw experiences from real life 
situations as well as rectify mistakes can we overcome 
irregularities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Human Rights Dilemma"] </F>
  [Text] When President Suharto once again criticized certain 
developed countries for linking aid programs with environmental 
and political conditions in an address the other day, he was 
joining the increasingly louder chorus of Third World leaders 
who steadfastly stand against pressures to bow to the Western 
countries' so called "conditionalities." 
  What we should underline from Suharto's remark is his 
warning 
that the disagreement over the issues of the environment and 
human rights could become new source of conflict in North-South 
relations. 
  True enough. The indications of this are there all right. 
  In the last several weeks the escalating war of words 
between 
the United States and China over human rights issues linked with 
China's most favored nation trading status has soured their 
relations to such an extent that, as Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen expressed the other day China has threatened "to 
live without any trade relations with the U.S." 
  Other Asian countries, like Vietnam and noticeably Malaysia, 
also have raised the hardliner's flag. Even Singapore, a 
country which is known for its close association with Western 
countries, snapped back a few weeks ago when President Clinton 
protested the Singapore court decision to sentence an American 
teenager to six strokes of the cane and four months in jail for 
spray-painting cars. 
  While we acknowledge that human rights conditions in many 
Asian countries, including Indonesia, need much improvement, and 
that foreign pressure has helped the situation to improve, there 
are reasons to be concerned that without a proper switching 
mechanism, the still developing row could lead into a tragic 
collision course, something which we believe nobody wants. 
  Judging from the heated nature of the words being shot back 
and forth, many Third World countries are becoming ever more fed 
up with the conditions imposed by the developed countries. But, 
different from the situation a few years back, they now have 
economic clout to back their hardliner stance: Asia's economic 
growth has boomed to an extent the failing Western countries' 
economies cannot simply ignore. 
  Some Asian countries, like China, for example, have even 
come 
to the conclusion that Western countries need them much more 
than they need the Western countries. The statistics and the 
projections seem to support these views. 
  For example, by the year 2000, Asia will have one billion 
consumers with sufficient spending power which will certainly 
create some of the biggest financial opportunities in history. 
Over the next decade, non-Japanese Asia is said to be planning 
to spend US$1 trillion on infrastructure projects, something 
which Western companies are surely eager to be a part of. But, 
if these developed countries are overzealous about Asia's human 
rights conditions, they may lose this huge market. 
  On the other hand, Western countries like the U.S., are 
bound 
to their commitment to environmental and human rights causes. 
In the case of President Clinton, he cannot back off on these 
issues because Congress and other pressure groups would crucify 
him. Hence, a nation's credibility is at stake. 
  In the midst of this dilemma some sort of compromise and 
face- saving solution must be sought. To a certain extent, 
foreign pressure on Asian human rights conditions have yielded 
positive results. This can be seen not only in the improvement 
of the human rights conditions themselves, but more importantly 
in the spreading awareness of the significance of human rights 
and the encouraging of local peoples to fight for their rights. 
  Thus, to a certain extent, the pressure and the momentum 
thus 
achieved must be maintained. But different approaches must be 
taken. For example, Western countries should drop their "high 
and mighty" approach, which amounts to dictating their concepts 
of democracy and human rights to Asian countries. Nothing much 
will be gained from playing "globocop" now. The response is 
bound to be annoyance, resentment and possibly rage.

  [Text] Jakarta, REPUBLIKA -- The national economy is in 
distress, but the government has given its assurance that shock 
therapy will not be used to overcome the situation. "I say that 
the Indonesian Government will not resort to shock therapy, nor 
will we adopt a TMP (/tight money policy/) again," Saleh Afiff, 
coordinating minister for economy, finance, and development 
supervision, said after receiving World Bank President Lewis 
Preston at his office on Monday (21 March). 
  According to Afiff, such measures would not be conducive to 
macroeconomic development and would tend to ignore the 
principles of caution. Thus, the government prefers safer 
measures to maintain strong economic stability. 
  He admitted the current economic situation is difficult. 
"Our economy has been facing many challenges since early this 
year," Minister Saleh Afiff said. 
  According to Afiff, unpredictably fluctuating oil prices and 
their downward trend are one of the challenges. Prices are 
expected to drop even further to $13 per barrel. The benchmark 
prices are set at $16 per barrel. 
  Inflation in the first two months of 1994 was quite high at 
3.01 percent. This means the government must keep inflation 
below 7 percent in the remaining 10 months. 
  In addition, non-oil and non-gas exports -- especially 
textiles and textile products -- have experienced slower growth. 
The export of textiles and textile products grew by 2.8 percent 
between January and November 1993, representing 21.89 percent of 
total non-oil and non-gas exports. The figures were in fact 
higher than the previous year, but it is feared that this 
position may affect state revenues. 
  Afiff further said that the growing appreciation of the yen 
against the dollar is the most serious situation. "The 
appreciation may increase our /debt stock/," Afiff said. 
  He said that Indonesia's debt stock may increase by $3 
billion if there is a 15 percent appreciation. Thus, 
Indonesia's current debt stock of $87 billion would swell to $90 
billion if there is an appreciation of that proportion. This 
will, of course, be an extremely heavy burden because 40 percent 
of Indonesia's total foreign debts are in yen. 
  This situation reminds us of the importance of maintaining 
self- reliance in development. We must reduce the role of 
foreign loans as much as possible, although the government has 
been able to manage the foreign loans. 
  Loans received by the government -- 60 percent of total 
foreign loans -- are divided into three categories. 1) Soft 
loans repayable in 25 years with annual interest of 3 percent. 
These loans are arranged through the CGI [Consultative Group 
for Indonesia]. 2) Loans in the form of export credits 
repayable in 20 years with annual interest of 7 percent. 3) 
Commercial loans repayable in at least five years at market 
interest. 
  "The government has been able to manage the three kinds of 
loans. It is rather difficult, however, to manage foreign loans 
obtained by the private sector," Afiff said. 
  The private sector is currently expected to play a major 
role 
in development. As such, the government does not prohibit the 
private sector from seeking foreign funds. The government 
merely asks that they refrain from seeking excessive loans. 
  Regardless of the current situation, the World Bank has 
praised Indonesia's economic policy, especially the one taken in 
1993. World Bank President Lewis Preston praised strategic 
measures such as the various deregulation packages, which he 
said had relaxed the TMP and overcome other obstacles. In 
addition, inflation has been kept below 10 percent.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- More than 500 students turned the 
Jakarta District Court into a theater yesterday and staged a 
tragedy in protest of the trials of 21 defendants charged under 
the nation's defamation law. 
  They carried a mock-up corpse on a bamboo stretcher through 
the corridors and burned incense, in what they said was 
Indonesian democracy's funeral. 
  Security officers stood by watching but made no attempt to 
interfere with the procession. 
  "Arrest us if you dare. Let's fill up the Salemba detention 
center," one said. 
  The court yesterday proceeded with the trial of the 21 
accused of defaming the name of President Suharto. 
  The students were arrested last December after staging a 
demonstration at the House of Representatives (DPR) at which 
they demanded the People's Consultative Assembly convene to 
grill the head of state for his conduct. 
  Yesterday was the defendants' turn to present their defense 
and none showed remorse for their behavior and used the 
opportunity to lash out at the government for arresting them, 
calling it an infringement on their freedoms. 
  The defendants remain divided into three groups, depending 
on 
the government's view of the severity of their alleged offense. 
The prosecution's "hard core" group of defendants consists of 
Yeni Rosa Damayanti, Masduki, Hendrik Dikson Sirait and Adi 
Kurniawan. The other two groups consist of six and 11 
defendants. 
  A lawyer of the group of four, Frans Hendra Winarta, told 
presiding judge Sutrisno yesterday that the prosecution's 
argument was obscure. 
  "It was not clear, precise or accurate as required by the 
Procedural Code." 
  Frans blasted the prosecutors for using a law inherited from 
the Dutch penal code, formerly used by the colonizers to charge 
freedom fighters. 
  The article in question, that is a part of the current 
Criminal Code, prohibits expressions of hostility, hatred and 
disrespect towards the President. 
  "During the Dutch period, that horrible and scaring article 
was heavily criticized by our forefathers," Frans said. 
  Yeni also read her own prepared, hand written defense 
statement, entitled "Speaking the Truth is not a Crime." 
  She said the protest at the House had nothing to do with the 
president. "We have no intention of mocking the president," the 
29-year-old student militant noted. 
  The protesters main concern, she said, was the excessive 
involvement of the military in day to day affairs, known locally 
as the security approach to development. 
  The system has turned Indonesia into a "state of fear", she 
said using a theme of a speech by Myanmarese [Burmese] Nobel 
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. 
  "I was accused of defaming an official, in fact it's I who 
has to feel insulted," Yeni said, adding that a number of high 
ranking government and military officials had called the 
students "anti- Pancasila" [state philosophy].

<F P=106> [Article by Nanda Utama: Corruption, Collusion and How to </F>
Overcome Them] 
  [Text] Corruption is one of the complex problems which the 
government constantly faces. This is understandable because 
corruption, manipulation, illegal fees, abuse of office or 
whatever you call it, always ends up the same way: the loss of 
money that the state uses to fund development. 
  Ironically, corrupt people are usually educated, have social 
status and plenty of power. Given all these advantages, they can 
try to protect themselves or at least make their modus operandi 
more sophisticated. 
  Attorney General Singgih, SH [Master of Laws], in a paper 
presented by Amran Hamid, SH, a member of his staff, at an 
international seminar entitled Urban Crime Trends in Criminal 
Policy held some time ago in Yogyakarta, revealed that according 
to figures from the Attorney General's office the quantity of 
corruption in departments or in nondepartmental government 
institutions has actually been declining from year to year. 
However, the quality of the corruption has been increasing. 
  From the 1988-1989 fiscal year to the 1992-1993 fiscal year 
the state lost 1,346 trillion rupiahs as a result of various 
cases of corruption in Indonesia. In an average year, Operation 
Justice was able to recover less than 10 percent of the money 
corrupted away from the state. In fact, only 1.28 percent of the 
138.2 billion rupiahs that the state lost in corruption in the 
1992-1993 fiscal year could be rescued (National News, 3 
February 1993). 
  From these figures we can get an idea of how much money the 
state is losing to corruption. It is no exaggeration to say that 
corruption is a vicious cancer which has spread throughout the 
entire body and has nibbled away at almost every level of social 
life from the lowest bureaucrat to the highest. 
  In this brief analysis, we will try to look at the dominant 
factors in corruption and at alternative solutions which might 
reduce the amount of future corruption without belittling the 
significance of efforts which the government has made up to this 
point. 
  Government Efforts 
  To overcome the increasing loss of state funds through 
corruption, the government has really tried in a number of ways 
to "reduce" the amount. This includes Presidential Directive 
Number 52 of 1970 concerning the Obligation of State Employees 
to List their Assets, opening P.O. Box 5000, creating oversight 
institutions, such as the BPK [Financial Control Board], the 
BPKP [Development and Financial Oversight Board] and the 
Attorney General's office, but the reality is that previous 
efforts have still not been very effective in cutting down on 
the amount of corruption. 
  The same is true of the Criminal Corruption Act (UUTPK), Law 
Number 3 of 1971, which relates to activities categorized as TPK 
[Criminal Corruption]; this can be seen in Article 1 paragraphs 
1, b, c of the General Provisions. Just to remind the reader it 
would be good for us to look at those provisions. 
  According to Article 1 of the UUTPK, the following are to be 
sentenced for Criminal Corruption: 
  a. whoever violates the law by taking any action to enrich 
himself, another person or group, which directly or indirectly 
damages the finances and/or economy of the state, or if the 
action either unbeknownst [as published] to him or which he 
should think will damage the finances or the economy of the 
state. 
  b. whoever, with the intention of benefitting himself or a 
group, misuses the authority, opportunities or means which he 
has by virtue of his office or position and which can directly 
or indirectly damage the finances or economy of the state. 
  In addition to enacting strict legal regulations, the 
Minister of State for the Reform of the State Apparatus, at that 
time Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, also tried to use built-in controls 
(WASKAT). But this effort also proved insufficient if we look at 
the figures for the loss of government funds again. 
  It is the practice of collusion or conspiracy between "the 
top and the bottom," and also possibly between government 
officials and the private sector, which has caused a sharp 
increase in losses to the development budget. The pressures of 
need, the closeness of relationships, the pleasure taken in 
short cuts and in creating mutually beneficial relationships are 
indicators of a spurt in corruption. 
  This is in line with the statement made by the economic 
observer Kwik Kian Gie at a one-day session on Increasing the 
Role of BEPEKA [Financial Examination Board] in the Era of the 
Second PJPT [Long-Term Planning] in Jakarta on 25 January 1994. 
He said that if all of the BPK's findings were openly reported 
to the DPR [Parliament], as is required by the 1945 
Constitution, it is possible that too many respected and highly 
placed bureaucrats would be caught and that bureaucratic 
stability would be shaken (National News 26 January 1994). 
  There are many obstacles in the way of authorities trying to 
prove collusion between "the high and the low". Efforts to 
salvage state losses have often run up against problems of 
finding out the facts. When certain figures suspected of 
corrupting away billions are checked, they no longer have the 
wealth. It turns out that they have transferred their wealth 
several times over so that it is no longer officially in their 
possession. 
  Confiscate It 
  It is really not too hard to find out if someone is being 
corrupt if we really want to. All you have to do is look at the 
person's monthly salary. For example, if a person makes three 
million rupiahs per month, 1.5 million will be used for food, 
family needs and other necessities. If the remaining 1.5 million 
rupiahs is saved, the savings will amount to 30 million rupiahs 
in two years. If he wants to have a fairly good car, he will 
have to save for two years. But in fact and people can see this 
he has three or four luxury cars. This doesn't even count other 
assets such as a house, land, bank deposits, etc. 
  As was touched on above, in many cases as soon as a corrupt 
person suspects that his corruption is about to be discovered, 
he tries to transfer his wealth as quickly as possible. In fact, 
it is even possible that he will manage by one means or another 
to transfer wealth which has already been confiscated to a third 
party. 
  Moreover, if they have not been arrested yet, it is possible 
that they will try to move their wealth abroad because the 
corrupt know that Article 35 paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law Number 3 
of 1971 can be used as an effective weapon in the fight for 
keeping the wealth they have gotten from corruption. 
  According to Article 35 paragraph (1) of Law Number 3 of 
1971, "Goods not owned by the person sentenced cannot be seized 
if the rights of a third party who has good intentions will be 
violated". According to paragraph (2), "If goods to be seized by 
a court order also include goods owned by a third party who has 
good intentions, within three months of the judgment he can 
submit a letter to the court objecting to the seizure of his 
goods. The prosecutor will be asked for an explanation but the 
explanation of the interested party must also be heard." 
  Nevertheless, because corrupt people always have so many 
tricks, the best option for rescuing state funds is to 
confiscate them so as to prevent a transfer to a third party. At 
the very least, this option should be chosen as soon as there 
are indications that someone is being corrupt. 
  The Role of Religious Figures 
  Given the difficulties of overcoming corruption, it would be 
interesting to think about the opinion expressed by Sayed 
Hussein Alatas in 1986. Alatas said that the role of holy and 
charismatic religious figures has been the most important single 
factor in taming corruption throughout Asian history, as long as 
no other antidote was available. 
  The government must try to spread the influence of these 
religious figures through education and through other 
institutions. They must broadcast information about their 
opposition to corruption and this must be developed within their 
traditional cultures. Efforts of this type should be considered 
a force which supplements other ways of fighting against 
corruption and it must be made clear that the goal is to achieve 
a just and unbiased society. 
  The facts show that such holy and charismatic figures can 
speak directly to the masses using words which are easy to 
understand because these words are much more effective than a 
dry philosophical speech about justice. 
  To conclude this short essay, why don't we try apply the 
alternatives described above since the corrupt ignore the 
regulations. At the very least, it could reduce the financial 
loss to the state due to corruption.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- A report issued overnight by 
the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) putting Japan top of the 
list of nations with trade barriers is not intended to slap 
sanctions immediately against Japan, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday. 
  "The USTR report is just one step of the procedures under 
the 
super 301," Fujii told a regular press conference after a 
morning cabinet meeting. "Super 301" is a retaliatory provision 
of a U.S. Trade Law recently reinstated by the Clinton 
administration. The report "does not mean a unilateral action 
against Japan," he said. 
  In its report for 1994, the USTR listed trade barriers in 39 
nations and designated 49 sectors in seven fields for Japan. 
  Asked about Japan's market-opening measures launched Tuesday 
in hope of resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the 
United States, Fujii quoted U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor as saying that "the U.S. is not discouraged, and the door 
is open." Fujii said, "we must actively take the measures 
decided voluntarily in the package." 
  Turning to domestic issues, Fujii called for swift enactment 
of the fiscal 1994 provisional budget that failed to become law 
Thursday, the last day before the fiscal year started Friday. 
  The government submitted the stopgap budget worth some 11 
trillion yen to the Diet on Tuesday. The measure is intended to 
bridge a delay in approval by the Diet of the full budget for 
fiscal 1994. 
  The provisional budget passed the House of Representatives, 
but deliberations hit a snag in the House of Councillors on 
Thursday in furious debate over Prime Minister Morihiro 
hosokawa's alleged stock dealings and loans.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Japanese business 
community expressed regret Friday [1 April] at a U.S. threat to 
take retaliatory action against Japan and other nations to pry 
open their markets for American goods and services. A U.S. 
Government report released Thursday accused Japan and other 
countries of trade barriers against American goods and services, 
warning that Washington might take action against them. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the U.S. stance shows 
that Washington has a "lack of understanding" of Japan's 
willingness to be a good partner of the United States. 
  Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies, said the U.S. accusation was "surprising," noting 
that the report argued that the Japanese industry's procurement 
from U.S. suppliers was insufficient. Abe said the industry 
will continue to purchase necessary equipment in a fair manner, 
without discrimination against foreign suppliers. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said Japan should carefully examine the contents of 
the report and take necessary steps to avoid possible U.S. 
sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's 
automotive industry Friday [1 April] responded calmly to a U.S. 
report which declared Japan guilty of unfair trade practices. 
Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, said it is not true that Japan has discriminated 
against foreign automakers and auto parts makers seeking to 
enter the nation's markets and will not do so in the future. 
  Kume, also chairman of Nissan Motor Co., made the remark 
after the U.S. Government released a report Thursday accusing 
Japan of maintaining trade barriers against foreign companies in 
the automotive sector, among others. He said his industry wants 
to try to make the United States understand that Japan's auto 
market is open for foreign countries to enter.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe and Japan's International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai agreed Friday to oppose unilateral U.S. 
trade retaliation such as that mandated under the revived Super 
301 Trade Law, Japanese officials said. 
  The law requires the U.S. Administration to annually 
identify 
countries maintaining trade barriers against its exports and to 
impose punitive tariffs if bilateral negotiations fail to remove 
such barriers. 
  Juppe, calling on Kumagai at the ministry, expressed hope 
that retaliatory rules such as the Super 301 will be abolished 
in global trade after member nations of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) sign a final accord this month on the 
seven-year-old Uruguay Round of talks held under its auspices. 
GATT has called a ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco, 
from April 12 to 15 to sign the accord. 
  Juppe also told Kumagai that the Marrakech conference should 
focus on trade and the environment, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe reiterated Friday that Japan and Germany should 
become full permanent members of a revised U.N. Security Council 
[UNSC] but said it implies "assuming responsibilities" such as 
peacekeeping duties. "It shall seem fit that countries who 
pursue their candidature (for permanent membership) proceed with 
constitutional reforms implied by such membership," Juppe told a 
news conference. 
  He was alluding to Germany's and Japan's pacifist postwar 
Constitutions restricting overseas troop deployment. 
  Tokyo enacted a law in 1992 empowering a limited overseas 
deployment of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to assist U.N. 
peacekeeping operations but a legal provision bans the 
peacekeepers from joining activities that may involve the use of 
force. However, a constitutional amendment opening the door to 
participation in proposed peace enforcement units remains highly 
controversial in Japan. 
  Former Defense Agency Chief Keisuke Nakanishi quit last 
December following public outrage over a speech advocating a 
revision of the Constitution for armed peacekeeping missions. 
  Juppe said, nonetheless, the discussed revision of the 
15-member Security Council remains a difficult problem, citing 
misgivings about the efficiency of a bigger council. 
  Should Japan and Germany, both northern nations, be awarded 
permanent seats, a number of countries from the southern 
hemisphere should also become permanent Security Council members 
to maintain "a certain geopolitical balance," Juppe said without 
elaborating. 
  Juppe, who met Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Thursday, and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
other cabinet members Friday, said the top objective of his 
four-day visit is "to reestablish high-level dialogue" between 
Japan and France. 
  Juppe said he conveyed a message from French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur inviting Hosokawa to France. 
  He said he and Hata agreed to hold foreign ministerial talks 
in principle once a year and to promote regular meetings of 
senior ministry officials. 
  Japan and France will actively cooperate in the 
reconstruction of war-shattered Cambodia and coordinate measures 
to fight AIDS, he said. 
  Japan and France should nurture political dialogue on all 
international problems, he said, adding he and Hata also 
discussed security in the Asia-Pacific region, especially North 
korea's alleged nuclear weapon program. 
  He called Pyongyang's refusal to allow full international 
inspections at a key nuclear facility "unacceptable" and "a 
behavior France condemns" because it involves "a great risk of 
nuclear proliferation." As a party to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea must accept 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he 
said. 
  He added he hopes North Korea "brings itself in compliance 
with international rules" since the U.N. Security Council 
adopted a statement Thursday urging Pyongyang to agree to a 
follow-on IAEA inspection at the controversial site. 
  "Japan must proceed in opening its markets," Juppe said, 
citing auto parts, aeronautics, public works and the insurance 
sector as special concerns but stressed that Paris is devoted to 
"multilateralism" in solving trade issues. 
  Following a trip to Kyoto, Juppe will leave for New Delhi on 
Sunday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Friday [1 
April] discussed shared concerns over North Korea's alleged 
nuclear weapons development program, a Japanese Foreign Ministry 
official said. Calling on Hosokawa at his official residence, 
Juppe confirmed French concerns about Pyongyang's refusal of 
full international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected 
of being used to produce nuclear weapons, the official said. 
  Juppe, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for a four-day stay, 
did not touch on Japan's aspirations to win a permanent seat on 
the United Nations Security Council, the official said. The 
French foreign minister voiced support on Thursday for Tokyo's 
bid to enter the council as a permanent member when meeting with 
his Japanese counterpart, Tsutomu Hata. 
  Juppe's visit is his third since assuming his post in April 
1993. He visited Japan last April to attend a Group of Seven 
(G-7) joint ministerial meeting and in July to attend the summit 
meeting of leaders of the seven major economic powers. 
  The visiting minister reportedly sought further expansion of 
bilateral political, economic and cultural exchanges and 
beefed-up two-way visits of political leaders between the two 
countries. 
  Juppe also conveyed to Hosokawa French Prime Minister 
Edouard 
Balladur's invitation for him to visit France. 
  Hosokawa did not make any particular response, the official 
said. But government sources said that Hosokawa is likely to 
visit three European nations -- Italy, France and Germany -- in 
early May. 
  Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, told 
Juppe in a separate meeting that Japan will continue to observe 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), denying it intends to 
become a nuclear power. "Japan will stick to its three 
non-nuclear principles in the future and will oppose to an 
emergence of a new nuclear power," Aichi said, according to 
Defense Agency officials. 
  Aichi made the remarks in response to an international 
concern that Japan might go ahead with a program to develop 
nuclear weapons if North Korea possesses nuclear bombs. 
  In reply to another question from Juppe, Aichi said Japan 
has 
no intention to build up defense capability to cope with the 
tense situation on the Korean peninsula. "Functioning 
effectively with the present self-defense capability and the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is the basis," for the stance, Aichi 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan on Friday supported a 
United Nations call on North Korea to allow full international 
inspection of its nuclear facilities suspected of being used to 
develop nuclear weapons. 
  "The UN statement underlined what the international 
community 
wants North Korea to do to help resolve the issue of Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear program through dialogue," Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We will 
support this statement," the top government spokesman said. 
  All 15 members of the UN Security Council, including China, 
a 
traditional ally of North Korea, agreed to issue the statement 
Thursday calling for Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Later in the day, Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Kishichiro Amae also told a press conference that Japan supports 
the U.N. presidential [as received] statement on North Korea 
because it "clearly shows as a unified opinion of the world 
community" what North Korea should do to solve the problem 
through dialogue. He added that Japan "strongly wishes North 
Korea would pay serious attention to the statement." 
  "We also consider that the role of China, in her 
relationship 
with North Korea, is still very, very important," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam renewed his call on Friday [1 April] for concerted 
action by South Korea, Japan and the United States to persuade 
North Korea to allay concerns that it is developing nuclear 
weapons capability. Kim telephoned Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and said he highly evaluated the United Nations 
statement issued Thursday calling on Pyongyang to allow full 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities, a Foreign 
Ministry official said. 
  In the 15-minute conversation, the premier replied that 
Japan 
will support the U.N. move to seek North Korea's acceptance of 
full inspections of nuclear sites suspected of being used to 
produce nuclear weapons, the official said. 
  Kim's telephone call was originally intended to relay the 
outcome of his recent visit to China to discuss the North Korean 
issue, the official said. 
  The South Korean president, who visited Japan shortly before 
his late March China visit, pointed out that China and Russia 
will also be needed to play a role in helping encourage 
Pyongyang to eliminate suspicion over its nuclear program. 
Noting that Seoul does not want Pyongyang to be isolated 
internationally, Kim also expressed hope that the communist 
country would agree to reopen dialogue with its southern 
neighbor to discuss the nuclear issue. 
  Hosokawa reportedly told Kim he wants to hold in-depth 
discussion on the topic with South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, who arrives in Tokyo Sunday for a two-day visit.

  [Text] Osaka, April 1 KYODO -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister 
Begum Khaleda Zia flew out of Osaka on Friday [1 April], capping 
a five-day official visit to Japan. 
  In summit talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in 
Tokyo on Tuesday, Zia was quoted as offering to drum up support 
for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United 
Nations Security Council. The 48-year-old premier said 
Bangladesh's support stems from its belief "that the leadership 
and positive posture of Japan are important for further 
strengthening the role of Asia in international relations." 
  During her visit, Japan pledged to extend a 23 billion yen 
official aid package to Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. 
  The pledge, covering two projects, was formalized in a 
ceremony to exchange notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and Bangladesh Finance Minister Saifur Rahman, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency will relax 
its restrictions on wheat imports to allow increased competition 
in the area, agency sources said Friday [1 April]. The plan was 
revealed following a news report that the agency sets import 
shares for the trading companies through which it purchases rice 
and wheat for the public. 
  The report said the agency informs the 26 designated trading 
houses of their shares ahead of grain auctions, prompting grain 
traders to collude on bids. 
  Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries, 
defended the government procedures for buying grain at a press 
conference earlier in the day, while a Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) official said it would be a violation of the Antimonopoly 
Law if the report is true. 
  Under the new agency plan for wheat imports, grain traders 
will be allowed to buy foreign wheat exceeding their quotas by 
up to 30 percent, instead of the 20 percent limit under current 
restrictions. 
  The decision was made in response to an FTC request for 
greater competition among wheat importers. Import ceilings for 
exceeding quotas have gradually increased from 5 percent in 1960 
to 10 percent in 1973, and 20 percent in 1990. 
  In a further bid to loosen its controls on the wheat trade, 
the agency said it also invited prospective importers to be 
added to the current government-authorized 26. So far no 
traders have responded to the invitation, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- The government decided 
Thursday [31 March] on 83.1 billion yen worth of measures to 
beef up the dairy and livestock industries for fiscal 1994, 2.2 
times more than the previous year, government officials said. 
The stepped-up measures are aimed at stabilizing operations of 
the dairy and livestock industries based on the agreement at the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks in December. 
  Of the total, 34.9 billion yen will be applied to the dairy 
industry and 48.2 billion yen will go to livestock farmers. 
  For the dairy industry, 14.6 billion yen will be used to 
streamline dairy business management by paying farmers 2 yen per 
kilogram of milk production. This measure is to continue from 
fiscal 1993. 
  The government will pay an additional 1 yen per kilogram to 
dairy farmers as an emergency subsidy to compensate for damaged 
pastures due to bad weather in 1993. 
  In the end result, despite the 1 yen cut in the 
government-guaranteed price of milk for fiscal 1994, farmers' 
revenue from milk production will be unchanged from the previous 
year. 
  The government sets its guaranteed producer prices for milk 
every year. When market prices for milk fall below the minimum 
level, the government buys up stocks to prevent further price 
declines.

names of the banks, but said there are two Japanese banks among 
the foreign banks which Mexico will allow to operate. He said 
the banks will invest a total of 20 to 40 million U.S. dollars 
each in Mexico. 
  Mexico has basically allowed no foreign banks to open 
hitherto, but the government has been lifting regulations on 
foreign banks in line with the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan will provide 4 
billion yen to help improve safety at Kathmandu airport, where 
two plane crashes occurred within two months in 1992, government 
officials said Thursday [31 March]. The Japanese and Nepalese 
Governments have agreed on a program to equip the accident-prone 
airport with radars and other facilities as well as train air 
controllers, the officials said. 
  The Transport Ministry sent a controller and an engineer 
Thursday to Kathmandu for training the Nepalese. The government 
also plans to invite 30 to 40 controllers from the airport to 
Japan for training. 
  The planned refurbishing of the control facilities will be 
completed around fall in 1996. 
  The poor safety level at the airport came into the spotlight 
in 1992, when two plane crashes within a two-month period killed 
nearly 300 people. 
  On July 31, 1992, a Thai Airways Airbus crashed into a 
Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the airport, killing all 
113 people on board, including 21 Japanese. 
  On September 28, a Pakistani airliner carrying 167 people 
crashed in a rainstorm near the airport, killing all aboard. 
  Kathmandu airport is considered tricky by pilots, who have 
to 
spiral down to the runway to avoid surrounding mountains. The 
airport has no radar and planes are guided in by radio beacon.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Diet on Friday night 
enacted a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 1994 with a 
record outlay of 11.05 trillion yen to bridge the delay in Diet 
passage of the full fiscal 1994 budget worth 73.08 trillion yen. 
  The stopgap budget, effective the same day, was to be 
enacted 
Thursday but approval by the House of Councillors was delayed 
over opposition demands to summon a witness in connection with 
stock transactions done in the name of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's father-in-law. 
  The upper house budget committee had deadlocked since 
Thursday evening after the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
demanded that a stock consultant, who has said the stock deal 
was Hosokawa's, be summoned to testify before the Diet as an 
unsworn witness. Hosokawa said it was conducted by his late 
father-in-law. 
  The ruling coalition had rejected but finally accepted the 
opposition demand Friday. Shozo Fujiki told reporters Wednesday 
that he arranged a 418 million yen loan for an aide of 
Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help finance the 
purchase of 300 shares of telecommunications giant Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 just after NTT went 
public. 
  The prime minister denied allegations that he personally had 
a hand in the 1986 purchase of the NTT shares. 
  The provisional budget was submitted to the Diet last 
Tuesday, approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday 
and was sent to the upper house the same day. 
  Deliberations by the lower house on the full budget have yet 
to begin because the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party are 
refusing to participate in the budget debates due to 
dissatisfaction with Hosokawa's explanation concerning 100 
million yen he says was a loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking group. 
  The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in 
spending 
on public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in the 
full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993 and 
to cover the roughly estimated amount usually necessary during 
the first 50-day period. 
  An outlay of 14 percent is included as a minimum requirement 
for labor, operating and other administrative expenses to keep 
the government functioning. 
  Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget 
allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from 
13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in 
tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen. 
  On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion 
yen 
during the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax 
income and 2.47 trillion yen from bond issuance. 
  To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion 
yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term 
treasury bills. 
  The 50-day provisional period is the second longest in 
postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990 
when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Police Friday [1 April] 
arrested two rightists and rescued two people who had been held 
hostage for nearly six hours inside the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper 
headquarters in Tokyo. Police identified the rightists as 
Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the 
Taihikai right-wing group. 
  The two were arrested at around 7:10 P.M. Uchiyama was 
carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said they 
recovered four sticks of dynamite. The two men had held Kei 
Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the company's public 
relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head of the 
secretarial department, in an executive reception room on the 
15th floor, police said. 
  Before breaking into the building, the two rightists, 
carrying a sword, a handgun and what they said were two sticks 
of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun, 
police said. 
  Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass 
media 
as a "Class A war criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to 
"amend the tone of its news coverage." The pamphlets also 
criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for his failure to 
retract a statement apologizing for Japan's wartime activities 
in Asia which he said were "a war of aggression." 
  Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30 
P.M., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake 
and they wanted to meet the company's president. Police said 
one of the men fired a shot when another security guard 
approached but no one was injured. 
  They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used 
desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the 
executive reception room with the hostages. 
  Friday's hostage situation was the second violent incident 
in 
five months at the headquarters of the mass-circulation ASAHI 
SHIMBUN involving the Taihikai. On October 20, Shusuke Nomura, 
58, the leader of the group, entered the building and committed 
suicide during a meeting with the company's executives in 
protest over the use of a cartoon parodying his group in a 
weekly magazine affiliated with the company. 
  Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security 
guard they are "disciples" of Nomura. Furusawa was Nomura's 
secretary and chauffeur. He was present in the same room with 
Nomura and other ASAHI SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot 
himself, police said. 
  On November 12, 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set 
off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of 
former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets Wednesday staged a joint air war 
exercise against the North including support to the ground 
force, air strike, long-distance airlifting and surprise attack 
with hundreds of warplanes in the skies above Pyongchang, 
Yangpyong, Oeyon islet and Muju, South Korea, military sources 
said. 
  C-141 and C-130 transport planes airlifted that day large 
aggressor Armed Force from U.S. bases in the Pacific to the U.S. 
air base in South Korea. The airlifted troops and lethal 
weapons were deployed in operational zones. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets deployed a large 
force of troops, scores of armored vehicles and large-calibre 
artillery units in the eastern and western sectors of the front, 
and displayed war hysterics, firing bullets and shells in 
Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and Yonchon 
County, Kyonggi Province. 
  They also staged exercises of support to "commando" 
operations, airlifting of war supplies, marine attack and 
support to landing in Uijongbu, Paju, Pochon and Yonchon and on 
the sea off Kunsan. 
  The warplanes involved in air war exercises against the 
North 
in South Korea Wednesday totalled more than 600.

daydream if the United States and the South Korean puppets think 
they can threaten and bring us to our knees with sophisticated 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  "We set greatest store by peace, but, if any enemy dared 
provoke a war by challenging our sincerity and efforts, we would

demonstrate once again the mettle and honour of heroic Korea." 
  The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful

information No. 646 published on March 31. 
  Noting that the United States and the South Korean 
authorities have staged war exercises almost every day, 
massively introducing various kinds of war materiel and a large 
number of aggressor troops, the information goes on: 
  "If the reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and 
their 
stooges are overlooked, the train of a nuclear war would 
inevitably be lighted, and then, the territory of our country 
would turn into a barren land and the whole nation suffer an

Patriot missiles and new war provocation moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and their stooges."

  [Text] The Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front [SKNDF] held a news conference on 31 March on 
the white paper published by the SKNDF Central Committee 
exposing the nuclear arms development maneuvers of the South 
Korean puppet clique. 
  The news conference was attended by reporters of newspapers, 
news agencies, and broadcasting networks in Pyongyang and 
foreign reporters. 
  Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, made remarks at the news 
conference. 
  Cho Il-min informed the reporters of the white paper 
published by the SKNDF Central Committee to expose the nuclear 
arms development maneuvers of the South Korean puppet clique and 
mentioned the purpose of publishing this white paper. 
  He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their stooges 
are waging the anti-North and antisocialist smear campaign on 
the pretext of the nonexistent nuclear issue of the North and 
are expanding it in a step-by-step manner. Thus, they are 
leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a touch and go 
war crisis. He said that because the South Korean people cannot 
be the victims of such a slanderous nuclear smear campaign, the 
SKNDF Central Committee decided to publish a white paper to 
expose the truth of the situation before fair public opinion of 
the world. 
  He said that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are used for the 
development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and the 
basis for this is that enough plutonium capable of producing 34 
nuclear warheads a year is being generated from the heavy water 
reactor in Wolsong, and that plutonium is being generated from 
the multipurpose research reactor in a more rapid manner than 
heavy water. He also pointed out that the South Korean figures 
involved in the nuclear development themselves confessed that 
these reactors were introduced for the purpose of developing 
nuclear weapons, and that since nuclear materials can be 
extracted even during operation, supervision is difficult 
[kamdokto kollanhada]. 
  Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, expressed the hope that 
the reporters will pay attention to nuclear weapons development 
maneuvers in south Korea, and will report and create public 
opinion in a fair and impartial manner. 
  He answered questions raised by reporters. 
  The white paper of the SKNDF Central Committee was 
distributed to reporters at the news conference.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon on Nuclear Arms Development of South Korean </F>
Authorities " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] 
(Hanminjon) published a white paper on March 30 exposing the 
nuclear arms development of the South Korean puppet clique. 
  Cho Il-min, chief of the Pyongyang mission of Hanminjon, 
distributed the white paper at a press conference on March 31. 
  To justify the anti-North fuss over the nuclear issue, the 
white paper says, the Kim Yong-sam group has misled public 
opinion by misrepresenting the pilot reactor of the North as one 
for "the development of nuclear arms". But the atomic reactors 
used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula are the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea. 
  Stating that the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor 
for nuclear arms development disguised as one for commercial 
use, the white paper says: It is a plutonium-producing reactor 
which has been introduced for the development of nuclear weapons 
in view of its purpose and structure. 
  The traitor Pak Chong-hui who had politicized nuclear arms 
development in the early 1970s made sure that a contract on the 
import of pressurized heavy water reactor was signed with Canada 
in December 1974 and the project was "pushed forward on a 
full-scale" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August 1988). 
  Nuclear experts involved in the nuclear arms development in 
those days and journalists testified: "Park Chong-hui seemed to 
have ordered the import of a heavy water reactor, because he was 
keen on developing nuclear weapons" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August 
1988), "The Wolsong heavy water reactor was imported from Canada 
to produce nuclear arms" (WOLGAN CHOSON, October 1991) and "The 
heavy water reactor is entirely intended for the production of 
plutonium" (WOLGAN CHOSON, March 1991). 
  The Wolsong heavy water reactor can change spent fuel at any 
time without stopping operation, because it is designed for the 
production of plutonium. Therefore, it is almost impossible to 
supervise it. The Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large 
amount of spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used 
directly for the development of nuclear weapons. 
  Now South Korea has stockpiled spent fuel containing ten odd 
tons of plutonium at present and the amount is foreseen to 
increase to 24 tons by the year 2000. The plutonium produced by 
the heavy water reactor in Wolsong till now since it started 
operation in 1983 is enough to make more than 370 atom bombs. 
When another heavy water reactor now under construction begins 
operation, the annual amount of plutonium output will more than 
double. 
  The white paper points out that the multipurpose research 
reactor constructed in the Taedok complex is a reactor 
exclusively for nuclear arms development under "research" veil. 
  It is disguised as one unrelated to the development of 
nuclear weapons because it uses uranium enriched to 20 percent. 
But it is, in fact, a reactor exclusively for the development 
of nuclear weapons which plays the key role in nuclear arms 
development in South Korea. 
  The Seoul regime got the "understanding" of its Washington 
master through several rounds of negotiations under the cloak of 
"research and production of isotopes". It began designing a 
multipurpose research reactor in 1985, started its building in 
1989 and completed it in 1992 in cooperation with Canada. 
  The multipurpose research reactor is not a research reactor 
for peaceful purpose but a reactor for military use which is 
used as a "diazole" in the production of nuclear arms. Its 
designing itself has been for the manufacture of nuclear bombs 
and it has opened the way for legally obtaining highly-enriched 
uranium. 
  The multipurpose research reactor can be reconstructed into 
a plutonium-producing reactor without difficulty any time. 
Though it is camouflaged as a light water reactor fueling on 
uranium enriched to 20 percent, it, in actuality, discharges 
much spent fuel containing high-level plutonium in a shorter 
time than the heavy water reactor. And it is closely linked 
with reprocessing facilities. 
  The nuclear developing team of South Korea has built 
experimental irradiation facilities along with the multipurpose 
reactor in the atomic energy institute of the Taedok complex. 
Thus, a perfect plutonium extracting system has been formed, in 
which the spent fuel of the multipurpose research reactor is 
directly reprocessed by the irradiation facilities. 
  Demanding that the Wolsong heavy water reactor and the 
multipurpose research reactor of Taedok which are totally for 
military use be destroyed, the white paper says: 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], making a 
noisy 
fuss about the pilot reactor of North Korea, turns a blind eye 
to the heavy water reactor and multipurpose research reactor for 
military purpose in South Korea whose capacity is respectively 
scores of times and several times that of the North's pilot 
reactor. The IAEA has not disclosed as yet the results of 
inspection of these nuclear facilities of South Korea. 
  The South Korean authorities are openly claiming the 
"reexamination of the joint declaration on the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula," calling for "nuclear option." This 
suggests that the South Korean authorities scheme to 
unilaterally abrogate the joint declaration adopted between the 
North and the South. 
  The South Korean authorities must give up the policy of 
nuclear arms development and declare the removal of the heavy 
water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are 
used for the production of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["Disgraceful Behavior of Flunkeyist Traitor" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam at "talks" with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa a few days ago raved that his group "has striven to 
find a peaceful solution through dialogue" with the DPRK, that 
there "is a limit to patience" and that "the young people who 
are not swayed by the sentiments of the past should take the 
lead" in "upgrading the relations" between Japan and South Korea. 
  MINJU CHOSON today brands this as a mean behavior of the 
flunkeyist traitor who tries to maintain power in league with 
outside forces, estranged from the nation. 
  The analyst says: 
  Still more intolerable is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
tried 
to completely cover up the crime-woven history of Japan, closing 
his eyes to it. 
  Last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam invited Hosokawa to Seoul 
and assured the latter that he would make a clean sheet of the 
crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean 
people in the past in reward for Japan's intensified clamor over 
the nuclear issue and cried for the "development of new 
future-orientated relationship". This time, he flew to Japan 
and flatteringly proposed it to promote from a new angle the 
"development of relations", not allowing Japan's crime-woven 
past to "affect the future." 
  The humiliating act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is an 
intolerable challenge to the unanimous demand of the Korean 
people that Japan properly liquidate its past. 
  Far from asking the past crimes of the Japanese 
imperialists, 
he voluntarily proposed that they should no more be brought 
forward. This reveals the sinister intention of the traitor, a 
pro-American stooge, to carry his anti-DPRK scheme into practice 
at any cost, with the "help" of Japan. In other words, he 
intends to inveigle Japan with the United States into the 
"international cooperation system" by all means and step up his 
treacherous acts with the patronage of his U.S. and Japanese 
masters. 
  History shows that those who committed treacheries, clinging 
to outside forces, are sure to face a stern judgement by the 
people. The destiny of Kim Yong-sam, a despicable flunkeyist 
traitor, cannot be otherwise.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Fellow countrymen who 
had defected to the northern half of Korea from South Korea gave 
their impressions. 
  Pak Hung-tal who came over to the North last year said the 
people in the North now enjoy a happy life as the dear leader 
Kim Chong-il has brought the peculiar Korean-style socialist 
system into bloom and shapes good politics centred on the masses. 
  He said: 
  "By availing themselves of the setback of socialism in some 
countries, the imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
resorting to every conceivable plot against the North, crying 
about the 'nuclear suspicion' and 'international cooperation 
system' in a bid to isolate and stifle the North. This is a 
daydream of fools. 
  "No force on earth can match the invincible might of the 
singlehearted unity of the North which is making headway under 
the banner of socialism, firmly rallied behind dear General Kim 
Chong- il." 
  Noting that dear General Kim Chong-il is the destiny and 
future of the Korean nation, a defector So Tok-su said: 
  "Socialism of the North where the entire people are 
vigorously pushing forward the socialist construction, closely 
rallied behind the dear leader, is invincible, and it is 
exerting a great influence upon the world people. 
  "Our dear leader Kim Chong-il who is steadily glorifying the 
people-centred socialism built in the North and wisely leading 
the struggle for the victory of socialism worldwide, is the 
great of great produced by heaven." 
  Cho Won-taek who came over to the North with his whole 
family 
had this to say: 
  "The dear leader, last year, resolutely smashed challenges 
of 
the enemy with his iron will and matchless grit, saving the 
nation's destiny and powerfully demonstrating the might of our 
republic to the whole world. 
  "People in the South ardently long for the socialist system 
in the North where the nation's dignity and soul are exalted, 
and heartily wish to live under the system. 
  "National reunification must be realized according to the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation at an 
early date so that the people in the South, too, may live in 
happiness under the loving care of the dear leader."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [KSDP] 
in a statement Friday declared that the Pyongyang tour of Yi 
Ki-taek, president of the South Korean opposition Democratic 
Party, must be realised unconditionally and no one must block it. 
  "At a time when the inter-Korean relations have reached an 
impasse, the visit of the president of a South Korean opposition 
party to Pyongyang will be a particularly meaningful one," he 
noted, and went on: 
  "If the visit of Yi Ki-taek to Pyongyang is realized, it 
will, no doubt, be beneficial to removing the danger of a 
nuclear war created on the Korean peninsula and finding the way 
of peace and reunification of the country by joint efforts of 
the nation. It will not be harmful either to the North or to 
the South. 
  "Yet the traitor Kim Yong-sam is opposing and blocking his 
trip to the North, arguing that it `is premature' and 
`impatience is an anathema'. This is an improper act." 
  "Kim Yong-sam once gave vent to grievances when his visit to 
Pyongyang was blocked by the former military dictatorial regime, 
after he expressed the wish as an opposition man. But now, 
seated in power, he is keeping the president of an opposition 
party from visiting the North. It is the height of perfidy and 
treachery." 
  The spokesman stated that the Korean Social Democratic Party 
would make every sincere effort to realise bilateral and 
multilateral negotiations between politicians of the North and 
the South out of the desire to promote the great unity of the 
nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea and social 
system, and achieve reunification in the 90s.

headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received]-- 
Local organisations of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in press conferences made public 
statements supporting the just stand of the DPRK and denouncing 
the perfidy of the United States. 
  The Fukuoka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in a 
statement March 28 sharply denounced the United States' 
arrogance to isolate and stifle the DPRK and the crimes of the 
South Korean puppet clique resorting to the division and war 
moves following the United States. 
  The Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in a 
statement called upon the Japanese people of broad segments to 
obtain a correct understanding of the situation and extend 
positive support and encouragement to the Korean people in their 
struggle for impartial solution of the "nuclear issue" and 
peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  The Nagano prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in a 
statement laid bare the anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S., Japan 
and South Korea, authorities charging it is an undisguised 
revelation of an attempt to obstruct the independent and 
peaceful reunification of Korea and stifle the DPRK by force.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on Russia's Proposal for Multilateral </F>
Negotiations"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA today about 
the recent proposal of Russia for multilateral negotiations for 
a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula: 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry in a recent statement proposed 
multilateral negotiations for dealing with the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  We affirmatively estimate the efforts of Russia to find a 
solution through political negotiations, opposing "sanctions" 
and pressure. But we fear that the Russian proposal for 
multilateral negotiations might complicate the matter. 
  As for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it is a 
political and military problem which should be settled between 
the DPRK and the United States first of all in view of its cause 
and its nature. 
  The U.S. authorities themselves had already admitted this 
and 
responded to DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States published a 
joint statement with the DPRK, admitted the reasonableness of 
the DPRK's proposal for a package deal and agreed to immediate 
steps of simultaneous action. 
  But the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula 
is undergoing twists and turns, without progress yet, because 
the United States, after reaching an agreement at the 
negotiating table with the DPRK, arbitrarily reversed the agreed 
points, setting unreasonable preconditions outside the 
conference room. 
  It wholly depends on the attitude of the United States how 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be settled in 
the future. 
  If Russia wants to contribute to the solution of the nuclear 
issue, it would be more suitable to the prevailing situation for 
it to exert its influence on the United States so that the 
latter may honestly implement the points of its agreement with 
the DPRK and observe the principle of impartiality, we think.

Committee of the Workers Party of Korea, at the national meeting 
of party cell secretaries held at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in 
Pyongyang on 31 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today we are holding the significant 
national meeting of party cell secretaries at a historic time 
when all the people throughout the country are vigorously 
accelerating the general march of socialism with the might of 
singlehearted unity and the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude, upholding the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song's New Year's address and the decision of the 21st 
plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. 
  During the entire period from the time when it took roots in 
the Down-With-Imperialism Union to date, our party has been 
paying special attention to strengthening party cells, firmly 
grasping it as its consistent organizational line to strengthen 
infrastructural party organizations. 
  Our party, which has hundreds of thousands of militant party 
cells, which are infinitely loyal to the party and the leader 
[suryong], has been strengthened and developed into a veteran 
and tested party that has been ever-victorious in the 
complicated and arduous struggle for pioneering a totally new 
path of socialism without knowing failure and without going 
through twists and turns and into a mighty and revolutionary 
party of chuche that has been in solid unity with the masses 
while enjoying our people's absolute trust and love. [applause] 
  All victories and successes attained in party building and 
in 
the accomplishment of our revolutionary cause under the wise 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] are a result of 
the brilliant fruition of the chuche-oriented party building 
line of our party, and the devoted efforts of party cell 
secretaries who have made the victorious advance of the 
revolution and construction dwell precisely on this. [applause] 
  The current national meeting of party cell secretaries held 
under the auspices of the party Central Committee and for the 
first time in the history of our party, as well as the history 
of the international communist movement, will become an epochal 
occasion, which further enhances the militant function and role 
of party cells in strengthening the party's might in conformity 
with the demands of the party and the developing revolution and 
in vigorously accelerating the socialist cause of chuche. 
[applause] 
  The current meeting has been attended by party cell 
secretaries from the entire party and party functionaries from 
central and local party organization--totaling some 10,600--who 
have actively contributed to building our party and to 
developing the revolution. 
  The meeting will sum up the successes and experiences 
attained thus far in party cell work under the leadership of our 
party and discuss tasks and methods to build all party cells 
into militant organizations which are infinitely loyal to the 
party and the leader [suryong], resolutely safeguard and defend 
the socialist cause, and further add luster to it. 
  Firmly believing that the current meeting, held amid the 
great interest and expectation of all party members and the 
people throughout the country, will successfully carry out its 
work on the strength of the high political zeal and active 
efforts of all participants and, thus, will become a historic 
meeting that marks a new turn in further strengthening and 
developing our party and in adding luster to the socialist cause 
of chuche, I declare the opening of the national meeting of 
party cell secretaries.

<F P=106> ["Congratulatory message" from Kim Il-song, general </F>
secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, WPK, Central Committee 
and DPRK president, to delegates attending the national meeting 
of party cell secretaries at Pyongyang Stadium in Pyongyang on 
31 March; read by Kye Ung-tae, member of the Political Bureau 
and secretary of the WPK Central Committee -- recorded] 
  [Text] Congratulatory message to the delegates attending 
the national meeting of party cell secretaries: 
  It is very significant that the national meeting of party 
cell secretaries is held at a time when our party is moving to a 
new, higher plane under the banner of modeling the entire party 
on the chuche idea and when the entire party membership and all 
the people are waging a vigorous great onward march of the 
1990's in wholehearted unity. 
  The national meeting of party cell secretaries, which is 
being held for the first time in our party's history, will 
become an important milestone to strengthen and develop our 
party to become an invincible party by enhancing the function 
and role of party cells and to further strengthen our socialist 
position. [applause] 
  I warmly congratulate the delegates to the meeting, as well 
as all the party cell secretaries of the entire party, who are 
waging a devoted struggle and are upholding our party's 
leadership with loyalty, for the strengthening and development 
of the party and for the victorious advance of the cause of 
socialism. [applause] 
  Our party is a glorious party which has been brought up with 
deep historical roots, and it is a chuche revolutionary party 
that struggles for the cause of independence of the popular 
masses with the chuche idea as its guiding policy. 
  Our party's founding and strengthening and development is 
unthinkable without the party cells -- its basic organizations. 
Because the position and role of the party cells are very 
important in party building and activities, we have consistently 
given deep heed to strengthening the basic party organizations, 
such as the party cells, since the preparations for party 
founding was made. 
  According to the policy put forth in the historic Karun 
meeting in 1930, we began the party founding work by forming the 
basic party organizations first and then expanding and 
strengthening them. Since its founding, our party has expanded 
the party ranks with advanced elements of the working popular 
masses, including workers, farmers, and intellectuals; and 
formed party cells in all places where there were party members 
and the masses, such as plants, enterprises, and rural areas. 
At the same time, we have strengthened the party cells' 
militant function in conformity with the prevailing demand at 
every stage of the development of the revolution. 
  Because the party cells were brought up strong and their 
function and role was enhanced, our party could realize the 
unity and cohesion of the party ranks based on the chuche idea 
and be strengthened and develop to be an invincible party in 
firm unity with the popular masses. [applause] 
  At a time when the historic task of realizing the modeling 
of 
the entire society on the chuche idea was put forth as a task of 
primary importance, our party made a major effort to strengthen 
the party cells in conformity with the new higher demand of the 
development of the revolution. After the national training 
course for party cells was held in 1991 by the initiative of the 
party Central Committee, a vigorous movement was conducted to 
create loyal party cells for the entire party membership under 
the slogan "Let us make all party cells into cells of loyalty," 
thus enhancing the party cells' militant function and role in an 
unprecedented manner. 
  Today, the party cells are excellently carrying out their 
noble mission and task in further strengthening our party to be 
the chuche revolutionary party and inheriting and developing the 
chuche revolutionary cause. [applause] 
  The party cell secretaries contributed to the shining 
successes of our party building and in the development of our 
revolution with their unheralded efforts and great achievements. 
The party cell secretaries have waged a devoted struggle for the 
sake of the party and the revolution with high pride and 
revolutionary self-awareness as the primary political 
functionaries of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], 
without seeking honor or reward. 
  The party cell secretaries have revolutionary faith and high 
loyalty, uphold the party wholeheartedly, look after the 
political life of the party members and working people with a 
warm, maternal feeling, and vigorously organize and mobilize the 
party members and working people to creation and exploits at the 
head of the struggle for socialist construction. I highly 
appraise the party cell secretaries for their great contribution 
to strengthening the party and realizing the party's leadership 
of the revolution and construction, and give my warm gratitude 
to the delegates to the meeting and all the party cell 
secretaries. [applause] 
  The most important revolutionary task for our party and 
people today is to defend and adhere and add luster to the 
popular mass-centered socialism of our own style against the 
challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries. The socialism 
of our country, which is built by embodying the chuche idea 
under our party's leadership, is a genuine socialism that 
conforms to the popular masses' independent aspirations and 
demands. 
  Whether we can crush the enemy's maneuvers and defend and 
adhere to the chuche socialist cause and complete this cause to 
the end depends on how we strengthen the party, the general 
staff of the revolution, and how we can enhance the party's 
leadership role. The party cells are the cornerstone upholding 
our party and a revolutionary guardpost defending our socialism. 
  The party cells are the base for imbuing the party members 
with the revolution and modeling them into the working class, a 
base for connecting the party members with the party Central 
Committee and realizing the relations of kinship between the 
party and the masses, and a base for organizing and mobilizing 
the party members and working people to the implementation of 
the party's line and policy. 
  All the party cells should be strong in order for the party 
to be strong and in order for the main force of our revolution 
to have an invincible might. All the party cells should 
smoothly carry out their function and role in order to give full 
play to the superiority and vitality of the socialism of our 
country. In strengthening the party cells is an important 
guarantee for strengthening the main force of our party and our 
revolution and firmly adhering and adding luster to our 
socialism. 
  Our party entrusts the party cell secretaries with the 
revolution's important guardpost of this magnitude. Our party's 
trust in and expectations of the party cell secretaries is very 
great, and the party cell secretaries' mission for the party and 
the revolution is very heavy. All the party cell secretaries 
should, with a high sense of responsibility and honor, make 
their party cells loyal cells that are boundlessly loyal to the 
party and militant cells that vigorously organize and mobilize 
the masses into the struggle to defend and adhere and add luster 
to the socialist cause. [applause] 
  The party cells should, above all, loyally uphold the 
unitary 
leadership [yuilchok yongdo] of the party Central Committee. 
[applause] Ensuring the unitary [yuilsong] leadership within 
the party is the fundamental principle of the party activity, 
and loyally upholding the unitary leadership of the party 
Central Committee is the foremost important duty of the party 
cells. When all the party cells become loyal cells boundlessly 
loyal to the leadership of the party Central Committee, they can 
become invincible ranks in which the entire party membership 
functions with one mind and will. 
  Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, is 
being brilliantly inherited and developed under the leadership 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il who excellently has the traits and 
natural disposition of a people-oriented leader. [applause] To 
solve the problem of inheriting our party's leadership smoothly 
in conformity with the demand of the revolution's development 
and the aspirations of the popular masses is the most proud 
success achieved in our party building. This firmly ensures the 
bright future and brilliant victory of our party and our 
revolution. [applause] 
  All party cell secretaries should continuously keep up the 
work of establishing the party's unitary leadership system. 
Party cells should unconditionally accept and thoroughly 
implement the party's line, policies, decisions, and directions, 
and should indoctrinate leader party members and working people 
to be endlessly loyal to the party's leadership. 
  Party cells should resolutely protect and defend the party 
Central Committee and struggle against all phenomena that hinder 
the party's unitary leadership. Party cells should well 
organize and guide party members' party life [tang saenghwal]. 
[applause] 
  The party life is an excellent school that raises party 
members as revolutionaries who are loyal to the party and the 
revolution. It is the party cells' primary duty to correctly 
organize and guide the party life of party members. 
  Party cells should strengthen party members' organizational 
and ideological life to make all party members endlessly loyal 
to the party and the revolution and to raise them as resolute 
revolutionaries who can unyieldingly struggle for the victory of 
the socialist cause under all stormy circumstances. 
  Party cells should enhance party members' organizational 
concept [chojik kwallyom], establish a self-conscious and 
revolutionary trait in their party life and make all party 
members participate in the party life with a sincere attitude in 
accordance with the standard of party life. 
  Party cells should normally organize and carry on the 
organizational and ideological party life, such as summing up of 
the party life and party training [tang haksup], should operate 
party meetings in orderly fashion at a high political and 
ideological level, should properly give party assignments to 
party members, and should actively help them fulfill the 
assignments. 
  Party cells should correctly organize and guide party 
members' party life in close connection with the implementation 
of their revolutionary tasks so party members can always play a 
leading and exemplary role in implementing revolutionary tasks. 
Party cells should strengthen work with the masses and firmly 
unite the broad range of masses around the party. [applause] 
  The work with the masses is the work of remolding and 
inciting [paltong] people's ideology and is important work to 
consolidate the party's mass-oriented basis and to strengthen 
the main forces of the revolution. 
  Party cells should properly work with the masses, 
indoctrinate the broad range of masses in a revolutionary way, 
firmly unite them around the party Central Committee, and 
actively contribute to strengthening the single-hearted unity of 
the entire society. 
  For the work with the masses, they should give priority to 
work with the basic masses so they can strengthen the party's 
class basis and the core forces of the revolution and can make 
the basic masses resolutely struggle for the party and the 
revolution, remembering their class status. 
  Party cells should more actively carry out work with the 
masses in various classes and strata and unite more masses 
around the party. They should also make all people indubitably 
trust our party and share their destinies with the party without 
vacillation in any trial. 
  Party cells should help organizations of the working people, 
including ones under the League of Socialist Working Youth of 
Korea, and actively agitate them to vigorously carry out work 
with the masses in accordance with each unit's characteristic. 
  Party cells should vigorously carry out the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--to effect 
constant innovations and upsurges in socialist construction. 
[applause] 
  The loyalty of the party members and workers to the party 
and revolution must be demonstrated in the practical struggle 
for revolution and construction. Workers and farmers who make 
innovations in production and construction; intellectuals who 
make valuable contributions to socialist construction with 
scientific and technological knowledge; People's Army soldiers 
who stand guard at guardposts to defend the fatherland like 
fortresses by even risking their young lives: They are people 
loyal to the party and revolution. 
  Party cells must regard the ideological revolution as their 
first and foremost revolutionary task and intensify education in 
the chuche idea among the party members and workers. We must 
make all party members and workers cherish the chuche idea as 
their firm faith and think and act as demanded by the chuche 
idea. We must prevent any alien idea or unsound life-style 
[isaekchogin sasangina pulgonjonhan saenghwal pungjodo] from 
infiltrating into ourselves. 
  We must bring all party members and workers to cherish an 
unfailing loyalty to the party, a staunch revolutionary spirit, 
an unshakable faith in socialism, ardent patriotism, and noble 
moral traits. We must also bring into fuller bloom in our 
society the beautiful communist morality of helping and leading 
each other forward and sharing weal and woe based on the 
principle of one for all and all for one. [applause] 
  Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the 
cultural revolution so that all party members and workers learn 
hard and strive to steadily improve their cultural and technical 
standards and enjoy to their hearts' content the socialist 
cultural life with rich emotional feelings and a high cultural 
attainment. 
  Party cells must strengthen organizational and political 
work 
to ensure that party members and workers accelerate the 
technical revolution and make innovations in building the 
socialist economy. 
  Party cells in the industrial sector must positively help 
our 
working class, which is in charge of the major sector of the 
people's economy, fulfill the people's economic plan by the day, 
by the month, and by the quarter and strengthen the might of the 
chuche-oriented economy without fail by highly displaying the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  Party cells in agriculture must lead our farmers to do 
farming in a scientific and technological manner as demanded by 
the chuche- oriented farming method with an attitude befitting 
masters who are responsible for the nation's granaries and, 
thus, fulfill the high goal of agricultural production set by 
the party without fail. 
  For the present the party cells in all sectors of the 
people's economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in 
building the socialist economy by effectively organizing the 
party members and workers for the implementation of the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy. [applause] 
  Party cells in the fields of science, education, literature, 
arts, public health, publications, and the press must well carry 
out work with intellectuals to ensure that they, with the honor 
of and pride in being intellectuals of a chuche Korea, 
positively contribute to building socialist culture with all of 
their creative wisdom and talent. 
  Party cells must always pay deep attention to defending the 
fatherland. 
  Our struggle for socialist construction is waged in the 
acute confrontation with the enemies. Today, the imperialists 
and their stooges are intensifying the military threat and 
provocation maneuvers against our Republic, the fortress of 
socialism, with each passing day. The party cells should see to 
it that the party members and working people heighten their 
revolutionary vigilance to cope with the enemy's aggressive 
provocation maneuvers, earnestly learn military affairs, and 
prepare themselves thoroughly in order to firmly defend the 
country's security and the gains of socialism. 
  The party cells should ensure that the party members and 
working people give full play to the traditional virtues of 
Army-people harmony and that the Army and the people are firmly 
united to firmly defend the socialist fatherland. [applause] 
  First, the party cells should loyally uphold the party 
Central Committee's unitary leadership. Second, they should 
bring up all party members to be chuche-type revolutionaries by 
effective party life organization and guidance. Third, they 
should carry out the work with the masses well in order to 
strengthen the relations of kinship between the party and the 
masses. Fourth, they should vigorously carry out the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in order 
to accelerate socialist construction. Fifth, they should firmly 
defend the security of the country and the gains of socialism. 
These are the five-point tasks the party cells should carry out 
at present. [applause] 
  All the party cell secretaries should firmly keep up the 
party cells five-point tasks and implement them thoroughly. 
Whether the party cells can carry out their function and role 
satisfactorily or not depends on the degree of preparedness and 
role of the cell secretaries. The party cell secretaries should 
be boundlessly loyal to the party so that the party cells may 
become the cells of loyalty. The party cell secretaries should 
skillfully organize work and push it ahead energetically so that 
the party cells may become cells with militant strength. 
  The party cell secretaries should become true loyalists 
boundlessly loyal to the party. [applause] The party cell 
secretaries should make their loyalty to the party their faith 
and part of their constitution. 
  The party cell secretaries should bear deep in their hearts 
the greatness of our party and the justness of the party's 
cause. They should have firm resolve to share their destiny 
with the party forever. They should wage an invariable devoted 
struggle throughout their life, unshaken in the face of any 
wind, for the sake of the party and for the victory of the 
party's cause. 
  The party cell secretaries should protect and defend the 
party politically, ideologically, and with their life with a 
firm faith that they are happy living or dead as long as they 
are loyal to our party. 
  Party cell secretaries must become the flag bearers in the 
revolution and struggle who resolutely defend the party's lines 
and policies and mobilize the popular masses into implementing 
these lines and policies. 
  Party cell secretaries must possess high revolutionary 
spirits and unwavering fidelity to the party's principles and 
class-oriented principles, carry out all work in ways beneficial 
to the party and revolution, and vigorously mobilize the popular 
masses into the struggle to implement the party's policies. 
  Party cell secretaries must take the lead in waging the 
struggle, overcome difficulties and achieve breakthroughs, and 
exert influence on popular masses and lead them by exhibiting a 
good personal example. Party cell secretaries must never 
compromise with [tahyop] phenomena that are at variance with the 
party's lines and policies and harm the interests of the party 
and revolution, but wage a resolute struggle against them. 
  Party cell secretaries must become the people's genuine 
servants who sincerely serve the people. [applause] Party cell 
secretaries must become the people's genuine servants who 
sincerely serve the people. [speaker repeats] 
  Party cell secretaries must have the correct view of the 
masses that the masters of our country and the masters of 
revolution and construction are the popular masses, boundlessly 
love and respect the people, and devotedly wage struggles for 
the people's benefits and happiness. 
  Party cell secretaries must always listen to the opinions of 
the people, share joy and sorrow with them, and resolve their 
difficulties and requests in a timely manner. 
  Party cell secretaries must not misuse their authority, hope 
for privileges, and entertain worldly desires. Rather, they 
must always lead frugal and sound lives and be cleanhanded 
[chongnyom kyonlbaek]. 
  Party cell secretaries must persistently make efforts to 
improve their political-administrative qualifications. 
  Without endlessly improving their qualifications to comply 
with the demand of the developing era, party cell secretaries 
cannot correctly organize and give guidance to the party 
members' party activities and efficiently organize and mobilize 
the party members and masses for implementing the party's 
policies. 
  Party cell secretaries must strongly arm themselves with our 
party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, entirely acquaint 
themselves with the party's lines and policies and plans, and 
have a full understanding of the party's work methods. 
  Party cell secretaries must study hard and make persistent 
efforts to strongly prepare themselves as proficient officials 
who have high political and theoretical qualifications and 
administrative experiences. 
  Party organizations of all levels must strongly build the 
ranks of party cell secretaries and positively help and lead 
them to ensure that they play their roles satisfactorily. 
  I firmly believe the delegates to the national meeting of 
party cell secretaries and all the other party cell secretaries 
of the entire party will uphold the party's leadership, 
excellently fulfill their duties, and, thus, repay the party's 
great trust and expectations without fail. [applause] 
  Kim Il-song [long applause] 
  31 March 1994 [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Cooperative fields of 
Korea are animated with spring farming. 
  The agricultural working people of South Hwanghae Province, 
a 
bread basket of the west coast, are pulling their full weight on 
sowing of seed rice on cold-beds and ploughing of paddy and 
non-paddy fields, true to the highly important teachings given 
by the great leader President Kim Il-song when he met 
agricultural officials of the province in March last year. 
  The great leader visited co-op farms in Yonan, Paechon and 
Chongdan Counties of the province in August that year, went out 
to fields and indicated ways of more successful farming, 
acquainting himself with the number of ears per pyong [one pyong 
is six feet square] and the number of grains per ear. 
  Always concerned for the development of agriculture of the 
country and the happiness of the people, he has made tireless 
trips of on-the-spot guidance to rural communities since the 
liberation of the country. He conversed with farmers and 
discussed farming with them at the edge of a field in a valley 
in a chilly breeze of early spring, at a patch of a paddy field 
under a scorching sun in summer and at a humble farmhouse till 
late at night in winter. 
  In Korea the chuche method of farming was created, a new 
agricultural guidance system was established and theses on the 
socialist rural question was published. The great leader put 
them forward by consummating the will of the peasants while 
giving on- the-spot guidance to rural villages. He published 
theses on the socialist rural question in February 1964 and has 
made uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance for its 
realization. Not minding a muddy road of the countryside on a 
rainy day, a road through the marsh of the tideland and a steep 
mountain, he called on agricultural working people and converted 
all the land of the country including the Kindung plain of 
Hwangju, Singyemiudung and the Paekmu plateau which had been 
forsaken as a barren land and tideland-turned fields on the west 
coast into fertile soil. 
  He unfolded a bright prospect of rural construction at a 
cooperative farm on the west coast, drawing a map of the 
village. At a workteam of a farm at the foot of Mt. Kuwol he 
indicated ways for the comprehensive mechanization of 
agriculture. 
  Last year, he guided the work of the countryside, traveling 
hundreds of kilometres to northernmost Yonsa County, North 
Hamgyong Province, and Paekmu plateau in Yanggang Province, 
tideland-turned fields and Kwail (fruit) County on the west 
coast and the Yonbaek plain adjacent to the Military Demarcation 
Line. 
  Indeed, our countryside which was a pronoun of backwardness 
and poverty in the past has been turned into a modern socialist 
countryside good to work and live in under the wise guidance of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song.

Wonhwa cooperative farm, Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province. 
  A meeting took place on the farm on March 29 to convey them. 
  The speakers at the meeting noted that the care shown by

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held 
here on March 30 on the lapse of ten years since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il called for a new revolutionary turn in 
publishing and printing. 
  Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, in his report said the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il on March 31, 1984, that is, ten years ago, 
elaborated on the need to effect a new revolutionary turn in 
publishing and printing to meet the requirement of the 
developing revolution in which the whole of society was being 
modeled on the chuche idea. 
  "Receiving the highly important words of the dear leader, 
the 
Workers' Party and people of Korea became able to accelerate the 
revolutionary cause with redoubled vigor by enhancing the 
militant function and role of the the press with a mighty 
ideological and theoretical weapon for developing the 
revolutionary press suited to the nature of the socialist 
society," the reporter noted. 
  He said the dear leader has directed primary efforts to the 
strengthening of the leadership of the party over publishing and 
printing, which is vital to the development of the press and 
success of publishing activities. "As a result, our press has 
been able to invariably maintain its revolutionary character and 
successfully fulfil its mission and duty as a mighty ideological 
weapon powerfully arousing all the party members and working 
people in the accomplishment of the socialist cause, the cause 
of the party," he stressed. 
  Referring to the fundamental improvement of publishing and 
printing over the past ten years under the wise guidance of the 
dear leader, he stressed: "All these achievements clearly prove 
the validity and vitality of the words of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il on effecting a new revolutionary turn in 
publishing and printing." 
  Outlining the tasks arising in publishing and printing, the 
reporter said the officials and working people engaged in 
publishing and printing must imbue the composition and contents 
of the publications with the chuche idea and issue more 
publications conducive to an active ideological education for 
bringing the greatness of the party home to the party members 
and the working people and further strengthening the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.

<F P=106> [By John McBeth in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Nearly 18 months after influential Research and 
Technology Minister B.J. Habibie bought much of the East German 
navy in a post-Cold War garage sale, the ships have begun 
arriving at a Surabaya naval base. But Indonesia's Defence 
Ministry insists it still doesn't know what the final price tag 
will be for the ships or what happened to the extras that were 
initially included in the package. 
  Typically, the answers appear to lie at the office door of 
Habibie, whose involvement in defence procurement goes back to 
1980 when he convinced President Suharto that nurturing a set of 
strategic industries with a high technological component was 
crucial to accelerating and sustaining Indonesia's 
industrialisation process. A key part of the plan was to turn 
the navy and air force into a captive market for the state-owned 
PT PAL shipyard and aircraft-maker, Industri Pesawat Terbang 
Nusantara (IPTN). 
  Over the past two or three years, Habibie has gone one step 
further and secured the final say in the purchase of almost all 
major armaments. Leaving aside the loss of lucrative 
commissions that once ended up in armed forces' coffers, the 
heavy role played by the civilian Habibie in military 
procurement has rubbed many an Indonesian general, admiral and 
air marshal the wrong way. Says one analyst: "If you're trying 
to develop a force structure and you're always being told to buy 
this or that, then you'll always be having to rationalise what 
that structure is going to be." 
  The difficult relationship between Habibie and members of 
the 
military leadership has taken on new relevance in recent years: 
Habibie's political influence has been rising at the same time 
as some of the military's most influential political figures 
have been effectively sidelined. Habibie was appointed in 1990 
to lead the Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI), an 
Islamic revivalist group. 
  Many senior officers see the ICMI as a potentially dangerous 
counterweight to their own influence and a vehicle which could 
be used to support a possible Habibie bid for the presidency 
when Suharto, his life-long acquaintance and mentor, finally 
leaves the scene. In the past 12 months, Habibie has acquired 
valuable political experience by playing an important 
behind-the-scenes role at the assembly which extended Suharto's 
term as president and at the five-yearly congress of the ruling 
party Golkar. 
  While Habibie has upset military leaders numerous times over 
one issue or another, the purchase of East German warships 
initially had the support of both then-Defence Minister Benny 
Murdani and navy chief Adm. Muhammad Arifin. The two men soured 
on the deal, however, in the final months before it was 
consummated. 
  Acquired from the Germans for only US$12.7 million -- but 
carrying an initial refurbishment estimate of US$640 million -- 
the 16 Parchim-class corvettes, 14 Frosch-class landing ship 
tanks (LST) and nine Kondor-class minesweepers are trickling 
into Surabaya under a delivery schedule that will extend into 
next year. Four of the corvettes, one LST and all of the 
minesweepers have arrived so far. 
  A senior Defence Ministry source said the cost of the refits 
"will depend on the components to be put in by Habibie," but he 
indicated the final figure could be as much as US$200 million 
below the original estimate. Savings have been made by limiting 
the work done in Germany's Peenewerft (corvettes) and 
Neptunwerft (LSTs) shipyards, where labour costs are higher. 
  The source also sought to play down navy unhappiness over 
the 
purchase. "The conflict is between the Ministry of Finance and 
Habibie," he told the REVIEW. "Of course, if the total budget 
is amortised through our defence budget, then there will be a 
problem." This stems in part from the actual side of the Defence 
Department's annual budgetary allocation which, at Rps [rupiahs] 
1.1 trillion (US$511 million) works out at only 1.5 percent of 
GDP -- the lowest in the Asean region. 
  Defence officials say the navy will pay for the ship 
refurbishment on an installment basis, starting with the 1995-96 
budget. They describe Habibie's initial estimates as "planning 
figures" and say they have been kept in the dark about the 
status of the additional US$338 million he sought to tack on to 
the package for the upgrade of navy shipyards a new port at 
Teluk Ratai on Sumatra's southern tip, and two new tankers. 
  Some military observers point to the fact that the average 
cost of US$20 million per ship is small compared with prevailing 
market prices. But others are sceptical about the long-term 
prognosis for a military already over-burdened with different 
systems. The critics also note that while the deal may provide 
PAL and its recently expanded facilities with much needed work, 
it offers virtually nothing in terms of new technology. 
  The 1,200-tonne corvettes are a major acquisition for a 
small 
navy built around 16 Dutch, United States and British-built 
frigates, nine fast patrol craft and two attack submarines. 
Similar to the Russian Petya or Risha-class patrol vessels, the 
corvettes carry twin, 57-millimetre and 30-millimetre guns, four 
torpedo tubes, two antisubmarine mortars and two SA-N5 
surface-to-air missile launchers. 
  The major problem for Indonesian naval officers is that 
each corvette has three engines and a propulsion system they 
have never worked with before -- and for which they have had to 
buy all available spare parts. The minesweepers, delivered last 
October, are in poor shape and most probably will serve out 
their life on coastal patrol duties. 
  The 1,950-tonne LSTs may be the best buy for a navy with an 
important role in nation-building. During any one year, the 
navy is required to show the flag at all of the country's 165 
ports. Much of that duty falls to the fleet's 30 assorted 
landing ships, cargo vessels and coastal oilers which are used 
to supply outlying islands and to move gear for civic action and 
public works projects. 
  While Arifin, the navy's top officer, initially went along 
with the deal, the same sentiments were apparently not shared by 
other senior officers, among them current navy chief Adm. Tonto 
Kuswanto, the then-commander of the Eastern Fleet. And even 
proponents of the deal had a change of mind when it became 
apparent how much would have to be spent on the refurbishments 
and on Habibie's list of extras. 
  "In the end, they were all told it was a done deal and to 
shut up and make it work, says one military source. "Navy 
chiefs look at it askance. They're going to use the ships, but 
they think they've been `had' by Habibie because they weren't 
really involved." Said another source: "They don't like what 
happened and they don't like the expense, but they do need the 
ships to protect Indonesia's outer extremities." 
  More than any of the three services, the navy seems to have 
been the most put out by Habibie's schemes. In 1984, for 
example, PAL was given the job of repairing 18 navy ships. When 
the shipyard said it would be unable to handle one of the 
vessels -- an LST requiring a new engine and communications gear 
-- it gave the Defence Ministry the go-ahead to get the vessel 
repaired in Singapore instead. 
  Former officers say the LST was halfway through the refit in 
Singapore when Habibie complained to Suharto that the navy was 
not utilising PAL. Although it would have cost US$450,000 to 
break the contract, a furious Murdani, then armed forces chief, 
ordered the cancellation of the whole project. Suharto 
subsequently rescinded the order because of the advanced stage 
of the refit, but Habibie made few friends out of the episode. 
  In the mid-1980s Habibie may have learned a costly lesson 
about market research when he sought to parlay the purchase of 
six high-speed hydrofoils into a deal with Boeing to build as 
many as 100 of the 40-knot craft under licence at PAL. The plan 
fell through when the navy refused to have anything to do with 
them because of their high fuel consumption and problems posed 
by the unusual amount of flotsam in Indonesian waters. 
  Two of the hydrofoils were later bought by a privately 
owned, 
passenger-ferry operation, but the other four gathered rust at 
PAL until late last year when the navy finally agreed to take 
them on to their books for troop-carrying and search and rescue 
work. One in fact has recently been seen around the disputed 
Sipadan and Ligitan islands, located just off the east coast of 
Borneo island. 
  Navy relations with Habibie reached such a low ebb in 1986 
that the fleet air arm embarked on a programme known as 
"Turbo-express" to re-engine and lengthen its five ageing C47 
transport planes rather than replace them with new IPTN-built 
CN235 turboprops. "That is an indication," says one source, "of 
the lengths they were prepared to go to avoid being a captive 
audience for Habibie." 
  As concurrent head of the Agency for Strategic Industries 
(BPIS), which groups together, PAL, IPTN and eight other 
concerns, Habibie supervised the early 1980s decision to buy 
100,000 Belgian FNC assault rifles which, along with the 
U.S.-made M16 and the Russian AK47, is one of three standard 
infantry weapons now spread through vanous units of the 
271,000-strong Indonesian armed forces. 
  Under a seven-year, transfer-of-technology arrangement, the 
first 25,000 rifles were to be made in Belgium and the last 
5,000 at PT Pindad, a munitions manufacturing company under the 
BPIS umbrella. But sources intimately involved with the deal 
claim that after four years, when army inspectors began looking 
into the transfer of the assembly line, they discovered far too 
much had been paid for the initial batch of rifles. 
  In the mid-1980s, Habibie caused further consternation by 
proposing to establish a factory for British Scorpion light 
tanks. At the time the plan was mooted, it was already clear 
there would not be a regional market for the vehicles. 
Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and New Zealand had 
bought Scorpions, or as many as they were going to -- and almost 
a decade later, manufacturer Avis is still actively trying to 
sell the tank to the Indonesian army.

  [Text] Reportedly, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
prepared his own original ideas, such as clarifying the 
additional spending for public works projects, to formulate an 
outline of the market-opening package that was adopted by the 
government on 29 March. Obtaining cooperation from Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa tried to persuade the 
ministries and agencies concerned, including the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF], to accept the ideas. Because of opposition by 
bureaucrats, however, it is said that Hosokawa was forced to 
give up all of his ideas and to delay formulating a program. 
This was disclosed by a government source. It seems that the 
prime minister's leadership will be tested again before 
formulating the final measures in June. 
  According to the source, the prime minister reportedly 
firmed 
up his original ideas while listening to the opinions of 
nongovernment figures -- including Yotaro Kobayashi (chairman of 
Fuji Xerox Co.), who acted as chairman of the Japan-U.S. 
businessmen's meeting, which was held in February immediately 
after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  It is said that the prime minister firmed up his intention 
about 13 March to include the following macromeasures in the 
package: 1) adding 100 trillion yen to the public investment 
plan; 2) announcing a cut in income and resident taxes to be 
extended beyond 1995; and 3) reducing the current-accounts 
surplus to 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the 
future. 
  The source said that Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister; Hiroshi Kumagaya, minister of 
international trade and industry; and other ministers supported 
the prime minister for a while. However, the MOF opposed the 
public investment and tax cut plans because nothing had been 
decided about obtaining alternative sources of revenue. As for 
the self-imposed goal of reducing the surplus, the Economic 
Planning Agency and other ministries changed their minds and 
took a negative stand toward this. 
  On 24 March, the prime minister asked Chief Cabinet 
Secretary 
Takemura to visit the nine ministries and agencies to persuade 
them to support the prime minister's intentions. However, the 
attitude of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] toward Takemura was cold. A top MITI official complained 
and said, "Does the prime minister think that the issue will be 
settled simply by the chief cabinet secretary making a round of 
visits?" 
  After this incident, close associates of the chief cabinet 
secretary quickly changed their minds and began to express 
negative opinions, saying, "It seems that the United States does 
not want us to carry out an additional increase in public 
investment." 
  After all, the government decided on 29 March to delay 
making 
decisions on increasing public investment and continuing tax 
cuts. The government barely managed to include in the package a 
plan to reduce the current-accounts surplus to 2.8 percent of 
GDP. 
  Reportedly, an MOF source bragged: "Members of the Prime 
Minister's Office were reluctant to give up on their ideas. You 
can understand how the Prime Minister's Office was isolated." 
However, this series of recent events unexpectedly revealed the 
fact that the prime minister was at the mercy of the bureaucrats 
of MITI and the MOF. President Clinton once said that Japanese 
bureaucrats "control Japanese politics."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Need To Work Out Substantial Market-Opening </F>
Measures"] 
  [Text] Japan's 13-year-old voluntary restraint on 
automobile exports to the United States was a symbol of economic 
friction with the United States. The restraint will be finally 
abolished. 
  Now that car exports have decreased due to the yen's 
appreciation and local production of automobiles overseas has 
increased, there is no need to continue the self-restraint on 
car exports to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry 
has made a remarkable recovery. This indicates the end of the 
era in which Japanese industry can enjoy an overwhelming victory 
in the world market. 
  From now on, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry 
[MITI] should make additional efforts to adopt trade policies 
based on multilateral trade rules. The economic circle also 
should once again keep this fact in mind that its 
economic-growth strategy centering on one-sided exports will not 
last long. 
  The United States has begun calling for Japan's "voluntary 
expansion of imports" in place of the voluntary restraint on 
auto exports. It has demanded that Japan increase imports by 
setting targets as it did so under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor 
Agreement. In the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations, the 
country has made such demands in the three individual sectors, 
including automobile and auto parts. 
  The U.S. demands seem to be desirable as compared with the 
voluntary export-restraint which artificially curbs exports 
because the U.S. demands will promote an increase in bilateral 
trade. However, this can be applied only in the case where Japan 
purchases cheap, good-quality products and parts. If the two 
countries try to increase dealings forcibly by going to the 
length of setting targets in trade talks, there will be 
distortions in economic activities. 
  While Japan needs to make efforts to increase imports by 
improving existing regulations and practices which constitute 
import barriers, as well as by expanding domestic demand, it has 
to reject unreasonable demands. 
  When viewed from this standpoint, some devices can be noted 
in the "package of external economic measures" compiled by the 
government. For example, the government has proposed that 
procedures be improved in government procurement to facilitate 
entry of products of foreign companies into the Japanese market 
and that methods be introduced to follow up on results of the 
entry of foreign products in three individual sectors. 
  However, the package only says that a conclusion will be 
made 
by about June on a program to increase public works 
spending--which was cited as a means to maintain domestic demand 
for the midterm--as well as tax system reform. Concrete 
measures to ease regulations were not spelled out in the current 
package. 
  Meanwhile, the package of external economic measures was 
influenced by government's conventional idea of emphasizing 
administrative instructions. While various automakers 
voluntarily announced their plans to increase the purchase of 
foreign auto parts, the government welcomed their plans. 
Nevertheless, the word "voluntarily" is in name only. It has 
been reported that MITI and politicians exerted a strong 
behind-the-scenes influence on automakers. 
  The auto parts purchase plans were worked out by the private 
sector. However, if automakers fail to achieve their goals 
after setting numerical targets, the United States may use the 
failure as an excuse for slapping sanctions on Japan. Moreover, 
there is a fear that hardliners in the United States, who 
believe Japan does anything if pressure is exerted, will gain 
the upper hand after they notice that while the Japanese 
Government is advocating deregulation in public, it has 
continued behind-the-scenes administrative intervention in 
industry. 
  In various aspects, relations between Japan and the United 
States are in the transitional stage. To establish a truly 
mature relationship between the two countries, the tense 
situation will be unavoidable for the time being. Prime 
Minister Hosokawa made a daring decision and said "No" to the 
U.S. demand for setting numerical targets in trade talks. The 
government must take a logical attitude in anticipation of a 
certain tension in the bilateral relations. 
  What is imperative for the government is to come up with 
substantial market-opening measures by the end of June. These 
measures will help consumers receive benefits through such 
factors as an increase in cheap imported goods. 
  Based on figures in official economic forecasts, the 
government stipulated in the current package that the ratio of 
Japan's current account surplus to its gross domestic product 
has been decreasing since fiscal year 1992 when the ratio 
reached its peak. However, what is important is not to indicate 
figures but to root in Japan a system in which fluctuations in 
the exchange rate connect with an decrease in exports and an 
increase in imports. 
  Although the current package of external economic measures 
is 
not a satisfactory answer to the United States, the ball has 
been thrown back to the U.S. side. It is hoped that the United 
States will receive the ball and resume the new economic 
framework talks. If the United States has any dissatisfaction, 
it should express it in the venue for the framework talks.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 1 Apr (AKP) -- Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia, has voiced his support for a statement by 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] protesting against 
the Thai Army's repatriation of Cambodian refugees to another 
zone of the Khmer Rouge. 
  Actually, the prince asserted his endorsement of the UN 
stance following his return from Thailand where he paid a 
two-day visit at the invitation of Thai counterpart Prasong 
Sunsiri. 
  UNHCR High Commissioner Mrs. Sadako Ogata, in a message to 
the Thai diplomacy chief, expressed her anxiety over the 
repatriation by the Thai Government of 25,000 Cambodian refugees 
to another Khmer Rouge-held zone, instead of regions controlled 
by the Royal Government of Cambodia. 
  The Khmer Royal Armed Forces on 19 March took control of 
Pailin, the "capital" of the Khmer Rouge, prompting an influx of 
25,000 Cambodian refugees, most of whom were Khmer Rouge 
families, into Thai territory. Thailand has lately begun to 
send those people back to a Khmer Rouge-held area at Phnum Malai 
hill, 45 km north of Pailin.

  [Text] The Senate approved on final reading a bill that 
will allow the liberalized entry of foreign banks in the 
Philippines before the chamber adjourned for the Lenten Season 
recess. The measure was certified urgent by Malacanang 
[presidential office]. 
  Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies, stressed that 
liberalization would allow the Philippines to join the global 
economy and give the country access to foreign funds development 
and opportunities opened by present international market 
conditions. 
  "When the whole world is making the globe smaller; when 
NAFTA 
is being organized; when the European common market have become 
one; when ASEAN is trying to assert its proper leadership in the 
economic development of the Pacific Area, are we in the 
Philippines going to be alone and be left behind by all these 
developments?" Roco said. 
  The approved bill (Senate Bill 1606), entitled "An Act 
Liberalizing the Entry and Scope of Operations of Foreign Banks 
in the Philippines," allows a total of six foreign banks to 
enter the Philippine banking system within a period of five 
years to foster greater competition in the industry. The 
president may recommend two more banks. 
  In the bill, foreign banks will be allowed to enter through 
any one of the three modes namely: 
  -- By acquiring, purchasing, or owning up to 60 percent of 
the voting stock of an existing bank; 
  -- By investing up to 60 percent of the voting stock of a 
new 
banking subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the 
Philippines; or, 
  -- By establishing branches with full banking authority. 
  Foreign banks will be allowed to bring in not more than 
three 
branches with a capital requirement of P [Philippine pesos] 300 
million. For every branch in addition to the three 
(sub-branch), P50 million shall be added to the permanently 
assigned capital. Assigned capitals shall be inwardly remitted 
and converted into Philippine currency. 
  Roco stressed that foreign banks that would establish 
branches in the Philippines would give the country access to 
global resources of the mother company. "That is principle of 
the liberalization." 
  Apart from increasing competition, Roco added that 
liberalization would equalize ownership in Filipino banks. At 
present, Filipino groups can only own 20 to 30 percent, while 
foreigners can own up to 40 percent. The bill contains a 
provision that allows a foreign bank or a Philippine corporation 
to own up to 60 percent of the voting stock of only one domestic 
bank or a new banking subsidiary. 
  One of the guidelines for approving a foreign bank 
application is ensuring that reciprocity rights are enjoyed by 
Philippine banks in the applying foreign banks' country. The 
Monetary Board, which is the approving body, is given other 
guidelines such as: 
  -- Ensuring geographic representation; 
  -- Considering strategic, trade and investment relationships 
between the Philippines and the country of incorporation of the 
foreign bank; and, 
  -- Study the demontation for financial innovations and 
stability in a competitive environment of the applicant. 
[sentence as published] 
  Only those among the top 100 banks in the world or the top 
three banks in the country of origin shall be allowed to enter. 
  He said it was time for the Philippine banking industry to 
share the profits with the Filipino people. At present the 
banking industry, despite being the most profitable in the past 
15 years, gave only 3 or 4 percent interest in deposits while 
charging 20 to 23 percent interest in borrowing. 
  "The liberalization will foster greater competition in the 
banking industry in attracting depositors," said Roco.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has issued a statement on the 
repatriation of 25,000 displaced Cambodians who fled the 
fighting into Thailand. The statement says Thailand provided 
assistance to the Cambodians by giving them temporary shelter on 
humanitarian grounds, hoping that once the situation in Cambodia 
returned to normal and was safe these people would return home 
quickly. 
  Subsequently, from 15-27 March the Thai Government sent 
these 
Cambodians back to their own country via Ban Saptari, Soi Dao 
District, Chanthaburi. The repatriation was the same as the 
action previously taken by the Thai Government and complied with 
the wishes of the Cambodians, who wanted to return to safe 
areas. Moreover, the Thai Government absolutely would not allow 
any armed group to enter Thai territory. The Thai Government 
(?is ready) to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees and other international organizations in transiting 
Thai territory to assist these suffering Cambodians in their own 
country. 
  On this issue, the Thai Government has appealed to the UNHCR 
to consult with the Cambodian Government on establishing a safe 
zone in Cambodia for Cambodians fleeing the fighting in their 
country. 
  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong informed Prince 
Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, of Thailand's position during the latter's 28-29 March 
official visit to Thailand. The Thai Government hopes the 
international community understands its actions in this matter. 
Thailand had to shoulder the burden caused by displaced 
Cambodians for over 13 years, and it does not want such a burden 
again. The Thai Government has tried to implement its policy on 
this issue by taking both its international responsibilities and 
international interests into consideration.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
reacted calmly Friday to a U.S. report naming Japan as guilty of 
unfair trade practices and renewed a call for a breakthrough in 
the stalled bilateral trade negotiations. 
  "As a whole, the report is harsh on us, but it does not mean 
it automatically leads to a unilateral action from Washington," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. "We do not have to swing from joy to sorrow on each 
item listed as a trade barrier," the top government spokesman 
added. 
  On Thursday, the U.S. Government issued an annual report 
accusing Japan and scores of other countries of maintaining 
trade barriers against U.S. goods and services. The thrust of 
this year's report on foreign trade barriers centers on 
obstacles the U.S. says Japan has erected against foreign goods. 
  The report, which serves as the basis for possible 
unilateral 
action by the U.S. Government against its trade partners, lists 
43 trade barriers in Japan under seven industry categories. 
  Takemura also reiterated hopes for an early resumption of 
the 
deadlocked "framework" trade talks, with Tokyo taking necessary 
steps to further open its markets to foreign competition as 
pledged earlier this week. 
  The bilateral trade negotiations collapsed at the summit 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton on February 11 due to a gulf over a U.S. demand for 
setting numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's 
markets. 
  The United States posted a record 59.3 billion dollar trade 
deficit with Japan in 1993, according to U.S. Commerce 
Department figures. 
  Japanese Finance Ministry figures put Japan's 1993 surplus 
in 
trade with the U.S. at 50.19 billion dollars. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kishichiro Amae criticized 
the U.S. trade document at a press conference later in the day. 
  Amae said he thinks the U.S. trade document was published 
before the U.S. studied the outline of Japan's external economic 
reform measures hammered out earlier this week. 
  "For example, all the items concerning government 
procurement 
of telecommunications and medical devices can be added in that 
list. A sufficient response to the contents of those items has 
already been described in the outline," he said. 
  He also touched on a reference in the U.S. document which 
said "it is apparent that Japanese barriers form a heavy burden 
on the world trade system and that the Japanese economy is more 
highly controlled and regulated than any other." 
  "Any such approach using `Japan as unique theory' is 
fundamentally unfounded and is a major problem in terms of the 
important relations of trust between Japan and the United 
States," Amae said. He said Japan considers it important to 
"make steady progress" on what needs to be done by June and seek 
a breakthrough in the framework talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister 
voiced hope Friday [1 April] that this year's U.S. report on 
foreign trade barriers will not lead to sanctions against Japan. 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also 
suggested at a press conference that Japan would bring its case 
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the world 
trade body, if the U.S. used the report as a basis for imposing 
trade sanctions. 
  Japan was among 39 countries and trade blocs the U.S. 
Government quoted as unfair traders in its annual trade barrier 
report published Thursday. The report lists 43 trade barriers 
in Japan under seven industry categories. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a separate 
press meeting that Japan should "not be now glad, now sad" with 
the annual report. "It is only a reference for the U.S. in 
specifying (unfair traders) at the end of September," he said. 
Washington plans to draw up a list of "priority" countries that 
will be subject to "Super 301" trade measures. 
  Hata also indicated that Japan has no fresh plans to allay 
the growing U.S. frustration with its trade deficit with Tokyo. 
He said Japan will focus on drafting macroeconomic measures 
which the market-opening package unveiled earlier this week 
suggested will be drawn up by June.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets on 30 March again 
staged a joint air war exercise for Northward aggression. 
  This war exercise, which included ground force support, air 
strikes, long-distance airlifts, and surprise attacks was 
carried out in the skies above Pyongchang, Yangpyong, Oeyon 
islet, and Muju as the operational stage. 
  F-16 nuclear-loaded fighter bombers, pursuit-assault planes, 
electronic jamming planes, which were mobilized from overseas 
bases, and more than 380 various military airplanes from the 
U.S. Air Force in South Korea and from the puppet Air Force, 
were mobilized. 
  This war exercise, staged frantically under the support of a 
EA-6 electronic jamming airplane, was a dangerous playing with 
fire designed to promote actual combat capabilities for 
cooperative surprise attack [hyopdong kisuptagyok siljon 
nungryok] for a Northward aggression, together with airplane 
wings deployed in U.S. bases in Japan and the Pacific, and 
airplanes from the 7th U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and 
from the puppet Air Force. 
  KC-135 refueling airplanes, which flew in South Korea from 
overseas bases timed to coincide with this war exercise, 
refueled scores of airplanes that ran amok with air war 
exercises by making shuttle flights between Taehuksan Island and 
Kyongyolbi Yolto. 
  C-141 and C-130 transport planes airlifted large aggressor 
Armed Forces from U.S. bases in the Pacific to the U.S. air base 
in South Korea. The airlifted troops and lethal weapons were 
deployed in operational zones. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets frantically ran 
amok with exercises of a Northward war of aggression on the 
ground, in the sea, and in the air, under the U.S. imperialists' 
instigation. 
  On 30 March, the South Korean puppets deployed hundreds of 
armed hooligans and scores of armored vehicles in the area 
adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] near Konan-ri, Piari, 
Yanggu county, South Korean Kangwon Province in the eastern 
sector of the front. In addition, they mobilized and deployed 
large-caliber artillery units in Hoengsan-ri, Yonchon County, 
Kyonggi Province in the western sector of the front. 
  That day, the puppet 105-mm artillery unit, occupying fire 
positions in Mayong-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon 
Province and in Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, 
fired about 70 artillery shells at an area near the DMZ by the 
Military Demarcation Line. The armed hooligans of the puppet 
Army, occupying combat positions in Chungsa-ri, Yonchon County, 
indiscriminately fired some 800 bullets from large-caliber 
machine guns, thus displaying war hysterics. 
  About 10 transport planes of the puppet Army, which flew in 
the air above Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province that day, created a 
bloodthirsty war atmosphere by dropping commando troops one 
after another, and the wings of armored helicopters and 
transport helicopters, which were mobilized in the air above 
Paju, Pochon, and Yonchon in Kyonggi Province, ran amok with 
airlifting war supplies to commando operations. 
  Fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and observation 
planes of the puppet Army, which were mobilized in the air above 
the sea off Kunsan, also ran wild with marine attacks and 
landing support. 
  The military airplanes, which participated in various air 
war 
exercises staged in the air above South Korea against the 
Northern half of the republic on 30 March, alone numbered as 
many as some 600 planes. 
  The war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets, which are becoming more grave with each passing 
day, clearly demonstrate how recklessly the rascals are running 
amok to crush our Republic with armed forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's vice minister of 
defense said Monday [4 April] Tokyo has no evidence that North 
Korea possesses nuclear weapons as suggested by Washington. "We 
cannot confirm this," Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference 
referring to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remarks in a 
Sunday NBC program that North Korea has already built two 
nuclear weapons. 
  Asked whether he believes that Pyongyang's new mid-range 
missile capable of reaching most of Japan can be used with 
nuclear warheads, Hatakeyama said he would not rule out such a 
possibility "in the future." 
  "At the present stage, however, all we can say is that this 
would be rather difficult," the vice minister said.

problem to a peaceful resolution. In a speech to an 
international forum, Owada said the major powers must have 
cooperative ties to maintain international order in the 
post-Cold War era. 
  A good example, he said, is the cooperation of China in the 
standoff over North Korea's refusal to allow full international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  Commenting on Japan's bid to become a permanent member of 
the 
U.N. Security Council, Owada said the focus should be on how 
Japan can aid the United Nations in maintaining global order 
rather than on simply winning permanent membership of the 
Council as a symbol of its powerful status.

  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who arrived in 
Tokyo today after completing a visit to the United States, held 
talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Hata. They decided that 
the two nations will continue efforts for a solution to the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. 
  The foreign ministers of two countries shared the view that 
for North Korea to resolve its nuclear issue through 
negotiations, North Korea should first accept the nuclear 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
should respond to North-South dialogue, and that China is 
playing an affirmative role for a change in the North Korean 
attitude. 
  During the talks, the foreign ministers of two nations 
shared 
the understanding that in the event that North Korea refuses 
IAEA nuclear inspection in defiance of the statement by the UN 
Security Council president, hard-line countermeasures, including 
UN applied sanctions, will be inevitable. Thus, it is likely 
that the two foreign ministers discussed concrete measures for 
sanctions. 
  At the same time, Foreign Ministers Han Sung-chu and Hata 
agreed to work out promptly the follow-up programs discussed 
during the ROK-Japan summit last month, including the plan to 
support permanent repatriation of Korean compatriots in Sakhalin. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will meet with Japanese Prime 
Minister Hosokawa tomorrow and will explain to him the result of 
the ROK-PRC summit and joint measures on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, which were discussed between the ROK and the 
United States during his visit to the United States.

<F P=106> [By Chong Pyong-chin from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] ROK and Japanese Foreign Ministers Han Sung-chu and 
Tsutomu Hata held talks at the latter's office on the afternoon 
of 3 April to discuss specific ways to cooperate in resolving 
the North Korean nuclear issue now that a statement of the UN 
Security Council's [UNSC] president has been adopted. 
  The two countries' foreign ministers shared the view that 
North Korea should respond positively to the UNSC president's 
statement no later than mid-April since the statement urges it 
to allow additional inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] before the end of this month, and they 
decided to cooperate in urging China to persuade North Korea. 
  Reminding his counterpart of the remark made by Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa during the recent ROK-Japanese 
summit, that "Japan will join UN sanctions against North Korea 
within the scope allowable by law," Minister Han requested that, 
while continuing to make efforts for dialogue with North Korea, 
Japan consider controlling its trade with North Korea, 
restricting the amount of money being sent to North Korea by 
Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang association of Koreans in Japan, 
and prohibiting North Korean ships from calling on Japanese 
ports in case North Korea does not observe the UN statement. 
  Regarding Minister Han's request, Minister Hata said that he 
would try to persuade North Korea to the utmost in cooperation 
with China to denuclearize the Korean peninsula in a peaceful 
way and that he would carefully consider the sanctions against 
North Korea suggested by Minister Han. 
  On 4 April, Minister Han will also call on Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to explain the ROK Government's position on the UNSC 
president's statement and to discuss international cooperative 
measures in preparation for the case in which North Korea, 
despite the UN decision, does not allow the IAEA to conduct 
additional inspections.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 3 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu agreed Sunday 
that China has a vital role in resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hata and Han 
commended the U.N. Security Council for leading China to back 
its statement urging North Korea to accept unimpeded inspections 
of its nuclear facilities, the officials said. 
  The foreign ministers gave "positive appraisal" to the 
statement adopted unanimously on Thursday by the 15 member 
states of the U.N. Security Council, they said. The statement 
of Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France was 
adopted after the United States dropped its bid to have the 
Security Council adopt a binding resolution. 
  It urged North Korea to allow International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspectors to complete an uncontrolled check of 
its nuclear facilities, while expressing concern that an IAEA 
team was barred from inspecting a radiochemical laboratory 
earlier this month. 
  After the Security Council members agreed to comply with 
Chinese demands to eliminate any language about sanctions, 
China, North Korea's traditional ally, agreed to endorse the 
mildly-worded, nonbinding statement. 
  The two foreign ministers confirmed their intention to 
monitor how the North will respond to the Security Council's 
demand to have it accept unhampered inspections within a month, 
the officials said. 
  Han will hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 
Monday before flying back to Seoul from a three-country trip to 
help solve the nuclear proliferation issue, they said. Before 
flying to Tokyo, Han sought cooperation from both the U.S. and 
China.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's foreign 
minister sought Japanese help Sunday in allaying fears of war on 
the Korean peninsula raised by North Korea's nuclear program. 
Han and his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata discussed recent 
developments concerning North Korea and agreed they should give 
diplomacy another chance to solve the nuclear crisis, South 
Korean officials said. Han came to Tokyo after high-level 
consultations with U.S. officials in Washington. He briefed 
Hata on overall discussions during their private meeting and at 
dinner. 
  Expressing concern over various side effects caused by the 
impression of danger in South Korea, such as a visible decrease 
in foreigners' investment activities, Han requested Tokyo's help 
in painting an accurate picture. He emphasized that no special 
military movements have been detected on the North Korean front. 
  Both foreign ministers gave positive marks to the U.N. 
Security Council presidential statement urging Pyongyang to 
allow further nuclear inspections, noting China's active 
participation in the process. Han called for a 
Seoul-Tokyo-Washington alliance in dealing with Pyongyang's 
nuclear program and a Chinese role in applying pressure on North 
Korea, the officials said. 
  While Han and Hata talked about pressing North Korea, they 
took note of the mid-May "deadline" for the Stalinist state to 
accept further nuclear checks. Until then, the foreign ministers 
agreed to carry on with diplomatic efforts, the officials said. 
  "I have emphasized to Japan that South Korea and the United 
States have neither any intention nor need to take a new 
initiative right now," Han told reporters after his meeting with 
Hata. "South Korea and the United States decided to keep our 
doors open and resume dialogue efforts when the opportunity 
arises," said Han. 
  If the U.N. Security Council did decide to push for economic 
sanctions against North Korea, Japan's support would be critical 
to the embargo's effectiveness. Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang 
organization in Japan, is believed to send 600 million to 800 
million U.S. dollars annually to North Korea. Successfully 
severing this money line would have serious repercussions for 
Pyongyang, and Foreign Minister Han sought Tokyo's help if such 
action was needed, according to the officials. 
  Han was to call on Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa Monday 
morning before returning to Seoul.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu agreed 
Monday [4 April] that China must play a larger role in 
encouraging North Korea to remove suspicions about its nuclear 
program. Hosokawa told Han that China's role will be crucial in 
tackling growing threats arising from Pyongyang's alleged 
nuclear weapons development program, a Foreign Ministry official 
said. 
  The premier also spoke of the need to seek cooperation from 
Beijing in persuading Pyongyang to allay international concern 
that it is developing nuclear weapons capability at its 
facilities in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the capital, the 
official said. China is North Korea's last major ally. 
  During the 35-minute meeting, Han remarked that China 
appears 
ready to play a more active role than before, the official said. 
  Han told Hosokawa that in addition to close contact among 
Japan, the United States and South Korea, the roles of China, 
Russia and other members in the UN Security Council will be 
important in helping resolve the issue. On Sunday, Han agreed 
with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that China has a 
vital role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  They also confirmed their intention to monitor how Pyongyang 
responds to the UN Security Council's call for it to accept full 
inspections of its suspected nuclear sites. 
  The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a 
statement urging North Korea to allow the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete checks of its nuclear 
facilities. The IAEA had reported that it was not allowed to 
carry out certain measures at a North Korean radiochemical 
laboratory. 
  After emerging from the session with Hosokawa, Han declined 
to reveal exactly what he discussed with the premier on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear program. "I cannot make a simple 
statement now," he said. 
  Han will return home later Monday at the end of a 
three-country trip to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Before flying to Tokyo, he visited China and the U.S. to seek 
cooperation on the issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The government plans to 
send Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to a ministerial meeting of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakech, 
Morocco, from April 12 through 15, the chief cabinet secretary 
said Monday [4 April]. 
  Masayoshi Takemura told reporters Hata will have an 
opportunity for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor about ways to reopen stalled trade negotiations between 
Japan and the United States. "We hope this will provide us a 
chance to achieve a breakthrough," Takemura said. 
  Takemura denied a news report that Japan and the United 
States will have unofficial talks as early as this week aimed at 
breaking the stalemate in bilateral trade negotiations. "We 
haven't decided on such a specific plan," he said. 
  Takemura also said that Tokyo will continue to seek a 
breakthrough in the stalled "framework" trade talks with 
Washington while carrying out a market-opening package announced 
last month. 
  The bilateral trade talks have been deadlocked since 
February 
11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a U.S. demand for 
numerical targets to gauge the openness in Japanese markets. 
  A Japanese newspaper reported Sunday that Japan will send a 
senior official to Washington as early as this week to hold 
unofficial talks in hopes of breaking the impasse over the trade 
negotiations.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Political parties and 
organizations collected tax-free political funds totaling 158.3 
billion yen during 1992 from local backers, an 8.7 percent drop 
from the previous year, according to a government report 
released Saturday [2 April]. 
  The funds raised by 53,818 political parties and supporting 
groups across the country represented a decline of some 15.1 
billion yen from 1991, when the amount hit a record 173.4 
billion yen, the Home Affairs Ministry said in its report. It 
was the first time in five years that political funds fell below 
the year before, it said. 
  Combined with national-level political funds, the total 
revenue stood at 332.3 billion yen, down 7.5 percent from 1991. 
  The local-level total expenditure, meanwhile, stood at 156.2 
billion yen, bringing the combined expenditure at 328.5 billion 
yen, a 7.6 percent decline from the previous year. 
  Ministry officials attributed the primary cause of the drop 
to the sharp decrease of funds collected by the then ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as well as the economic 
recession after the bursting of the speculative "bubble economy" 
in the early 1990s and a growing momentum toward political 
reform. 
  The ministry compiled the report after political parties' 
local chapters and political organizations declared their 
fund-raising balance of payments to local election management 
committees. 
  Of the amount, political parties collected 66.7 billion yen, 
down 5.7 percent from the previous year, while 617 organizations 
raised 3.6 billion yen in fund-raising parties, an increase of 
75.8 percent over 1991. 
  The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) topped the list at 29.8 
billion yen, followed by the LDP at 22.4 billion yen, the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) at 7.1 billion yen, Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] at 4.0 billion yen, the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP) at 3.3 billion yen and the United Social Democratic 
Party (USDP) at 200 million yen. 
  Although many of the major parties registered increases of 
funds over the previous year ranging from 1.6 percent of the SDP 
to 24.8 percent of Komeito, the LDP recorded a sharp decrease of 
18.0 percent, or about 4.9 billion yen, the report said. 
  The LDP, currently the leading opposition party, was active 
to raise funds in 1991 to prepare for the House of Councillors 
elections the following year. 
  The JCP, another opposition party, also suffered a 1.1 
percent drop. 
  The coalition's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and new 
party 
Sakigake [Harbinger], two LDP breakaway parties which were 
founded in June 1992, were not covered. 
  Another coalition bloc, the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, did not report such funds. 
  Of the 47 prefectures, Tokyo outshone the other prefectures 
at 18.5 billion yen, followed by Osaka at 11.5 billion yen and 
Aichi Prefecture at 8.2 billion yen and Kanagawa Prefecture at 
7.2 billion yen. 
  The ministry released a report last September on political 
funds that central offices of political parties and 
organizations collected in 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange 
said Monday [4 April] it will impose a fine of 21 million yen on 
Kankaku Securities Co. for its involvement in dubious stock 
trading deals in violation of securities rules. 
  The Japan Securities Dealers Association also announced a 
decision to order the second-tier brokerage house to pay a fine 
of 36 million yen for violating securities rules. It is the 
third time for the exchange and the association to punish 
Kankaku Securities for improper dealings. 
  In the latest case, Kankaku Securities was fined for its 
involvement in a questionable practice known as "tobashi" 
between 1990 and 1991 and pledging to compensate clients for 
investment losses between 1985 and 1991. The brokerage is also 
accused of improperly compensating clients over investment 
losses. 
  "Tobashi" is a term for transactions involving the temporary 
transfer of stock that has lost value from one client to another 
in an attempt to cover up the first client's losses. 
  In the latest case, the Finance Ministry has already ordered 
Kankaku Securities to suspend operations in its corporate 
division for 10 days.

Hosokawa told business leaders Monday [4 April] he hopes that 
debates on the 1994 fiscal budget up for Diet approval will be 
expedited, his aides said. Hosokawa made the remark during a 
morning meeting with business leaders, including Eiji Suzuki, 
former head of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations

  The executives expressed concern that a delay in debates on 
the budget will affect economic recovery, the officials said. 
  The business leaders also urged Hosokawa to make clear the 
government's stance [on] macroeconomic measures, such as tax 
cuts in years beyond fiscal 1994, which began Friday, and an 
additional appropriation for public works projects, they said. 
  Other business representatives at the meeting included 
Shoichiro Toyoda, next president of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations, Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, Nikkeiren Chairman Takeshi Nagano and 
Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Corporate 
Executives.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The government paid out 
2,163.0 billion yen more than it received against the private 
sector in fiscal 1993, up 9,321.3 billion yen from year-earlier 
net receipts of 7,158.3 billion yen, the Finance Ministry said 
Friday [1 April]. The large net payments reflected a series of 
pump-priming measures, sluggish tax revenues and increased net 
payments in foreign exchange funds, a ministry official told 
reporters. 
  As for the latest reporting month of March, the national 
coffer posted net payments of 2,874.9 billion yen, down 687.3 
billion yen from the same month a year earlier. 
  In the fiscal year that ended just Thursday, tax revenues 
came to 55,032.1 billion yen, down 2,978.5 billion yen from a 
year earlier, stemming from the weak economy, the official said. 
  Covering the sluggish tax income, bond issuance rose 4,862.5 
billion yen to lift overall revenues by 1,917.8 billion yen to 
66,966.8 billion yen. 
  Net payments resulted as general-account expenditures rose 
2,569.7 billion yen to 45,969.8 billion yen, the special account 
increased 3,612.6 billion yen in net payments to 18,995.0 
billion yen, and foreign exchange funds marked net payments of 
3,836.2 billion yen, up 5,142.6 billion yen from the previous 
year's net receipts of 1,306.4 billion yen. 
  Reflecting the economic stimulus packages in particular, 
spending on public works climbed 1,933.6 billion yen to 6,075.6 
billion yen, a special account for the ministry's trust fund 
bureau decreased 1,115.0 billion yen in net payments to 5,588.7 
billion yen, and government-backed financial institutions posted 
net payments of 4,915.0 billion yen, up 3,220.6 billion yen. 
  The net payments in foreign exchange funds apparently 
stemmed 
from dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the 
yen's sharp rise, and the ministry official said the figure is 
the largest since 1986 when net payments came to 4,350.6 billion 
dollars. 
  The official said March public works spending and 
disbursement from the Trust Fund Bureau and public financial 
institutions remained steady for the month, in line with the 
third supplementary budget enacted in February to fund large 
chunks of the latest 15 trillion yen stimulus package. He cited 
the small year-on-year decline in overall net payments despite a 
full 2,073.5 billion yen increase in bond issuance. 
  For the month of April, the ministry projected 4,134.0 
billion yen in net payments, down 2,507.5 billion yen from 
year-earlier net payments of 6,641.5 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The government, alarmed by 
a host of plans to raise public utilities rates, plans to curb 
such moves, government officials said Friday [1 April]. This 
was decided at a ministerial meeting in response to a request by 
Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota that rate hike moves 
be screened carefully by the ministries concerned. 
  Kubota said rate hikes should be restrained particularly at 
a 
time when the domestic economy is showing signs of recovery, 
adding that the government should lay down a "unified view" 
regarding the range and timing of rate increases. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi urged the government to 
make clear its stance on the matter, the officials said. 
  Local pay telephone call rates went up Friday along with 
medical charges. Public housing, highway and subway 
corporations have announced plans to raise charges in the near 
future. An advisory panel to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
cautioned last week against indiscreet public utilities rate 
hikes. 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told an afternoon 
news conference that the government will study proposed hikes in 
public utilities rates in line with the expected consumer price 
rise of 1.5 percent for fiscal 1994. 
  "The government should make efforts to prevent easy rate 
hikes from leading to the rise in overall consumer prices," the 
top government spokesman added. 
  Takemura said the government will draw up, possibly next 
week, a unified view on a host of plans to raise public 
utilities rates.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno remained cautious Monday [4 April] about 
suggesting an economic recovery is under way, although he said 
some bright signs have emerged. 
  Since the beginning of this year, some indicators in 
consumption and production have pointed to improvements in 
business activities, Mieno said in an opening address to a 
three-day quarterly meeting of the central bank's branch 
managers and overseas representatives. But "final demand as a 
whole" still remains stagnant, as shown by declining corporate 
capital investment, and a further careful watch is necessary to 
see if those bright signs are sustained and spread to lift the 
economy, Mieno said. 
  Mieno said personal consumption is showing signs of 
"stopping 
falling and recovering," and production is expected to increase 
in the January-March quarter after posting a sharp decline in 
the previous quarter. Under these circumstances, corporate 
sentiment is regaining stability, he said. 
  Ongoing inventory adjustments and the spreading effects of 
past fiscal and monetary measures as leading to these 
improvements, he said. [sentence as received] 
  There is also a possibility, however, that they might have 
stemmed from special window-dressing efforts by companies ahead 
of the book closing last Thursday for fiscal 1993, the central 
bank chief said. 
  Mieno also pointed to continued downward pressure on the 
economy from ongoing corporate restructuring efforts to cope 
with the yen's sharp appreciation over the past year, as well as 
asset deflation after the collapse of the economic bubble of the 
late 1980s. 
  On monetary policy, he said the central bank will continue 
carefully monitoring economic and financial-market developments. 
In this connection, the easing of credit so far is contributing 
to form the basis of macroeconomic recovery by facilitating 
corporate restructuring, Mieno said. 
  Short-term market rates are moving at low levels, although 
long-term market rates have risen recently from year-earlier 
levels because of the evaporation of "excessive market hopes" 
for lower rates late last year, he said. 
  Mieno said the financial authorities must push forward 
deregulation and other measures in capital markets to back up 
efforts by companies to restructure and by financial 
institutions to liquidate bad loans. He said "utmost use" of 
markets is important to facilitate various adjustments and to 
put the economy into a sustainable growth phase without 
inflation. 
  Bank of Japan branch managers from 33 domestic branches and 
three overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on 
the economic conditions of their respective areas and to confirm 
monetary policy. 
  Attention is fixed on whether the three-day meeting will 
lead 
the central bank to paint a brighter economic picture. At the 
previous meeting, the branch managers spelled out a recovery in 
corporate sentiment. 
  Mieno will hold a press conference Wednesday to wrap up the 
meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Police raided the office of 
a rightist group Saturday [2 April] in connection with the 
arrest of two of its members who held two ASAHI SHIMBUN 
executives hostage at the paper's headquarters in Tokyo the 
previous day. Police searched the office of the "Taihi-kai" in 
Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, after the arrests of its members 
Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29. 
  Uchiyama and Furusawa were arrested Friday evening after 
holding Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the paper's 
public relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head 
of the secretarial department, for nearly six hours in an 
executive reception room on the 15th floor. The two men were 
armed with a handgun, a sword and carried four sticks of 
dynamite, police said. 
  The rightists surrendered and released the two hostages 
unharmed after police and the group's chairman, Kazuo Nakadai, 
urged them to abandon their mission, police said. 
  Aragaki told reporters at the headquarters Saturday morning 
that the two men repeatedly demanded during the hostage drama 
that newspapers and television networks report their point of 
view. He said he rejected their demands. 
  As the pair broke into the building, they passed out 
pamphlets describing the country's mass media as a "Class A war 
criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to "amend the tone of 
its news coverage." The pamphlets also criticized Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for refusing to retract a statement 
apologizing for Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he 
termed a "war of aggression." 
  "(It) was an unusual situation but I did not feel any fear 
because it didn't seem like they would hurt us," Aragaki said. 
  Aragaki said he told the two men as he was being released 
that "(Japan) is a democratic society, so why don't we debate?" 
He said Uchiyama replied, "we were reluctant to act like this 
but it was our choice of life." 
  On October 20 last year, Shusuke Nomura, 58, then leader of 
the group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a 
meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of 
a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated 
with the ASAHI SHIMBUN.

  [Text] U Myint Maung, the son of U Maung Htin of 11th 
Street, Einme, Irrawaddy Division, and the officer in charge of 
agriculture, forests, and environmental protection in Dr. Sein 
Win's exile group, entered Kawthaung, Myanmar [Burma] from 
Thailand on 26 March and returned to the legal fold. U Khine 
Saw Tun, the son of U San Tun Aung of the Lamadaw area, 
Kyauktaw, Rakhine State; a member of the Central Committee of 
the ALP [Arakan Liberation Party], an Arakan armed organization 
in the jungle; and joint secretary of the Information Committee 
of the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] in the jungle, 
returned to the legal fold in Yangon [Rangoon] on 29 March. 
  U Myint Maung joined the National League for Democracy in 
December 1989. He took part in the election held in May 1990 
and was elected as a representative of constituency-2 in Einme 
Township, Irrawaddy Division. He went underground in Manerplaw 
in December 1990 and was made the officer in charge of 
agriculture, forests, and environmental protection in Dr. Sein 
Win's exile group. He returned to the legal fold because he was 
unhappy with the unfairness of the jungle groups and the 
one-sided decisions made by their leaders. 
  U Khine Saw Tun went underground in 1988 and served as a 
reserve Central Committee member of the ALP, an Arakan armed 
organization, and a central committee member of the National 
United Front of Arakan, NUFA. He also served as joint secretary 
of the Information Committee of the Democratic Alliance of 
Burma, DAB, and was in charge of the central office. He 
traveled to Germany in 1991; Bangladesh and Germany in 1992; and 
Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Switzerland, and 
France in 1993. On these trips he attended constitutional 
meetings and other political meetings. It has been learned from 
responsible personnel that he returned to the legal fold because 
he became discouraged during his visits to many foreign 
countries by the attitudes and unrealistic dreams of the groups 
that are opposed to Myanmar and refuse to review and understand 
the truth and ongoing changes taking place in Myanmar.

extracts of proposal papers read by 11 delegates from the group 
representing elected representatives -- six from political 
parties and five independents. 
  The proposal paper belonging to the elected representatives 
of the National League for Democracy [NLD] is read by four NLD 
representatives. Dr. Thein Lwin reads first. Addressing the 
chapter heading on the state, he quotes the Western definition 
of a state. He says: "Myanmar [Burma], a nation composed of 
national races, shall be established according to democratic 
practice under a federal system." He proposes the nation be 
called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. 
  U Tun Aung, alias U Tun Tun Hein, elected representative 
from 
Shan State's Nawnghkio constituency, continues reading the NLD 
report. He quotes a Western constitutional expert and a 
political scientist on the essence of a country's constitution 
and democracy. He says: "In prescribing self-administered 
zones, special care must be taken not to divide the country into 
many segments, so that a Yugoslavia-type situation does not 
arise in the country. Therefore, it will be necessary for 
national races from regions concerned and the entire people to 
have identical outlooks and desires." 
  Next, U Saw Oo Rei, elected representative from Kayah 
State's 
Phru-so constituency, continues reading the NLD report. 
Addressing the issue of state structure, he says: "The 
democratic and correct method is for the ruled to elect their 
rulers freely and fairly." He then quotes a political scientist 
on the need for national races to coexist peacefully. Quoting a 
philosopher, he says everyone likes to participate in the 
process of determining their destiny, and people are 
increasingly less willing to follow orders dictated by others. 
He says ethnic races that have been fighting each other for 
many years are now holding talks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that 
Israel and the Palestinians have likewise reached an agreement. 
He also cites similar events in Mozambique, Angola, South 
Africa, and Mexico. He then cites remarks by British and 
Singapore leaders on the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian 
peace accord. He notes that in Burma, the government and the 
armed organizations are also holding talks to find a solution 
for the country. He says: "There are good prospects for 
internal peace. It is normal practice among nations to hold 
talks to solve internal and external problems." 
  Continuing, U Saw Oo Rei says: "The basic foundation of 
democracy is self-help and self-determination. In other words, 
it is the appointment of a people's government elected by the 
people for themselves." He then refers to a quotation by 
President Suharto calling for management of development by the 
people themselves. Quoting political philosophers, he explains 
that "the declaration of one's intention to practice democracy 
tomorrow without practicing it today is meaningless" and that 
"the wishes of the voters constitute political sovereignty." 
  Next, U Hla Min, elected representative of Tenasserim 
Division's Kawthaung constituency, continues reading the NLD 
report. Addressing the chapter heading on the president as head 
of state, he says one vice president is enough and that the 
president should be elected by representatives duly chosen by 
the people and should be made responsible to the Union 
Parliament. He says it is the NLD's view that "the people of 
Myanmar have never experienced the presidential system of 
government. It is a very new system. The people -- who have 
only experienced the parliamentary democracy system -- are well 
aware of this system's good and bad lessons. It will be 
beneficial for the country to take the good lesson and reject 
the bad lesson." 
  Continuing, U Hla Min says the presidential system of 
government should ensure it has a good beginning and should take 
into consideration the country's political stability, economic 
development, and progress in education and technology. He also 
points out the need for national unity, internal peace, the 
prevalence of law and order, economic stability, and a 
disciplined and responsible populace. He says it is especially 
necessary to promote democracy and the Lokapala [universal] 
principles of justice, liberty, and equality. He says it is 
also important to ensure that the three sovereign powers that 
stem from the people are delegated to the people's 
representatives. 
  The session recesses at 1120. 
  When the plenary session resumes at 1220, U Sai Hsaung Hsi, 
alias Nelson, and U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, read the proposal 
paper of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD]. 
  U Sai Hsaung Hsi, representative from Shan State's Kyaukme 
constituency, reads first. Referring to the principles 
contained in Article Five on prescribing "self-administered 
areas to national races other than those national races who have 
been granted the status of state or region" if they meet 
population and territorial requirements, he voices his 
difference of opinion. He says: "Shan State has always existed 
as a state, and it did not achieve statehood through a grant. 
Shan State joined the Union under the Panglong Treaty." 
  He says it is the SNLD's view that even national races who 
already have state status "should be able to claim the status of 
autonomous region with administrative autonomy, or national area 
with cultural autonomy" if they meet population and territorial 
requirements. For instance, he says, the Bamah [Burman] do not 
have a region or state despite their status as a major race. 
Under the present rules, Bamah nationals can claim 
self-administered areas. He says the constitution must be clear 
and its provisions must not be contradictory. He says, 
therefore, the constitution should not include the phrase "other 
than national races who have been granted state status." 
  Next, U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, elected representative from 
Shan State's Kyaukme constituency, reads the second part of the 
report. Referring to self-administered zones, he says the 
criteria for granting self-administered status should be uniform 
and that the phrase "other than national races who have been 
granted state status" should not be included in the constitution. 
  He then cites the existence of Karen communities living 
outside Karen State and Mon communities living outside Mon 
State. He proposes a "Tai Lian State or self-administered zone 
for Tai Lian nationals living in upper Sagaing Division and 
lower Kachin State." He concludes the report by reiterating the 
SNLD's proposals. 
  Next, U Hla Maung, an independent from Karen State's Kya-in 
Seikkyi-1 constituency, reads his report. Bureau records show 
he was elected as a representative of the deregistered Patriotic 
Old Comrades League. He proposes that the state be organized as 
a union with the existing seven divisions and seven states, 
which will all be called states. He proposes that the 14 
states, with equal status, retain their original names. 
  On the issue of the head of state, he says the president 
should be the head of state and should be elected through an 
electoral college. He proposes constitutional restrictions on 
the government to prevent autocracy and the revival of absolute 
monarchy. He proposes that Parliament, where national 
sovereignty lies, be elected by the people. He proposes the 
electoral college, which elects the president and vice 
president, be formed of representatives of the two chambers of 
Parliament. 
  The plenary session recesses at 1400 after U Khin Maung Cho, 
an independent from Kayah State's Dimohso constituency-1, reads 
his report. Bureau records show he was elected as a 
representative of the deregistered Kayah State Nationalities 
League for Democracy. No extracts of his report are given. 
  U Tun Hlaing, an independent from Rangoon Division's Bahan 
constituency-1, reads his report when the plenary session 
resumes at 1500. Bureau records show he was elected as a 
representative of the deregistered Democracy Party. He explains 
the differences between the definition of the state and the 
government, saying: "The state is a permanent entity while the 
government is a temporary institution that changes from time to 
time." He explains: "State power belongs to the citizens, who 
are the real owners of state power." He says that because 
citizens enjoy the benefits of the state, they should serve the 
interests of the state and should not oppose or betray it. He 
defines government as "an entity that accepts the power 
entrusted to it by the citizens and administers for the 
development of the state. Citizens may or may not like the 
government's policy. Citizens have the right to openly speak, 
write, and protest about what they like and dislike according to 
democratic practices. A government that is not in accordance 
with the wishes of the majority of citizens cannot have a 
genuine mandate. Only if these basic principles are clear can 
the basic principles be laid down in the constitution." 
  He says the following basic principles should be enshrined 
in 
the constitution: "Myanmar is a sovereign independent state; 
the sovereign power of the state lies with the citizens; all 
powers stem from the citizens; and citizens shall enjoy social 
justice, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of 
belief, freedom of worship, freedom to earn a livelihood, 
freedom of organization, freedom of action, and equality before 
the law, without discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or 
class." 
  He says he has previously proposed that the "prime minister 
is the best head of state for the country; I do not believe a 
president with full executive powers is best and I do not like 
the election of a president through an electoral college. If 
the majority supports a president with full executive powers, 
though, I will have to abide by their decision according to 
democratic practice." 
  Continuing, U Tun Hlaing explains that he considers it 
appropriate, as proposed by the work committee chairman, to have 
two groups of members from the two chambers of Parliament elect 
the president. He explains it is appropriate to have the 
participation of national races and elected representatives in 
national construction tasks, and perhaps members of the Defense 
Forces, depending on the circumstances, although it should not 
be stated in the constitution that members of the Defense Forces 
will participate. He says: "I believe it will be appropriate 
for the two chambers of Parliament to elect the president 
without the participation of representatives of the Defense 
Services." He says that in addition to the qualifications 
stipulated for members of parliament, a provision should be 
added requiring the president to have a university degree. He 
explains that because the head of state will have to interact 
with other countries, the head of state should be well versed in 
international law and politics. The head of state must also be 
well respected by the general public. He believes these 
qualifications will best serve the interests of the nation and 
its citizens. 
  Next, U Tun Kyaw, an independent from Shan State's Namhsan 
constituency, presents his report. Bureau records show he was 
elected as a representative of the Ta-ang Palaung National 
League for Democracy. He proposes that the chapter on the state 
should say: "The Republic of Myanmar is a nation where national 
races live collectively." 
  Addressing the state structure, he recalls how the Ta-ang 
Palaung took up arms after their demands for self-determination 
were ignored before and after independence. He says: "During 
the current period of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, the Ta-ang Palaung have given up the armed struggle" 
and have worked on local development schemes. He says the 
Ta-ang Palaung national leaders and people welcome the National 
Convention and the peace agreements with nine other national 
races. 
  Continuing, U Tun Kyaw calls on the national races who have 
obtained the status of regions and states as well as those who 
have not obtained this status to cooperate with magnanimity in 
prescribing self-administered areas. He then proposes that a 
Ta-ang self-administered division be granted. The territory 
should be based on Namhsan in northern Shan State with Namtu in 
the east; Kutkai and Namhkam in the north; western Hsipaw and 
Kyaukme in the south; and parts of Momeik and Mogok in Mandalay 
Division in the west. He also proposes that Kyaukme and part of 
(Mong Gaw), Namtu, and (Man Tong) be upgraded as townships and 
formed into two districts and prescribed as a Ta-ang 
self-administered division. 
  He then discusses the appointment of the president and vice 
presidents, saying: "In accordance with the three Lawkapala 
principles -- liberty, equality, and justice -- and to allow a 
member of the national races to be one of the three vice 
presidents, a principle should be stipulated that allows for the 
appointment of a Shan national -- not a Bamah -- as a candidate 
for vice president in the upper chamber, with equal 
representatives from the regions and states." 
  Next, U Aung Thein, an independent representative from Shan 
State's Ywangan constituent, reads his report. Addressing the 
state, he proposes that the principles "the Republic of Union of 
Myanmar is a genuine democratic state" and "the Republic of 
Union of Myanmar is a social state" should be added to the 
fundamental principles. 
  Continuing, he proposes that Kalaw, Pindaya, Ywangan, and 
Yatsawk in Southern Shan State and Naungcho in Northern Shan 
State be prescribed as a Danu self-administered region. He then 
cites a book on Burmese cultures in explaining the areas 
inhabited by the Danu national people. 
  Addressing the head of state, he says: "As our president 
will have full authority to exercise administrative power, the 
two vice presidents will become figureheads. They will become a 
burden to the country." That is why those who are elected by 
the three organs responsible for appointing the president and 
vice presidents should be called presidential candidates rather 
than being directly designated as vice presidents. He says that 
whichever of the three presidential candidates gets the largest 
number of votes in the Union Parliament should become president 
and the one who gets the second largest number of votes should 
become vice president. He believes it would be suitable for the 
situation in the country. He then says the selection of a 
president will be in accordance with democratic principles and 
will show honor and respect for the people. He concludes his 
proposal paper by reading basic principles on the qualities of 
the president. 
  After the presentations, Alternate Chairman U Tin Maung 
explains the work remaining to be carried out. In his 
explanation, he notes that since 23 March various delegate 
groups have presented 53 proposal papers at the National 
Convention Plenary Session. He says the Panel of Chairmen has 
to review and analyze all of the proposals in order to give 
explanations on every point at the upcoming plenary session. 
Therefore, the Panel of Chairmen hopes to hold the next plenary 
session on 5 April. In conclusion, he says the Panel of 
Chairmen will inform the delegates of the exact date of the next 
plenary session before 5 April. 
  The session concludes at 1650.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
hopes for greater flow of investments from Swedish companies 
into this country, especially in the field of high technology. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed conveyed this message to 
his Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt during an hour-long meeting 
at the Prime Minister's Department here Monday. 
  Dr. Mahathir hoped Bildt's visit, the first by a Swedish 
prime minister, would further boost trade between both 
countries, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters 
after the meeting. 
  Bildt and his four-member delegation arrived here Sunday for 
a three-day official visit aimed at enhancing bilateral ties. 
  Abdullah, who was present during the meeting, said both 
prime 
ministers agreed that the current good bilateral relations would 
provide greater encouragement to expand economic relations and 
to increase trade activities between the two countries. 
  Bildt invited Dr. Mahathir to visit his country and see for 
himself the business opportunities available there, he added. 
  Abdullah said the discussions centred on the situation in 
their respective countries and also in East Asia. 
  Dr. Mahathir also explained to Bildt Malaysia's Vision 2020 
to become a developed country and the country's success in 
fostering close relations among its multi-ethnic and 
multi-religious people. 
  Bildt was impressed with the political stability in Malaysia 
and the country's sound economy, he added. 
  The Swedish prime minister said Vision 2020 was an 
inspiration for him and his country, Abdullah said. 
  Bildt was confident that the vision would pave the way for 
more Swedish investments in Malaysia, he added.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said press freedom does not 
mean that people can tell lies and if the Britain press take the 
liberty of telling lies, they must be ready to face the 
consequences. Speaking at a [name indistinct] interview program 
aired by the British (?ITV) network today, the prime minister 
said Malaysia's decision to ban British companies from getting 
new business contracts may be reviewed but such a decision is 
not within his authority. 
  Malaysia imposed the ban following British media reports 
saying Malaysian Government leaders received kickbacks from 
British companies. The ban, which also annulled all business 
agreements, caused British companies to lose billions of ringgit. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the end of his visit to 
Sabah, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the federal government had no 
intention of pressuring the Sabah state government when it made 
its decision to rotate the chief minister's post among the three 
main ethnic groups. The move is purely designed to prevent 
undesirable actions by some people. [Mahathir's recording 
indistinct] 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir also talked about tourism in Sabah.

  [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has 
urged the people of Sabah to discard parochialism. They should 
regard themselves as Malaysian in equal terms with people in the 
other states. Speaking at a gathering in Kota Kinabalu, the 
prime minister said the spirit of solidarity is important for 
the people to discard any feelings of alienation. Everyone in 
the country enjoys the same rights, including holding top posts 
regardless of the state of origin, community, or religion. 
Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir added that federal government 
supervision of the new Sabah administration is necessary to 
ensure that the abuses of past governments do not recur. The 
supervision is not deemed as colonizing Sabah but to make sure 
that the state is administered well.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Cabinet today approved the 
draft amendments to the Constitution which allows for the 
setting up of the Court of Appeal and a code of ethics for 
judges. 
  Law Minister Syed Hamid Albar said several other draft 
amendments to the Constitution were approved, including the 
appointment of judicial commissioners, clarifying the practice 
of constitutional monarchy and the appointment of a Chief 
Justice for the Court of Appeal. 
  He said the amendments would be tabled in Parliament in 
April 
or May. 
  With the setting up of the Court of Appeal, there will be 
three levels of higher courts -- the High Court, Court of Appeal 
and the Supreme Court. 
  Syed Hamid said this would enable the country to have a 
three-tier system. 
  "Any judge who is qualified for the High Court will be able 
to sit in the Court of Appeal," he said, adding that there would 
be a panel of judges for the court. 
  He said the Chief Justice for the Court of Appeal would be 
appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong [Paramount Ruler]. 
  Syed Hamid was speaking to reporters at his office after the 
weekly Cabinet meeting. 
  On the code of ethics, Syed Hamid said the Cabinet had 
approved a new provision to Article 125(3) of the Constitution. 
  "The new provision will allow for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong 
to prescribe a code of ethics which should be observed by 
judges." 
  Syed Hamid said the code of ethics would cover the 
performance and duties of the judges in terms of their honesty 
and integrity. 
  "Any judge who breaches the code of ethics will have action 
taken against him including being dismissed from his post," he 
said, adding that the Lord President [Chief justice of Federal 
Courts Malaysia] would decide if any judge had breached the code. 
  The public had a right to details about the code of ethics 
as 
it would be a step towards creating a better public image for 
judges. 
  Syed Hamid also said the Cabinet had approved the 
substitution of the word "misbehaviour" in Article 125 with "any 
breach of the code of ethics". 
  "The Cabinet has also approved that the word `advice' in 
Article 40 of the Constitution be defined to avoid 
misunderstanding," he added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: `The Ball Is in Myanmar's Court'] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent three-day 
visit to Myanmar [Burma] must rank as one of the more 
significant development for that country in its efforts to 
rejoin the world community. For 26 years to 1988, Myanmar had 
shut out the world and attempted to pursue a self-sufficient 
"Burmese Way to Socialism. But it realised eventually that 
ideological purity does not translate readily into the material 
progress a country and its people need, and Myanmar has in the 
last few years been crawling out of its hermit shell. But the 
world, particularly the West, has not rolled out a welcome-back 
mat. Instead, regular efforts are made at the United Nations to 
get the world body to condemn Myanmar and decree sanctions 
against it for its repressive political regime and human rights 
abuses. Singapore and its ASEAN neighbours believe, however, 
that "constructive engagement" rather than the cold shoulder 
will yield better results. The way to get Myanmar onto the path 
of democracy is to encourage it as it takes tentative steps into 
the free world. And the carrot is foreign investment, for this 
is what Myanmar's leaders know they need -- and need very badly 
-- to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure and economy. 
  Myanmar is trying very hard to lure investors and visitors. 
Where previously foreigners would be lucky to get a 24-hour 
visa, Myanmar has now thrown open its doors. Visitors are 
coming in increasing numbers, but the passenger traffic at 
Yangon's [Rangoon] airport is nothing like that at airports in 
Vietnam and China, the other socialist states now embracing the 
capitalist way of life. One reason is the intense competition 
for foreign funds from not only these emerging economies of 
China and Vietnam, but also countries like Indonesia and India. 
These places offer more attractive investment incentives than 
Myanmar. And many a businessman exploring Myanmar's potential 
has been put off by the red-tape, the lack of infrastructure, 
and its most unrealistic foreign exchange rate. Many investors, 
especially from the West, are staying away because of the human 
rights issue. Some who did venture in are leaving. American 
oil giant Amoco recently closed its operations after sinking 
more than US$100 million [Singapore dollar] (S$151 million) 
looking for oil. Officially, the reason is failure to find oil. 
Unofficially, Amoco shareholders want out because of Myanmar's 
human rights record. 
  Which brings us to a critical part of the development 
equation: Myanmar will have to show more progress on the 
political front if it hopes to attract the foreign investments 
it needs. In his talks with Myanmar's leaders, Mr Goh urged 
them to take steps to be more open and "return to normalcy", by 
which he meant Myanmar should become more like the countries of 
ASEAN with their democratic elections. He added that his 
impression is that while the leaders recognise this need, they 
will take the necessary steps at their own pace. Those steps 
have to be cautious because Myanmar's leaders have, for 
instance, to find ways to bridge the problematical ethnic 
divisions in the country. But take the steps Myanmar must, and 
sooner rather than later. The arguments put forth by ASEAN for 
constructive engagement will ring hollow if Myanmar is not seen 
to be responding appropriately to the growing foreign investor 
interest. It is up to Myanmar to show a sceptical world that 
constructive engagement works.

  [Text] Singapore and Malaysia have agreed to meet within 
the next three months to finalise the draft agreement on the 
demarcation of the boundary between the two countries in the 
Straits of Johor. 
  This was announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
on Thursday after the sixth Singapore-Malaysia meeting on the 
boundary demarcation held here from Tuesday to Thursday. 
  The Singapore team was led by the senior state counsel in 
the 
Attorney-General's Chambers, Mr S. Tiwari. 
  The leader of the Malaysian delegation was the Ministry of 
Land and Cooperative Development's secretary-general, Mr Azmeer 
Rashid. 
  The MFA statement said the meeting was conducted in "a 
cordial and friendly atmosphere reflecting the close 
relationship and cooperation between the two countries". 
  The two sides carried out negotiations on the draft 
agreement 
to mark precisely the territorial waters boundary, in accordance 
with the Straits Settlement and Johor Territorial Waters 
Agreement 1927. 
  Substantial progress was made and most of the outstanding 
issues were resolved and agreed upon by the two delegations, the 
statement said. It added that both sides agreed to have their 
next meeting in Malaysia.

  [Text] The Home Affairs Ministry [MHA] last night expressed 
regret that the American Embassy has questioned the judgment of 
a Singapore court for a second time. 
  The Embassy had issued a statement after the unsuccessful 
appeal of Michael Peter Fay against his sentence for vandalism. 
  Its Charge d'Affaires, Mr Ralph Boyce, said the Embassy 
continued to believe that caning was an excessive penalty for a 
youthful, non-violent offender who pleaded guilty to a 
repairable crime against private property. 
  He expressed hope that the Singapore Government would 
reconsider the caning sentence on Fay. 
  The MHA statement said it was surprised at Mr Boyce's 
remarks. It said: "This is the second time he has criticised 
the judgment of a Singapore court in public. 
  "This is regrettable. As a diplomat accredited to Singapore 
and representing a country that respects the rule of law, he 
should respect Singapore's judicial system." 
  The statement went on to say that there were official 
channels for him to make representations and added that the 
damage Fay had caused was extensive.

  [Text] The U.S. trade representative has released an 
annual report on foreign trade barriers that cites the 
procurement of the Japanese Government. Asked by a group of 
reporters in the Diet building to comment on the annunal report,

In this way, the prime minister stressed that the Japanese 
Government plans to do everything in its power to map out 
another package of measures during June to open markets in Japan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Urged Not To Open Market Only To Avoid </F>
Facing Sanctions From U.S."] 
  [Text] The 1994 annual report on foreign trade barriers 
released by the U.S. trade representative states that Japan has 
set up trade barriers for 43 items in seven sectors; this is the 
largest number of items so noted yet. Among them are the 
automobile, insurance, and government procurement areas that 
were discussed as priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. 
  The annual report has been released every April, but the 
1994 
report will provide a basis for the Clinton administration to 
compile a list of nations to be subject to the Super 301 
provision it has recently revived. For this reason, the 
Japanese Government is wary of the 1994 annual report. What is 
important for now is that Japan should open up its market 
thoroughly and widely with the ultimate aim of turning Japan 
into an open-market nation in order to avoid facing criticism 
from the rest of the industrialized nations, not sanctions from 
the United States. 
  The Clinton administration's trade strategy to open the 
markets of its trade partners by using the Super 301 provision 
as a lever for imposing sanctions has been under much 
international attack. Now that the Uruguay Round of GATT has 
just directed that trade disputes should be settled through 
multilateral, not bilateral, negotiations, the worldwide 
consensus holds that the Clinton administration's trade strategy 
runs counter to GATT's rules. 
  In the United States, however, even many self-proclaimed 
advocates of free trade regard the Super 301 provision as a 
"nuclear deterrent for the world trade system." Although the 
Clinton administration believes that Super 301 should not be 
used recklessly, it believes that the provision can be used as a 
weapon to open the markets of its trade partners and can 
contribute to the expansion of world trade. 
  It is remarkable that any nation would point out its 
partners' trade barriers; even if a nation thinks its market is 
fully open, its trade partners may believe that its market is 
closed. If a nation issues warnings on the possibility of 
imposing sanctions, this is even more remarkable. 
  If the U.S. trade representative finds what it believes are 
trade barriers in its partners' markets, it should take the 
issue to GATT for arbitration; this is the logical thing to do. 
GATT is the only international trade forum that can determine 
whether such trade barriers actually exist or if they are based 
on a misunderstanding. 
  The number of Japanese trade barriers cited in the 1994 
report is the largest ever. [Ira] Shapiro, adviser to the U.S. 
trade representative, has stressed, "the amount of Japanese 
trade barriers are exceptional among the G-7 industrialized 
nations." The Japanese Government, for its part, has so far 
worked to open markets in Japan and cannot take at face value 
the claims by U.S. trade authorities on Japanese trade barriers; 
however, it is true that ambiguous bureaucratic regulations and 
exclusionary business practices in Japan still keep the Japanese 
market closed. Japanese bureaucrats, who have refuted the U.S. 
trade authorities, cannot confidently say the Japanese market is 
open wider than the American and European markets. 
  Japan should work out its own way to open up its market 
instead of opening up reluctantly under threats from the United 
States. The government is set to map out another package of 
external economic measures in June. The government should map 
out a package of the most concrete external economic measures, 
both in the macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, rather than 
work out a collection of piecemeal measures to avoid facing U.S. 
sanctions. To that end, the work of mapping out the package 
should not be left to bureaucrats, and politicians should make 
decisions on their own. 
  In any case, Japan's current account surplus is too large. 
Japan can no longer be suspected by its trade partners of 
keeping its market closed. The market of the world's top 
surplus nation should be the most widely open one. Opening the 
Japanese market is expected to benefit Japanese consumers and 
serve to improve Japan's economic system.

  [Text] Japanese business leaders regard the U.S. Trade 
Representative's [USTR] annual report on foreign trade barriers 
as a means of putting pressure on Japan. For example, Kosaku 
Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
said, "The United States intends to force Japan to make 
compromises at the framework talks by hinting at the possibility 
that Japan may become a target of sanctions under the Super 301 
provision." Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], said, "Since it has six 
months to specify its trade partners who will be the targets of 
the sanctions, the United States is expecting some progress to 
be made at the bilateral framework talks during this period." 
Both leaders believe it is less than likely that the Super 301 
provision will actually be applied against Japan. 
  However, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation 
of Employers Associations [Nikkeiren], said, "We should make all 
possible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario." As for 
intensifying trade frictions between Japan and the United 
States, Nagano is particularly concerned about the possibility 
that these might have a negative impact on "the Japanese 
economy, which has showed some signs of a recovery."

  [Text] Japanese industries have unanimously expressed 
dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's having listed 43 
items deemed to be Japanese trade barriers in its "1994 Report 
on Foreign Trade Barriers." The telecommunications, medical 
equipment, and electric power industries, which are newly cited 
in the report, especially do not agree with its contents, 
saying: "The U.S. Government is mistaken in its understanding 
of the facts" (as stated by the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies). This is because the amount of procurement of 
foreign goods by nine electric companies sharply increased to 
$440 million in 1992 from $210 million in 1990, and U.S.-made 
products accounted for 80-90 percent of the total. 
  It can be said that of the 43 items listed in the U.S. 
report, "such items as telecommunications and medical equipment 
-- which are newly listed in the report -- as well as 
automobiles, computers, and supercomputers -- which were main 
topics at the economic framework talks -- are the most probable 
targets of the Super 301 provision of the Trade and 
Competitiveness Acts" (according to the Japan Machinery 
Exporters' Association). 
  Meanwhile, Takayoshi Masuzawa, managing director of the 
Communications Machine Makers' Association, stresses: "Although 
trade imbalances in the field of communications equipment as a 
whole still exist, the excess of net exports of such products as 
facsimile machines is now decreasing, due to an increase in 
local production abroad." 
  Regarding the cellular phone issue, the managing director 
also points out: "The introduction of the `urikiri system' 
[lifting the ban on direct sales of cellular phones to 
consumers] in April will promote price and service competition, 
hence it will facilitate the access of foreign makers to the 
Japanese market." 
  The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association points 
out: "The Japanese computer market is an extremely free market 
in which imports have been totally liberalized and tariffs have 
been abolished. Procedures for government procurement of 
supercomputers are transparent." The association does not try 
to conceal its dissatisfaction, saying: "It is hard to 
understand the U.S. report, which completely ignores Japan's 
efforts and its results." 
  In response to the U.S. pointing out the supposedly closed 
nature of the Japanese auto industry in its business dealings, 
Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' 
Association [JAMA], says: "It is not true that we discriminate 
against foreign automakers and makers of automobile parts. We 
have no intention to do so in the future as well." He adds: 
"It can be gathered from the report that the Clinton 
administration is still taking a hardline position on 
policymaking toward Japan." 
  However, the actual situation is that each industry is 
failing to come up with concrete measures to prevent the United 
States from accusing them this September of engaging in unfair 
trade practices. The automobile industry announced its midterm 
purchase program of foreign auto parts in late March. With JAMA 
playing a leading role, the industry has also spelled out new 
plans to increase imports of finished cars, including a plan to 
establish a grievance committee. It is trying to coolly react 
to the U.S. report, saying "there is no choice but to steadily 
implement these plans, (as stated by JAMA). 
  Since the electric power industry is now working out such 
measures as the disclosure of information on its plans to 
procure materials as well as the simplification of procedures 
for procurement, it intends to introduce these measures as an 
answer to the U.S. demand that Japan open its markets.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Move Toward Resuming Their </F>
Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] On 29 March, the government decided on a "package 
of external economic measures" aimed at further opening up the 
Japanese market and relaxing the current regulations in a bid to 
make Japan an open economic society. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa briefed President Clinton on major 
points of the package by telephone, and then expressed hopes to 
resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  The economic framework talks are in a cooling-off period 
following the breakoff of the February Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
Taking advantage of the cooling-off period, Japan has been 
looking for clues on ways to resume the framework talks. The 
door is not yet closed on the possibility of a resumption of the 
framework talks. Now that Japan has announced plans for its 
domestic reforms, both Japan and the United States should 
seriously study ways to resume the framework talks. 
  Formal economic dialogue between Japan and the United States 
remains stalled, which is not a desirable situation for the two 
countries. Both the government and the private sector in Japan 
have held running discussions on how to patch up bilateral 
relations since the February Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off, 
and this move is an expression of the view taken by the 
government and the private sector in Japan that good Japan-U.S. 
ties are indispensable for the development of the world economy. 
  We hope that both Japan and the United States will discuss 
issues at home and abroad, make proposals for each other's 
consideration, and work to defuse their economic friction at a 
forum of the framework talks. 
  Notwithstanding, we do not highly rate all contents of the 
package. The government will make a final decision on how to 
implement the package in late June and on whether the package 
lacks concrete steps to open up markets in Japan and relax the 
bureaucratic regulations. 
  The government has decided to defer setting a voluntary 
target to slash Japan's current account surplus in the package. 
In the package, the government has clearly indicated a 
declining trend in the ratio of Japan's current account surplus 
to its GDP on the basis of its economic forecasting, and 
envisioned the ratio at about 2.8 percent in 1994. 
  As for increasing the amount of public investment, the 
government has not indicated how much the public investment will 
be increased, but said it would review the basic plan for public 
investment by June, while studying ways to increase public 
investment and reexamining the conventional allotment of public 
investment. On the issue of revamping the current tax system 
and cutting income taxes, the government has said that it will 
seek to reform the tax system within the year on the basis of a 
conclusion that the ruling coalition parties will draw in June. 
  From the position of the bureaucrats who have mapped out the 
package, mention of the ratio of Japan's current account surplus 
to its GDP, together with reference to a review of the basic 
plan for public investment in the package, may be a great step 
forward. The question, however, is how much the prime 
minister's political decisions and ideas have been incorporated 
in the package. We would assume that since the prime minister 
rebuffed the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would 
be proper for him to make more bold requests in the finalized 
package. 
  Regarding deregulation, the government has clearly pointed 
out priority areas, but said that it would compile records on 
the results of the deregulation by the end of June. We see no 
vigor in the government's plans to relax the regulations. The 
government should relax the regulations as early as possible. 
  If there is a lack of political decision making on key 
issues, no matter how favorably certain measures to open the 
Japanese market compare with those of other industrialized 
nations, the package of external economic measures as a whole 
does not leave a good impression. We hope that the prime 
minister will display his leadership by making an early decision 
on a set of concrete measures to implement the package without 
being complacent on a plan to map it out by June. 
  Meanwhile, the government has announced that it will abolish 
Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports to the 
United States as of this year. The government has made the 
announcement in accordance with an agreement worked out in the 
new multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), and it 
can be said that the announcement is a symbol indicating that 
Japan-U.S. economic relations are heading for a new era. 
  U.S. unilateral trade sanction measures like the Super 301 
provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act run counter to the 
objective of the Uruguay Round. We hope that the United States 
will change its negotiating strategy of hinting at the 
possibility of imposing sanctions on its trading partners.

  [Text] "While U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
stated that the United States was disappointed with Japan's 
market-opening package, he said the door remains open," said 
Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister of international 
trade and industry, at a news conference on 31 March. At the 
news conference, Vice Minister Kumano mentioned the fact that 
Mr. Kantor expressed dissatisfaction with the "package of 
external economic measures." However, he talked as if he had the 
impression that "there is hope that the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks will be resumed." 
  Vice Minister Kumano gave a self-evaluation of the economic 
package, saying: "(The United States) may not give standard 
marks to our package." Then, he added: "The United States 
needs to thoroughly review such measures as deregulation in the 
package." His remarks indicated that Japan wanted the United 
States to closely examine the details of its external economic 
measures. Moreover, he stated: "Now the government is briefing 
the United States on the current market-opening package through 
diplomatic channels. I hope it will serve as a stimulus." 
Thus, Vice Minister Kumano revealed that Japan is calling on 
the United States to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. talks.

  [Text] Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade 
and industry, told a news conference on 1 April after a cabinet 
meeting that "if an annual report on foreign trade barriers 
recently compiled by the United States is linked to sanctions to 
be imposed in accordance with the Super 301 provision, Japan 
cannot watch idly with indifference." Commenting on the 
inclusion of three priority sectors discussed at the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks in the annual report, he stated, "If 
the Super 301 provision is applied to the three sectors, the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks would collapse. Both Japan 
and the United States need to work to avert such a situation. 
They should resume the framework talks to discuss bilateral 
economic issues in a calm atmosphere and work for a conclusion 
of the framework talks. This is the way to expand and balance 
Japan-U.S. trade." In this way, Mr. Kumagai urged the United 
States not to abuse the annual report and stressed the need for 
resuming the framework talks.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 2 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. trade representative has released an 
annual report on foreign trade barriers that calls on Japan to 
improve the current procedures of procurement by the Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). In response, the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] made clear on 1 
April that it is ready to negotiate with the United States in 
April, at the earliest. The NTT announced a set of measures to 
revamp its current procurement procedures, including free 
contracts, in response to a package of external economic 
measures that the government announced on 29 March. The MOPT 
expressed a willingness to negotiate with the United States with 
the aim of briefing that country on the measures announced by 
the NTT. 
  Japan and the United States have concluded an 
intergovernmental agreement on NTT's procurement. An annual 
review of the NTT's procurement is to be conducted in accordance 
with the agreement, but the 1993 review has yet to be undertaken.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] During a 29 March phone conversation with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made a 
proposal for holding informal vice-ministerial talks, and it 
seems that the United States has agreed to this proposal. 
  The government intends to hold such informal talks as early 
as this week, and coordination is in progress on dispatching to 
Washington either Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi or 
Deputy Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI]. Since the United 
States has indicated that "the door is still open" (as stated by 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor), the government 
believes that "the United States will not negate resumption of 
the framework talks" (as stated by a MITI source). 
  At the Japan-U.S. summits held last February, the framework 
talks were suspended because of a failure to settle differences 
in views between the two countries on the issue of objective 
criteria. While the United States insisted on establishing 
objectives for the future, Japan maintained that targets should 
be limited to results achieved in the past. Therefore, the 
government maintains: To resume the talks, "efforts should be 
made to settle the issue of objective criteria through informal 
talks," otherwise "the talks would end divisively again" (as 
stated by a government source). The government has thus decided 
on holding informal talks with the United States, focusing on 
the objective criteria issue. 
  Objective criteria are supposed to be decided separately for 
various priority areas brought up in the framework talks, 
including telecommunications, government procurement of medical 
equipment, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. However, 
the Japanese Government plans to conduct informal talks by 
focusing on such fields as government procurement and insurance. 
Since progress was made in these two fields at the recent 
summits, and the two countries have almost reached an accord in 
these two areas, the government intends to achieve a 
breakthrough in these fields, thereby bringing the deadlock in 
the framework talks to an end. 
  At the talks held last February, the United States made an 
informal proposal for signing a compromise agreement, which 
states that while Japan will not be asked to indicate numerical 
figures as future targets, the United States will agree to the 
statement that "Japan will respect the upward trends established 
in the past." Based on this proposal, the government plans to 
seek points of compromise. However, since Japan and the United 
States have salient views on the subject of automobiles and auto 
parts, the government actually intends to postpone talks on the 
issue. 
  At the same time, the government intends to give a briefing 
on details of its new package of external economic measures 
agreed upon in late March, thereby stressing Japan's position on 
tackling the market-opening issue. The government will then 
inform the United States and seek its understanding that Japan 
has postponed its conclusions on its macroeconomic policies, but 
that it will work out the details by the end of June. 
  Moreover, the government also intends to point out the fact 
that the "Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" issued in late March 
by the U.S. Trade Representative lists "barriers" in 43 areas of 
trade in Japan. Strong dissatisfaction has been voiced within 
the government, maintaining that "the report claims to point out 
barriers in areas which have virtually been resolved in the 
package."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Those Who Are Rumored To Have </F>
Exercised Behind-the-Scenes Leadership in the Motorola Case, 
Which Was Settled by Japan's Greater-Than-Necessary Concession"] 
  [Test] The Japan-U.S. dispute over U.S. access to the 
Japanese cellular phone market was settled after the Japanese 
side made a considerable concession. The cellular phone trade 
agreement included a private-level accord between Motorola Inc. 
and the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation [Japan Mobile 
Communications Corporation] (IDO) and a separate 
government-to-government accord. IDO has committed itself to 
building many relay stations to expand its Motorola-system 
cellular telephone network, while the Japanese Government has 
pledged to "make the utmost efforts to support the completion of 
IDO's commitments." IDO is expected to receive financial 
assistance from its main shareholders, the Toyota Motor 
Corporation and the Tokyo Electric Power Company. 
  How did it come about that Japan "has lavished hospitality" 
on the United States by making the maximum concessions? 
  "Ichiro Ozawa was the key man," a government source said. He 
confirmed that Ozawa was in constant contact with U.S. 
Ambassador Walter Mondale to find some way out of the difficulty 
while the negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Posts 
and Telecommunications and the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative were making no progress. 
  The explanation given by the government source was as 
follows: "Amid the disturbance caused by the announcement of a 
tax-reform plan to replace the 3-percent consumption tax with a 
7-percent national welfare tax, Ozawa assured Ambassador Mondale 
that Japan will first carry out income tax cuts for three 
consecutive years and increase other taxes later. However in 
the end, it was definitely decided to limit the income tax cut 
to one year, and Ambassador Mondale was greatly embarrassed by 
Ozawa's misjudgment. So, Ozawa managed to square himself with 
Ambassador Mondale by paving the way for a major concession to 
the U.S. demand for comparable access to Japan's cellular 
telephone market." 
  Some people advocate a contrary opinion, saying, "It is a 
total overestimation to think that Ozawa has such influence." 
Another government source disclosed that "What was decisive in 
this case was Toyota's intention, rather than Ozawa's." 
  "Toyota, which is a major shareholder in the mobile phone 
company, feared that if Japan did not yield a single point in 
the cellular phone case, the friction in such sectors as 
automobiles and auto parts might increase when the bilateral 
trade framework negotiations resume. This is why the automaker 
has strongly pressured IDO into making the maximum concessions 
to the U.S. demand." 
  In any case, everyone is of the same opinion that a 
"high-level political decision" occurred in the settling of the 
dispute. For the United States, the cellular phone accord means 
that the Japanese Government has guaranteed to the United States 
access to the Japanese market. 
  This is no more than managed trade, and there is a good 
possibility that the United States might ask to spread the 
Motorola-type deal to other sectors. The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry has deplored the cellular phone 
agreement, saying, "Seen from a strategic point of view, Japan 
made a big mistake that will form a source for future trouble." 
What it says sounds right.

  [Text] Regarding the issue of expanding plate glass 
imports, which is one of the sectors being discussed at the 
Japane-U.S. framework talks, it has been disclosed that the U.S. 
Government has asked [motometa] the Japanese Government to make 
Japanese glass wholesalers and glass fitters prepare independent 
plans designed to increase their purchases of U.S.-made plate 
glass. In the past, the United States had demanded [yokyu] that 
Japan prepare a plan to buy U.S.-made auto parts, and Japan 
accepted this request. The recent request is the second of its 
kind. Because of this, Japan, which aims to resume the 
framework talks by taking advantage of the announcement of the 
recently approved "foreign economic reform plan outline," is 
faced with a new difficult task. 
  As for an expansion of plate glass purchases, Japan and the 
United States have already signed an accord. The two countries 
are supposed to review this accord at the framework talks. 
  The United States is asking for independent purchasing plans 
prepared by Japanese companies--including aluminum sash and 
prefabricated home builders, plate glass wholesalers, and glass 
fitters. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
is strongly rejecting this U.S. demand, saying, "Because there 
is no regulation of plate glass, we cannot give guidance to 
domestic companies asking them to increase their purchases of 
certain goods." 
  There are some 1,000 glass wholesalers and glass fitters in 
Japan, and most of them are small to medium-sized companies. 
Because of this, MITI says that "it is impossible for us to ask 
each company to prepare an independent plan." 
  In January 1992, Japan mapped out an action plan designed to 
help foreign companies make inroads into the Japanese market. 
To implement the plan, MITI has been taking various measures, 
including introducing Japanese wholesalers to U.S. plate glass 
manufacturers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Feels Relieved by UNSC's </F>
Statement To Continue To Persuade North Korea"] 
  [Text] As for the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear 
weapons development program, the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
adopted the chairman's statement to seek the complete carrying 
out of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). In this regard, the Japanese Government welcomed 
the decision, saying that the "international community was able 
to express its strong determination to North Korea" (according 
to a senior Foreign Ministry official). There was a possibility 
that Japan would be forced to make a hard decision if the UNSC 
adopted a resolution to impose economic sanctions on the DPRK. 
Because of this, the government was relieved by the statement, 
which was designed to continue to persuade North Korea. 
<H5>  Japan Holds Ministerial Meetings One After Another To </H5>
Exchange Views With the United States and South Korea 
  In positively evaluating the fact that the UNSC member 
states, including China, unanimously approved the chairman's 
statement which was designed to demand that North Korea accept 
the resumption of nuclear inspections, Japan will cooperate with 
the United Nations in strengthening pressure on North Korea to 
accept inspections. Although the chairman's statement does not 
specify a deadline for accepting the IAEA's inspections, the 
Foreign Ministry understands that "it will be done in accordance 
with a report that the IAEA director general submitted to the 
Security Council on 22 March" and that the UNSC indirectly 
demanded that North Korea "accept a reinspection within about 
six weeks," as the same report states. A Foreign Ministry 
source said, "Perhaps North Korea also understands that around 
mid-April is the deadline." 
  China is the key to North Korea's agreement. The Foreign 
Ministry analyzes the situation by saying: "Now that China has 
agreed with the chairman's statement, we have laid the 
groundwork to work on China to make North Korea respond in a 
positive manner. In this sense, China was given a heavy task." 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will come to Japan 
on 3 April. U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry and South Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae will visit Japan in late April. 
During the series of visits, the three countries will 
demonstrate their cooperative ties to indirectly urge North 
Korea to accept the inspections. 
<H5>  Many Obstacles in Supporting the U.S. Military </H5>
  Government officials are studying the measures that Japan 
can 
take on the supposition that the UNSC approves economic 
sanctions against North Korea and the so-called naval blockade. 
The reality is that they are still discussing the issue of 
revising the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Act to enable Japan to 
send SDF aircraft during emergencies to rescue Japanese living 
abroad. It seems that Japan has no choice but to adopt concrete 
measures to deal with the situation if the naval blockade 
becomes a reality. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency will respond first if the UNSC 
decides to impose a naval blockade on North Korea. It is 
possible for SDF vessels to patrol within Japanese territorial 
waters if the Defense Agency director general, after obtaining 
approval from the prime minister, instructs them to take "action 
to patrol the sea" in accordance with Article 82 of the SDF Act. 
It is generally believed that Japan cannot take further actions 
"because the right of collective self-defense is involved." The 
issue of logistical support for military vessels of the United 
States and other countries is also a focal point. The Defense 
Agency thinks that, under current laws, Japan cannot supply fuel 
to U.S. warships, for example. To supply fuel to U.S. warships, 
Japan must sign an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
with the United States and to revise the SDF Act. 
  As for logistical support, some people think that the "scale 
of cooperation that Japan will be able to provide depends on the 
wording of a UN resolution regarding sanctions and on the trend 
of public opinion." Because of this, it seems that Japan will 
choose "the most suitable method" of the following three 
choices: 1) to introduce a new law similar to the UN 
Peacekeeping Law, which was discarded during the Kaifu 
administration; 2) to revise laws such as the SDF Act; and 3) 
to interpret the current laws to meet the circumstances. 
<H5>  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Plays Central Role in Forming </H5>
Strategies 
  The government and the ruling parties feel a sense of crisis 
over the DPRK issue. However, no prospect is in sight for 
starting Diet deliberations on a draft budget for fiscal year 
1994. In addition, they have to deal with the issue of Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's loan from the Sagawa Kyubin firm. They are 
far from working out carefully thought-out arrangements. 
  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara summoned the 
responsible officials of each ministry and agency to the prime 
minister's official residence to talk about measures that Japan 
can take if the UNSC decides to impose economic sanctions on 
North Korea. However, it is said that they are still "sorting 
out measures which it is possible to take" (according to a 
government source). Some bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki are 
beginning to doubt the Hosokawa administration's 
crisis-management capabilities, asking, "Will the 
administration, which lacks centripetal force, be able to make 
political decisions?"

  [Text] Japan and South Korea have agreed to cooperate in 
building a next-generation information network. This was 
finalized during the recent Japan-ROK summit talks. ROK 
companies will be allowed to participate in the multimedia 
experiments at the Kansai culture and science town, the 
preparations for which are being conducted under the initiative 
of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT], and 
experiments on a link-up with the ROK will be undertaken. 
  While the private sector has taken the lead in the 
information superhighway program in the United States, Japan and 
the ROK chose to conduct their program under government guidance. 
  South Korea is working on a next-generation communications 
network with the installation of optical fibers and other 
equipment, dividing the period from 1994 to 2015 into three 
phases. It plans to build a main state communications network, 
linking mostly public institutions, and a public communications 
network linking South Korean homes. 
  The ROK expressed interest in a briefing from Japan on the 
information network experiments at the regular Japan-ROK 
telecommunications consultations last October. President Kim 
Yong-sam formally asked for Japan's cooperation during his Tokyo 
visit at the summit talks on 26 March. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa basically agreed to the request; he stressed the 
importance of an international communications network linking 
Tokyo, Seoul, and other cities. 
  South Korea expressed its desire to participate in the "new 
generation communications network pilot model project" combining 
communications and broadcasting going on at the Kansai science 
town. The MOPT accepted the request. 
  The project calls for installation of an optical fiber 
network in private homes in the science town to conduct 
experiments on "video on demand"--providing video programs 
whenever the consumers want them--and television shopping 
services, which will start in July. This communications network 
will now be linked with South Korean companies and private homes 
to experiment with international communications. 
  If the experiments are successful, the two countries may 
cooperate in developing new applications for multimedia, such as 
remote medical treatment, or working at home. 
  Right now, a total of around 100 companies are participating 
in this project, including the British communications company 
Cable and Wireless, Canadian communications equipment maker 
Northern Telecom, and another foreign company. Asian companies 
are yet to take part in the program. 
  As a result of the bilateral cooperation agreement, Korean 
Telecommunications (KT) and electric machinery makers of the 
major business conglomerates are expected to participate in the 
Kansai science town experiments.

  [Text] As of 2 April, it has become definite that Japan 
will send a group of about 40 election monitors to the Republic 
of South Africa to monitor its election of a constituent 
assembly. The elections are scheduled to start on 26 April. 
According to a concrete plan, a group of about 20 monitors 
which is mainly composed of Foreign Ministry personnel and 
civilian volunteers who participated as monitors in the 
Cambodian elections will be sent as independent government 
monitors. Moreover, five monitors will be sent by 
nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and 15 others will go as 
individual participants in the UN Observer Mission to South 
Africa (UNOMSA). 
  The first group of these monitors to be sent by the 
government will leave for South Africa on 8 April. Other 
members will leave around the middle of this month. Moreover, 
Japan also plans to send an advisory election monitoring group 
composed of Diet members. 
  With regard to the upcoming dispatch of the election 
monitors 
group, the government does not plan to apply the UN Peacekeeping 
Operations (PKO) Cooperation Bill. In this connection, the 
election monitors to be sent will not participate directly in 
the UNOMSA, but they will act while maintaining close contacts 
with the UNOMSA.

  [Text] Tokyo -- It has been decided that Naha City Mayor 
Kosei Oyatomari will meet on 5 April with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to plead with the latter for the return of Naha harbor 
facilities [including Naha Military Port]. The Ad Hoc Committee 
on General Policy on Okinawa (chaired by Tsuruo Yamaguchi) of 
the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan has arranged the 
meeting and Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Okinawa 
Development Agency, will attend. 
  It has been 20 years since both Japan and the United States, 
at the 25th meeting of the Japan-U.S. Joint Security Committee 
in 1974, agreed to return the Naha harbor facilities on 
condition that a site was secured for their relocation. In 
commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the reversion of 
Okinawa to Japanese rule in 1991, Japan and the United States 
began full-fledged discussions on how to return the harbor 
facilities and the discussions have since continued with no 
agreement reached. 
  In connection with problems arising from U.S. military bases 
on Okinawa, Governor Ota met on 1 February with the prime 
minister to plead with the latter. During the meeting, the 
Okinawa prefectural governor also asked the prime minister to 
work for the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield and the 
Naha harbor facilities and a halt to live-firing exercise by 
U.S. Forces on Okinawa across Prefectural Highway No. 104.

  [Text] Urasoe -- The Urasoe City Assembly (chaired by 
Ichiro Akamine), at its March regular plenary session on 31 
March, unanimously adopted a "statement opposing the relocation 
of Naha Military Port." The assembly also unanimously adopted a 
"resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas near Naha 
Port" in order to promote the second reclamation project, and a 
"statement calling for an early lifting of the ban on the use by 
civilians of water areas that are now used exclusively by 
Makiminato Supply Depot." 
  The statement against relocating Naha Military Port said, 
"there are news reports of plans to relocate Naha Military Port 
to Makiminato Supply Depot." 
  It continued: "The relocation could greatly impede a 
reclamation project that Urasoe City plans to promote. We 
absolutely do not approve of the relocation." 
  Explaining why the ruling party supported the statement 
against the relocation of the military port, assembly member 
Genichi Uehara said: "The alleged secret agreement on the 
relocation of Naha Military Port has turned out to be 
groundless. Successive mayors of Urasoe City have opposed the 
relocation." 
  The statement against the relocation of Naha Military Port 
will be mailed to the prime minister, the foreign minister, the 
transport minister, the director general of the Defense Agency, 
the director general of Okinawa Development Agency, the director 
general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the 
governor of Okinawa Prefecture, and Okinawan officials in charge 
of managing major ports in Naha City. 
  The resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas 
near 
Naha Port was adopted by the assembly on the basis of an 
agreement concluded between the mayors of Naha and Urasoe 
Cities. Under the agreement, Urasoe City, not Naha City, is in 
charge of managing the waterfront areas, and will meet the costs 
of reclaiming land along the waterfront. The resolution was 
adopted by a vote of 15-4. 
  A statement on the resolution issued by Naha City said: "It 
is best if the assembly adopts the resolution unanimously, but 
this is a case where it cannot do so." 
  In response, Urasoe City plans to ask the Naha City Harbor 
Deliberation Council for advice on how to expand the waterfront 
areas available for reclamation.

  [Text] Tokyo -- On 31 March, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MOPT] called on the Frequency Control 
Council (chairman: Masaki Ikuta) for advice, asking whether a 
preliminary license for operating a television station should be 
granted to Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (which is being 
formed by Takashi Higa, representative organizer and adviser to 
OKINAWA TIMES). The council positively responded to the inquiry 
the same day. The preliminary license is a de facto approval to 
begin service. Because of this, full-fledged activities, 
including establishment of the company itself and construction 
of the station building, will take place for the establishment 
of the third private television station in Okinawa. It is 
expected that the station will start its service in October 
1995. Since Ryukyu Asahi plans to establish cooperative ties 
with the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation (RBC), which is an 
exisiting operational station, attention is focused on the 
possibility that two channels will be given to one company. As 
for granting a preliminary license to Southwest Broadcasting 
Corporation (representative organizer: Hidenobu Goya, chairman 
of the Kanehide Group), the MOPT did not ask the council for 
advice this time. 
  Following the MOPT's decision in July last year to allocate 
two additional channels to Okinawa, Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting 
Corporation, which is affiliated with Television Asahi, and the 
Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, which is scheduled to 
receive television programs from Nippon Television Network 
Corporation, applied for a preliminary license. Of the two, the 
application of Ryukyu Asahi was approved and the Frequency 
Control Council, which is an advisory organization to the MOPT, 
advised the ministry to grant a preliminary license. According 
to the preliminary license, Ryukyu Asahi's call name is QAB and 
will use channel 28. Its transmitting station and main station 
will be constructed in Kakazu, Tomishiro-son, and Kumoji, Naha, 
respectively. Construction of the stations will be completed on 
6 October 1995. 
  Moreover, the total amount of its capital is 700 million 
yen. 
Its investors are Asahi National Broadcasting Co., ASAHI 
SHIMBUN, RBC and 10 local companies. Takashi Higa, 
representative organizer, is scheduled to become president of 
the new station. 
  Ryukyu Asahi will use seven relay stations to transmit its 
programs. Because of this, 87.2 percent of all households -- 
almost the entire area of Okinawa -- will be covered. Miyako 
and Yaeyama [islands] will not be included in the coverage area 
for the time being. 
  The preliminary license will be issued on 6 April. Ryukyu 
Asahi plans to establish a company in May. After that, Ryukyu 
Asahi will start to construct its office building, order 
equipment, and compile programs to prepare for its grand 
opening. According to a plan, Ryukyu Asahi will have its office 
in the building of RBC, which will also dispatch its capable 
members to Ryukyu Asahi. 
  As for Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, the MOPT decided 
not to query the council this time regarding issuance of a 
preliminary license, saying: "We are still screening its 
application." The Nippon Television Network Corporation 
explains: "It is difficult to take action because the situation 
regarding the television business is still severe. No progress 
has been made at the site."

  [Text] Ten Japanese semiconductor manufacturers -- 
including NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi -- will jointly establish 
"Semiconductor Industries Research Institute," a think tank for 
researching and advocating policies to rehabilitate the 
competitive power of Japanese semiconductor industries. The 
think tank will analyze such subjects as market development for 
next-generation technology, and increases in investment costs, 
and advocate governmental support and cooperation with academic 
circles. Japanese semiconductor industries have been refraining 
from such joint projects. This was because the Japan-U.S. 
friction over semiconductor trade once focused on the Japanese 
Government's excessive support for the industrial circles. 
However, major chip makers have decided to jointly solve their 
common problems to cope with revival of U.S. makers and rapid 
growth of ROK makers. Japanese chip makers intend to stop any 
further decline of their world market share. 
  In addition to NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, the think tank 
will 
be participated in by Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Oki Electric 
Industry, Sony, Matsushita Electronics, Sanyo, and Sharp. NEC 
Managing Director Hajime Sasaki is expected to chair the 
10-party organization, and its operations will be started by 
about five full-time staff supported by member companies. 
  The primary duty of the think tank is to prepare advisory 
reports on the following subjects: 1) development of markets 
for next-generation technology, such as multimedia; 2) 
technological and industrial problems, such as increasing 
investment costs; and 3) the desirable position of the Japanese 
semiconductor industry in the world market. 
  Semiconductor manufacturers have been refraining from 
multiparty projects since the 1980's, when "Super LSI 
[large-scale integration] Technology Research Cooperative," 
founded in 1976, was criticized by the United States as a cause 
of trade friction. However, "individual companies cannot 
adequately deal with their problems since cooperation among 
material makers, machine tool makers, academic circles, and the 
government is not needed in many fields" (as noted by a top 
official of a leading chip maker). Therefore, they have decided 
to tie up in order to jointly cope with difficult problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Iwao Nakatani, professor at the Hitotsubashi </F>
University: "Partial Relaxation of Regulations Under the 
Large-Scale Retail Store Law"] 
  [Text] Now that the government has recently taken steps to 
relax regulations under the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, 
large-scale retail stores are able to set up new branches, 
provided each outlet has a floor area of less than 1,000 square 
meters. As the Hiraiwa Report stresses, the abolishment of such 
regulations is a trump card to revitalize the current state of 
the Japanese economy and narrow price differentials between 
Japan and other nations. It is very regrettable that the 
government has reached a half-formed resolution on relaxing the 
regulations. 
  Primary reasons for the government drawing up such a 
half-formed resolution include: first, medium- and small-scale 
retailers have strongly reacted against completely abolishing 
the regulations, and their reaction has led the government to 
fear political risks in taking such action; and second, the 
government has concluded that even if the conventional 
regulations are left unrelaxed, large-scale stores can open new 
branches of their retail stores anyway. 
  When the Large-Scale Retail Store Law was enacted 20 years 
ago, large-scale stores could freely open new branches, provided 
each had a floor area of less than 1,500 square meters. The 
government then restricted the area of new retail store outlets 
to 500 square meters by strengthening the regulations. This 
time, the government has somewhat relaxed the regulations, but 
the deregulation has fallen short of reaching the size available 
20 years ago. The United States has pressed Japan to open its 
markets and has asked Japan to set numerical targets, because in 
many instances, Japan has agreed in general to relax its 
regulations; however, Japan has yielded to pressure from 
interest groups whenever it has planned to take concrete steps 
to relax its regulations. 
  Political pressure exists in all nations. Politicians should 
make a firm decision on whether to yield to pressure or adhere 
to their principles and push for reforms to the last. Voters 
will decide whether such decisions are right or wrong when they 
cast ballots in elections. This is part of the democratic 
process. At present, however, government-led consultative 
councils submit reports to the government and policies are 
actually formulated based on the conclusions of such reports. 
This is not a healthy process. The present situation is such 
that the collusive relationship between the government and the 
private sector is hard to break, and bureaucrats, whose 
decisions are not mandated by voters in elections, have taken 
the initiative in deciding to keep the Large-Scale Retail Store 
Law in effect. This situation clearly runs counter to the 
principles of democracy. 
  There is a "logic of adults" [otonanoronri] behind 
Japanese-style decisionmaking; such logic is villainous. The 
government's idea is that, "since large-scale stores can still 
open new retail outlets under the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, 
it is desirable to reap the benefits of keeping the law in 
force." It appears that the "logic of adults" has been behind 
the government's recent decision to keep the Large-Scale Retail 
Store Law intact. We must not forget that the "logic of adults" 
has prevented transparency in Japanese decisionmaking. The 
government's decision to keep the law intact clearly will be 
advantageous to major Japanese firms that have already 
consolidated their business foundations in the distribution 
industry, but will be disadvantageous to foreign firms that have 
yet to firmly establish themselves in the Japanese market. 
  The Large-Scale Retail Store Law does not exist in the 
United 
States. The nonexistence of such a law has constantly 
revolutionized the distribution system and kept prices low in 
that country. Wal-Mart, a discount store in the United States, 
is well-known worldwide for its innovative management. Wal-Mart 
is a fast-growing, high-profit firm that has posted the world's 
top retail sales over the past few years. The characteristic 
feature of the company's strategy is to open retail outlets in 
small towns with populations around 30,000. Major supermarkets 
are reluctant to open retail outlets in such small towns. Many 
conventional retail stores are small, while the prices of goods 
sold at such stores are high. 
  Wal-Mart has focused on opening retail outlets in rural 
towns. The American firm has tried hard to purchase goods from 
all over the world at the lowest prices, and this has made it 
possible for its retail stores to sell goods at lower prices. 
As a result, townspeople have rushed to Wal-Mart to buy goods, 
leaving rival conventional stores bankrupt. 
  To be sure, the bankruptcy of conventional small retail 
stores has resulted in great pain for such firms. However, the 
living standards of townspeople have greatly improved. Their 
real purchasing power has grown and existing business has become 
brisk in order to meet fresh demand. In addition, one new 
business after another has emerged. People who have lost their 
jobs in conventional small retail stores have found new jobs in 
Wal-Mart, and some of them have started new businesses. The 
arrival of Wal-Mart has substantially revitalized towns and 
improved the livelihood of people in the towns. 
  The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters headed by 
the prime minister will create today (28 March) a "panel on 
import promotion, market opening, and distribution." I hope 
that as a trump card to drastically narrow the price 
differentials between Japan and other nations, the prime 
minister will make a political decision on the repeal of the 
Large-Scale Retail Store Law.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's private advisory 
organ called the "Consultative Committee on Defense Problems" 
(headed by Asahi Breweries Ltd. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi) 
designed to discuss and study new defense policies held its 
fourth meeting at the prime minister's official residence on the 
morning of 30 March. In the meeting, positive views toward 
participating in a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) plan were 
expressed. 
  In the meeting, the members received a briefing by Maritime 
Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki and Air 
Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Isao Ishizuka about the 
current situation. 
  In response, with the tense situation on the Korean 
peninsula 
in mind, an opinion was expressed by committee members that "we 
wonder if there are ways to deal with a missile attack. The TMD 
is an effective system for strengthening Japan's exclusively 
defensive defense." 
  Meanwhile, the view was also expressed that "comprehensive 
study has to be given to the TMD plan because it relates to the 
issue concerning use of space for peace purpose, and the 
collective self-defense right."

"`Ozawa Operation' Under Way With the Transportation Ministry 
Being Used as a Base; Ranking Official Sent to Detroit To Ward 
Off Pressure of U.S. Industry"] 
  [Text] A little over seven months have passed since the 
government changed hands. The long reign of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] has come to an end, and the political 
regime of 1955 which made such reign a possible has collapsed, 
but battles are now being fought on the political front lines 
between a new group of parties that want to establish a new 
order and the LDP, which wants to return to power. The future 
of the political realignment is still not clear. We will 
examine various phases of the ongoing war in the political world. 
  To find a breakthrough in the automobile issue, which 
symbolizes Japan-U.S. economic frictions, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa and other people 
are now conducting a top-secret operation. This is an operation 
targeting Detroit, the center of the U.S. auto industry. 
  On 8 March, Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama, the Ministry of 
Transportation's [MOT] second-highest-ranking administrative 
official, was sent to Detroit for active talks with five senior 
executives of the "Big Three" such as Ford Motors Vice President 
Booker. 
  Six days later, on 14 March, Ozawa, who had not been seen at 
public appearances since the beginning of the month and who had 
been absent from ruling party representatives meetings and 
regular news conferences, was at a Tokyo office--which he uses 
for secret meetings--with Toshihiro Nikai, parliamentary vice 
minister of transportation, where they were together waiting for 
Mukaiyama, who had returned home the day before. 
  Mukaiyama reported on the results of the meeting with the 
Ford vice president and other executives, and said, "They wanted 
to obtain technical advice on how they can export without 
hitches more automobiles to Japan." 
  The MOT had already decided to remove barriers on U.S.-made 
vehicles by carrying out vehicle inspections on them in the 
United States and by treating them as Japanese-made vehicles are 
treated--in response to the U.S. charge that Japan's vehicle 
inspection system is working as a barrier to exports to Japan. 
The ministry plans to permanently station inspectors at the 
Japanese Consulate General in Detroit beginning in April. 
  In other words, with this due to happen soon, Councilor 
Mukaiyama was sent to Detroit to explain in detail to U.S. 
automakers Japan's efforts--in hopes of stemming that industry's 
pressure on Japan. Sending him was part of the operation. 
Ozawa, who came up with the idea, appeared to have been content 
with the results. 
  Meanwhile, the "operation" proceeded in Japan as well. The 
MOT sent an unusual order to the Chrysler Japan Sales Company on 
10 March, saying, "We need five Cherokees to be assigned to 
national offices." A senior ministry official said, "We 
eventually want to buy 100 of them altogether with the help of 
concerned organizations such as the Airport Corporation." For 
Ozawa, the purchase of U.S.-made Jeeps for a total of 300 
million yen is part of the operation to "root out the trouble by 
spraying insecticide on the roots." Ozawa's strategy is based on 
the thinking that the only effective way of dampening the 
pressure from Washington is to shut the mouths of persons from 
U.S. industry. 
  Last July, having played a major role in changing the 
possession of the government, Shinseito not only filled major 
cabinet posts but also sent its confidants to key parliamentary 
vice ministerial posts. And, under Vice Minister Nikai, who 
twice came to serve as parliamentary vice minister--something 
which does not often happen--the MOT continued changing into 
Ozawa's "base in Kasumigaseki." 
  Around the end of 1992, there was the strife within the LDP 
Takeshita faction consisting of the "pro-Ozawa group versus the 
anti-Ozawa group" that started with former LDP Vice President 
Shin Kanemaru resigning over the scandal of taking 500 million 
yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Company. This strife culminated in 
the creation of the Hata faction. 
  It was 27 December, the day before the Hata faction was to 
be 
launched at an inaugural meeting. In the office of the 
Transportation Policy Bureau director on the eighth floor of the 
MOT in Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, were gathered such high-ranking 
officials as Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo, and 
Kuniji Toda, director of the Marine Technology and Safety 
Bureau. The excuse for the gathering was to commemorate the 
ending of the extraordinary Diet session that closed on that day. 
  The meeting started with the arrival of Nikai, former MOT 
parliamentary vice minister. Director-rank officials exchanged 
pleasantries and cracked jokes for about half an hour. Then 
House of Councilors member Nobuya Izumi, an old MOT man (former 
councilor of the ministry's Ports and Harbors Bureau), appeared 
and bowed to his former superiors, who were sitting around 
Nikai, and said, "Please continue your favors to me." Voices 
shouting "cheers" went up around Izumi. It was at this moment 
that the MOT witnessed Izumi joining the Hata faction. 
  Izumi's joining the Hata faction while the strife was under 
way between the pro-Ozawa group and the anti-Ozawa group--which 
sent ripples even to Kasumigaseki--meant that the MOT clearly 
supported the Hata faction. A senior official of a different 
government office recalled, "The MOT was impressed by the 
political capabilities of Diet members Keiwa Okuda and Nikai, 
who took the initiative in resolving the controversial Narita 
Airport issue. The ministry wanted to strengthen its position 
by deciding to ride along with Ozawa, whom these two people 
supported." 
  The MOT has under its control a broad industry which covers 
transportation services using automobiles, aircraft, and 
railways; warehousing services, shipbuilding, stevedoring, 
reclamation and dredging operations, and tourism. Winning the 
ministry over to its side meant having control over an 
organization with big pipelines to political funds, as well as 
the power to collect votes. In fact, political donations to the 
LDP amounted to more than 600 million yen a year, including 
about 360 million from 16 major private railway systems -- to 
mention only the portion of funds raised from the transportation 
industry (based on the 1992 political fund revenue and 
expenditure report). 
  At the end of the three-month-long strife, of a total of 15 
Takeshita faction members elected from the upper house 
proportional representation system who were backed by government 
ministries and agencies, only three, including two former 
Defense Agency officials, turned out to be supporters of Ozawa. 
It was a bitter defeat for Ozawa. This may be all the more 
reason for a senior Shinseito member's now insisting proudly, 
"there is no question that the MOT supports Shinseito." 
  Ozawa previously had nothing to do with transportation zoku 
[Diet members lobbying for the interests of the transportation 
industry and transportation-related government offices]. There 
is no doubt that in the background of Ozawa's having decided to 
use the MOT as an advance unit of the attack forces in 
operations concerning the important issue of Japan-U.S. 
relations there lay this link between Shinseito, the MOT, and 
the transportation industry from the days of his group's 
splitting off [from the LDP Takeshita faction]. 
  There are many industrial organizations which support the 
old 
LDP, which built up the politicians-bureaucrats-businessmen 
triangle by mobilizing its "zoku Diet members." Meanwhile, 
extremely bitter battles are being fought between Shinseito and 
the LDP. There is the concern: Is Shinseito merely a party 
which dresses differently [from the LDP] but which continues 
"zoku governance"? From the "offensive against Detroit" 
operation, one can see clearly the depths of Japanese politics, 
which appear unable to be rid of the triangular political system 
easily. 
  The MOT was ruled by the LDP's unyuzoku [Diet members 
concerned with transportation] before. They had great authority 
over transportation, including busses and trucks. 
Traditionally, the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction was the most 
powerful. Former transportation ministers--including Hiroshi 
Mitsuzuka, chairman of the Mitsuzuka faction and former chairman 
of the LDP Policy Research Council; Masajuro Shiokawa, and Akira 
Ono--and Mutsuki Kato, former chairman of the LDP Policy 
Research Council (who is a member of the Renewal and Reform 
League) and who controlled the transportation industries, were 
representative members of the Mitsuzuka faction. 
  On the other hand, the Takeshita faction--which was at the 
top of the system, in which zoku Diet members ran government 
ministries and agencies--sought to have many upper house Diet 
members, who represented each industrial sector, become members 
of it. The faction did this by placing economic ministries and 
agencies--including the Ministry of Construction, the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, and the Agricultural, Forestry, and 
Fisheries Ministry--under its control. The Takeshita faction 
had 109 members immediately after the lower house elections held 
in July 1992. Of the 109, however, 41 were upper house members. 
It was a faction which attached too much importance to the 
upper house. 
  The Takeshita faction sent Kenzo Muraoka, senior member of 
the faction, to the post of transportation minister during the 
Kaifu administration. Keiwa Okuda, one of the "seven important 
members" of the faction, became transportation minister during 
the Miyazawa administration. 
  Shinya Izumi, who won a 1992 election for a 
proportional-representation seat by obtaining the support of the 
MOT, decided to run in the election while Okuda was secretary 
general of the Takeshita office. He has been strengthening 
steadily his control over the MOT. 
  Following a split in the Takeshita faction, however, there 
was a fierce power struggle between Okuda, who supported Ichiro 
Ozawa, and Okamura and former Transportation Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, who were anti-Ozawa. Izumi belonged to the Ozawa 
group. The LDP Policy Research Council underwent a personnel 
reshuffle after the split of the Takeshita faction, and 
Toshihiro Nikai, who supported Ozawa, became chairman of the 
council's transportation department. This created the 
impression that Ozawa supporters, who are also members of 
Shinseito, took over the main posts of the MOT. 
  Various changes are taking place among zoku Diet members 
following the change of political power. While Shinseito and 
the LDP are having a fierce battle over the control of the 
different industries, the zoku Diet members are actively 
following the new [transportation] sectors. 
  According to a rough calculation by the Ministry of Posts 
and 
Telecommunications, a new 123 trillion yen multimedia market 
will be created by 2010. The ruling and opposition parties are 
very much interested in the information and communications 
sector. In October, Shinseito formed a Diet members league 
(chaired by Kozo Watanabe) for the promotion of information and 
communications industries. This league has the same name as 
does the LDP's counterpart. Moreover, the ruling coalition 
parties, including Shinseito, established a Diet members group 
for information and communications (representative caretaker: 
Mamoru Nakajima) on 23 March, as if this were not only 
coincident with the establishment of NTT's multimedia promotion 
team, which was formed in February. This coalition group is 
composed mainly of Social Democratic Party of Japan lawmakers 
who were former members of the Zendentsu, a labor union of NTT. 
Each coalition party was asked to send a few representatives to 
the group. This request was well received, and Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP] together sent 25 
representatives. One of the group's members said: "It is a 
cheerleading squad for NTT. The multimedia is not only a field 
with a bright future, but the votes of Zendentsu members are 
attractive to us." 
  As for education, some senior members of the National 
Federation of Private College Associations (representative: 
Shigeyoshi Tachibanadaka, Science University of Tokyo director) 
-- which was shaken by a rumor that the budget for subsidies to 
private colleges will be cut next fiscal year -- were confused 
by a report that "Shinseito is saying that `no help will be 
given at the time of budget allocations if the federation makes 
a plea to the LDP.'" The federation just could not betray the 
LDP. After all, representatives of the federation visited both 
the LDP and Shinseito to ask for help. A senior federation 
official said: "The LDP helped us a lot in the past. However, 
we did not want to upset the current ruling parties, either. It 
was difficult for us to do anything." 
  Shinseito has already formed sectoral meeting groups, which 
are similar to those of the LDP, and it is trying to make these 
look like those of the LDP. As for the Diet members league, the 
party's is increasingly trying to rival that of the LDP. As for 
schools, Shinseito formed several Diet members leagues -- 
including a Diet members league for the promotion of private 
kindergartens (chairman: Tatsuo Ozawa) and a Diet members league 
for the promotion of vocational and other schools (chairman: 
Hajime Funada) -- from late last year to this January. 
  Moreover, the same party also formed in February a "Diet 
members league for the promotion of affluent car companies" 
(chaired by Keiwa Okuda), and a comprehensive league designed to 
cover four automobile-related industrial sectors, including 
busses and taxis. This is an enlarged version of the LDP's Diet 
members league for car repair services.

  [Text] On 30 March, a plan emerged among the ruling 
coalition parties to set up a "vision study group" to replace 
the "policy study group" proposed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, but which was withdrawn due to opposition from the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake 
[Harbinger]. According to several senior ruling coalition party 
officials, the plan to set up a new study group is aimed at 
coordinating various parties' basic policies regarding such 
general topics as constitutional issues and ideas about how 
Japan ought to be as a nation. They hope to set up the study 
group in April. 
  Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi (independent), who is 
one of the original proponents of the policy study group, is 
playing a major role in working out plans for the new group. 
Partial changes in the prospectus originally drawn up for the 
policy study group are planned. Changes are to include the 
removal of topics such as that calling for selecting "unified 
candidates" in preparation for future national elections and 
that for cooperation among the ruling coalition parties geared 
toward "formation of a new new party." In addition, study 
subjects are to be changed to more generalized topics instead of 
specific areas, and participation in the study group is to be on 
an individual basis, as a rule. 
  On the morning of 30 March, Yamaguchi met SDPJ Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama at the lower house official residence. 
Yamaguchi explained the new plan and sought his understanding. 
However, Murayama said he believed it is more important to 
resume Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 draft national 
budget.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 2 April, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister, gave a lecture at a meeting held 
by a group mainly composed of junior bureaucrats for the purpose 
of exchanging views among different professions. In dealing 
with the realignment of political parties, Hata said: "It is out 
of the question (that the coalition parties) should act as if 
they were five horses heading in different directions while 
pulling the same carriage. Efforts must be made to unite the 
coalition parties in one way or another because political 
dynamism now lies in competition with the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]." In this way, Hata reiterated his intention to 
promote the plan for forming a new party and coordinate the 
selection of coalition-supported candidates for the next House 
of Representatives' election.

  [Text] At 1030 on 2 April, the high-ranking delegation of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia led by Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister; and Samdech Hun Sen, second 
prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, held talks 
with the high-ranking SRV delegation led by His Excellency Vo 
Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister, who is on a visit to 
Cambodia. 
  The talks went on for over two hours and focussed on two 
issues, namely the border issue and that of Vietnamese residents 
in Cambodia. The two sides agreed to set up a joint technical 
committee to check and mark the border between the two countries 
and to set up appropriate technical groups concerning Vietnamese 
residents in Cambodia. 
  The two sides informed one another of the economic and 
political situation and other areas and also pointed out the 
concrete points in relations between Cambodia and Vietnam. The 
two sides also discussed the issue of goods circulation, 
particularly the transport of goods through Vietnam.
