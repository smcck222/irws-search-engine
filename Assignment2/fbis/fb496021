<F P=106> ["Cambodian-Vietnamese Joint Communique" issued in Phnom </F>
Penh on 3 April] 
  [Text] 1. At the invitation of Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second 
prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], His 
Excellency [H.E.] Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV, paid 
an official friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia from 2 
to 3 April 1994. 
  2. During the stay in the Kingdom of Cambodia, H.E. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage laid wreaths at 
Independence Monument and visited a number of cultural and 
economic centers in Phnom Penh. The delegation was warmly 
welcomed by the Cambodian people at every place it visited. 
  H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet paid a courtesy call on 
Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly and acting 
head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The latter warmly 
welcomed H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Cambodia. 
He highly valued the visit, considering it important to 
reinforce and expand the traditional relations of friendship and 
the time-honored cooperation of good neighborliness between 
Vietnam and Cambodia. 
  At the meeting, H.E. Vo Van Kiet conveyed, via Samdech Chea 
Sim, solicitous greetings and best wishes from the Vietnamese 
leadership to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen 
Norodom Monineat Sihanouk. May his majesty speedily recover and 
may his majesty and the queen enjoy the best of health and 
happiness. H.E. Vo Van Kiet reaffirmed Vietnamese President Le 
Duc Anh's invitation for His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and 
Queen Norodom Monineat Sihanouk to pay a state visit to the SRV 
at an appropriate time. 
  Samdech Chea Sim thanked H.E. Le Duc Anh for the invitation 
and promised to convey the request to His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineat Sihanouk. 
  3. The SRV delegation headed by H.E. Vo Van Kiet held an 
official meeting with a delegation of the RGC led by Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively 
first and second prime ministers. The talks were conducted in 
an atmosphere of friendship, cooperation of good neighborliness, 
and mutual understanding. The two sides informed each other of 
the situation in each country and discussed concrete measures to 
strengthen and develop the relations of friendship and [word 
indistinct] cooperation between the two countries. They also 
exchanged views on international and regional issues of common 
concern. 
  4. The Cambodian side informed its Vietnamese counterpart of 
the initial achievements made by the RGC and the Cambodian 
people under the clear-sighted and intelligent leadership of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. This is for the cause of 
achieving national reconciliation and preserving and promoting 
peace and political stability in the process of rehabilitation, 
reconstruction, and development. 
  The Cambodian side highly valued the positive contribution 
made by the Vietnamese Government and people to the Cambodian 
peace process and their strict respects for and constructive 
contribution to the implementation of the Paris 23 October 1991 
accords on Cambodian peace. It also expressed its delight with 
the important achievements won by the Vietnamese people for the 
cause of reforms and for consolidating the independent, 
sovereign, and open-door foreign policy. The Cambodian side 
warmly welcomed the decision by the U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to lift the economic embargo against Vietnam. It considered the 
action a new positive step to clear the way for the 
normalization of relations between the two countries. 
  5. The Vietnamese side expressed its pleasure with the 
positive development and fine achievements made by the Cambodian 
people in the restoration of peace, implementation of national 
reconciliation, and reconstruction of the country. It was also 
delighted with the independent, peaceful, sovereign, nonaligned, 
and friendly foreign policy of the RGC and the latter's efforts 
in reintegrating Cambodia into the international and regional 
communities. The Vietnamese side warmly welcomed His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk's decision to reascend the throne as king 
of Cambodia. It also highly valued his majesty for his historic 
leading role and his tireless efforts in the process of 
achieving national reconciliation and unity, restoring peace and 
political stability, and rebuilding the country toward 
prosperity and glory. 
  The Vietnamese side also expressed sincere gratitude to His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodian people for their 
kindly sentiment and fine support to the Vietnamese people. It 
was confident that under the clear-sighted leadership of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, the RGC and the Cambodian people 
would succeed in building a peaceful, independent, neutral, 
nonaligned, prosperous, and glorious Cambodia. The Vietnamese 
side sincerely wished the RGC new, and still greater successes 
in the implementation of its noble task in this most difficult 
phase of history. 
  6. The two sides were pleased to take note of the fine 
development in relations between the two countries. They 
reaffirmed their pledges to maintain and expand the relations of 
friendship and cooperation of good neighborliness in all fields 
based on the principles of the joint communiques dated 25 
January 1992 and 25 August 1993 specifically concerning mutual 
respect for each country's independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity; noninterference in each other's internal 
affairs; and cooperation with equality and mutual interests. 
This is to respond to the aspiration and interests of each 
country's people and the interests, peace, stability, and 
cooperation for development in the region. 
  7. In this spirit, the agreement on economic and trade 
cooperation; the agreement on cultural, educational, scientific, 
and technical cooperation; the agreement on transit goods; and 
the agreement on the creation of a joint committee for economic, 
cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation between the RGC 
and the SRV Government were signed by the two countries' 
governments. The two sides consider these agreements an 
important foundation for further promoting their cooperation in 
line with the two sides' interests. The two sides agreed to 
encourage various ministries, institutions, and agencies 
concerned to increase their meetings to prepare agreements and 
contracts on concrete cooperation. 
  Heeding the Cambodian side's request, the Vietnamese side 
agreed to assist Cambodia in the development of human resources. 
  8. In the spirit of friendship and cooperation of good 
neighborliness, the two sides agreed to (?urgently and correctly 
solve) all remaining issues concerning bilateral relations 
through negotiations and on the basis of mutual respect for each 
country's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
legitimate interests. This is for the two countries' interests 
in line with international laws and customs and each country's 
regulations. 
  9. The two sides agreed to establish a working group of 
experts to discuss and solve the border problem between the two 
countries. The group will also discuss necessary measures to 
maintain security and stability along the border and create a 
border of lasting peace and friendship between the two countries. 
  10. The two sides agreed to set up a working group of 
experts to discuss and solve the issue of ethnic Vietnamese in 
Cambodia based on respect for Cambodia's law and international 
law and customs. The Vietnamese side highly valued the RGC's 
statement that it would continue to implement His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk's policy toward ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. 
In this spirit, the ethnic Vietnamese will be treated as other 
foreign nationals. 
  11. The two sides agreed to further negotiate with other 
countries concerned, within the framework of the interim Mekong 
committee, to work out an appropriate formula for solving the 
problems concerning the right to use the Mekong River's 
resources and protecting the regional environment in the 
interest of the states and people on the river's banks, 
especially the states and people in the lower part of the river. 
  12. The two sides satisfactorily noted the recent positive 
development in Southeast Asia and the trend toward peace, 
stability, and cooperation in the interests of regional 
development. They warmly welcomed the initiative and efforts to 
promote talks to increase mutual understanding and settle 
diverse disputes and conflicts among the regional countries 
through peaceful means. The two sides reaffirmed their desire 
to further reinforce and expand the relations of good 
neighborliness and cooperation with equality and mutual 
interests with all the regional countries, contributing to 
building Southeast Asia as a zone of peace, stability, 
friendship, and prosperity. 
  13. The two sides were of the opinion that the reinforcement 
and expansion of the traditional relations of friendship and 
cooperation of good neighborliness between the SRV and the 
Kingdom of Cambodia constitute a positive contribution to peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
  14. H.E. Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV, expressed 
sincere gratitude for the warm hospitality given to the 
Vietnamese delegation by the RGC and the Cambodian people and 
the warm sentiment of time-honored friendship and fraternal 
solidarity between the two peoples and nations, Cambodia and 
Vietnam. 
  [Signed] For the RGC, First Prime Minister Norodom 
Ranariddh; Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
  [Dated] Phnom Penh, 3 April 1994. 
  For the SRV Government, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.

  [Excerpt] Phnom Penh, April 1 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh returned to his country Friday 
after a three-week trip to France as the nation's co-defence 
ministers returned from Hanoi. 
  Moving quickly through the airport, Ranariddh said only that 
the trip, on which he was accompanied by his wife, had been a 
private visit. 
  The joint ministers of defence, Generals Tie Banh and Tea 
Chamrat, returned from a four-day trip in Hanoi to strengthen 
military ties. 
  Tie Banh said Vietnam had congratulated the Royal Cambodian 
army for capturing Pailin. 
  He denied a Thai newspaper report which said Thursday that 
the two ministers had appealed to Hanoi for ammunition and 
weapons. 
  "We went there only to improve our good relations with our 
neighbors," he said. "Our trip was not concerned with politics 
or ammunitions supplies. It was a friendly visit." [passage

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 3 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-premier 
Hun Sen said Sunday that the government will soon appoint a 
governor and devise a development plan for the former Khmer 
Rouge stronghold of Pailin, captured by the government in late 
March. 
  "We are going to adminster this town, not just militarily to 
prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge, but to develop it as 
well," Hun Sen told AFP. 
  He did not mention whether the government would begin mining 
the northwestern Cambodian town's rich seams of rubies and 
sapphires, which earned the Khmer Rouge an estimated one million 
dollars per month in revenues to finance their guerrilla war. 
  "This town will be an agricultural development and 
industrial 
zone because the natural resources in this zone can support such 
small factories as sugar cane processing," he said. 
  The Cambodian government has said previously that it would 
honor contracts between the Khmer Rouge and Thai mining and 
logging companies, which are located just over the Thai border. 
  Cambodian troops seized trucks, bulldozers and rock-sorting 
equipment owned by the Thai contractors when they captured 
Pailin, and diplomats here say the Cambodians are taking their 
time "cataloguing" their finds. 
  Cambodia's deputy interior ministers, Im Chhunlim and Khan 
Savoeun, have been given the task of setting up a development 
plan and appointing a governor to run the Pailin area as a 
special administrative region. 
  Hun Sen said he envisaged tourist groups traveling to the 
area "in a few years, when the security is improved and when 
malaria can be controlled." 
  It was not clear when Pailin's development would begin, when 
civilians would be allowed to settle there, or when the governor 
would be appointed. 
  Khan Savoeun was the commander of a regiment of formerly 
royalist guerrillas who had been allied with the Khmer Rouge but 
are now part of the coalition government fighting the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  He is viewed as having previously maintained the closest of 
relations with his former allies, but never actually joined the 
Khmer Rouge hierarchy. 
  Khan Savoeun's troops in the battle-scarred district of 
Stoung in central Kompong Thom province were reported by UN 
peacekeepers to have aided the Khmer Rouge in breaking the 
ceasefire well after the signing of the Paris peace accords 
formally ended the civil war in 1991. 
  He became deputy interior and public security minister 
following the UN-run elections in May 1993 as part of a 
power-sharing arrangement between the monarchists, led by Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and the former communists headed by Hun Sen. 
The two share the prime minister's portfolio. 
  Im Chhunlim is a member of Hun Sen's party.

  [Text] Leopoldo Mabilangan, alias Comrade Hector, former 
spokesman of the Merlito Glor Command [of the New People's Army] 
based in Mt. Banahaw, was shot dead by unknown assailants in 
Batangas yesterday [3 April]. A witness said Mabilangan was 
preparing to attend a wedding ceremony in Santo Tomas Church 
when he was shot. Police Chief of Staff General Percival Adiong 
said the killing of Mabilangan would be thoroughly investigated. 
He said the murder would affect peace talks between communist 
rebels and the government. Doctors said Mabilangan had three 
gunshot wounds, under his head, face, and neck. 
  Meantime, Malacanang [presidential office] condemned the 
killing of Comrade Hector Mabilangan, saying it can set back the 
government's search for peace. Press Secretary Jesus Sison said 
that President Ramos, who has been informed about the killing, 
was determined to see to it that the peace process will not be 
adversely affected. 
  DILG [Department of Interior and Local Government] Secretary 
Rafael Alunan III deplored the killing of Mabilangan. Alunan 
said the killing was an affront to the citizenry, who upholds 
the value of human life and the preeminence of civil order over 
any form of criminality. He expressed the government's 
determination to pursue the program of peace with the 
collaboration of the enlightened leadership of the rebel groups. 
  House Speaker Jose De Venecia and former National 
Unification 
Commission member Eduardo Ermita were also saddened by 
Mabilangan's killing. De Venecia has regretted that Comrade 
hector had to die at the height of his efforts to improve the 
lives of his people. He urged authorities to facilitate 
investigation of the killing and apprehend and punish the 
perpetrators of the crime. For his part, Ermita was hopeful 
that the killing will not be a hindrance to the ongoing peace 
process.

  [Text] The amnesty proclamation signed by President Ramos 
last Friday does not cover soldiers and policemen who committed 
human rights violations, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said 
yesterday [28 March]. 
  Drilon was reacting to the objections raised by the National 
Democratic Front (NDF) to Presidential Proclamation (PP) 348 
which offers amnesty to military and police personnel who may 
have committed acts punishable under the Revised Penal Code, the 
Articles of War or other special laws in connection with 
counter-insurgency operations. 
  Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chair for international affairs, 
said the proclamation was practically condoning the atrocities 
committed by government forces in the anti-insurgency drive. 
  But Drilon cited Section 1 of PP 348 which states that the 
amnesty does not cover soldiers and policemen who committed 
torture, arson, massacre, rape or other crimes against chastity, 
or robbery of any form. 
  These crimes are specifically listed as excluded in the 
proclamation because these acts "are not necessary in counter- 
insurgency operations," he said. 
  Drilon also noted that PP 348 was based on a draft submitted 
by the NUC [National Unification Commission] and that it was 
during discussions by the NUC that a "conscious decision" to 
exclude human rights violators was made by the commissioners. 
  Senator Rodolfo Biazon, meanwhile, chided rebel leaders who 
rejected the president's amnesty program on the ground that it 
did not result from peace talks. 
  "Their objections are irrelevant because they have no right 
to decide for those who have returned to the government fold and 
already out of their control and influence," he said. 
  Proclamation 347 offers amnesty to all rebels who have 
committed crimes in pursuit of their political beliefs. 
  The NDF and the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
[Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] have rejected the amnesty 
offer pending the outcome of the peace talks. 
  But Biazon, a member of the defunct National Unification 
Commission, explained that PP 347 applied only to those who have 
"opted to come out and lead a peaceful life." 
  Rebels are deemed to have "returned to the fold of the law" 
once they declare their intent to apply for amnesty, he added. 
  Drilon, who was also an NUC member and is an ex-officio 
member of the National Amnesty Commission (NAC), also dismissed 
the rebel leaders' position. 
  He said PP 347 did "not exclude the possibility of another 
amnesty proclamation." 
  The president himself had said the amnesty was being granted 
without prejudice to any legal arrangement that may result from 
a negotiated settlement which the government is pursuing with 
the various rebel groups. 
  Biazon said the amnesty covered rebel returnees who missed 
Proclamation 10 and 10-A issued in ]992 or will come out within 
six months after Congress approves PP 347. 
  He said those opposed to the latest round of amnesty, as 
drafted, will have to wait for the outcome of the peace talks. 
  "If the peace talks succeed, their case may be provided for 
through a negotiated settlement of the insurgency," Biazon said. 
  "If the talks fail and the rebel leaders decide to continue 
the armed struggle, government may still consider another round 
of amnesty proclamation for rebels who opt to end the fighting 
individually," he added. 
  The Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) also 
rejected the amnesty package for similar reasons. It said: 
  -- The fate of those applying for amnesty will still be 
decided on by the amnesty commission, and the NAC decision can 
still be questioned before the Court of Appeals. 
  "This tedious process negates one of the government's 
reasons 
for declaring its amnesty package, that is, to speed up the 
peace process." 
  -- It does not address the cases of political prisoners 
charged with or convicted of common crimes. This means that 80 
percent of them are automatically disqualified. 
  -- It covers government personnel who committed atrocities 
in 
the anti-insurgency campaign. "How can the release of the 
perpetrators of human rights violations contribute to a lasting 
peace?" 
  -- It preempts the outcome of the peace talks between the 
government and armed dissident groups. 
  The TFDP is pushing for a general, unconditional amnesty, 
which it said "must come after a negotiated political settlement 
and not before."

<F P=106> [By Joey Caburnida] </F>
  [Text] Amid continued disunity and factionalism in its 25 
years of fighting the government, the Maoist New People's Army 
(NPA) yesterday said that their comrades' bolting from the 
movement has not weakened the organization but has instead paved 
the way for them to further strengthen their revolutionary cause. 
  In a statement, NPA spokesman Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal 
said the removal of such former comrades as Rick Reyes, Arturo 
Tabara, Romulo Kintanar and Felimon Lagman was part of its 
rectification efforts. 
  At the same time, Rosal dismissed government pronouncements 
of the movement's pending extinction and described the fullblown 
schism in its ranks as a "temporary setback." 
  He vowed to carry on the fight to seize power from the 
government. The communist guerrillas have earlier rejected an 
amnesty offer made by President Ramos last week, saying it was 
meant to further divide the insurgents by luring their members 
surrender ahead of proposed peace talks. 
  "For as long as there is social injustice and until national 
freedom and democracy are achieved, the NPA will remain on the 
forefront of the people's armed struggle," Rosal said. 
  He added the NPA, its mother organization, the Communist 
Party of the Philippines, and its political arm, the National 
Democratic Front, have been implementing a rectification 
campaign to do away with their previous error of speeding up the 
process of insurrection and the undue haste with which the war 
from the countrysides to the cities was heightened. 
  He said Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar and Lagman refused to 
acknowledge the need to rectify such errors and had instead 
wanted to continue them. 
  He said the movement suffered from the assassination 
campaign 
waged by urban guerrillas against soldiers and policemen in the 
cities, which led to a public backlash. Rosal's faction favors 
small guerrilla units proselytizing and harassing military 
installations in the rural areas.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri, and Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat signed an 
agreement for the management and maintenance of the Thai-Lao 
Friendship Bridge in Vientiane, the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic today. The opening ceremony of the bridge will be 
held on 8 April. The major points of the agreement pertain to 
the administration and maintenance of the bridge and the 
establishment of management committees. The bridge has nothing 
to do with the Thai-Lao boundary, which is determined by the 
deepest channel of the river. Each side will have jurisdiction 
over half of the bridge and will collect toll fees at a similar 
rate. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong said that the bridge will provide 
convenience for the transportation of goods and benefit the 
economic development of the two countries. A committee will be 
set up to administer the bridge while another committee will be 
set up to oversee legal issues. The deputy governor of Nong 
Khai Province and six other persons will represent the Thai side 
in the committee, while the Lao side will include the deputy 
governor of Vientiane Municipality. The officials will set the 
date for opening the bridge to the public. Whether or not the 
two sides will cooperate to build other bridges depends on 
economic development. Part of the bridge has been prepared for 
laying rail tracks. 
  The Lao foreign minister believes that the opening of the 
bridge will help further develop the Lao economy. He admits 
that it may lead to positive and negative social changes in 
Laos. Such changes, however, could also take place even without 
the bridge. 
  Meanwhile, the Lao mass media also asked about efforts to 
arrest General Vang Pao who has reportedly fled into Thailand. 
Foreign Minister Prasong said that Thailand will not allow any 
person to use its territory to conduct inappropriate activities 
against neighboring countries. There has been no news because 
no arrest has been made. He did not think that the person was 
still in Thailand.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time Has Come To Admit Vietnam Into ASEAN"] </F>
  [Text] The honor guard at Hanoi's international airport has 
probably never been so busy. Since Washington lifted its 
three-decade-old economic embargo on Vietnam in February, the 
formerly shunned communist bastion has been besieged by 
diplomatic visitors. 
  Leading the rush, have been the heads of the Association of 
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all eager to look at 
investment prospects and assess Hanoi's ambitions to join their 
privileged group. Within the space of a little over a month, 
Vietnam has hosted visits from the secretary general of ASEAN 
and the leaders of Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. 
  Communist Party chief Du Muoi was a guest of Malaysia last 
week, and President Le Duc Anh is due to visit Indonesia in late 
April. The visits coincide with a diplomatic offensive on the 
part of Vietnam, which is trying to widen ties with ASEAN and 
pave the way for its own entry into the group. 
  The official exchanges mark the second major diplomatic 
offensive Vietnam has launched following the break up of the 
Soviet bloc. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
members between October 1991 and July 1992 as Vietnam searched 
for new economic partners. At the time, most observers 
predicted that it would be at least five years before Vietnam 
would be admitted. But in a reflection of the sweeping 
political changes that are occurring across the region, 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in Hanoi that 
he thought Vietnam may be formally discussed in 18 months. 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos was even more optimistic, 
calling for the immediate acceptance of Vietnam. 
  Political differences between communist Vietnam and the six 
capitalist ASEAN members have been swept aside with Hanoi's 
market reforms and the signing of the Cambodia peace agreement 
in 1991. 
  Goh said Vietnam's communist ideology was no obstacle to 
membership of the bloc, founded when most of its members were 
aligned against Hanoi during the Vietnam War. 
  "It (Vietnam's communism) should not be an obstacle," he 
said. "It depends on whether it can contribute to ASEAN." 
  Vietnam contends that its political system is not going to 
change anytime soon and that the important thing is stability 
for economic development, a line that fits in nicely with the 
way most ASEAN governments feel about the "soft autocratic" 
style of democracy they practice. 
  Other ASEAN officials have argued that the speed at which 
Vietnam is integrated will depend on the pace of its economic 
development and market reforms While Vietnam is about 30 to 40 
years behind Singapore and possibly some 20 years behind in 
development compared to the Philippines or Indonesia, the wide 
disparity within ASEAN itself would suggest that this is not an 
obstacle. 
  However, ASEAN officials have said that before membership 
can 
be granted, Hanoi must prove its ability to contribute to the 
group's technical projects and resolve administrative and 
financial obstacles. These include the need to boost English 
language skills and accounting practices. 
  Once again it seems ASEAN's ability to zero in on petty 
bureaucratic priorities when faced with the opportunity of 
taking bold action will only reinforce its reputation as a 
hide-bound forum for endless talk and little achievement. 
  Hanoi is upgrading its technical capabilities to accelerate 
its admission but ASEAN continues to talk of admitting Vietnam 
only at an "appropriate time" when it is sure it can make a 
contribution to the regional group. 
  In one frequently cited area, education, it is going to be 
years if not decades before Vietnam can contribute but in 
possibly the most important area -- security -- Vietnam is ready 
to make a valuable contribution now. 
  As Philippines President Fidel Ramos, Hanoi's only strong 
supporter in the regional grouping noted, Vietnam's 
"incorporation into ASEAN is an imperative of Southeast Asian 
peace, security and prosperity." 
  "Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become one 
of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force in 
the balance of power," Ramos said during his recent visit to 
Hanoi. 
  Of particular interest to Ramos and the Philippines is the 
dispute Spratly Islands. ASEAN has been reluctant to take an 
assertive stand on the atolls which are claimed in part by four 
of its members, as well as Vietnam, Taiwan and China and have 
long been regarded as the most likely source of conflict in the 
region. 
  In 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty in which the 
original ASEAN members pledged to settle their disputes 
peacefully. China refuses to sign the treaty and its use of 
force against Vietnam to settle claims in the South China Sea is 
becoming increasingly troubling. 
  ASEAN was born out of fear of the spread of communism and 
conflict from Vietnam. Whether it is a member of ASEAN or not, 
Vietnam remains crucial to continued peace and prosperity in the 
region. 
  By admitting Vietnam, ASEAN will be better placed to work 
toward a solution of the Spratly Islands issue and also prosper 
if the South China Sea can in the words of Ramos, "be 
transformed from waters of contention to an area of cooperation." 
  As ASEAN admits itself, Vietnam's membership is no longer a 
matter of policy or principle but merely procedure and time -- 
an that time has come.

  [Text] Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut 
issued a statement on 2 April in which he expressed opposition 
to the Thai Government's immediate repatriation of some 30,000 
Cambodian refugees to areas under Khmer Rouge control. He said 
he strongly protested the incorrect move taken by the Thai 
Government. He said it constituted a real violation of human 
rights. The statement was addressed to Sadako Ogata, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  Ogata, the Washington government, and humanitarian 
organizations formally protested the repatriation to the Thai 
Government but Thai leaders denied the allegation. 
  Cambodian refugees, mostly women and children, fled the 
fighting in Pailin after government forces took over the Khmer 
Rouge stronghold in the province on 19 March. The Thai 
military, however, insisted that the Cambodian refugees wanted 
to return to their respective areas under Khmer Rouge control. 
Nobody has been allowed into the area for observation. 
  The Cambodian foreign minister said that he profoundly 
regrets the Thai Government's inhuman act, which contradicts 
efforts by human rights organizations to achieve equality and to 
find a solution to human rights abuse. During his visit to 
Thailand last week for talks with the Thai Government on the 
problem of Cambodian refugees, the Cambodian foreign minister 
adopted an entirely different attitude regarding his reproach of 
the Thai Government.

<F P=106> [By Thada Mahapaoraya] </F>
  [Text] Thailand and the United States will hold talks 
tomorrow and Wednesday in Washington on an aviation agreement to 
replace one terminated by the Thai Transport and Communications 
Ministry four years ago. 
  The Thai delegation will be led by Transport and 
Communications permanent secretary Mahidon Chanthrangkun. Other 
members will include Civil Aviation Department director-general 
Dr Sisuk Chanthrangsu, Thai Airways International [THAI] 
president Thamnun Wangli, and Somnuk Hanphanit, THAI's 
vice-president for international relations. 
  The US side will be headed by Carl Candiff, the State 
Department's head of special negotiations for transport affairs. 
The team includes representatives from the Department of 
Transportation and members of national air carriers, a source in 
the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry said. 
  The Thai team will be listening closely to US proposals on 
implementing a new agreement the source said. 
  THAI believes that an open-skies policy would hurt Thailand, 
the source said. 
  "US carriers are anxious for the agreement since their 
flights to Thailand outnumber the flights THAI operates to the 
US." 
  THAI flies four times a week to Los Angeles and has no plan 
to increase flights until at least the end of 1994. 
  US airlines -- Northwest, United, Delta and Flying Tiger (a 
cargo carrier) -- operate 28 flights a week to Bangkok. 
  American Airlines also wants to enter the Southeast Asia 
market. 
  "Now they are flying under a seasonal agreement approved by 
the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry," said the 
source. "Under this agreement the US feels insecure, since they 
cannot make long-term plans and flight numbers will be frozen at 
28 per week which is insufficient to accommodate the growing 
numbers of passengers and cargo." 
  The source said this week's negotiations would be confined 
to 
broad principles.

  [Text] The Russian Embassy is upset that police released 
information that a missing diplomat had fled to the United 
States, police sources said. 
  "A Russian Embassy official rang up the police department 
today to communicate its displeasure that police supplied 
information about third secretary Igor Makeev's flight to the 
United States,'' he said. 
  "This created a negative image of Russia," the source quoted 
the embassy official as saying. 
  The source said police responsible for finding Makeev also 
took Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit to 
task for releasing the unconfirmed information. 
  "This is sensitive information, and in addition is still 
unconfirmed," the source said. 
  Makeev, 39, left his apartment in Bangkok's Soi Saladaeng 
with a laptop computer believed to contain secret embassy 
information on March 22. 
  Deputy police chief Pol. Gen. Phong-amat Amattayakun 
yesterday said the Russian Embassy had written to banking 
institutions and business concerns asking they cancel Makeev's 
credit card from March 25. 
  Phong-amat deplored the embassy's action: "The Russian 
Embassy is withholding information that we need, making it hard 
for us to locate Makeev." 
  Suspension of the credit card "makes it impossible for us to 
find out where Makeev makes payments using his card."

  [Text] Police believe the missing Russian diplomat, third 
secretary Igor Makeev, is still alive but his whereabouts is a 
mystery. 
  A high-level police officer, who requested anonymity, said 
yesterday after he was told of Mr. Makeev's disappearance that 
several police units had launched a search for him. 
  He was last seen leaving Ocean Apartment in Soi Saladaeng 
off 
Silom Road on March 22. 
  The Institute of Forensic Medicine confirmed that Mr. Makeev 
was not on the list of dead sent to the Police Hospital. 
  Since Mr. Makeev was also responsible for looking after 
Russian women in Thailand, the police went to bars and 
nightclubs in Soi Sawatdi off Sukhumwit Road but found no traces 
of the Russian. 
  The police are awaiting confirmation from the Immigration 
Police Bureau as to whether or not Mr. Makeev has left Thailand.

  [Text] A dissolution of the House is now inevitable if 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai wishes to block the Opposition's 
constitution amendment draft approved overwhelmingly by 
Parliament at its first reading Thursday. 
  Coalition sources said the decision by Parliament to endorse 
the Opposition draft, strongly criticized for being drafted 
hastily from the 1978 constitution, has made a dissolution 
unavoidable. 
  Mr. Chuan is expected to dissolve the Lower House before the 
draft passes it third reading if it appears the draft will be 
less democratic than the present charter, said one source. 
  A senior Democrat Party member said the Premier, after the 
Government's humiliating defeat in Parliament, sought a meeting 
with former prime minister Prem Tinsulanon at his home on 
Thursday. 
  He said Gen. Prem advised the Prime Minister to dissolve the 
House in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat. 
  The Opposition on Thursday managed to recruit Senate support 
in pushing through its constitution amendment proposal after the 
draft was accept for deliberation less than 24 hours earlier. 
  The bloc prepared the draft hastily by dusting off the l978 
constitution and inserting most of the 26 amendment points 
previously agreed to by the 10 political parties making up the 
coalition and Opposition. 
  But the Opposition removed those bills seeking to reduce the 
number of senators and their power, apparently to ensure the 
support of the Upper House for the bill. 
  "The Prime Minister will definitely not allow this 
disgraceful constitution draft to be put into use," said the 
source. 
  He said a dissolution was among measures discussed by 
government whips yesterday. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan also hinted at the 
possibility of a dissolution because of worries over future 
cooperation between the coalition and Upper House. 
  He said the Senate could vote against a key government bill. 
  Although he insisted the Senate vote for the Opposition's 
constitution draft was not unusual, Mr. Banyat admitted there 
could be grave problems if the Upper House should one day voted 
against a key government bill involving the distribution of 
power, the administration court or taxation. 
  "If these bills do not get the support of the Senate, we 
will 
really have to do some heavy thinking," said Mr. Banyat. 
  Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Charat 
Phuachuai 
said the extraordinary committee appointed Thursday to 
scrutinize the Opposition-sponsored amendment draft was expected 
to recommend that the second and third readings be held during 
the next House session from May and July. 
  He said the debate would start another political uproar. 
  "The draft may be amended in a way so as to become totally 
unacceptable to the people," he said. 
  "Under this scenario, the Prime Minister has only two 
political options -- either to resign or dissolve the House. I 
am quite confident that after the committee finishes its 
scrutiny, there will be a political change in the country." 
  Mr. Charat said it was widely known the opposition parties 
were trying their best to topple the Government. 
  Fellow Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Phinit 
Charusombat said a major change may be inevitable if the 
Opposition joins with senators in amending the Constitution to 
the extent where it becomes unacceptable to the public. 
  "The people should monitor developments closely," he said, 
but hoped a compromise could be reached. 
  Democrat Party secretary-general Sanan Kachonprasat ruled 
out 
any political change in the near future how ever, saying the 
party representatives on the scrutiny committee would do their 
best to ensure the opposition constitution draft is more 
democratic. 
  "Prime Minister Chuan is not the kind of person who submits 
easily to pressure. There is no political reason for the 
Premier to dissolve Parliament," he said. 
  Deputy Government Spokesman Sudarat Keyuraphan said her 
Phalang Tham Party may propose a dissolution if the details in 
the constitution amendments do not benefit the people. 
  Democrat MP Niphon Bunyamani said he was confident the Prime 
Minister would not allow the opposition amendment draft to be 
approved if it was unacceptable to the people. 
  "I think the Prime Minister will eventually have to return 
power to the people by dissolving Parliament as the Government 
has far fewer representatives on the scrutiny than Senate and 
Opposition combined," he said. 
  The government whips met yesterday morning and were later 
joined by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the other 
coalition parties. 
  Solidarity whip Ekkaphap Phosun said they discussed the call 
for a dissolution but thought it would be of no use since the 
Senate would not be dissolved as well. The charter amendment 
problem would also not have been addressed. 
  "We confirm the Government will continue to administer the 
country. If we cannot amend the charter this time, we will just 
resubmit the bills," he said. 
  "If we dissolve Parliament and the Opposition gets elected 
into the House, they will not amend the charter." 
  Mr. Ekkaphap said Mr. Chuan was asked why Defense Minister 
Wichit Sukmak voted with the Opposition Thursday and replied 
this showed the charter amendments were not a Government affair 
and there had been no lobbying of ministers who are senators. 
  The matter was left to the conscience of each 
parliamentarian. 
  Earlier, there had been calls from within the Democrat Party 
for House Speaker Marut Bunnak to be sacked after be scheduled 
the Opposition charter draft and for Gen. Wichit to be ousted 
for voting with the Opposition despite being a Cabinet minister. 
  New Aspiration Party leader Chawalit Yongchaiyut insisted 
the 
Government had not "lost face" through its defeat in Parliament. 
It is the people who will be affected, he said. 
  The Interior Minister said the Government would continue to 
push for the charter amendments. 
  Democrat MP Alongkon Pholabut said the Senate and Opposition 
vote showed disrespect for the people, but there was still time 
for them to remedy that during the scrutiny process. 
  "The power and number of senators constitute a large force 
and it goes against the wishes of the people to have senators 
hold the majority," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: `Dissolve House, Return Mandate to the People'] </F>
  [Text] On the face of it, the successive setbacks 
inflicted on the ruling coalition during the messy 
constitutional-amendment exercise last week underscore a serious 
miscalculation by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's government 
regarding the cohesiveness and political bias of the Senate. 
  The coalition had wanted to reduce the number of Senators as 
part of a larger package of proposed political reforms, 
purportedly to make the constitution more democratic. But 
coalition leaders did little homework in terms of lobbying or 
coordinating with members of the Upper House. 
  So when the full parliament convened its extraordinary 
session last Thursday, the Senators pulled the rug out from 
under the Government and threw their full support behind an 
alternative charter amendment draft submitted by the Opposition 
which contains most of the previously agreed to amendment points 
but minus the contentious Senate down-sizing. And when the 
Government's own draft on this very subject was raised the 
following day, it was -- not surprisingly -- scuttled by 
wholesale Senatorial abstentions. 
  But what is at stake here is not so much a case of the 
Senate 
flexing its muscles in an over-zealous exercise to protect its 
own turf. No one in his right mind would expect the Senators to 
vote in favor of a charter amendment draft that would reduce the 
number of their own peers and scale back their powers. Even 
with the increasing public scrutiny over the legitimacy of their 
existence, most probably still hold on to the constitutional 
edict that they remain the 'representatives', albeit 
non-elected, of the people. 
  What is far more disturbing is the combination of the 
insincerity and internecine bickerings among the elected members 
of the House, both coalition and Opposition. Their collective 
mishandling of this entire constitutional amendment episode has 
reduced the sanctity of the parliamentary system to naught. 
  The Democrat Party highlighted constitutional reforms as one 
of its main political platforms during campaigning for the 1992 
general elections. Indeed, many of the voters who cast their 
ballots for the Democrats at the time had probably expected the 
party to initiate changes in order to make the Constitution more 
democratic. 
  But despite its successful post-election emergence as the 
core party of the coalition, the Democrats did little to fulfill 
this electioneering pledge. Rather than exerting leadership and 
guidance, the Prime Minister instead passed the burden of 
constitutional amendments over to Parliament. What followed was 
a lengthy series of deliberations by a special parliamentary 
panel, interspersed with squabbling among the MPs of both 
benches. 
  When the coalition was finally forced to take action in the 
face of mounting public pressure for constitutional reforms, it 
decided to take the easy way out by tabling what it perceived to 
be the less contentious points to ensure smooth passage -- 
instead of picking substantive issues that would otherwise be 
needed to make the Constitution truly democratic. 
  If the efforts by the coalition were insincere and 
half-hearted, the fickleness by the Opposition alliance calls 
for stronger condemnation. It may be recalled that 
representatives of the coalition and Opposition originally 
agreed to amend only eight of the total 25 proposed changes, but 
the Opposition side subsequently broke ranks and insisted on 
tabling the total package in one go. 
  Acting once again under the apparent impulse of public 
pressures rather than genuine determination, the Government 
decided on the eve of the extraordinary parliamentary session to 
go along with the Opposition demand, but only to find out that 
the Opposition changed track at the last minute by proposing a 
different, alternative draft. It has become all-too apparent 
that, through its constant changes of heart, the fickle 
Opposition was more intent on out-scoring the Government and 
forcing a drastic political change such as the Government's 
resignation or parliamentary dissolution in the process -- 
rather than entertaining any genuine desire to make the 
Constitution more democratic. After all, the 1978 charter on 
which the Opposition draft is based is probably one of the least 
ideal models to follow. 
  Mr. Chuan and his Democrat colleagues can continue to try 
distancing themselves from the constitutional-amendment charade 
by blaming it on Parliament. But having been handed two 
humiliating defeats on two successive days, the Government has 
run into a political dead-end. The legitimacy of its existence 
as much as its ability to govern effectively is put into serious 
doubt. Under these circumstances, the most logical option for 
the Government is to dissolve Parliament and return the mandate 
to the people.

<F P=106> [Article by Humphrey McQueen: "Price to be Paid for US Free </F>
Trade] 
  [Text] Is the world moving towards less government 
regulation of trade or closer to an open trade war? In November 
last year, President Clinton hosted a meeting of all but one of 
the 15 heads of government from the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Co-operation forum. 
  On December 15, the latest round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade was signed. On New Year's Day 1994, the North 
American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada 
and Mexico came into being. Then, six weeks later trade 
negotiations between Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa 
failed to issue even a Zen resolution to try harder in future. 
  So, should the scoreboard be counted as three losses and one 
win for retaining national controls? No. All four need to be 
seen as part of a different game. Far from aiming at so-called 
freer trade, the quartet of tussles shared the single goal of 
re-establishing the dominance of US conglomerates across global 
markets. That is the reality behind the misnomer "free trade". 
  The failure of the Clinton-Hosokawa talks highlighted the 
substance and the limitations of APEC, GATT and NAFTA. To 
achieve dominance for US corporations, Washington needs to 
switch between seemingly contradictory approaches -- 
multilateralism through GATT, regionalism in NAFTA and 
bilateralism with Japan. The rhetoric behind GATT is that only 
multi-lateral trade deals are acceptable since regionalism and 
bilateral arrangements limit access to markets. US negotiators 
interpret that objective as applying only to regions and deals 
in which US firms are not the principal player. 
  Yet even US politicians can suffer from a surfeit of 
hypocrisy. Hence, instead of calling the body to replace GATT 
the multi-lateral trade organisation, Washington insisted on it 
being named the World Trade Organisation. That preference 
signalled how US trade negotiators do not intend to be limited 
to multilateralism. 
  Throughout these deals, deceits and disputes, the Australian 
Government kept investing its rhetoric in APEC. Yet, if Japan 
and the US can't agree between themselves, what chance is there 
that they and 13 others will come up with a workable trading 
community? Our interests would have been better served had 
Keating joined Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir in a boycott 
of APEC. The accusation of "recalcitrant" should have been 
aimed at the US administration. 
  Mendacity about the virtues of multilateralism was only one 
of the whoppers generated by those four commercial battles. The 
other big lie was the quantified benefits that were supposed to 
depend upon the successful conclusion of GATT and NAFTA. 
  When a writer on Britain's GUARDIAN newspaper looked back 
over those estimates, he discovered that GATT's first success 
had been a growth in its own promised benefits. A year before 
the compromise agreement, the boost to world output from a 
successful outcome had been put at $US100 billion ($140 billion). 
  Then, as GATT looked as if it would fail, the figure for 
expected growth in world economic activity began to inflate. It 
peaked at $US269 billion to be attained by the year 2002. What 
caused this expansion? The answer was the urgency to stimulate 
public pressure upon recalcitrant governments. 
  Similar propaganda needs accounted for the figures given out 
about NAFTA. The chief economic adviser to the secretary 
general of GATT said that the NAFTA numbers were being made up. 
  One creative economist admitted that his model depended on 
guesswork about how much capital would flow into Mexico. Making 
up the numbers runs counter to the assumption in "free-trade" 
dogma that markets cannot be managed by governments because they 
are unpredictable. 
  One critic of the NAFTA numbers racket observed that if 
economists could predict labour market outcomes seven years in 
advance, the centrally planned economies of the former Soviet 
bloc need never have imploded. 
  Are there to be no losers from GATT? Yes, but the only one 
listed was sub-Saharan Africa, marked to drop $US2.6 billion. 
However, the fine print did contain a warning which applies to 
the alleged winners as well. Estimates of increased growth took 
no account of the social costs that must flow from global 
corporations gaining greater power over national economies. 
  For example, Australia is supposed to make $US1 billion 
extra 
in export returns from improved access to world markets for our 
agricultural products. This alleged gain had to be balanced 
against the costs of unemployment after the closure of food 
plants in our country towns because of increased processed 
imports. Nor were environmental costs part of the GATT 
guesstimates. 
  Hence, even if the numbers concocted for GATT and NAFTA 
were, 
by some fluke, to turn out to be accurate, they still would 
offer no indication about the prices to be paid in achieving 
that growth.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Hostile Policy of Stifling DPRK Will Surely End in </F>
Failure, DPRK FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
released a statement Monday regarding a "presidential statement" 
the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] had adopted raising 
an unreasonable demand with the DPRK. 
  Following is the full text of the statement: 
  The United Nations Security Council called upon the DPRK to 
accept an unreasonable additional inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in a "presidential 
statement" on March 31 imposing an unjustifiable demand upon the 
DPRK. 
  Our "nuclear issue" is, by nature, not a topic for 
discussion 
at the UN Security Council. 
  We have already undergone inspection of our nuclear 
facilities, which was enough for the continuity of safeguards, 
as agreed with the United States and the IAEA. 
  There is no room for doubt in this regard. 
  Conflicting views, if any, in the course of the inspection, 
should have been solved on all accounts between the IAEA which 
was the actual inspector for the inspection and the country 
which was the object of inspection. 
  Nevertheless, the UN Security Council actually put on the 
agenda and discussed the inspection of the DPRK and adopted a 
"presidential statement". Why query clear is the essence of the 
matter. [sentence as received] 
  Out of its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK, the United 
States needed a forum of political debate, that is, the UN 
Security Council, and had to secure an expedient of pressure in 
the form of "presidential statement". 
  It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the 
UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to 
guarantee world peace and security discussed the issue of the 
DPRK on the basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced 
"conclusion" of the Board of Governors of the IAEA that the 
"scope of noncompliance with the safeguards agreement has 
expanded". 
  It is the present-day reality that the United States and 
some 
Western forces which hate our socialist system as a thorn in 
their flesh can freely manipulate international organisations, 
if necessary, in order to do harm to small countries like ours. 
  No one can deny this. 
  If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its 
mission, 
it should take issue with the United States which is gravely 
threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with a 
huge amount of nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution 
of the nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its 
henchmen. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council 
unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear 
activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are 
engaged in a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of 
the United States. 
  This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the 
hands of the United States in the latter's hostile policy of 
stifling the DPRK, applying double standards. 
  This time the UN Security Council took sides with the United 
States in its hostile policy against the DPRK by including the 
question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the 
"presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our 
"nuclear issue" on purpose. 
  The safeguards agreement virtually ceased to be effective 
from the moment when the DPRK temporarilly suspended the 
effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the sake of its talks with 
the United States. 
  Out of the desire to prove the transparency of our nuclear 
activities, we have so far accepted only inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards as a well-intentioned, voluntary step. 
  This was an inspection conforming to our special status. 
  As they could not deny this fact, the United States and the 
IAEA agreed to the DPRK-proposed inspection limited to one for 
the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc inspections 
of us pursuant to the safeguards agreement. 
  The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and 
additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for 
the DPRK which is now in a publicly recognized special status. 
  We do mean what we say. 
  We have consistently maintained a steadfast policy of 
independence and a correct line in external relations and never 
changed our once clarified position. 
  The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the 
unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope 
of partiality against the DPRK, flattering big countries, before 
demanding an additional inspection of it. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in 
further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining the 
United States in its intrigues against the DPRK. 
  We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for 
expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of 
making an apology. 
  Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised 
in stepping up the campaign for international pressure on our 
Republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the IAEA 
and the UNSC. 
  It is carrying into extremes its military pressure, 
threatening to resume "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and 
"make no scruple of a second Korean war". 
  Facts patently prove that the United States has no intention 
to solve the nuclear issue at all but chiefly seeks the aim of 
executing its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK by 
deliberately straining the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean authorities, following it, are trying to 
resume nuclear war exercises in league with the nuclear state 
against us at any cost, while continually shipping in nuclear 
weapons and putting spurs to their own nuclear development. 
  This virtually shows that the South Korean authorities have 
no regard for the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula" but are taking the criminal road of 
nullifying it. 
  Since the United States resorts entirely to pressure, 
reversing all its commitments with us, we have no alternative 
but to put on the normal track our peaceful nuclear activities 
which have been unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the 
UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can 
never work with us. 
  The more desperately the United States and its followers try 
to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more 
immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party, 
people and People's Army will increase. 
  It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with 
strength, and dialogue with dialogue. 
  The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is 
fated to be frustrated. 
  Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the 
nuclear issue.

  [Text] According to reports, a U.S. daily, THE WASHINGTON 
POST, reported on 31 March that U.S. Defense Secretary Perry let 
loose a war outburst [chonjaeng pogon] opposing us. 
  Babbling [todulda] about North Korea's fictitious nuclear 
development, the warmonger let loose a bellicose, reckless 
remark [mangbal] that the United States is prepared to stop 
nuclear development even at the risk of unleashing a war on the 
Korean peninsula. He cried [koadoeda] that the United States 
made a series of military preparations for it. 
  The warmonger clearly revealed a plot to isolate [korip], 
crush [apsal] us, and openly threatened [nogolchoguro wihyop] us 
by saying that the U.S. strategy is to take step-by-step 
pressures by isolating North Korea and that more serious 
measures will be taken in the future. 
  Perry frankly confessed that the spare parts for U.S. combat 
planes and ground crews were taken to military bases in South 
Korea and Japan, that the South Korean puppets are preparing 
some kind of weapons, and that preparations for deploying 
launching pads for Patriot missiles in South Korea are 
proceeding. He even let loose an open war outburst [nogolchogin 
chonjaeng pogon] without hesitation that the United States will 
strike an overwhelming aerial blow within 24 hours against 
someone's provocation. Perry raved [todulda] that he will have 
in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets during his planned 
junket [haenggak] to South Korea on not only simple military 
countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the military 
measures should be taken. In this way, he himself revealed that 
his junket is an out-and-out war junket aimed at giving a new 
order after examining war preparing troops in South Korea. 
  The warmonger's bellicose remark, which coincides with the 
U.S. bellicose class' commotions [sodong] aimed at pressuring 
the Republic, vividly shows that it is none other than the 
United States that leads the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to confrontation and war.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Pressure Cannot Be Method for </F>
Solution to Problem"] 
  [Text] According to a report, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry 
recently babbled about the so-called development of nuclear 
weapons by the North. He said that even at the cost of war that 
may be triggered on the Korean peninsula again, the United 
States will suspend the development of nuclear arms and it has 
made a series of military preparations for this. 
  Moreover, he unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent 
remarks on war that the United States will deal an overwhelming 
air strike against someone else's provocation within 24 hours. 
  These bellicose remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary should not 
be overlooked in view of the grave situation prevailing on the 
Korean peninsula today. 
  As is known to all, the United States totally reversed the 
agreement reached during the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York by 
presenting unreasonable excuses, instead of doing what it should 
have done according to this agreement, thus leading the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch. 
  By raving about resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear war 
exercise, the United States deployed in the advance area the 
U.S. naval fleet made up of 30 ships, including a mobile 
aircraft carrier unit, so that the fleet can reach the coast of 
our country within 24 hours. 
  In addition, Patriot missiles departed Texas, United States 
and are on the way to South Korea at the order of the U.S. 
President. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is working out a plan to 
deploy 600,000 troops, including two Marine corps divisions from 
the U.S. mainland; 200-odd ships and vessels, and 1,600-odd 
airplanes to the Korean peninsula within 80 days in an emergency. 
  Timed to coincide with this bustling military move, U.S. 
Defense Secretary made violent remarks about an overwhelming air 
strike, and so forth. This clearly shows the U.S. imperialists' 
intention to start a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula 
at last. 
  The United States raved that such military steps are to be 
taken because we are developing nuclear weapons. However, this 
is nothing but sophism designed to deceive the people and to 
justify its maneuvers of aggression by misleading public opinion. 
  As is known to all, the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula occurred when the United States began to bring nuclear 
weapons to South Korea. As the United States threatened our 
people with them, the problem has increased. 
  Nevertheless, the United States, the offender of a nuclear 
threat, laid blame on us, the sufferer, and expanded the war 
maneuvers in a step-by-step manner. This is an intolerable crime 
that is the same as a thief calling, "Stop thief!" These are 
stereotypical tactics used by the U.S. imperialists whenever 
they invade other nations. 
  As the whole world knows, all situations illustrate that the 
one who is blocking the road of a solution to the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United 
States and the ringleader who is driving the situation on the 
Korean peninsula into a phase of confrontation and war is none 
other than the United States. 
  The U.S. imperialists should correctly realize that they 
cannot solve the problem by a military threat and menace, nor 
can they frighten and bring our people to their knees. This is 
proven by historic facts, including the Korean war in the early 
1950's, the Pueblo incident in the 1960's, and the Panmunjom 
incident in the 1970's. 
  The time when the means of force worked disappeared a long 
time ago. The time when the United states could threaten and 
menace small nations by wielding military clubs as a almighty 
means and act like the international police is gone forever. 
  Moreover, the Korean people are not the people of the past 
when the nation was just liberated from the Japanese 
imperialists' colonial rule, but are the mighty and dignified 
people who shape their destiny independently by grasping it in 
their own hands. 
  Our people have a firm self-reliant national economy and 
strong defense capabilities to defend our-style socialism by 
smashing any aggressor in a stroke. Our people do not want war 
but are not afraid of war. 
  It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem 
through dialogue and negotiations. If the United States is truly 
interested in resolving the nuclear problem, it should not 
adhere to foolish military means and discard nuclear threats to 
us. It should first take a step to give up the policy of 
hostility against us. 
  If the United States, instead of doing this, advances along 
the road of provoking a war by further aggravating tension, the 
rascals will suffer only bitter defeat. If the Korean war in 
1950 was described as the beginning of a downward slope for the 
U.S. imperialists, a second Korean war will drive the U.S. 
imperialists into a corner from which they can never come out. 
  The United States should ponder the consequences to be 
brought about by its new war provocation maneuvers and should 
act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Yi Mong-ho, head of the 
DPRK Parliamentary Union delegation, speaking at the 91st 
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on March 25, 
warned that the United States should be held entirely 
responsible for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by 
its war moves. 
  Recalling that although four steps of simultaneous action 
were agreed upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York in 
February, the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations, 
leaving its promise an empty word, he said: 
  "The United States frustrated the third round of DPRK-USA 
talks with the far-fetched argument that the inspection of the 
DPRK by the International Atomic Energy Agency was not 
satisfactory, and decided to deploy Patriot missiles in South 
Korea, threatening the resumption of 'Team Spirit' joint 
military exercises. 
  "We will not regard it as our duty any longer to guarantee 
the continuity of safeguards since the United States and the 
IAEA intentionally distorted the results of inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards and are abusing them as an excuse for 
increasing pressure on our Republic. 
  "The attempt of the United States and some Western countries 
to put pressure on us through the UN Security Council hampers a 
complete solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
and compels us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT). 
  "We will have no other choice but to carry into practice the 
measures laid down in the March 12, 1993, statement of the 
government of our Republic in order to defend the national 
sovereignty and security of the country. 
  "A grave situation which may lead to confrontation and war 
has been created on the Korean peninsula again, and it is our 
stand to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with war under such 
situation." 
  Speaking at the conference that day, a member of the DPRK 
Parliamentary Union delegation said the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula must be solved through DPRK-USA talks because 
it is the United States that introduced nuclear weapons into 
South Korea and has threatened the DPRK and invented a fiction 
of "suspected nuclear development" of the North. 
  "Pressure, threat and sanctions can neither be a solution to 
the problem, nor will they work with our people," he stressed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Political and public 
circles of the world denounced the United States' unjustifiable 
pressure on Korea and expressed solidarity for the Korean 
people's cause of justice. 
  Juan Ramos, general secretary of the Communist Party of the 
Peoples of Spain, expressed firm solidarity for the just 
struggle of the Korean people, saying they should never yield to 
the unreasonable demand of the United States, when he received 
the permanent representative of the DPRK to the World Tourism 
Organization on March 28. 
  Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism) in a 
statement March 27 said it was ridiculous of the United States 
to raise a clamor for "sanctions" and war racket against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He demanded that all 
outside forces immediately give up pressure and threats against 
Korea. 
  The Communist Party of Chile in a statement March 28 
expressed full support to the measure taken by the DPRK 
Government to defend the sovereignty of the country and the 
dignity of the nation. 
  Ali Hassan, general secretary of the Supreme Council of the 
Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in Lebanon, at a meeting 
held on March 24, and David Baz, former chairman of the party, 
in a statement March 22, called upon all the political parties 
and organizations and the peaceloving people of the world to 
launch a solidarity movement in support of the just struggle of 
the Workers' Party and people of Korea. 
  The political department of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in a statement March 23 demanded that the U.S. 
Administration immediately give up its nuclear threats against 
the DPRK and seek a peaceful, fair solution to the nuclear 
issue through direct dialogue with the DPRK. 
  Juan Mariategui, director of the Peruvian Institute for Non- 
Alignment and African Studies, in a press statement published 
that day, stressed that the United States must try to find a 
solution through negotiation, not by means of pressure, and Om 
Prakash Mantri, secretary general of the Asian regional 
committee to support Korea's reunification, in a statement on 
the same day, urged the United States to renounce the 
anachronistic idea that it could solve problems by means of 
military strongarm and strength.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- An anti-U.S. 
demonstration was staged in London on March 26 to condemn the 
United States for aggravating the situation of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Taking part in the demonstration were representatives of 
some 
20 political parties and organizations including the New 
Communist Party of Great Britain, the Britannic Communist Party, 
the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain 
(Marxist-Leninist), the Revolutionary Communist Group of Great 
Britain, the British Anti-Imperialist Youth Organization and the 
British Organization of Solidarity with the Third World. 
  They staged a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy for 
hours, 
strongly urging Washington to stop at once threat to the DPRK 
and the "Team Spirit" and all other actions of military 
provocation. 
  The protesters contended that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean 
peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Speeches were made by some representatives during the 
demonstration. 
  Hugh Stephens, representative of the Britain-Korea 
Friendship 
Committee, in his speech called for the formation of a 
nonpermanent organization to defend the DPRK, noting that the 
prevailing situation was demanding a more organized movement to 
defend socialist Korea from the imperialists' moves to provoke 
another war.

Strike Exercise and Gunfiring Against North" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets on March 31 hurled fighter planes 
of various types including F-15s and FA-18s into the skies above 
Nyongwol, Wonju and Chunchon and staged an exercise of surprise 
strike at targets in the midst of electronic jamming, according 
to military sources. 
  In separate action that day, large-calibre artillery groups 
and heavily-armed bandits of the puppet army took firing 
positions in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, 
Phaju and Ryonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, and kicked up a 
war frenzy, firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000 large-calibre 
machinegun bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone along 
the Military Demarcation Line. 
  On the same day, the puppets deployed scores of 
large-calibre 
guns in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and 
brought some 500 armed bandits into areas near Rinje and 
Ryonchon Counties. 
  Some ten helicopter gunships and transport helicopters of 
the 
puppet army flew into the skies above Ryonchon and Phochon and 
Cholwon, areas under the very nose of the North side's portion 
for a frantic exercise of support to ground attack and war 
materiel airlifting.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets 
staged a surprise strike exercise and gunfiring to invade the 
North in the midst of electronic jamming. According to a 
military source, the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets 
staged a surprise strike exercise to invade the North in the 
midst of electronic jamming on 31 March. F-15 fighter bombers, 
FA-18 pursuit assault planes, EA-6 electronic jamming planes, 
which arrived from overseas bases, and fighter planes under the 
control of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea and the 
puppet Air Force were committed on a large scale. 
  On the same day, electronic jamming planes, which hurled 
into 
the skies above Yongwol, Wonju, and Chunchon from a base in 
Japan, caused electronic jamming in this area. Also, strike air 
corps were called to frantically stage a surprise strike 
exercise on the targets. Thus, a violent warlike atmosphere was 
kicked up. 
  This war exercise was a commotion of playing with fire aimed 
at enhancing the actual combat capabilities for a cooperative 
surprise strike to invade the North through the electronic 
jamming planes. In addition, the South Korean puppets were 
running amuck in gunfiring and helicopter operation exercises at 
the front line, right in front of our face. 
  On 31 March the puppet Army's large-caliber artillery groups 
and heavily armed hooligans, who took firing positions 
throughout the area of Naedae-ri and (Kwanu)-ri, Cholwon County, 
South Korean Kangwon Province, and (Pangmok)-ri, Paju County, 
and Majon-ri and Tanjung-ri, Yongchon County, Kyonggi Province, 
kicked up a war frenzy by firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000 
large-caliber machine gun bullets near the Demilitarized Zone 
along the Military Demarcation Line. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed scores of 
large-caliber guns around the area of Chupa-ri, Cholwon County, 
South Korean Kangwon Province, and dragged in some 500 armed 
hooligans into the area near Susan-ri, Inje County and 
(Kangnae)-ri, Yonchon County. Also on this day, some 10 armed 
helicopters and transport helicopters of the puppets were 
running amok after being mobilized in the skies over Yonchon, 
Pochon, and Cholwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, right in 
front of our face, in support of ground attacks and airlifting 
of war material. 
  At a time when the U.S. imperialists are applying 
unreasonable pressure to implement nuclear inspections of our 
Republic and are deploying, on a large scale, up-to-date weapons 
to South Korea, what is becoming all the more serious is the 
fact that all of these frenzy commotions of playing with fire by 
the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets are driving the 
situation of the Korean peninsula toward a dangerous phase.

flying corps of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the 
puppet Air Force, according to military sources. 
  Meanwhile, tank groups and armed bandits of the puppet Army

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets on 1 April perpetrated 
another round of provocative joint air war exercises against the 
North. 
  That day, formations of overseas-based pursuit-assault 
planes 
and VTOL [vertical take off and landing] assault planes of the 
U.S. Marines frenziedly staged surprise attack exercises on 
strategic objects in the Northern half of the Republic in 
coordination with airplanes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea 
and the puppet Air Force, thus instigating an atmosphere of war. 
  This frenzied playing with fire, staged for a long in the 
skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Oeyon islet and Chongju, was 
designed to examine coordination striking capabilities of 
various types of military aircraft of the U.S. Marines and 
airplanes of the U.S. Air Force and the puppet Air Force against 
the North. 
  Meanwhile, tank groups of the puppet Army, which were 
mobilized and deployed in Kumpari, Paju County, fired scores of 
tank guns at areas in Hapo-ri on the other side of Imjin River, 
and armed hooligans of the puppet Army who occupied combat 
positions in Pangmong-ri fired hundreds of large-caliber machine 
gun bullets while advancing toward the Military Demarcation Line. 
  This shows that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets are recklessly rushing ahead toward a war against the 
North.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Only Death Will Be Given to </F>
Provokers"] 
  [Text] The war hysteria of the South Korean puppets for 
the new war provocation has reached an extreme point. As was 
already reported, the so-called puppet prime minister -- who 
visited the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff on 25 March and openly 
agitated for national reunification through a northward invasion 
by ordering it to be in thorough readiness -- visited the puppet 
frontline Army units on 26 March and the police stations in 
Seoul on 27 March and ordered them to assume a thorough 
readiness, to thoroughly maintain public peace and order, and to 
be alert. This shows how the puppets are unsteady in their mind 
for their Northward invasion. 
  As everyone knows, the present situation on the Korean 
peninsula is rushing to the dangerous phase of a touch-and-go 
situation [ilchokchugbalui wihomhan kungmyon]. The puppets, who 
intentionally blocked North-South dialogue, held successive 
meetings -- such as the so-called meeting of security-related 
ministers and the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- to 
formulate war plots as if they are waiting for an opportunity 
and have babbled about a so-called retaliation or the security 
posture. Also, they have decided on the deployment of Patriot 
missiles to South Korea and on the resumption of the Team Spirit 
nuclear war exercise and ordered all puppet armed forces to be 
put on alert. 
  In this situation, the Kim Yong-sam clique visited the 
Japanese reactionaries and plotted to crush [apsal] our republic 
in collusion with outside forces, thus talking about the 
cooperative system or sanctions. 
  Also, the United States has largely mobilized its aggressive 
arms, including nuclear aircraft carriers, to South Korea and 
the sea areas surrounding South Korea. By so doing, the United 
States conducts nuclear war exercises -- in the sky, land, and 
sea of South Korea -- aimed at us every day. These serious 
situations created by the South Korean puppets, with the U.S. 
imperialists, will never be a thing that can be overlooked. 
  According to the recent remarks by the puppet national 
defense minister, the puppets formulated a northward invasion 
war plan, the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, made up of a 
five-stage operational concept, with the United States in 
September 1993. The bustling military movement that has been 
shown recently in South Korea is a part of its schemes to put 
the adventurous Northward invasion war plan into practice. 
  After artificially creating an obstacle to the working-level 
delegate's contacts for the exchange of special envoys appointed 
by the North-South highest authorities, the puppets have finally 
broken them up. Needless to say, it is clear that their purpose 
is a deliberate plot based on their criminal intention to do 
harm to the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces 
under the so-called nuclear issue. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is the servant of the U.S. 
imperialists' nuclear war, as well as the vicious national 
betrayers who want to maintain their dirty lives in return for 
their act of making the nation become the victim of a nuclear 
war, thus only being a shock brigade for the imperialists' war 
of aggression regardless of the destiny of their country and 
nation. It is natural that trouble causes trouble. 
  As shown by all these facts, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique 
has actually plotted to provoke the northward invasion war and 
to ignite a fire on the point of a war. Under these conditions, 
there is no guarantee that a war will not be waged in any place 
on the Korean peninsula [chosonbandoeso chonjaengi tojiji 
anhuriranun tambonun odiedo opsupnida]. 
  In collusion with outside forces, the Kim Yong-sam ring has 
plotted to irritate [kondurida] our republic by eagerly seeking 
an opportunity for the northward invasion. These are foolish 
and indiscriminate remarks and acts. 
  Our people want peace, but will not beg for it. Also, they 
do not want war, but will never be afraid of it. If the puppets 
force us to carry out war, our people and our People's Army will 
rise up as one to retaliate the aggressors in tens thousandfold 
and safeguard socialism of our own style to the end. Only a 
bitter defeat and tragic death will be given to provokers. This 
is a lesson learned from the Korean war waged in the early 
1950's. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that their 
war provocation is just the way to their shameful destruction, 
and they must not act recklessly.

<F P=106> ["War Racket Precipitating Self-Destruction" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam recently issued a "special alert order" to the puppet 
army, crying for "perfect" war preparations against the North 
through the "cooperation system" with the United States. The 
puppet prime minister openly incited "unification through 
Northward march" and the puppet defence minister opened to the 
public a new war scenario against the North codenamed New 
Operation Plan-5027. 
  Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says: 
  The ill-boding military moves in South Korea are so grave 
that they cannot be overlooked. This shows the puppet clique is 
driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the dangerous 
brink of war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of the most treacherous 
political charlatans and warmaniacs who depend most heavily upon 
outside forces among the successive puppet rulers. 
  As long as there are such fools who stoop to any infamy 
against fellow countrymen for the sake of the interests of 
outside forces, the nation cannot avoid misfortune." Such 
traitors must be removed from the nation in time. 
  If the South Korean puppets continue military provocations 
and unleash a war in collusion with outside forces, they will 
have to pay dearly. 
  The Korean people and People's Army will deal a severe 
retaliatory blow at the aggressors if they dare provoke the 
socialist motherland. 
  The South Korean puppets must look straight at the reality 
and refrain from rash acts.

Perry in protest of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to 
South Korea and by shouting a slogan, "Yankee go home!" 
  The students denounced that Perry aggravated tension on the 
Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of U.S. Patriot 
missiles to South Korea. They stated that North Korea denounced 
the deployment of Patriot missiles as an act of war against 
Pyongyang. 
  The students burned a portrait of Perry and models of 
Patriot missiles in a park in downtown Seoul. As a result, black 
smoke rose to the sky and the U.S. flag was tumbled all about on 
the ground. 
  About 200 police assumed a guard posture to block the park 
in an attempt to check the students' street demonstrations. 
  Some protesters, wearing masks, shouted the slogan, "We 
oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles!" 
  Approximately 400 riot police with shields and clubs were 
standing in front of the U.S. Embassy in the center of Seoul to 
repress possible disturbances. 
  In the past students have burned the U.S. flag and staged 
demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy opposing U.S. 
policies.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Some 500 students 
affiliated with the "South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils" (Hanchongnyon) staged an anti-U.S. demonstration in 
front of the 8th Army Command of the U.S. imperialist aggression 
forces in South Korea on Saturday evening, according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  They continued the protest for more than one hour, shouting 
"We oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles" and "Yankee go 
home". 
  Meanwhile, an estimated 2,000 students, at the second 
congress of deputies to Hanchongnyon held at Pusan National 
University on April 2 and 3, unanimously resolved to check a 
"parliamentary ratification" of farm market opening, accusing 
the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of opening the market. 
  They decided to hold a mass rally in Seoul, stage a boycott 
at all universities and colleges across South Korea and launch 
into an indefinite hunger sit-down of some 200 Hanchongnyon 
cadres in front of the puppet National Assembly hall, with the 
"extraordinary National Assembly session" due in mid-April, to 
carry their resolve into practice. 
  It was also decided at the congress to hold an all-citizens 
rally against the farm market opening.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- Some 500 students 
staged a strong anti-U.S. demonstration at a park in central 
Seoul on April 2, protesting the U.S. plans to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, according to a foreign press report 
from Seoul. 
  The students accused the United States of heightening 
tensions on the Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of 
U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  The raged students burned a painting of U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry, models of Patriot missiles and U.S. 
flags, shouting the slogans "Yankee go home" and "No Patriot 
missiles". Black smoke billowed into the air as the students 
burned the painting and models of Patriot missiles with the U.S. 
flags drawn on the sides. 
  About 200 police were on alert to prevent the students from 
marching into the streets. But they did not yield to it. 
  Upset by the anti-U.S demonstration of the students, the Kim 
Yong-sam pro-American flunkeyist traitorous clique posted more 
than 400 riot police in front of the U.S. Embassy, making 
itself open to criticism.

Against Rice Market Opening" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The struggle of the 
South Korean students against the "parliamentary endorsement" of 
"the Uruguay-Round accord enforcement plan" including rice 
market opening is a most righteous patriotic action, stresses 
NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  It says: 
  Handing over the whole rice market of South Korea to outside 
forces by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a treacherous act to 
prolong his dirty remaining days as a colonial lackey by selling 
off the interests of the country and the nation. 
  It is the unshakable will of the South Korean students and 
people to overthrow the treacherous group, not yielding to any 
suppression by the "civilian" dictators. Their fighting spirit 
cannot be broken by any fascist bayonet.

<F P=106> ["Closing remarks" by Comrade Kye Ung-tae, member of the </F>
Political Bureau and secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea 
Central Committee, at the national meeting of party cell 
secretaries held at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in Pyongyang on 2 
April -- recorded] 
  [Text] The meeting of cell secretaries of the whole party, 
which was held amid great interest and expectation of party 
members and people across the country, will complete its work 
today after successfully discussing the raised problems with 
lofty political zeal and active participation of comrade 
delegates. 
  The current conference proudly summed up the achievements 
and 
experience attained in implementing programmatic tasks put 
forward by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic 
letter, "Let us strengthen the party cells," to the participants 
at the national lecture meeting for party cells held on 10 May 
1991. The current conference also discussed the issue of making 
all party cells a militant organization that is unswervingly 
loyal to the party and to the leader [suryong] and that 
tenaciously defends, protects, and further glorifies the 
socialist cause. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song personally sent a 
congratulatory message to the conference and extended great 
trust and honor to the delegates of the conference and to all 
party cell secretaries of the whole party. He provided us with 
programmatic guidelines -- the militant banner -- which we 
should firmly grasp in further enhancing the militant functions 
and role of party cells in compliance with the demand of our 
party and development of the revolution. [applause] 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il personally promoted a 
conference of cell secretaries of the whole party this year -- a 
revolutionary epoch-making year when socialist construction in 
our country will enter a phase of new development -- and 
scrupulously guided the whole course from preparation to 
operation of the conference. He extended great trust and 
boundless benevolence to the delegates of the conference. 
[applause] 
  The current conference of cell secretaries of the whole 
party 
was a meeting of single-hearted unity that demonstrated the 
invincible might of our party, which is firmly rallied behind 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the destiny of our party, 
the revolution, socialism, and symbol of all of our victories; 
and behind the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, based on 
loyalty and filial piety. The current conference was a meeting 
of loyalty that highly displayed the revolutionary faith and 
indomitable will of cell secretaries of the party to tenaciously 
defend, protect, and further glorify the socialist cause -- the 
party's cause -- without a slight degree of wavering even amid 
complex situations. [applause] 
  Indeed, the current conference was a historic meeting that 
provided an important milestone in constantly strengthening and 
developing our party by enhancing the functions and role of the 
party cells and in further consolidating our socialist 
encampment. This conference will be brilliantly embroidered in 
the glorious history of our party. [applause] 
  By deeply cherishing the party's lofty trust in and great 
benevolence to cell secretaries of the party, the delegates to 
the conference should make active efforts to make all party 
cells the loyal party cells that are endlessly loyal to the 
party and to the leader by thoroughly carrying to accomplishment 
the five-point tasks put forward by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song for the party cells, and the militant tasks put forward 
by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his letter to the 
participants of the national lecture meeting of party cells in 
May 1991. They should strive to make all party cells the 
militant party cells that vigorously organize and mobilize party 
members and workers into the struggle to tenaciously defend, 
protect, and further glorify the socialist cause. [applause] 
  Cell secretaries of the party should substantively carry out 
political indoctrination work to foster all party members to be 
genuine loyalists and dutiful sons unswervingly loyal to the 
party and to the leader. They should carry out organizational 
work and guidance work for party members in accordance with the 
new demand of the prevailing situation and the development of 
the realities. Thus, they should further consolidate the 
single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks. 
  By upholding the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously 
accelerate the general march of socialism with the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle" among party 
members and workers, the party cells and cell secretaries should 
vigorously carry out organizational and political work for 
thorough accomplishment of the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. They should continually effect innovations and advance 
with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima 
and should highly display the superiority and vitality of 
socialism in our country. 
  The party cells and cell secretaries should thoroughly carry 
to accomplishment the party's military line and should direct 
great efforts to make firm political, ideological, military, 
technological and material preparations so they can smash at a 
stroke the U.S. imperialists' provocation at any time. 
  I am firmly convinced that all party cell secretaries who 
are 
attending this conference will keenly realize honorable yet 
their responsible missions and duties before the party and 
before the revolution as responsible figures for the basic 
organizations of the party, will firmly establish the monolithic 
leadership system of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the 
whole party and whole society, will strengthen and develop our 
party into the everlasting glorious chuche revolutionary party, 
and will actively contribute to brilliantly accomplishing the 
socialist cause, the party's cause. I now declare the meeting of 
cell secretaries of the whole party closed. [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The national conference 
of party cell secretaries which was held in Pyongyang from March 
31 to April 2 was a historical conference which marked an 
occasion of a new turn in further strengthening and developing 
the Workers' Party of Korea and successfully accomplishing the 
socialist cause of chuche by enhancing the function and role of 
the party cells in compliance with the developing reality, 
declares NODONG SINMUN today in an editorial. 
  The editorial says: 
  It was a proud conference which fully demonstrated the 
wisdom 
of the guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who have strengthened the 
cells and other basic organizations of the party and built up 
the party to be an impregnable one by founding the 
chuche-oriented idea of party building and energetically guiding 
the struggle for its materialization. It also demonstrated the 
revolutionary faith and unshakable will of all the party cell 
secretaries and party members to complete the building of 
Korean-style socialism with the might of singlehearted unity. 
  Today the party cell secretaries remain faithful to the 
leadership to the party and the leader and are successfully 
discharging their noble mission and duty in increasing the 
party's might and carrying forward the revolutionary cause of 
chuche. 
  The conference powerfully demonstrated that the WPK with 
hundreds of thousands of militant cells unfailingly loyal to the 
party and the leader is an ever-victorious, veteran and 
experienced party, a great party that leads the cause of 
independence in our age to victory, smashing any anti-socialist 
moves. 
  The editorial calls on the whole party, the entire people 
and 
all the Army to turn out as one in the struggle for frustrating 
all the provocative moves of the imperialists and defending and 
developing Korean socialism like an impregnable fortress, united 
in one mind around the great General Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Many delegates to the 
national conference of party cell secretaries including those 
who were awarded the title of labour hero of the DPRK and 
honored with letters of commendation from the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, met here Sunday with Yi In-mo, a former 
war correspondent of the Korean People's Army and veteran party 
member who is widely known as the incarnation of faith and will. 
  Upon meeting them, Yi In-mo recalled the days right after 
the 
liberation of the country when he was making strenuous efforts 
to rouse people of broad strata to the struggle for democratic 
reforms including the agrarian reform, upholding the line of 
nation building set forth by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song. 
  He said he told his comrades who were with him in South 
Korea 
and visitors that his birthday is October 10, the founding 
anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. "I did so," he went 
on, "not because I forgot my birthday, but because I wanted to 
celebrate the party founding anniversary together with the 
people of the homeland, remembering at any time and in any place 
that I am a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, and always 
thinking of the party." 
  He said each time the enemy tried to force him to write a 
"paper of ideological conversion" he tore it to pieces and threw 
them at their faces, his mind crowded with thought of our 
general and consciousness of being a party member. 
  Noting that the great leader and the dear leader are the 
greatest in the world, he asked the party cell secretaries to do 
a lot of more work, remaining loyal subjects who uphold Comrade 
Kim Chong-il with unquestioned worship. 
  The visitors vowed to hold President Kim Il-song and Comrade 
Kim Chong-il in high esteem and follow them, build their party 
cells well and constantly strengthen and develop them, as Yi 
In-mo asked them to.

<F P=106> ["Great Optimism" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- We will never abandon 
the road of truth, our own choice, but advance along it to its 
very end. This is the faith and pluck of our party and people 
and a great optimism of general Kim Chong-il", declares NODONG 
SINMUN Sunday in a political essay titled "Great Optimism". 
  The political essay quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il as saying: 
  "We must derive a proper lesson from the setback faced by 
socialism in some countries and resolutely reject all the 
slander levelled by fools, and we must advance more vigorously 
towards the bright future of humanity, displaying such 
intelligence and courage as to turn misfortune into a blessing." 
  This proposition arms all of us with great optimism, the 
political essay says, and goes on: 
  Let us display such intelligence and courage as to turn 
misfortune into a blessing and more vigorously advance towards 
the bright future of humanity. 
  This is the unshakable faith and iron will of the dear 
leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il that no matter what storm may rage and what 
adverse current may sweep the globe, the direction of the 
development of history can never be changed and justice and 
truth will win, so will socialism without fail. 
  We are watching with pride and optimism socialism, which the 
imperialists said met its "end", advancing with irresistable 
force through ordeals and adversity. 
  The signs of decline and downfall of imperialism which was 
bluffing and the throes and confusion of the doctrine of return 
to bourgeois past under the cloak of "reform" and peoples under 
the banner of socialism, the banner of independence, and 
socialist Korea making a long drive. What do all these stark 
facts show query [incomplete sentence as received] 
  They show the immovable historical law that justice and 
truth 
win while injustice and falsehood go to ruin, that socialism is 
sure to win while imperialism is fated to destruction. 
  The collapse of socialism in some countries and the end of 
Cold War are by no means "victory" of capitalism and imperialism. 
  True socialism does not suffer a setback or collapse. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the incarnation of 
faith and will and of intelligence and courage and a great 
defender of justice and truth, who is defending the cause of 
socialism with such rare intelligence and courage as to turn 
misfortune into a blessing, possessed of iron will and faith 
that justice and truth are sure to win in whatever adversity. 
  The dear leader has further strengthend and developed the 
Workers' Party of Korea, the guiding force of the Korean people, 
into an ever-victorious revolutionary party and the Korean 
People's Army, which is the destiny of the people, into 
a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary army and achieved the 
unbreakable singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the 
masses, the eternal viability of socialism, thereby building 
Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses into an 
impregnable fortress of socialism, the invincible bulwark. 
  Socialism is the ideal of mankind and great justice. 
  Unthinkable is a world without socialism and a world without 
justice.

  [Text] Vietnam Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is to visit 
Cambodia to further strengthen friendly cooperation. It's the 
first official visit to Cambodia of a leader of the Vietnamese 
Government since Cambodia approved its Constitution to establish 
the new Royal Government. 
  This is to take place following the two years of activities 
in bilateral relations. In late 1993, the first and second 
prime ministers of Cambodia, Mr. Ranariddh and Mr. Hun Sen, paid 
an official visit to Vietnam, and in early March this year, 
Chairman of the Cambodian Parliament Samdech Chea Sim also 
visited Vietnam. Early this week, the two co-defense ministers 
of Cambodia were also present for an official friendship visit. 
Meanwhile, many Vietnamese high-ranking state and government 
delegations also went to Cambodia, including the trip made by 
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
  These activities demonstrate positive developments in 
relations between the two countries, who have had long, 
traditional ties. Vietnam has always respected the Paris 
agreement on Cambodia. Vietnam has also reserved goodwill and 
sincere support for Cambodian people's efforts to overcome all 
trials to achieve national reconciliation and reconstruction. 
For this very reason, the Government of Cambodia has attached 
great importance for the preservation and development of 
friendly relations with Vietnam and neighboring countries, 
considering it an important goal of Cambodian foreign policy. 
  However, there remains a number of pending issues, 
especially 
the interest and security of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. 
This question must be solved properly in the interest and the 
aspiration of the people of both countries, in face of the 
increasing massacre of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia by the 
Khmer Rouge. The two sides have agreed to solve the question 
through peaceful negotiation. 
  The coming visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will be an opportunity for the two sides to deal with this 
problem and also create conditions for further developments of 
comprehensive bilateral cooperation. Vietnam and Cambodia will 
sign a number of agreements on economic cooperation, trade, 
culture, and education. These are legal documents for bilateral 
cooperation. 
  With the visit to Cambodia by Vietnam's government leader, 
Vietnam and Cambodia relations will pace more constructive steps 
to contributing to peace and stability in Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Dear friends, in Phnom Penh on the evening of 2 
April, the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia solemnly 
hosted a banquet in honor of the visiting Vietnamese Government 
delegation led by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  At the banquet, Samdech Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia 
delivered a speech. He said: 
  [Begin Ranariddh recording, in Cambodian fading into 
Vietnamese translation] His Excellency the Prime Ministers, 
Their Highnesses, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen: 
  On behalf of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the King of Cambodia, 
the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia has the honor to 
welcome His Excellency Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV, 
and his entourage. Samdech Hun Sen and I are very pleased to 
meet again with His Excellency the Vietnamese prime minister and 
other high-ranking officials of the Vietnamese Government in our 
land. 
  His Excellency Vo Van Kiet warmly welcomed our delegation on 
a visit to Vietnam in August 1993. During the visit, we 
exchanged views on various issues of our respective countries 
and those of the region. It was a great honor for our 
delegation to be received by His Excellency Le Duc Anh, 
president of the SRV, and His Excellency Do Muoi, general 
secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Through that visit, 
we have gained new ideas about the Cambodia- Vietnam cooperation 
relations, especially our determination to continue talks on 
various issues which are aimed at expanding cooperation between 
our two nations. 
  We unanimously agreed that we will give priority to 
cooperation projects related to the economic, trade, 
scientific-technological, tourism, and other essential domains. 
We still have many issues that require consistent consultation 
and discussion so as to strengthen and develop the relations of 
friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. 
  We have but a common mission; I am convinced that our two 
states and governments have the same aspiration of maintaining 
long and lasting peace, security, and stability. 
  We have built a fine, healthy atmosphere with an aim to 
consolidate the relations of friendship, cooperation, and good 
neighborliness. These are factors that help strengthen 
relations between our two peoples. Our struggle for prosperity 
and happiness at present not only serves the interest of peace 
and stability in the Southeast Asia region, but also in the 
Asia-Pacific and the world. 
  On this occasion, I would like to express the Royal 
Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia's gratitude to the SRV 
Government for its positive contribution to restoring peace and 
stability in Cambodia through the signing of the 23 October 1991 
Paris Agreement on Cambodia. We still have many important 
issues to be resolved. We are confident, however, that we can 
resolve them through the principle of respecting each other's 
national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
noninterference to each other's internal affairs as well as in 
the spirit of respecting the Kingdom of Cambodia's neutrality. 
  His Excellency the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Royal 
Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I would like to express 
our appreciation on U.S. President Bill Clinton's correct 
decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. This 
has created new relations between the United States and the SRV 
and through which various nations in the region are gaining 
potential to quickly develop their economies. 
  Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you, 
together with me, to turn our attention to a great personage who 
has brought about peace to the Kingdom of Cambodia: Samdech 
Norodom Sihanouk. 
  I have the honor to invite His Excellency the Prime 
Minister, 
Their Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen to a toast for the good 
health of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the esteemed King of the 
Cambodian people.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at a banquet in Phnom </F>
Penh on 2 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Your excellencies the first and second prime 
ministers, ladies, and gentlemen: On behalf of the SRV 
Government delegation, I would like to thank their excellencies 
the first and second prime ministers for inviting me to pay an 
official friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia, a 
beautiful country with a brilliant Angkor civilization and a 
diligent and creative population. I would like to thank the 
co-prime ministers and the Cambodian people for extending us a 
warm welcome and showing the hospitality and sentiment of a 
close neighbor. I would also like to thank you for your kind 
words on the Vietnamese nation and people, our traditional 
friendship and cooperation, and the good-neighborly relations 
between our two nations and peoples. 
  On this occasion, we would like to share our pleasure at 
learning that the king of Cambodia has recovered from his 
illness and will return to Cambodia -- together with his sons, 
daughters, nieces, and nephews -- to celebrate the upcoming 
Cambodian traditional new year. I would also like to share my 
pleasure in noting the achievements made by the Cambodian 
people, under the clear-sighted leadership of King Norodom 
Sihanouk and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, on 
the path toward attaining peace, national reconciliation, and a 
prosperous and happy life. 
  I am convinced that these encouraging achievements will open 
new and favorable conditions for the Cambodian people to build 
their country into a peaceful, independent, neutral, unified, 
nonaligned, and prosperous nation, thereby meeting the earnest 
aspiration of the Cambodian people and their friends around the 
world, including the Vietnamese people. 
  Vietnam and Cambodia are two close and neighboring 
countries. 
Our nations share a longstanding traditional friendship. We 
have shared weal and woe over the past several decades. The 
Vietnamese people have consistently and highly valued the fine 
sentiment and wholehearted support and assistance extended to 
them by King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodia people. We 
always consider the consolidation and development of our 
relations of friendship and cooperation with the Cambodian 
people a major policy of our nation. We are very pleased to note 
that our fine and proven relationship has satisfactorily 
developed in the new situation through various lively events, 
such as exchanges of visits by high-level delegations from the 
two countries in the recent past. 
  On this occasion, I would like to assert the aspiration and 
unswerving determination of the Vietnamese Government and people 
to do their best in strengthening and developing relations of 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  We are convinced that with goodwill and effort by both 
sides, 
Vietnamese-Cambodian relations -- built on the basis of 
respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity; and of equality and mutual interest -- 
will be further consolidated and developed for the happiness and 
prosperity of the people in each country and for regional peace, 
stability, cooperation, and development. 
  On the occasion of the Cambodian traditional new year, Chol 
Chhnam Thmei, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government and people 
I would like to convey my best wishes to King Norodom Sihanouk, 
Queen Monique, and the Royal Cambodian Government and people. 
[applause] 
  At this happy moment, in the spirit of our fraternal 
friendship, I would like to propose a toast to the good health 
of King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monique and to the good 
health of the co-prime ministers and the Vietnamese and 
Cambodian leaders. I wish the Cambodian people even greater 
achievements in their cause of building Cambodia into a peaceful 
and prosperous nation; I hope the traditional relations of 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness between Vietnam 
and Cambodia are further consolidated and developed; and I wish 
good health to all of the distinguished guests here. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent] </F>
  [Summary] Dear friends: This morning in the capital city 
of Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage paid 
a courtesy call on Acting King [title as heard] Chea Sim. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet was accompanied by Norodum Sirivut, 
Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs 
and international cooperation. Acting King Chea Sim cordially 
received Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage. He 
expressed his gratitude to the Vietnamese Government for its 
constant efforts to help bring about peace in Cambodia. He was 
convinced that this historic visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will contribute to strengthening the friendship between Vietnam 
and Cambodia a step further. He briefed Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet on the current situation in Cambodia and informed him that 
King Norodom Sihanouk's health condition was good and that the 
King would return to Cambodia on 8 April. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
thanked 
the Cambodian leaders for having accorded the Vietnamese 
Government delegation a warm welcome. He assured His Excellency 
Chea Sim of the desire and persistent efforts of the Vietnamese 
Government and people to do all they can to preserve and promote 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia. He expressed his belief that with the 
goodwill and efforts of both sides, these ties will continue to 
be consolidated and developed with each passing day. 
  Afterward, at 0900, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and First 
Prime Minister Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
signed the Vienamese-Cambodian joint communique on the 
conclusion of the visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. The signing ceremony was held at Chamka 
Mon Palace. 
  Next, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and 
Norodom 
Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, signed the agreements on 
cultural, educational, training, and scientific-technological 
cooperation as well as on the establishment of a joint economic, 
cultural, and scientific-technological cooperation committee. 
Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet and Cambodian Commerce 
Minister Va Huot signed the agreements on economic and trade 
cooperation and on goods transit between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the comrades accompanying him 
left Phnom Penh for home this morning. Seeing the Vietnamese 
delegation off at Pochentong International Airport were First 
Minister Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, and many other high-ranking Cambodian 
Government officials. Also on hand to bid farewell to Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage were members of the 
diplomatic corps, representatives of international organizations 
in Phnom Penh, and members of the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia. 
  Prime Minister Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen invited 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to step on a red-carpeted honorary 
stand as a military band played the national anthems of Cambodia 
and Vietnam. Next, the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as the latter reviewed the guard of 
honor and bade farewell to Cambodian and foreign officials. The 
special plane carrying Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the 
comrades accompanying him took off at 1000 sharp. 
  Twenty-four hours is too short for an official friendship 
visit. Yet, thanks to the positive efforts of both sides, this 
visit brought about fine results and opened a new step in the 
development of relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.

<F P=106> [By Ho Yong-pom] </F>
  [Text] Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong strongly 
indicated on 3 April that the ROK and the United States may 
change their existing policy of demanding the special envoy 
exchange as a precondition of North Korea-U.S. talks by saying: 
"Although the special envoy exchange between the North and the 
South still remains a precondition to the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. talks, a broad discussion including the de-linking of 
the two is possible and should be done." Attending a discussion 
meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue among opposition and 
ruling party lawmakers held at Academy House in Suyuri, Seoul on 
the afternoon of 3 April, Vice Minister Hong said: "It will be 
more advantageous to omit the precondition of the special envoy 
exchange and adopt a package deal of `guaranteeing the 
diplomatic relations with the United States under the condition 
of the assurance of nuclear transparency' because the latter 
provides a more justifiable basis for imposing stronger 
sanctions in case North Korea refuses nuclear reinspection." 
  Vice Minister Hong's remarks are noteworthy because it has 
been learned that the government has been recently reviewing a 
plan to simultaneously hold the special envoy exchange between 
the North and the South and the third-round North Korea-U.S. 
talks if North Korea accepts additional inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Vice Minister Hong backed up the speculation that the 
de-linking is being studied by saying, "Behind-the-scenes 
dialogue for the third-round North Korea-U.S. talks is still 
underway between working-level officials of the two sides. For 
now, we do not intend to propose dialogue to the North first." 
  Vice Minister Hong also said, "Had the nuclear issue not 
come 
up, our government would have followed its policy to actively 
help the establishment of diplomatic relations between the North 
and the United States from the very beginning of the regime."

<F P=106> [By Chin Chang-nip from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The United States originally set the overall 
inspection [chonmyon sachal] of North Korean nuclear facilities 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the 
exchange of North-South special envoys as a precondition for 
holding its third round of high-level talks with North Korea. 
It has been learned that the United States has expressed its 
intention to change its previous policy by attaching less 
importance to the exchange of North-South special envoys. The 
ROK, however, is opposed to this policy. The difference in 
opinions between the two countries regarding the issue has been 
disclosed. 
  The United States seems to believe it can make North Korea 
come to the negotiating table to discuss the nuclear issue if 
it attaches less importance to the exchange of special envoys. 
Also, it seems to believe that this can be another way to 
settle the North Korean nuclear issue, and that it will make 
some progress in resolving the nuclear issue when it holds the 
third round of high-level talks with North Korea, while the 
North and South are carrying out their exchange of special 
envoys. 
  The ROK worries that its efforts to denuclerize the Korean 
peninsula may be fruitless under the pretext of the improvement 
of North Korean-U.S. diplomatic relations when the United States 
excludes the exchange of North-South special envoys from its 
preconditions for holding the third U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks or intends to discuss the issue at the third U.S.-North 
Korean talks as demanded by North Korea. 
  North Korea has maintained that it did not agree with the 
exchange of North-South special envoys in either the second 
round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks or in the past 
unofficial contacts between the United States and North Korea in 
New York. It has said, however, that the exchange of 
North-South special envoys can be discussed as an agenda item at 
the third North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The ROK and the 
United States have stressed: The North Korean side first 
proposed the exchange of North-South special envoys, then the 
South Korean side accepted it. Therefore, this is a 
precondition that should be kept by North Korea. 
  The ROK believes that although the North Korean nuclear 
issue 
involves the international community, it is, ultimately, a 
matter of the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, it worries that 
the issue of signing an agreement on the denuclerization on the 
Korean peninsula through the exchange of North-South special 
envoys would be discussed as an supplementary agenda item, when 
the issue of improving diplomatic relations between North Korea 
and the United States is being mainly discussed at the third 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. This is the reason for the 
ROK's objection. 
  The ROK believes that it is highly possible that North Korea 
would put forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as 
a condition for negotiations in improving relations with the 
United States if those negotiations are not going smoothly 
during the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. It also 
believes that if something goes wrong, the ROK will be the 
victim of negotiations between North Korea and the United States. 
  The United States is likely to review the change of the 
timing of the exchange of North-South special envoys, 
considering that it would be better to discuss other important 
issues after inducing North Korea to the negotiating table. 
  It has been learned, however, that the U.S. Government has 
not yet decided on its policy regarding the precondition for the 
third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks after the coordination 
of the timing of the exchange of the special envoys. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry believes that North 
Korea's demands are an attempt to strengthen its position in 
negotiations with the United States by splitting the ROK and the 
United States and to exclude the ROK from participating in the 
negotiations by downgrading it as a third-party, not as a party 
concerned. Therefore, he said that it is the position of the 
Department of Defense to block in advance North Korea's attempts 
in order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  He also said that the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, 
as well as the ROK Forces, must strengthen their combatant 
capability to prepare for the emergency situation on the 
assumption that the UN Security Council may impose sanctions on 
North Korea. He stressed that the United States and the ROK 
must closely cooperate with each other to strengthen their 
capability.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chong Pyong-chin from Washington] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 2 April that the ROK and the 
United States are prudently examining a method of not linking 
the exchange of special envoys of the North and South to the 
third round of high- level DPRK-U.S. talks. In the past, our 
government had adhered to the position that the exchange of 
special envoys is a precondition for holding the third round of 
high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  A high-ranking government official accompanying Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu to the United States to seek ways to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue said on 2 April: "In a 
series of talks between high-ranking U.S. officials and Foreign 
Minister Han, the United States presented such a proposal. In 
this connection, our side said that we will prudently examine 
this after consultations with our related ministries." 
  This official pointed out: "With the announcement of the 
statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council [UNSC], the 
North Korean nuclear issue will go from the level of ROK-U.S., 
North-South relations to the UN level of multi-faceted 
consultations. Therefore, the United States felt that the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and South should no 
longer be a stumbling block to resolving the nuclear issue." 
  This official added: "During the discussions at the UNSC, 
the Chinese side also indicated that since it will actively play 
mediator so that North Korea can accept reinspection of its 
nuclear facilities, the demand that the exchange of special 
envoys be a precondition for the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks 
should be withdrawn. Since the exchange of special envoys of the 
North and South is one of the methods to guarantee North Korea's 
nuclear transparency, if the nuclear transparency is guaranteed, 
our government's view which regards the exchange of special 
envoys as a prerequisite for the DPRK-U.S. talks, can be 
reexamined." 
  In this connection, another high-ranking government official 
said: "The North-South issue must be resolved at a higher 
stage. If the nuclear issue is resolved, the exchange of special 
envoys will also be realized naturally." He hinted that the 
examination on not linking the exchange of special envoys to the 
high-level DPRK-U.S. talks is being carried out positively.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that his government has never 
considered de-linking inter-Korean dialogue from Pyongyang's 
refusal to open fully its nuclear sites to international 
inspection. Asked about his position on remarks made Sunday by 
a senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official that Seoul was 
considering separating the nuclear problem from an envoy 
exchange, Minister Han said, "it seems to be his personal 
opinion." 
  While meeting reporters at the South Korean Embassy here, 
Han 
stressed that "Pyongyang must expose its nuclear sites to 
additional inspections by the International Atomic energy agency 
(IAEA) and allow an exchange of special envoys between South and 
North Korea if it wants to hold talks with the United States." 
  He said that "it is up to the IAEA" to make a decision on 
further checks of North Korea's suspect nuclear sites. However, 
"it will be between one month and six weeks after the United 
Nations Security Council adopted the chairman's declaration on 
March 31." 
  Han will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
in 
Moscow on April 14 to discuss the nuclear problem.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The presidential office 
on Monday fiercely denied Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's 
remarks a day earlier that the government may withdraw its 
demand for inter-Korean dialogue before Pyongyang can talk with 
Washington. "There is no change in the government's stance that 
an exchange of inter-Korean special envoys is a condition for 
the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks," said 
presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. "What Vice Foreign Minister 
Hong said is his own private opinion," he noted. 
  Chu tried to smooth the waters, claiming that Hong had 
spoken 
on condition that what he said was his personal viewpoint. But 
the rumblings about Hong were not pretty, especially since the 
controversy over Amb. Hwang Pyong-tae's bungling last week has 
yet to die out. Hwang, the ambassador to Beijing, irked the 
presidential team when he made it sound as if South 
Korean-Chinese cooperation would replace the traditional South 
Korean-Japanese-U.S. channel in handling the North Korean 
nuclear crisis. 
  A presidential aide lashed out at Hong, saying he was 
concerned that the vice foreign minister's remarks might be 
erroneously taken as the government's new North Korea strategy. 
He also slammed recent leaks by responsible policy-makers of the 
government's negotiating tactics. "It appeared as if diplomacy 
and the national security policies were in confusion, more so 
because they made public the negotiating cards," this aide said. 
Taking a jab at the Foreign Ministry, he said it should be 
excluded in formulating the government's North Korea policy.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said here on Monday afternoon that he expects China 
will influence North Korea to fulfill its obligations spelled 
out in the UN Security Council president's recent statement over 
the nuclear question. The minister noted that the council 
president's statement was unanimously adopted and China played a 
positive role in the process. 
  While meeting with the press on arrival at Kimpo Airport 
from 
his tour of the United States and Japan, Han said South Korea, 
United States and Japan are carrying on efforts to persuade 
North Korea through China. 
  "If North Korea fails to fulfill the obligations within a 
specific period of time, the UN Security Council will take up 
the issue again, at which stage it would apparently take strong 
steps," he said. 
  The foreign minister also said that North Korea's acceptance 
of additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) is one of prerequisites, not the sole condition, 
for third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. He thus held 
fast to the position that the U.S.-North Korea agreement made on 
last Feb. 25 remains valid. 
  Regarding the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, Minister 
Han 
declined to say whether the joint exercise would be resumed by 
saying South Korea is discussing the question with United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok] </F>
  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said on 1 April, 
Washington time, that the UN Security Council's adoption of the 
president's statement raised the possibility of resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Minister Han said 
this at a news conference he gave to ROK correspondents at the 
National Press Club in Washington after holding talks with U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry. He also said: "We attach 
more significance to the measures -- which may be taken by the 
UN Security Council -- than to dialogue." He added: "The 
government has no plan for now to propose a diplomatic 
initiative to Pyongyang." 
  The following are questions posed and the answers: 
  [Question] What has happened to the ROK-U.S. coordination of 
views on the Team Spirit exercise? 
  [Han Sung-chu] North Korea has not fulfilled its agreement 
with the United States. This has created circumstances under 
which we can cancel our plan to withhold the exercise. However, 
a final decision will be announced after consultations between 
the ROK and the United States which will be held when U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry visits the ROK. 
  [Question] The signing of the contract to purchase Patriot 
missiles is reportedly imminent. Can you comment? 
  [Han] That is absolutely not true. We did not buy those 
Patriot missiles to be deployed in the ROK: The United States 
deploys them because the U.S. Forces in the ROK need them. 
  [Question] What do you think of Secretary Perry's strong 
remarks toward North Korea? 
  [Han] He said portions of his full remarks were reported 
after being exaggerated. He also said he stressed a need to 
maintain a deterrent or defensive capability depending on the 
future situation. 
  [Question] Did President Kim Yong-sam not give you the 
mission of having a resolution passed at the UN Security Council? 
  [Han] UN Security Council discussions are multilateral. 
Therefore, no country can have its hope fulfilled 100 percent. 
Our country had tried to have a resolution passed at the UN 
Security Council. However, one must not overlook the fact that 
the recently passed statement of the Security Council president 
contains more substantial details. 
  [Question] Do you have any hidden card for resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue? 
  [Han] The North Korean nuclear issue is complex and has no 
special remedy. Therefore, I would like to highly assess the 
Security Council president's statement because the statement has 
made it possible to start discussions on the nuclear issue again. 
  [Question] Is the troop reinforcement, which Secretary Perry 
has referred to, an irrevocable, final decision? 
  [Han] I do not think so. 
  [Question] How will our diplomacy be carried out for a few 
weeks from now? 
  [Han] First of all, I think, China will make efforts to make 
North Korea correctly realize the message contained in the 
president's statement, and the contact between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will possibly 
resume. I believe that if nuclear inspections are completed in 
this course, the possibility of resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue will arise. 
  [Question] When do you think North Korea will receive 
further inspections? 
  [Han] We think there is a deadline in actuality even though 
one was not mentioned in the statement. The fact that the IAEA 
believes that inspections must resume in six weeks is a good 
point for consideration.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 2 April 
commenting on the UN Security Council's adoption of a 
president's statement on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Aftermath of the 'President's Statement." 
  The editorial first describes the president's statement as 
the "first stick," because the statement contains the UN 
Security Council's "clear will" to demand that North Korea 
receive nuclear inspections. The editorial adds that North 
Korea must know it will be a "loser" if it thinks it still has 
time to "maneuver." The editorial writes: "If North Korea 
continuously uses its nuclear card, the international community 
will become more and more wary of North Korea. North Korea 
must be trustworthy if it wants economic cooperation with the 
international community. North Korea has given rise to nuclear 
suspicions and, thus, tarnished its image. This is tantamount 
to destroying a basis for economic cooperation." 
  The editorial continues that it is time the government 
sincerely goes through a reexamination, writing: "It must no 
longer be lured by optimistic or romantic approaches." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled: "Aftermath of the UN Security Council 
President's Statement." 
  The editorial first advises that North Korea "will not 
ignore" the statement on the grounds that the statement is 
nonbinding. The editorial then asks North Korea to "pay 
attention to" the UN Security Council recommendation that 
North-South negotiations be resumed to implement the joint 
denuclearization declaration. 
  Referring to the U.S. media report that it is all right even 
if special envoys are exchanged during or after the DPRK-U.S. 
talks, the editorial writes that "this idea will only satisfy 
North Korea, which pursues a policy of thoroughly excluding 
South Korea from all negotiations." The editorial finally asks 
the ROK Government to "maintain consistency" in dealing with the 
North Korean nuclear issue, instead of running about in 
confusion. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled: "UN Security Council Statement." 
  The editorial writes that as a result of the adoption of the 
statement, the "ball is again in North Korea's court." It says: 
"It is clear that the UN Security Council will seek the adoption 
of a resolution on sanctions against North Korea if North Korea 
does not receive nuclear inspections. Therefore, time will not 
always be on the North Korean side. Because North Korea's 
efforts to indefinitely resist the pressure has its limits, it 
must know that the sooner it decides to receive nuclear 
inspections and resume North-South dialogue, the more beneficial 
it will be." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled: "It is Time China Persuades North 
Korea To Receive Nuclear Inspections." 
  The editorial first expresses its discontent over China's 
excessive protection of North Korea regarding the nuclear issue 
and refers to China's responsibility for this issues. It 
writes: "China preferred the adoption of a statement, a moderate 
approach, at the UN Security Council, while insisting on 
dialogue, and our country and the world accepted China's idea. 
Therefore, complying with the spirit of the statement, China 
must persuade North Korea to accept the international 
community's demand before the UN Security Council resumes 
deliberations and adopts a resolution on sanctions." 
  The editorial concludes: "North Korea will not be able to 
go scot-free [musa halsu opta] without ensuring nuclear 
transparency. It would be wise to accept the UN recommendation 
and China's persuasion." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled: "Government's Chaotic 'Solution' to 
the Nuclear Problem." 
  The editorial first describes the chaotic situation 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue due to the ROK 
Government's frequent changes in policies. Referring to U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Perry's remarks that the United States 
would prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons even 
if it requires that the United States wages another war on the 
Korean peninsula, the editorial asks who will pay the price for 
such a war. Commenting on the government's position that the 
statement will express the international community's view on the 
North Korean nuclear issue to North Korea, the editorial asks 
the ROK Government to solidify its basic policy on the North 
Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] The U.N. Security Council statement on North Korea 
issued Thursday took the format suggested by China but it is not 
milder in content than the resolution that had been initiated by 
Western countries, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. 
  He said South Korea and four countries with permanent 
membership on the council--the United States, Russia, Britain 
and France-- decided to accept the Chinese proposal to issue a 
statement instead of a resolution in order to gain future 
cooperation from China, the other permanent member. 
  But the content included much that had been suggested by the 
five countries, especially South Korea, he claimed. "The 
statement, therefore, can be said to be a compromise of the 
Western idea of adopting a resolution and the Chinese proposal 
for a statement," said Ham Myong-chol, director-general for 
international organizations of the ministry. 
  He tried to place the most significance of Thursday's U.N. 
Security Council statement in setting a deadline for an 
additional nuclear inspection on North Korea at the end of this 
month or early next month. He said Hans Blix, director-general 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is scheduled 
to make a report on North Korea to the council within "six weeks 
from March 24." The statement issued Thursday has required the 
director-general to report also on the completion of the 
inspections agreed between the IAEA and North Korea Feb. 15 on 
the day. 
  "This means North Korea is given a deadline for receiving 
additional inspections to make up for those conducted last 
month, which the IAEA said are unsatisfactory. 
  "The deadline, to be specific, is the end of this month or 
early next month," he said. 
  He said another noticeable change in the process of 
negotiations on the statement was the active participation of 
China. Ham said China participated in the process from the 
beginning when the other four permanent members of the Security 
Council started to draw up the first draft. China, however, 
remained silent during the first stage and proposed a few days 
later to issue a statement instead of the resolution. 
  South Korea also took part in the whole process and 
succeeded 
in having the statement include a phrase on the deadline for 
additional inspections of North Korea, Ham said. He said the 
original draft drawn up by the four Western permanent members 
did not mention the deadline. The Seoul government, however, 
supported the Chinese proposal out of the belief that what 
counts more is content not format, he said. The official said a 
resolution appears more resolute than a statement. But a 
statement, if it is made with a consensus among members, could 
be more effective than a resolution that is vetoed by one member. 
  He said a presidential statement can also serve well the 
purpose of the Security Council measure--to urge North Korea's 
acceptance of inspections and recommend dialogue between the 
parties concerned.

<F P=106> [By Kim Cha-su from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] A controversy has arisen over the deadline for 
further inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. A report to the UN 
Security Council by IAEA Director General Hans Blix says that 
further inspections of the North Korean nuclear facilities must 
be conducted within six weeks. Therefore, some people say that 
the deadline should be the end of April, and others say it 
should be mid-May. 
  An ROK Foreign Ministry official, who is now visiting Japan, 
said on 3 April that this issue must be clarified because the 
deadline for further inspections would be an important factor 
for the UN Security Council's next step. 
  The Security Council president's statement indirectly 
mentioned the deadline, saying: "The Council invites the 
director general of the IAEA to report further to the Security 
Council on the question of completion of the inspection 
activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK on 15 February 
1994, when the director general is scheduled to report on the 
follow-up inspections required to maintain continuity of 
safeguards, as noted in the director general's report to the 
council." 
  However, when presenting a report to the Security Council on 
24 March, Director General Blix said that to ensure the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards, further inspections of not 
only the facilities which were not inspected during the 
inspection period ending 15 February but the facilities which 
were inspected during the same period must be conducted within 
six weeks. 
  The Foreign Ministry official views that "within six week" 
must be interpreted to be six weeks from 15 February, when the 
first round of inspections were completed."

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- China plans to send a 
high-level delegation to North Korea for the 82nd birthday of 
President Kim Il-song on April 15 that will urge resolution of 
the nuclear dispute through dialogue, a Seoul government 
official said Sunday. 
  The Chinese delegates will reportedly brief Pyongyang on the 
recent summit between South Korean and Chinese Presidents Kim 
Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin and explain Beijing's position in 
approving a United Nations Security Council statement calling on 
the Stalinist country to meet with the United States and 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  They are to highlight Kim Yong-sam's assurances that South 
Korea has neither the intention nor ability to absorb the North 
and will support Pyongyang vis-a-vis the United States and Japan 
when the nuclear problem is resolved, as well as emphasizing the 
need for inter-Korean dialogue. 
  Beijing promised efforts, albeit limited, to lure Pyongyang 
to the negotiating table during Kim's visit to China last week. 
  The Chinese delegation to Pyongyang is likely to be led by a 
senior official who will congratulate Kim Il-song on his 82nd 
birthday, the Seoul official said. 
  The visiting delegates are expected to advocate peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear problem in meetings with high-level 
North Korean officials, he said. The Chinese will pay a courtesy 
call on President Kim Il-song and explain South Korean President 
Kim's thoughts on North Korea set forth in his summit with 
Jiang, the official said. 
  North Korea and the United States will resume contact in one 
way or another, the official said, probably later in the month 
after Kim's birthday.

Korean situation said today that North Korea secretly sent Kim 
Chong-u, chairman of the North Korean External Economic 
Committee, to Beijing last week, explained to the relevant 
Chinese Government officials its food shortage situation, and 
asked China for the emergency support.

  [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu will leave here Saturday morning for 
Tokyo, where he will consult with Japanese Government leaders on 
the North Korean nuclear issue. Han is scheduled to meet with 
his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata Sunday afternoon to 
explain the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China 
and discuss the U.N. Security Council president's statement on 
North Korea adopted Friday. Han and Hata are expected to 
discuss follow-up measures on the nuclear dispute. 
  The South Korean foreign minister will call on Prime 
Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday to express Seoul's appreciation for 
Japanese cooperation in the Security Council's adoption of the 
presidential statement. They will discuss ways to maintain 
closer consultations on the North Korean question. 
  Prior to his departure, Han held intensive discussions with 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on resumption of the 
military exercise Team Spirit and beefing up joint defense 
capabilities in South Korea. Han and Perry agreed that the two 
countries will decide on Team Spirit's timing in subsequent 
discussions considering developments in the nuclear impasse, and 
when Perry visits South Korea in mid-April, according to Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho. 
  In the hour-long meeting, Han and Perry shared the opinion 
that Friday's unanimous adoption of the Security Council 
statement would exert enormous pressure on North Korea. 
  Earlier, Han attended a policy debate attended by Peter 
Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, and Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for 
political and military affairs.

United States will wait before deciding whether to hold this 
year's joint military exercise in view of recent developments in 
the North Korean nuclear row, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said. 
  Speaking at a press conference for Korean correspondents on 
Friday, Han said Washington and Seoul had left open the 
possibility of holding Team Spirit when North Korea violated its 
agreement with the United States on Feb. 25. South Korea and the 
United States, however, have yet to discuss such matters as when 
to hold the exercise, Han said. 
  Han then noted that the U.N. Security Council has just 
adopted a presidential statement urging North Korea to permit 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. He said 
he believed the U.N. action opened "another possibility" to 
resolve the nuclear dispute through dialogue. But right now, 
more weight is being given to the Security Council step than 
dialogue, Han said. 
  Given these circumstances, Seoul has no intention of taking 
the diplomatic initiative vis-a-vis Pyongyang in order to 
achieve a breakthrough in the nuclear impasse. Neither has the 
South Korean position changed with regard to its previous demand 
that Pyongyang must accept IAEA inspection of all seven reported 
nuclear facilities, Han said. 
  Asked whether Seoul is prepared to give in and let Pyongyang 
and Washington hold a third round of talks before an 
inter-Korean envoy exchange, Han said "no." There have been no 
discussions between Seoul and Washington on this point, he added. 
  Han reiterated that progress would come only when North 
Korea 
accepted complete IAEA inspections. "There could be flexibility 
as to whether North Korea accepts inspections or the IAEA makes 
a proposal on negotiations (for inspections)," he said. 
  Commenting on U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remark 
that in order to resolve the nuclear dispute risk of another 
Korean war can be taken, Han said Perry clarified that he had 
been partly misinterpreted. 
  Prior to Friday's press conference, Han appeared on NBC-TV's 
"Today" program and said another chance is at hand to resolve 
the nuclear dispute. Han said he had reaffirmed in his talks 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that they would 
keep the door open for North Korea to solve the issue through 
dialogue.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government has 
tentatively decided to suspend the South Korea-U.S. joint 
military exercise Team Spirit until mid-May, the deadline for 
North Korea to allow further inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), informed sources said Monday. 
  The United Nations Security Council told North Korea to 
permit IAEA checks by the middle of May in a presidential 
statement issued March 31. 
  The government will hold a meeting of related ministers this 
week, after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu returns from trips to 
the United States and Japan, to discuss Team Spirit's 
suspension, the sources said. A final decision on suspending the 
war games will be made at a South Korean-U.S. defense 
ministers' meeting. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will visit Seoul on 
April 17 to discuss the North Korean problem and meet with his 
South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae. 
  The South Korean Government is considering suspension of 
Team 
Spirit because it wants the North to respond positively to the 
Security Council president's statement. 
  If Pyongyang refuses to allow inspections by mid-May, 
however, Seoul may resume Team Spirit in late May or sometime in 
the second half of this year, the sources said. 
  Seoul also plans to allow deployment of Patriot missiles as 
scheduled since the Patriot is purely a defensive weapon.

  [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Seoul is planning wider 
market opening to American automobiles and planning to start 
negotiations with the United States, trade officials said 
Saturday. The measure comes as Washington showed readiness to 
launch a full-scale drive into the South Korean market with a 
warning of invoking 301 trade provision against Seoul. The U.S. 
National Trade Estimate (NTE) made available Friday criticized 
Seoul's formal and informal barriers that have "virtually closed 
Korea's 1.1 million-unit passenger car market to U.S.-built 
motor vehicle exports." 
  Initial plans include gradually lowering the import tariff 
from the current 10 percent to around 7.5 percent, the officials 
said. An inter-ministerial meeting led by vice trade, industry 
and resources minister is planned on Monday to set the details. 
  The government will start first with improving non-tariff 
barriers, such as active public message that the government will 
not impose disadvantages to those buying foreign cars, allowing 
more and larger show rooms and giving air time for 
advertisements during prime time slots. These issues are likely 
to be tabled formally at a meeting between South Korean Trade 
Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
this month during the signing period of the Uruguay Round [UR] 
agreement in Morocco, the officials said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  The Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry has been the main 
opposer but very recently agreed to consider the auto market 
opening more positively, according to the officials. 
  Seoul and Washington had agreed to address the issue at the 
minister level during last December's bilateral UR negotiations. 
This agreement is included in their record of understanding. 
U.S. requests include import tariff reduction schedule, revision 
to the current local tax system where taxes are levied according 
to engine size, consequently working against larger American 
models. Washington officials suggest levying taxes according to 
the level of fuel efficiency instead of engine size. 
  The NTE points out that imported cars in South Korea 
accounted for only 0.2 percent of Korea's market in 1933. The 
blatant anti-import campaign of the mid-1980s has waned but 
similar signals still continue, the report said. 
  "Korea's duty of 10 percent compares highly unfavorably to 
the 2.5 percent duty assessed Korean automobiles entering the 
United States," it said. "The U.S. objective is to ensure that 
U.S. motor vehicles have the same access to the Korean market as 
Korean motor vehicles have to the U.S. market," it said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
apparently split over how to respond to mounting U.S. pressure 
for wider access to Korea's motor vehicle market due to 
different interpretations of the wording in a "record of 
understanding" exchanged between Seoul and Washington during the 
Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations last year. 
  The Foreign Ministry advocates early tariff concessions on 
automobile imports, abolition of limits on showrooms for foreign 
cars and approval of advertising as demanded by the United 
States, while the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry firmly 
opposes lower tariffs and early liberalization of the 
distribution market before the scheduled January 1996. 
  The Foreign Ministry says concessions are inevitable, 
pointing to the phrase "reduction in the tariffs on motor 
vehicles will be addressed at the ministerial level," 
interpreting "address" as meaning "announce" and therefore a 
promise on future cuts. 
  As Washington, citing the record, is strongly demanding 
tariff reductions and predicting Korea will inevitably have to 
bow to its request, the Foreign Ministry wants to resolve the 
issue quickly. 
  U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Peter Collins 
referred to the record of understanding to demand immediate 
tariff cuts on car imports in trade talks in Seoul early last 
month. 
  The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, however, sees 
things 
differently. It interprets "address" to mean "discuss" as it is 
often regarded in business, saying it thus cannot be a promise 
on tariff cuts as insisted by the United States. 
  Even if it is a promise, the reduction refers to tariff 
offers because the record was made in the UR negotiations, the 
trade ministry argues. 
  Offering and actual tariff rates may be the same to the 
United States, but they are two different things to Korea, the 
ministry says, adding that Seoul only needs to change the 
offering rates. 
  In its country schedule, Korea had offered to maintain an 
80-percent tariff on motor vehicle imports until 2004. 
  The Trade Ministry immediately issued a press release that 
the government has no plans to lower tariffs on car imports nor 
to open the distribution market earlier than scheduled, 
contrasting with earlier reports quoting Foreign Ministry 
officials as saying that Seoul has decided to accept the U.S. 
demand on tariff cuts on car imports.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
office may strengthen the government's overall policy 
coordination as senior administration officials continue to 
contradict one another on the North Korean nuclear dispute and 
other foreign and national security issues. As part of the plan 
reported Monday, the presidential office would either form a 
consultative body comprising Chongwadae, the National 
Unification Board, the foreign and defense ministries and the 
Agency for National Security Planning, or beef up Chongwadae's 
team on foreign and national security affairs. 
  One Chongwadae official acknowledged Monday that confusion 
has emerged in the government's foreign and security policy 
"because of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's attitude, Ambassador 
to China Hwang Pyong-tae's recent remarks and Vice Foreign 
Minister Hong Sun-yong's publicly expressed opinion" over the 
weekend. 
  "Chongwadae is undertaking a study from various angles in 
order to strengthen the coordinating function of its foreign and 
security policy," the official said, requesting anonymity. 
  The consultative body is being considered because of the 
limitations of the current system including conferences of 
security-related ministers, chaired by the president, and the 
prime minister's strategic sessions with high government 
officials. But the new body would not be like the United 
States' National Security Council (NSC) since the present 
security-related ministers' meetings perform a similar function, 
he said. 
  Alternatively, Chongwadae may beef up the office of the 
senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security 
affairs since it is the president who makes the final decision 
on all foreign and security policy, he said. 
  Another Chongwadae official said, "following Ambassador 
Hwang's inappropriate remarks, our foreign policy was once again 
plunged into confusion when Vice Foreign Minister Hong suggested 
on Sunday that the government should consider dropping its 
demand for a special envoy exchange with North Korea as a 
precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks." 
  "It has become an urgent government task to strengthen 
policy 
coordination if we are to establish an effective North Korea 
strategy," the official said. 
  "The weakest point in our foreign policy in the past started 
with showing all our cards," the official pointed out. 
Henceforth, the government will keep secret its negotiating 
strategy while beefing up the publicity function, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry said 
Saturday that it has decided to extend a measure to strengthen 
the country's defense posture in preparation for an emergency, 
which began last November and originally was to end at the end 
of March. The ministry said the measure must be extended because 
North Korea has kept heightening tension on the peninsula by 
reinforcing its military training. 
  The ministry decided to watch North Korea's military moves 
by 
operating a 24-hour security monitoring system on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, the ministry lifted the special state of alert, 
ordered for President's Kim Yong-sam's visits to Japan and 
China, as of 5:30 P.M. last Wednesday.

minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; with Choe

Minister Kim's responsibility for the controversial revision of 
the Uruguay Round implementation plan. 
  When announcing the reshuffle of the minister of 
agriculture, 
forestry, and fisheries today, Chu Ton-sik, spokesman for 
Chongwadae [presidential office], said: President Kim Yong-sam 
admitted that the Uruguay Round implementation plan had been 
revised for farmers and would be beneficial to them. However, 
Minister Kim had told the people, as well as the president, that 
he would not correct even one word of the implementation plan. 
Therefore, by revising this plan, he deceived the people and 
the president and tarnished the morality of the civilian regime. 
So, the president had no alternative but to hold the minister 
responsible and replaced the minister with the former vice 
minister of home affairs.

<F P=106> [By Kim Chang-nok, director of the Foreign Exchange Policy </F>
Division and the International Finance Bureau of the ROK 
Ministry of Finance] 
  [Text] Financial market-opening has both positive and 
negative effects. An influx of foreign capital lowers interest 
rates and increases investment. But massive inflow of foreign 
capital increases money supply and puts pressure on appreciation 
of currency. Thus the size of capital inflow must be adjusted 
or the government must export capital in order to balance 
capital inflow. 
  A net capital inflow of 10 billion dollars is expected for 
this year. To offset a surge of capital inflow, the government 
mapped out a series of measures to encourage capital outflow or 
capital exports. These measures have expanded room for overseas 
expansion and operations of Korean industrial companies. 
  First of all, the government softened its control on private 
holding of foreign capital. A total of 1,300 enterprises with 
annual external trade volume of more than 10 million dollars 
have been permitted to hold up to 300 million dollars overseas 
or 30 percent of their annual external trade volume. 
  Other smaller companies and individuals were also permitted 
to keep up to 20,000 dollars overseas, through a drastic easing 
of the foreign exchange concentration system. 
  Second, restrictions on overseas investment in bonds, 
securities and real estate for portfolio management purposes 
have been eased. Securities companies, institutional investors 
and insurance companies have been authorized to invest as much 
capital as possible in buying foreign bonds and equities and 
real estate for asset management purposes. From around June, 
individual investors will be able to directly invest in foreign 
bonds and equities within a ceiling to be set later. General 
trading companies can also invest in overseas real estate up to 
100 million dollars or within 10 percent of their annual export 
and import volume. 
  Third, the government virtually liberalized its remaining 
restrictions on outbound direct investment by local firms. The 
number of sectors to be "restricted" for offshore direct 
investment, was reduced to 14, from the previous 17. Except for 
these "restricted" sectors, Korean firms can invest in all kinds 
of projects overseas. Outbound investment less than 300,000 
dollars can be made only by reporting to banks, not to the 
government. About 75 percent of outbound direct investments are 
handled by banks. This liberalization measures will help local 
firms expand their offshore production base and sharpen their 
international competitive edge. 
  Fourth, measures were also taken to help industrial firms 
make a timely settlement in external payments. Local firms will 
no longer need government approval when they pay royalties less 
than 300,000 dollars. Commercial banks, not the Bank of Korea, 
will be in charge of verifying the overseas remittance of funds 
by industrial firms for the capital increase of their foreign 
offshoots. 
  Local firms can send up to 20,000 dollars per month to 
overseas office for maintenance expenses. When Korea eliminates 
restrictions on the current account transactions, including 
services fees payment, from June, Korean firms will be able to 
deal in external activities in a more liberal way that is 
available in Western industrialized countries. 
  When foreign exchange restrictions are lifted, there is a 
worry that speculative hot money will move in and out of Korea. 
To prevent the movement of the disruptive hot money, the 
government has barred, from February, individuals from receiving 
foreign currency of up to 20,000 dollars without identifying 
their sources. Those who receive up to 50,000 dollars from 
overseas will be placed on the special surveillance list of the 
Korean tax office. 
  Secondly, non-residents, namely foreigners, can not convert 
more than 20,000 dollars per month in local currency, without 
identifying the sources and uses. 
  Korea is ready to push for liberalizing the foreign exchange 
rules for internationalizing its economy. As excessive capital 
inflows have many negative effects, the government must devise a 
mechanism to keep the foreign capital inflow amount at an 
optimal way. Especially, the government is promoting a policy 
that will encourage the outflow of capital for productive 
purposes that will be of long-term benefit to Korean firms and 
the economy, not for consumption-oriented purposes such as 
upward adjustment of overseas travel expenses.

  [Text] With the start of its new fiscal year, Daehan Kyoyuk 
Insurance Co. has set its sight on creating a powerful financial 
group by 2000. 
  Yi Chung-hoe, president of the insurance company, said 
Friday 
that Daehan Kyoyuk will create a financial group with its main 
pillars being a bank, an insurance company and a securities 
company. "We will become the largest independent financial group 
(independent of industrial capital) in the nation by 2000," Yi 
said while unveiling his company's projects for fiscal 1994. 
  Daehan Kyoyuk, which took over an insurance company last 
year, plans to take over a commercial bank this year, said 
another official of the insurance company. The insurance company 
is the first financial institution in the nation to declare that 
it will create a financial conglomerate after top government 
officials said last month that the government will foster 
financial groups independent of industrial capital. 
  Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential secretary for economic 
affairs, said last month that the government will raise the 8 
percent ceiling on the ownership of equity stakes in a 
commercial bank by a person, his relatives and those with 
certain close business relation to him. Such a measure would be 
the first step taken to help create financial conglomerates 
powerful enough to challenge foreign financial behemoths in the 
face of wider market opening. Pak said the government will 
change commercial banks from quasi public institutions to 
genuine private businesses and help make some of them lead 
companies of planned financial conglomerates. 
  The Korea Tax Institute, which recently conducted a study on 
fostering financial groups at the request of the Ministry of 
Finance, also proposed in its report last month that commercial 
banks become lead companies of financial groups. 
  While the general consensus is that financial groups should 
have nonbank financial institutions clustered around commercial 
banks, Daehan Kyoyuk would have to take over a commercial bank 
to create a financial group. One of the takeover targets is 
Citizens National Bank, which the government plans to put on the 
block this year. An official from Daehan Kyoyuk said his company 
will bid for the commercial bank. 
  Daehan Kyoyuk, which has an investment consulting company as 
well as a securities company as its subsidiaries, also plans to 
acquire a merchant bank, a credit union and other financial 
institutions. Preparations by Daehan Kyoyuk are expected to set 
in motion mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions. 
  In addition to Daehan Kyoyuk, Shinhan Bank and Korea Long 
Term Credit Bank are expected to unveil their plans to form 
financial groups soon. The two banks, many government officials 
said, are strong candidates to become lead companies of 
financial groups.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report from the "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] North Korea [DPRK] has issued a statement on its 
decision to refuse the UN Security Council [UNSC] request that 
it accept inspection of its nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Commenting on the 
statement, the Japanese Government said it was very regrettable 
that the country failed to fully understand the international 
community's real intention. 
  The government expressed particularly grave concern that the 
North Korean statement, in which the country said it had been 
forced to resume its suspended nuclear development, may become a 
decisive factor in leaving the country isolated in the 
international community. 
  On the other hand, the government intends to make additional 
efforts to influence North Korea to accept inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, this time in cooperation with China, which 
still has influence in North Korea. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held talks today 
with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is 
currently visiting Japan. In the talks they shared the view 
that China's cooperation is necessary to solving the issue of 
nuclear inspections of North Korea. 
  Foreign Minister Han said the significance of the UNSC's 
presidential statement adopted at the end of March was that it 
held China to a sense of obligation to make progress on the 
issue. He said there was an impression that China was trying to 
play a more positive role than before. 
  In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa said it is necessary 
for 
the countries concerned -- namely Japan, the United States, and 
South Korea as well as China -- to cooperate in influencing 
North Korea to solve the issue. They confirmed the intention to 
continue to urge North Korea to accept the inspections by the 
end of this month [April].

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan on Monday renewed a 
call for North Korea to take measures to allay international 
suspicions that it is secretly developing a nuclear weapons 
capability. 
  "We are concerned that North Korea may not have understood 
very well the U.N. Security Council statement urging Pyongyang 
to comply with international nuclear safeguards," Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We want 
to urge North Korea again to take the statement seriously and 
actively take steps to resolve the issue," the top government 
spokesman said. 
  The Security Council statement calls for efforts to help 
allay concerns that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons 
through dialogue, he said. 
  Takemura's comment followed North Korea's accusation that 
the 
United Nations is "applying double standards" in issuing the 
statement last week. 
  According to the (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) 
monitored in Tokyo, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said pressure from the United States has forced Pyongyang to 
"normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally frozen" 
for North Korean-U.S. talks. 
  Warning against any escalation of pressure, the spokesman 
said North Korea's policy is to answer "strength with strength, 
dialogue with dialogue." 
  Last Thursday, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement 
urging Pyongyang to allow full inspections of its nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital, 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  North Korea has insisted the nuclear issue is not an 
international issue, but a problem to be worked out with the U.S. 
  Japan's Foreign Ministry reacted calmly to North Korea's 
denunciation of the U.N. statement. Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito described Pyongyang's statement as "not alarming" 
because it did not completely block room for negotiations to 
solve the problem of North Korea's alleged nuclear arms 
development. 
  He noted that North Korea's statement said Pyongyang is 
still 
prepared to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem. 
  "The international community will continue to expect North 
Korea to change its mind through dialogue," Saito told a news 
conference. He said the international community will continue 
to urge China to play an expanded role in solving the problem. 
  He denied that Japan had asked Indonesia to mediate in 
solving the crisis or received requests from Indonesia to play a 
mediation role. 
  Saito said the government is investigating the reported use 
of Japanese materials for stainless steel tanks that were 
installed at North Korea's new facility. THE WASHINGTON POST 
reported Saturday that an IAEA inspection team obtained evidence 
that high-quality materials imported from Japan were used for 
stainless steel tanks.

  [Text] President Ramos and his Cabinet recently approved 
an expanded list of flagship projects even as it was decided to 
have two calendars for its implementation: one to fit the 
remaining four years of the Ramos Administration and the other 
for the long term. 
  Presidential Committee on Flagship Programs and Projects 
(PCFPP) Chairman Emilio Osmena told reporters yesterday his 
committee of seven is formulating a more focused priority list 
that will identify which projects can be accomplished in the 
next four years; which ones are to be put in place or begun; 
and, which ones are to be left for the next administration to 
implement. 
  The current list consists of 79 "different and discrete" 
projects representing components of the original 19 flagship 
projects identified by Mr. Ramos in his First Quarter Report. 
Flagship projects are infrastructure projects eyed for their 
high impact on the economy or their necessity in supporting and 
encouraging the inflow of private investments. 
  These are part of the 400 or so projects identified by the 
Core Public Investment Program of the National Economic and 
Development Authority [NEDA]. 
  According to Mr. Osmena, the setting up of the PCFPP and the 
two calendars will mean better implementation of the projects. 
The committee, whose members include the Secretaries of 
Transportation and Communications, NEDA, Public Works and 
Highways, Tourism, Agriculture, and Trade and Industry, "will be 
putting on a national hat so that government does not become 
like an octopus where each tentacle does not know what the 
others are doing," said Mr. Osmena. 
  The PCFPP head said the strategy for prioritization will 
take 
on the demographic approach. That is, creating population 
density centers with high domestic output. This is otherwise 
known as "growth corridors." 
  Geographically, Luzon has the most number of projects, with 
a 
total investment of Pl00 billion [Philippine pesos]; the 
Visayas, P11.3 billion; and Mindanao, P10.2 billion.

  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, foreign minister of the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization, or PLO, is paying an official visit to 
Thailand as the guest of the Thai Foreign Ministry. The 1-4 
April visit to Thailand by the PLO foreign minister and his 
five-member delegation is aimed at further strengthening 
relations between the PLO and Thailand. The PLO foreign 
minister will exchange views with Thai officials on issues of 
common interest, the promotion of bilateral trade, and the 
technical and agricultural assistance Thailand intends to give 
the Palestinian people. 
  Thailand has maintained good relations with the PLO for a 
long time. It recognizes that the PLO is the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people and support its 
endeavors to obtain the right to self-determination and the 
motherland of the Palestinian people. On 28 December 1993, the 
cabinet approved the establishment of a PLO representative 
office in Thailand. 
  At 1500 today, the PLO foreign minister paid a courtesy call 
on Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri to discuss 
the status of the PLO representative office in Thailand. He is 
scheduled to give a special lecture on the Middle East peace 
talks at the Foreign Ministry. The Foreign Ministry will host a 
dinner reception in honor of the PLO delegation this evening. 
  Earlier, the PLO foreign minister and his delegation paid a 
visit to Singapore and will leave Bangkok for trade talks with 
Vietnam on 4 April.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Risks in Sino-US Tension"] </F>
  [Text] Australia is right to oppose the tactics being used 
by the United States to wrest human rights concessions from 
China. The objectives of Canberra and Washington are the same 
-- to persuade Beijing of the intrinsic merits in political as 
well as economic liberalisation. Both nations have criticised 
China for its recent crackdown on dissidents. However, while 
Australian policy is to treat human rights separately, the US 
risks boxing itself into a corner by making these issues an 
integral part of trade and foreign policy. 
  Australia does not have the economic clout of the US and our 
interests as a member of the Asia-Pacific community are not 
always in harmony with those of the US. Our approach on human 
rights, set during last year's visit to China by the Prime 
Minister, Mr Keating, is a quieter one. Yet it has resulted in 
two parliamentary delegations being invited to study conditions 
in China. These have provided a foundation for informed and 
patient lobbying in Beijing. 
  The US approach is founded on President Clinton's readoption 
of "linkage" -- tying progress on human rights to the rest of US 
policy. Hence the threat to withdraw China's 
most-favoured-nation [MFN] trading privileges. Such a move 
would severely damage China's economy. The US takes about 30 
per cent of China's exports and the raising of tariff barriers 
would have a punishing effect on the remarkable economic 
expansion led by southern China. 
  But there would also be collateral damage to Hong Kong (the 
conduit for Sino-US trade) and Taiwan (which has invested 
heavily on the mainland). The stakes are also high for the US. 
While trade sanctions might pressure China into a positive 
response, this would be inconsistent with past responses by 
Beijing's leadership. It is more likely the present tension 
will further cool relations between China and the US and harm 
the latter's own interests in the region. 
  The US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, drew a 
predictable response with his forceful remarks in Canberra on 
Tuesday [8 March]. Angered by China's arrest and detention of 
several dissidents over recent days, he said: "These actions 
will have a negative effect on my trip as well as on the subject 
under review" -- that is, MFN. Beijing's response was to make 
more arrests while saying it would not tolerate external 
pressure over human rights, even if it meant losing preferential 
trade arrangements. It is difficult to see how Mr Christopher's 
visit to Beijing over the next few days can lead to productive 
results in such a hostile climate. 
  The US posture on human rights reflects the best aspects of 
the American ethos. However, there are problems in linking it 
to foreign policy. Former president Mr Ronald Reagan's 
secretary of State, Mr George Schultz, was a critic of linkage, 
and for good reason. He showed the US could, without fuss or 
fanfare, achieve real results where noisy criticism had failed 
-- especially in cajoling the former Soviet Union to ease 
restrictions on Jewish emigration. But President Clinton's more 
aggressive and overt approach arouses concern about the 
direction of US foreign policy, especially in this region. 
  The Clinton policy has been driven by the US Congress. It 
was congressional outrage over the violent suppression of 
political dissent in Tiananmen Square and Dili that led to MFN 
reviews for China and Indonesia. (Jakarta reacted more 
favourably to US trade pressure than has Beijing because it was 
in line with Indonesia's trend towards gradual political 
liberalisation.) Congressional demands for faster growth in US 
employment were also behind the President's ill-considered 
decision to pick a fight with Japan over trade access. The US 
should be in no doubt that these issues are all capable of 
causing unintended but real harm to Australia's interests.

  [Text] New York, April 1 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador 
to the United Nations on Friday [1 April] renewed Pyongyang's 
call for high-level talks with the United States to settle a row 
over international inspections on North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Pak Kil-yon said 
North Korea is not opposed to holding high-level talks with the 
U.S. if a ground for such talks is provided. 
  Pak said, "not at this moment, but if the U.S. could lay the 
foundation for a third round of high-level talks, we have stated 
we will not oppose" such a move. 
  On a UN Security Council statement Thursday calling for the 
North to fulfill obligations to open its nuclear facilities to 
international inspections, the ambassador said it is "a 
unilateral demand and (North Korea) does not have an obligation 
to meet it." 
  In a statement issued Thursday, the Security Council urged 
North Korea to allow unrestricted inspections of its nuclear 
facilities and hinted at economic sanctions if it failed to 
comply. 
  But Pak did not deny a possibility of accepting further 
inspections by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), if negotiations with the U.S. proceed. 
  "We have not yet heard of an official proposal from the UN," 
he said. 
  Asked what he has in mind as a condition for holding the 
high- level talks with the U.S., Pak said "it is only the 
fulfillment of the U.S.-DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea) agreement reached on February 25." 
  In the agreement with the north on February 25, the U.S. 
announced it would call off the Team Spirit joint military 
exercises with South Korea in exchange for North Korea's 
acceptance of IAEA inspections on its seven declared nuclear 
plants. 
  The IAEA started the inspections last month but after an 
IAEA 
inspection team was barred from collecting samples of nuclear 
material from one of the seven nuclear plants, the U.S. 
stiffened its attitude. 
  The U.S. and South Korea then reversed the decision to call 
off the Team Spirit war games after the IAEA's announcement that 
Pyongyang had thwarted its nuclear inspections. 
  The Security Council announced it would wait until the end 
of 
April, when the IAEA provides its report on the North Korean 
issue, before it decides if it will actually impose sanctions on 
the north. 
  Diplomatic sources said the focus now has shifted to whether 
the U.S. and the north will resume unofficial contacts to pave 
the way for high-level talks as well as China's efforts to 
persuade Pyongyang to accept the U.N. request. 
  China, as a permanent Security Council member, has veto 
powers on UN resolutions and has maintained close relations with 
North Korea even after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, 
once another supporter of Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [Statement by DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued in </F>
Pyongyang on 4 April place and date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
released the following statement regarding the UN Security 
Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's statement 
making irrational demands [tangchi anun yogudul] on us: 
  On 31 March, the UNSC announced the president's statement 
making irrational demands while urging us to allow additional 
unjust [pudanghan] inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to 
the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough 
inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States 
and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here. 
  Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the 
course of the inspection, that should be settled between the 
agency and the inspected country, the actual parties concerned 
with the inspection. 
  Why on earth, despite these facts, did the UNSC finally 
discuss the referred issue on inspections of us and adopt the 
president's statement? 
  The intrinsic nature of the problem is clear. The United 
States needed the UNSC, a stage for political discussions 
[chongchijok toui madang], and had to make the president's 
statement, a venue for pressure [amnyok konggan] to realize the 
hostile policy to crush [apsal] the DPRK. 
  The UNSC, whose mission is to guarantee peace and security 
of 
the world, discussed our issue based the IAEA Board of 
Governors' unjust and biased conclusion [pudanghago 
pyonggyonjogin kyollon] noting that the scope of the 
noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been broadened 
[tambo hyopchong pulihaengui pomwiga hwaktae toeoddanun]. This 
clearly contracts the purpose and principle of the UN Charter. 
  Today's reality is that the United States and some Western 
forces [ilbu sobang seryoktul], who see our socialist system as 
a thorn in their flesh, can have international organizations at 
their beck and call [che maumdaero chwauji halsu innun], if 
necessary, to plot to harm small countries, such as our country. 
No one can deny this. 
  If the UNSC indeed wants to fulfill its mission, it should 
raise an issue [munjesi] with the United States, which is posing 
grave threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with 
an immense number of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to 
the solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean 
authorities, the perpetrator [hasuin] of the United States. 
  What cannot be overlooked, in addition, is that the UNSC has 
unjustly raised an outcry over us, who are conducting peaceful 
nuclear activities [pyonghwajok haek hwaltong], while ignoring 
those countries that are playing the dangerous nuclear game 
[wihoman haek changnanjil] under the U.S. protection. This 
shows that, applying a double standard, the UNSC is being used 
by the United States for realizing its hostile policy to crush 
the DPRK. 
  The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear 
issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the 
safeguards accord in the president's statement encouraged by 
[pyongsung] the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK. 
  The validity of the safeguards accord has virtually been 
suspended since we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] for 
the DPRK-U.S. talks. Up to the present, we have allowed 
inspections only to guarantee the continuity of safeguards as a 
self-imposed and well-meant measure [chayulchogin sonuiui 
chochiroso] with the desire to prove the transparency of our 
nuclear activities. These inspections coincide with our special 
position [uriga chohae innun tuksu chiwie puhaptoenun]. 
  Since the United States and the IAEA could not deny this, 
they agreed to conduct the restricted inspection only to 
guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not regular or irregular 
inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. Accordingly, raising an 
issue on the implementation of the safeguards accord and 
additional inspections is senseless to us since we are in an 
authorized special position [kongindoen tuksu chiwi]. 
  We do what we say we are going to do, and do not do what we 
say we are not going to do. We are invariably adhering to a 
firm independent policy and a correct line on external 
relations. We have never changed a position that we once 
declared. 
  The UNSC should first take steps to fix the unjust action by 
the IAEA Secretariat, which has widened the area of unjust 
treatment of us [urie taehan pulgongjongsongui pomwirul 
hwaktaesikigo innun], currying favor with large countries, 
before demanding our additional inspections. 
  The IAEA Secretariat ought to apologize for the fact that it 
has widened the area of unjust treatment, openly joining the 
U.S. anti- Republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA 
Secretariat has gradually expanded its unjust treatment of us. 
We will repay [kyesan] this without fail. 
  The United States is more openly stirring up the maneuver of 
international pressure against the Republic [kukchejogin 
pangonghwaguk amnyok sodongul touk nogolhwa hago itta], using 
the IAEA Board of Governors and the UNSC. 
  Furthermore, the United States is creating an extreme 
military [word indistinct] situation, saying that it will resume 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that it is ready to 
trigger the second Korean war [cheiui choson chonjaengdo 
pulsahagetta]. 
  All facts clearly prove that the United States has no 
intention to resolve the nuclear issue at all and that its main 
aim is to realize its hostile policy of crushing Korea 
[taechoson choktaesi apsal chongchaek] by deliberately 
aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  Complying with this as well, by continuing to introduce 
nuclear weapons and stepping up their nuclear development, the 
South Korean authorities are attempting to persistently stage a 
nuclear war exercise against us in conspiracy with a nuclear 
possession country. This shows that the South Korean authorities 
are, in fact, not interested in the joint declaration of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but are rushing toward 
the criminal road of nullifying it. 
  Under the present situation in which the United States is 
clinging to pressure alone [migugi amyok ilbyondoro naonun hyon 
sanghwangeso] after overturning all promises made to us we have 
no choice but to conduct on a normal basis our peaceful nuclear 
activities [chongsanghwa hajiannulsu opke toeyotta] which we had 
unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with 
the presidential statement of the UN Security Council as an 
occasion. However, this cannot fool us. 
  The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to 
crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the 
singleheartedly united might of our party, the people, and the 
People's Army will be. 
  Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue 
is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile 
policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin. 
  Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is 
consistent [sijong ilgwan hada]. 
  [Dated] 4 April 1994, Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The time has come for the 
Seoul government to make a historic decision that will affect 
the North Korean nuclear negotiations and inter-Korean relations 
in a way no one can predict. As soon as Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu returns from his consultations with U.S. and Japanese 
officials Monday evening, the core policy-makers on diplomatic 
and inter-Korean dialogue will huddle and chart a future course 
in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. The question 
they face is one nobody dared ask before -- should Seoul 
withdraw its demand for inter-Korean dialogue and let Pyongyang 
and Washington talk by themselves? 
  Now is the time if Seoul wants to renovate its North Korea 
policy. Seoul and Washington, impatient on the brink of the 
mid-May deadline when the U.N. Security Council may decide to 
impose sanctions on Pyongyang, are more than eager to bring 
Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. North Korea has hinted 
at a willingness to negotiate with the United States over IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections but still 
refuses to engage in inter-Korean dialogue. 
  Ironically, North Korean officials' blatant reference to war 
last month, threatening to turn the South Korean capital into a 
"sea of fire," provided Seoul with an excuse to pull back on its 
inter-Korean dialogue demand. The mood on the Korean peninsula 
could not be chillier after the war threat, and this may well 
give Seoul officials a reason to once and for all suspend talks 
with their Pyongyang counterparts. 
  As things now stand, Seoul insists on exchanging 
inter-Korean 
special envoys before Washington holds the next round of 
high-level dialogue with Pyongyang. "We felt that we better 
elevate inter-Korean dialogue to a certain level while we had a 
chance. We believed that was the way, the only way to ensure 
that inter-Korean relations would progress in parallel with 
North Korea-U.S. ties," said a Foreign Ministry official, 
looking back to when Seoul decided to attach this precondition. 
But North Korea's insistence on negotiating only with the United 
States and keeping South Korea out of the picture has frustrated 
Seoul's hopes. 
  Criticism from the liberal wing holds that Seoul's obstinacy 
on inter-Korean dialogue has only blocked successful 
negotiations on the nuclear problem. Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong openly suggested Sunday that the government snip any 
connection between inter-Korean dialogue and nuclear 
negotiations, a remark widely interpreted as a trial balloon. 
But to do as Hong suggested requires much more than the courage 
to take a chance: It means giving up having a say in North 
Korean-U.S. talks, watching their relations progress more 
meaningfully and quickly than inter-Korean ties. 
  But more fearful than this for the government is public 
opinion. No matter what the reason, the government will be 
accused of caving in to North Korean tactics and letting itself 
be excluded from the whole negotiating process. This would 
constitute nothing short of swallowing its own words repeated 
for years that "the road to the United States goes through 
Seoul." 
  Foregoing the demand for inter-Korean talks in itself could 
motivate North Korea to come to the negotiating table, but the 
price for Seoul is not small.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The government may 
consider de-linking an inter-Korean envoy exchange with a third 
round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington, a 
senior official hinted Sunday. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, after attending a forum 
of ruling and opposition party lawmakers held at Academy House 
in Seoul, said it is worth studying a de-linking of the two 
issues. 
  Hong's remarks drew notice because the government is set to 
review its overall policy toward Pyongyang and decide on future 
policy following the adoption of a U.N. Security Council 
president's statement. 
  The government held a senior officials' meeting late last 
week to discuss its strategy for inter-Korean talks and 
resumption of "Team Spirit," the South Korean-U.S. annual joint 
military exercise, and decided to make a final decision after 
Foreign Minister Han returns Monday evening from trips to the 
United States and Japan. 
  The government has thus far maintained that an inter-Korean 
exchange of special envoys should be realized before the third 
round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks is held. 
  Hong said, "We should study whether the government's linking 
of the special envoy exchange to the third round of high-level 
talks is helpful in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  "But if we stopped linking the two issues, there might be a 
problem of national sentiment that South Korea was being 
excluded from the nuclear issue and that the government's 
principles on the issue had changed." In spite of possible 
problems, Hong personally preferred de-linking the envoy 
exchange and the high-level talks. 
  If North Korea did not ensure transparency of its nuclear 
program at talks with the United States despite South Korea 
having withdrawn the precondition of a special envoy exchange, 
the world would have a more solid foundation to impose sanctions 
on Pyongyang, according to Hong. In addition, Seoul does not 
have to link the two issues to improve inter-Korean relations, 
he added. 
  If Washington and Pyongyang set up diplomatic ties, then 
inter-Korean relations would naturally improve: Conversely, if 
inter-Korean links improved, then Pyongyang-Washington relations 
would also get better, he said. "It doesn't matter which of the 
two comes first," he said.

  [Text] Officials of Okinawa City and the prefectural 
government are shocked by the crash of an F-15 fighter belonging 
to the U.S. Forces [USF]. Shusei Arakawa, mayor of Okinawa 
City, expressed his anger, saying: "Today's accident clearly 
shows that the existence of the military base itself is a 
danger. It happened on a military base but the military base is 
in Okinawa, and there is an ammunition dump near the site of the 
accident. The accident could have resulted in disaster." 
Governor Ota commented: "I feel like saying here we go again. 
We will file a stiff protest with the USF." On the other hand 
[as published], all political parties on Okinawa are taking the 
accident seriously. They plan to convene an extraordinary 
meeting of the prefectural assembly to adopt a protest 
resolution. The prefectural government also plans to file a 
protest with the USF, and demand the USF immediately find out 
the cause of the accident. 
<H5>  It Is Serious and Regrettable That the Accident Happened </H5>
  Governor Ota's comment: It is serious and regrettable that 
the aircraft belonging to the USF crashed near a residential 
area. They are saying that nobody was injured, and no damage 
occurred to property, but we are concerned by the fact that the 
aircraft crashed near an ammunition dump. I have asked my staff 
to find out the details. 
<H5>  The Accident Occurred Because There Is a Military Base </H5>
  Okinawa City Mayor Shusei Arakawa's comment: I have already 
been to the site of the accident. The aircraft crashed on 
farmland. People who had been working near the site of the 
accident said they heard a roar and saw fire shoot out when the 
aircraft crashed, and that they were terrified. Several 
accidents occurred in the past too because of the existence of 
the military base, and we lodged a protest each time. However, 
today's accident clearly shows that the existence of the 
military base itself is a danger. It happened on a military 
base, but the military base is in Okinawa, and there is an 
ammunition dump near the site of the accident. The accident 
could have resulted in disaster. We will immediately begin to 
study how to deal with the situation.

  [Text] Tokyo -- An F-15 fighter of the U.S. Forces on 
Okinawa crashed near Kadena Air Base on 4 April. Commenting on 
the crash, Akira Takeshita, deputy director general of the 
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA], said, "Such a 
crash should not have occurred and it is very regrettable that 
the crash actually occurred." He also made it clear that 
shortly after the crash, the DFAA asked the command of the U.S. 
Forces in Japan [USFJ] to take thorough measures for safe 
management of the U.S. military bases on Okinawa and conduct a 
thorough investigation into the cause of the crash. 
  The Kadena Air Base public affairs office gave a briefing on 
the crash and the DFAA released the briefing. The briefing said: 
An F-15 fighter taking off from Kadena Air Base on a routine 
training crashed near the air base at 0924 on 4 April. The 
crashed aircraft belonged to the 44th Fighter Squadron of the 
18th Wing and the pilot safely ejected from the aircraft without 
injuries. A team will begin investigating the cause of the 
crash and details of the accident will be made public once the 
investigation is completed. 
  The U.S. military aircraft crashed about 800 meters 
northeast 
of a Kadena Air Base runway and the crash site is within the air 
base's facilities. 
  Mr. Takeshita said: "As for the safe management of the U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa, we have long asked the U.S. side for 
it. The DFAA immediately expressed regret to the command of the 
U.S. Forces in Yokota over the crash and the Naha DFAA Bureau 
expressed regret to the commander of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa. 
We will continue to ask them to work for the safe management of 
the U.S. military bases in Japan."

  [Text] The Okinawa Municipal Assembly (with Heiwa Yaga as 
speaker) called an extraordinary session at 1800 [0900 GMT] on 
the afternoon of 4 April at which members unanimously adopted a 
resolution and a statement of opinions strongly protesting to 
U.S. military authorities about the U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter 
crash in the morning. 
  An assembly delegation is scheduled to present these 
documents to the U.S. Forces Okinawa Area Coordinator, the Naha 
Defense Facilities Administration Bureau, the prefectural 
governor, and the prefectural assembly speaker on the morning of 
5 April. 
  The resolution and statement of opinions point out: "The 
Kadena ammunition dump is located near the accident site, and in 
neighboring areas there are also stock farms, recreation 
centers, and villages. As a single mistake could have resulted 
in a disaster involving citizens, it was a serious shock to our 
people and they are now uneasy." 
  As well as criticizing the U.S. military for its deficient 
maintenance and management of military aircraft, the documents 
reiterate the people's great anger. 
  "Okinawa city residents have been compelled to coexist with 
the largest U.S. military base in the Far East. And as far as 
they are concerned, they feel this accident vividly demonstrates 
their fears that inevitably result from the existence of 
military bases." 
  Touching on previous accidents, as well as the fact that 
military aircraft regularly fly over residential areas, the 
documents state "our people are continually exposed to the 
danger of being deprived of their lives and property." 
  Therefore, while strongly demanding that measures be taken 
to 
prevent any further accidents, the assembly wants the cause of 
the accident be publicized for prefectural residents as soon as 
possible, maintenance work on all aircraft strengthened, and a 
ban on aircraft flying until proper maintenance work is ensured.

  [Text] Toshiyuki Takano, councilor with the North American 
Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], called 
on Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota on 4 April. During the 
meeting, Mr. Takano promised that the Foreign Ministry will do 
its best to resolve problems arising from the U.S. military 
bases on Okinawa. 
  The Foreign Ministry official is in Okinawa to tour U.S. 
military bases, and an F-15 Eagle fighter crashed during his 
stay in the island. It is said that during his meeting with 
Donald R. Gardner, commander of U.S. Forces Okinawa, at Camp 
Courtney, he asked the commander to conduct a "thorough 
investigation into the cause of the crash and take thorough 
measures to prevent a recurrence of such a crash." In response, 
the commander said, "I understand." 
  During the meeting with Mr. Takano, Okinawa Prefectural 
Governor Ota said: "The Okinawans are increasingly reacting 
against intensifying live-fire exercises and flight training by 
U.S. Forces on Okinawa. The presence of Naha Military Port 
stands in the way of developing the free trade zone. Under this 
situation, the crash occurred and I have difficulty dealing with 
problems, including the crash accident, arising from the U.S. 
military bases in Okinawa." 
  In response, Mr. Takano said, "The Foreign Ministry will do 
its best to smoothly resolve problems arising from the U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Should Voluntarily Remove Trade </F>
Barriers"] 
  [Text] The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) 
recently submitted to Congress the 1994 edition of the "National 
Trade Estimates Report on Foreign Trade Barriers." 
  The number of items and descriptions related to Japan has 
increased from the previous year and occupies a large portion of 
the report. It can be said that the report clarifies the 
Clinton administration's trade strategy urging Japan to open its 
markets wider. 
  Certainly, Japanese markets are still bound by many 
government regulations and the principle of competition is not 
fully being carried out in Japan. The relationship between the 
government and the private sector lacks transparency. Also, 
complicated business practices still exist. Reforming the 
economy's structure is a top priority task for Japan to open up 
its markets wider. 
  Japan should voluntarily and actively remove trade barriers 
to imports of both quality and less-expensive goods as well as 
services before other countries demand that it do so. 
  The removal of such trade barriers will help maximize the 
effect of the yen's appreciation, bring benefits to consumers, 
and help develop world trade. In this sense, Japan should 
listen to the voices of other countries hoping to gain access to 
Japanese markets. 
  However, it will be a different story if the United States 
unilaterally imposes sanctions, such as retaliatory tariffs, if 
its demands are not met. 
  The USTR report provides a basis for application of the 
Super 
301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which outlines steps for 
retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices) that was 
reinstated by Clinton's executive order. The USTR will specify 
by the end of September the countries and market fields that are 
subject to the application of the Super 301 provision. 
  This year's report covers all topics negotiated in the 
Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, including Japanese Government 
procurement of telecommunications equipment. It is expected 
that if no agreement is reached in the framework trade talks, 
the United States will seek solutions in individual sectors by 
threatening sanctions under the Super 301 Provision. 
  Needless to say, unilateral sanctions in line with the Super 
301 provision will run counter to the agreement in the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks to be signed in mid-April. 
  Asian and European nations have urged Japan to open its 
markets wider. But they are also very critical of the U.S. 
strategy of threatening sanctions in trade negotiations. We 
hope Washington will reconsider its strategy. 
  What Japan and the United States should do now is to resume 
the suspended framework trade talks. Japan has recently 
announced the "outline of external economic reforms," which is 
inadequate but a step forward. We hope opinions and criticism 
should be exchanged at the negotiating table. We believe that 
this is the way to create a new relationship of trust. 
  Recent remarks and actions by U.S. officials, including the 
USTR annual report, are full of assertions that past Japan-U.S. 
agreements have yielded almost no results. Such assertions 
could be aimed at urging Japan to implement bold market-opening 
measures. Even so, they will cause misunderstanding among the 
peoples of both countries. 
  We should refrain from overreacting in each case, but we 
think the recognition of facts should be done more accurately. 
  For example, beef imports increased 1.9 times and orange 
juice imports 4.3 times between 1988 and 1992. Artificial 
satellites have all been procured from the United States since 
the signing of a bilateral agreement. There are more examples. 
As such, Japan-U.S. economic relations never remain stagnant.

  [Text] It has been disclosed that the Defense Agency [DA] 
and the U.S. Department of Defense, which are promoting joint 
development of a next-generation support fighter (FSX), agreed 
that technology used to produce radio-wave absorbing material 
belongs to Japanese companies, which are in charge of developing 
the material. Seven companies, including TDK Corporation, are 
buckling down to the task of developing the radio-wave absorbing 
material to improve the aircraft's stealth nature. In the past, 
the United States had maintained that it was entitled to use all 
technologies related to FSX development free of charge except 
for four items, including highly efficient radar. But, the DA 
submitted an additional proposal to the United States calling 
for recognition of Japanese companies' technological proprietary 
rights for several pieces of equipment. 
  The radio-wave absorbing material will be applied on leading 
edges of the FSX's main wings and intakes. The material, which 
is the subject of the recent U.S. approval, was jointly 
developed by seven companies -- including TDK, Mitsubishi Rayon 
Company, and Nippon Carbon Company. This is the fifth item 
approved as Japan's own technology; Mitsubishi Electric 
Corporation's highly efficient radar, computer, and integrated 
electronic warfare system and Japan Aviation Electronics 
Industry's inertial navigation system were approved previously. 
  Following the previous approvals, the DA proposed at a 
meeting of the FSX technological steering committee (TSC) held 
in mid-March at Kelly Air Force Base (in Texas) claiming 
proprietary rights for Shimazu Corporation's optical display, 
Yokogawa Electric Corporation's multifunction liquid crystal 
display, and other equipment. The United States is expected to 
answer the proposal as early as this summer. 
  Agreeing to remodel Lockheed Corporation's F-16 jet fighter, 
Japan and the United States started the joint development. The 
United States insists that technologies related to the FSX 
development are "derivative technologies" created during the 
process of F-16 remodeling. According to a memorandum signed 
between the two governments in 1988, the United States can use 
derivative technologies free of charge. However, the DA and 
Japanese defense industries, including Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, are maintaining the stand that "nonderivative 
technologies," which they independently developed, are also 
included in the memorandum. The two countries are continuing 
behind-the-scenes negotiations. 
  In principle, the United States will have to pay for the use 
of such technologies if they are recognized as nonderivative 
technologies. We can say that the recent U.S. recognition is an 
"outcome of the negotiations." The radio wave absorbing 
material is a product of a technology that can be widely applied 
to nonmilitary goods production. Therefore, the companies 
wanted to get their proprietary rights. 
  It is believed that dozens of items in the memorandum are 
still not clarified as to whether they are "derivative or 
nonderivative technologies." Japan will continue to seek U.S. 
recognition of technologies Japan developed on its own. But, 
there is a possibility that the U.S. Congress may oppose such an 
attempt and the issue may become another source of Japan-U.S. 
friction. However, it seems that Japan and the United States 
will make mutual concessions since the FSX will make a maiden 
flight in the summer of 1995 and also because it is expected 
that a budget for its mass production will be earmarked starting 
fiscal 1996.

  [Text] NEC Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., and Fujitsu Ltd. are 
to begin developing technology for next-generation information 
networks, which can send data to distant areas at 
superhigh-speed, in cooperation with an auxiliary organization, 
which falls under the jurisdiction of both the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]. They recently inaugurated a 
research and development company to develop combined technology 
for computers and communications and to build up by fiscal 1998 
an information transmitting system needed for establishing the 
basis of future information communications. It is expected that 
Japan will promote a program to establish large-scale 
information networks similar to the "information superhighway" 
planned in the United States. Thus, their collaboration will 
set a concrete example of cooperation between the private sector 
and the government for the program. 
  The newly established company is named "Superhigh-Speed 
Network and Computer Technology Research Institute" [SNCTRI]. 
The company, whose head office is in Minato-ku, Tokyo, is 
capitalized at 30 million yen, 70 percent of which has been 
invested by Japan Key Technology Center. The center, which is 
an auxiliary organization under the jurisdiction of both MITI 
and the MPT, is to give financial support to electronic 
communications and machine industries. NEC, Hitachi, and 
Fujitsu have invested 10 percent each. NEC Managing Director 
Seijiro Yokoyama serves as the president of the new company. 
The SNCTRI, which has been given five years to develop new 
technology, will increase its capital to 3.5 billion yen by 
fiscal 1998, the final year for the development. 
  Currently, a distributed processing system that uses 
personal 
computers and work stations to send data is popular in computer 
communications. However, the system has a problem--the greater 
the distance between two communicating spots, the slower the 
data transmission. The SNCTRI is to develop combined technology 
for computers and communications networks that makes it possible 
to send data to distant areas at a superhigh-speed. 
  It will also establish protocol (communications procedures) 
and develop technology for real time image transmission to make 
it possible to send multimedia data composed of images, voice, 
and text at a high speed. In fiscal 1998, it plans to develop 
technology for transmitting 2.4 gigabytes (1 gigabyte is 10 
million bits) of data per second.

  [Text] Regarding the government's procedure of buying 
imported rice and wheat from trading companies through bids, it 
has been revealed that the Food Agency director general, who 
represents the government, has sent written instructions to 28 
trading companies every six months informing them before the 
bidding actually takes place what share each company will 
receive in the upcoming grain auction. This was discovered by 
ASAHI SHIMBUN. The actual amount of rice and wheat purchased by 
the government almost coincides with share noted in the Food 
Agency's written instructions, which are known as "voices from 
heaven." According to several sources, major trading companies 
rig their bidding prices. Because of this, this newspaper 
became suspicious of the practice in which the Food Agency 
conspired with certain trading companies over import rights and 
interests. 
  ASAHI SHIMBUN obtained a letter dated 1 October 1993 which 
was sent to a trading company. The agency's director general 
sealed the letter by using his seal, and the letter specified 
the percentage share that the company was to receive at the 
wheat auction in the latter half of fiscal year 1993. Moreover, 
the letter states that "we are notifying you that we have 
decided on the following." "Voices from heaven" have been sent 
to trading companies' top executives, including their 
presidents, twice a year, on 1 April and on 1 October. 
  The Import Department of the Food Agency explains that "the 
purchase process was not wholly dependent on bidding because the 
agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase contracts." 
However, a company which bid the lowest price won the contract. 
An official of a trading company said it was a "competitive 
bidding." Although it looked like a competitive bidding, the 
trading companies decided which company would bid the lowest 
price on the basis of the percentages determined by the Food 
Agency. 
  In this regard, a senior Fair Trade Commission official 
said: 
"Even if the agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase 
contracts, it would be bid rigging by the trading companies if 
what was revealed is true. If the Food Agency director general 
is sending out such `voices from heaven,' these make competition 
between trading companies a mere facade." 
  Although annual grain imports amounted to about 200 billion 
yen in fiscal year 1992, they will increase significantly 
starting in and after fiscal year 1993 because of emergency rice 
imports and the partial liberalization of Japan's rice market. 
  Bidding is conducted every Wednesday at the agency for 
foreign grain expected to be imported in a one-week period two 
months after the bidding takes place. The agency works with 26 
trading companies for wheat imports and 20 for rice imports, and 
it asks them to submit price quotations. These firms are called 
"listed importers." However, the agency chooses several 
companies who submit the lowest bids and places orders with them 
on a weekly basis. 
  Six months of weekly orders equal the share that the agency 
ultimately granted each company through the "voices from 
heaven." It is the job of the 10 leading trading 
companies--including Mitsui and Co. and the Mitsubishi 
Corporation--who were given the largest import shares among the 
listed importers to coordinate weekly shares and tender prices. 
This practice of coordinating matters started several decades 
ago. It is said that the weekly bidding prices of low-ranking 
trading companies are also determined by the 10 leading 
companies. 
  The Food Agency does not publicly release information on the 
shares of grain it purchases from each trading company, and 
previously no changes were made to the shares granted to each 
company. However, the shares of the top 10 companies have been 
changing slightly ever since a case in which beef importers 
rigged their bidding prices was uncovered in 1988. A trading 
company official explains, "This [changing of shares] is a 
maneuver designed to conceal the bid riggings."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister </F>
of international trade and industry, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The government is currently 
calling for deregulation, but what do you think of the fact that 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has more 
regulations than any other government office? 
  [Kumano] It is not good to evaluate deregulation efforts by 
focusing only on the number of regulations. In some cases, the 
number increases. For example, although the Gas Industry Law 
was recently revised to liberalize the industry, the number of 
regulations on the gas industry increased as a result. We have 
to promote deregulation while reviewing all systems and 
structures which have supported this nation since the end of the 
war. MITI has taken a broader view of this issue. 
<H5>  A Role for the Market </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Since the Meiji era, Japan has pushed 
an industrial policy. But because the policy has almost 
completed its role, some people are arguing that MITI is no 
longer necessary. 
  [Kumano] It is a matter of course that the framework of 
industrial policy changes with the times. The administration's 
role is to meet the needs of areas that it takes charge of or to 
anticipate these needs. Our major tasks include deciding what 
industries should do at a time when systems and structures are 
being reviewed, and rectifying price gaps between Japan and 
other countries. 
  The market mechanism forms the basis of industrial 
activities. It is very important that the mechanism functions. 
The government sometimes creates a big demand or forecasts the 
demand. Some people say it is undesirable for the government to 
forecast demand, but I do not think so. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] MITI still has two divisions in 
charge 
of administering iron and steel. Don't you think that the 
significance of the existence of bureaus that directly supervise 
industries, including the Basic Industries Bureau and the 
Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, is decreasing? 
  [Kumano] MITI has constantly reviewed its structure. What I 
want to stress is that no government office in the world covers 
broader areas than does MITI. On macroeconomic policies, the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF] is in charge of finance, while the 
Economic Planning Agency is responsible for coordinating all 
policies. Meanwhile, MITI is asked to speak from its position 
of covering broad areas. I think that this structure is capable 
of contributing to the Japanese economy. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] I think that some government offices 
will become obsolete when the roles of the market increase. 
  [Kumano] The areas supervised by MITI introduced the market 
mechanism at an early point. I am confident that I am the best 
market theorist in Kasumigaseki. However, market theory is not 
100-percent correct. Somebody has to assume the task of 
operating markets. I think that politicians and bureaucrats, 
who work under politicians, should assume the task. 
<H5>  Reduction Not Necessary </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think that government 
offices tend to become larger because they have a less-developed 
sense of costs compared to the private sector? 
  [Kumano] While administrative service is provided using the 
market mechanism, it is always exposed to the criticism of the 
mass media. We should prevent government offices from becoming 
larger. But, I do not think that they are getting larger. For 
example, there is only one division in charge of the auto 
industry, and it is composed of only 10 or so officials. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But they will not become smaller, 
will 
they? 
  [Kumano] If government offices are doing unnecessary things, 
we will have to review them. We always accept criticism of 
ourselves. We need to reflect on our actions. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think it is necessary for 
MITI to become smaller to some extent? 
  [Kumano] I think it is unnecessary at the moment. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people call MITI the second 
MOF because it takes the same stand as the MOF on macroeconomic 
policies. 
  [Kumano] The truth is that the MOF has been influenced by 
MITI's opinion and that the two have coordinated their views 
through arguments. When the two ministries confront each other, 
you call it a negative effect caused by a vertical 
administrative system. And when the two cooperate through 
arguments, you call MITI the second MOF. It is regrettable. 
  At present, macroeconomic measures are very important. From 
a short-term point of view, they undoubtedly boosted the economy 
for the last two to three years. From a mid- and long-term 
point of view, macroeconomic measures are necessary to 
effectively use Japan's high ratio of savings in the process of 
the nation's moving toward an aging society. There is currently 
an imbalance between savings and investment, and this is the 
cause of the current accounts surplus. Japan has to invest its 
high savings in housing, research institutes, and the 
information infrastructure. To do so, the government needs to 
either go into debt or to increase taxes. It is impossible to do 
so only with debt. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What you have explained resembles the 
idea advocated by the MOF of emphasizing a financial equilibrium. 
  [Kumano] No, it does not. We have not said that the 
investment should be made solely with taxes, but we have 
proposed increasing the government's debt. We have not agreed 
with the MOF on everything. We are thinking of what we should 
do to carry out (our policies). It is unpleasant to be called 
the second MOF when we make realistic arguments. I am doing my 
job with confidence and based on economic theory and the belief 
that we can better our society. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it also MITI's duty to check on 
the 
MOF? 
  [Kumano] Yes, we are checking on them. It would be 
problematic if the MOF did not take action [to cause an economic 
recovery]. But in actuality, they are taking action. If 
anything, they are taking the initiative in some ways. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently 
criticized both MITI and the MOF by name. 
  [Kumano] The President called Japan a big-export but a 
no-import nation. This is very regrettable because his remark 
ignores the facts. 
<H5>  Final Decisions Should Be Made by Politicians </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you draw a line between 
bureaucrats and politicians in policymaking? 
  [Kumano] It is difficult to draw the line because there are 
various kinds of policies. But in principle, final decisions 
should be made by politicians. It is absolutely impossible for 
bureaucrats to do what ministers are opposed to. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the so-called 
[Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Chief Secretary Ichiro] Ozawa 
plan, which includes the idea of establishing a parliamentary 
councilor post? 
  [Kumano] I do not know whether news reports on Ozawa's plan 
are accurate. At any rate, I think it is good to discuss 
various things, including Ozawa's plan. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of politicians 
taking part in bureaucrats' personnel management? 
  [Kumano] It is true that ministers have the right of 
personnel management. But the neutrality of the administration 
is also important. I cannot say absolutely that their 
participation is not good.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi </F>
Miyazawa by AERA editor Hiroshi Tadaki; place and date not 
given: "Will Japan Become a Normal Country, as Advocated by 
Ichiro Ozawa? And Will It Go Nuclear?"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. Ties: The Situation Does Not Call 
for the Flamboyant Term "A Relationship of Equality" 
  [Tadaki] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa explained that the 
breakdown of the Japan-U.S. trade talks was a necessary step to 
turn Japan-U.S. ties into a fully mature relationship. Mr. 
Miyazawa, how do you view the failure of the trade talks? 
  [Miyazawa] It is quite normal that Japan and the United 
States cannot reach an agreement on trade at the working level. 
The prime minister or the president deal with the matter only 
after being informed about the failure of working-level 
negotiations. I expected both leaders to make the utmost 
efforts to reach an agreement, even by holding an all-night 
conference. 
  In July 1993, when the Group of Seven [G-7] nations held a 
summit in Tokyo, I agreed with President Bill Clinton to put 
into specifics a new framework for resolving bilateral trade 
issues after six months. Therefore, when I handed over my duties 
to Mr. Hosokawa, I said, "Mr. Hosokawa, you will have to forge a 
consensus within each ministry by the end of the year, in order 
to prepare a concrete plan for trimming Japan's massive trade 
surplus, before you head to Washington for the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks." 
  Unfortunately, Prime Minister Hosokawa was very busy dealing 
with domestic affairs until the eve of the Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting. He managed to get political reform bills through the 
Diet, but he was compelled to scrap his tax-hike plan [to 
replace the 3-percent consumption tax with a 7-percent national 
welfare tax]. He was too busy to catch his breath until he got 
onto the plane heading for the United States. His mind was too 
occupied with domestic affairs to think about the Japan-U.S. 
trade talks. He did real wrong in delaying the drafting of the 
budget plan for the new fiscal year. I think that the 
government should have compiled the fiscal year 1994 annual 
budget by the end of 1993. 
  [Tadaki] Do you think that the Japan-U.S. relationship has 
now declined to a critical level? 
  [Miyazawa] As they did at the Lillehammer winter Olympic 
games, Japanese reporters probably had the urge to report [on 
the progress at the Japan-U.S. summit talks] by saying: "Go, 
Japan, go; we won!" However, reality does not allow us to be 
pleased with the outcome of the summit, in saying that the two 
countries now enjoy "relations of equality." For the United 
States, the failure of the framework talks means that there is 
no longer any commitment between the two countries. Moreover, 
the negotiations will not resume for awhile. Now, the U.S. 
concern is how to exert pressure on Japan. The U.S. 
administration, as well as the U.S. Congress, is expected to 
make the utmost efforts to pressure Japan to lower its trade 
surplus and to further open its market. 
  Now, the U.S. Congress is considering a bill designed to 
impose sanctions on Japan. However, [John D.] Rockefeller is in 
the Senate. In a recent speech, Clinton said: "Rockefeller, 
who is a great Japanophile, is on my side [on this issue]. This 
inspires me with great confidence." Rockefeller's family, from 
the time of his father, has loved Japan, and he studied at the 
International Christian University [in Tokyo]. We should do our 
best to respond [to the United States' demands]. 
  "The United States gives the rest of the world a helping 
hand, simply because it wants to spread its values, because it 
wants to make its values common to all, and because it wants to 
foster its values in the four corners of the world," Henry 
Kissinger has said seriously in the past. Despite the end of 
the cold war, or I should rather say because of the end of the 
cold war, Japan and the United States should have a common goal 
in mind, which is the spreading of their values throughout the 
world. 
  Moreover, to be more realistic, Japan will have to further 
improve its relations with Southeast Asian nations, as well as 
with China. Each of these countries has its own potential 
enemy: Some are afraid of Japan, while some others are nervous 
about China. However, no country feels this way toward the 
United States. The United States constitutes a stabilizing 
force in this part of the world. Japan needs the United States 
not only for its own sake, because the U.S. presence in Asia is 
also indispensable for Japan's maintaining intimate relations 
with China and Southeast Asian nations in the 21st century. 
  When I made a tour of Southeast Asia in 1993, I delivered a 
speech in Bangkok to set out the so-called "Miyazawa Doctrine." 
A storm of applause arose particularly when I said: "Japan 
will never become a military power. Even if there is a conflict 
in Asia, Japan is not able to play the role of a policeman. 
Moreover, it will never try to perform such a duty." All 
Southeast Asian nations still expect the United States to 
continue to act as a stabilizing force in this part of the world. 
<H5>  Political Situation: The Mission of the "Political Reform </H5>
Government" Is Now Over 
  [Tadaki] Prime Minister Hosokawa caused a stir by announcing 
a tax hike plan. He failed to reach an agreement on trade with 
President Clinton. He was forced to withdraw his 
cabinet-reshuffle plan. Under such circumstances, it seems that 
he can hardly maintain his high popularity. 
  [Miyazawa] The Hosokawa administration was created to 
accomplish political reform. In my opinion, there is no more 
justification for its existence because it has already completed 
its mission. However, Prime Minister Hosokawa does not think 
so. He thinks that his administration should also achieve 
economic reform, as well as administrative reform. If he really 
wants to do so, he has to give priority to adjusting the 
policies between coalition members. Otherwise, nothing will go 
smoothly. As a matter of fact, his tax hike plan and his 
cabinet-reshuffle plan have caused flaps because of a lack of 
coordination. The Hosokawa administration can barely coordinate 
policies because the eight coalition members did not forge 
common ground on key policies at the start. To bystanders, 
everything that Prime Minister Hosokawa does seems to be very 
precarious. 
  [Tadaki] Behind the uncertainty lies the difference in views 
about political realignment, namely the conflict between those 
who favor a "two-party system" and those who prefer a "moderate 
multiparty system." What do you think of this? 
  [Miyazawa] Under the market system, there will always be 
some 
people who will be in a disadvantageous position or who will 
find it difficult to survive in a highly competitive world. Not 
including Marxism, I think it is necessary to have political 
groups, such as the Social Democratic Party of Japan, to act as 
these people's spokesmen. In my opinion, about 20 percent of 
politicians should be the mouthpiece of these people. Thus, I 
wonder whether a two-party system would really benefit the 
public. It will be regrettable if the current multiparty system 
is transformed into a two-party system and if constitutional 
reform becomes the main point of contention between the two 
parties. Although this issue needs to be discussed thoroughly, 
I do not appreciate a framework under which there are two big 
parties arguing over the question of whether the Constitution 
should be revised. 
  [Tadaki] Ichiro Ozawa says that the use of armed force is 
justifiable when this is done as an international contribution. 
How to you view his concept of a "normal country?" 
  [Miyazawa] UN Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali 
previously stressed that the United Nations will intervene in 
regional conflicts by bringing UN troops into action to create a 
peaceful world. However, what happened in Somalia shows that 
matters do not work out this way in reality. Moreover, at this 
moment, the United Nations does not have the fullest confidence 
of people as a neutral and fair organization. When I look at 
what has happened in the world recently, I can say that things 
are not moving in the direction called for by Mr. Ozawa. 
  The expression "fighting in a just cause" remains a dreadful 
memory for Japanese. The memory of the past cannot disappear so 
easily. Japanese feel strongly that Japan should never repeat 
its past mistake. Japanese might think differently should the 
international situation turn ugly. Fortunately, the 
international situation is taking a favorable turn. Therefore, 
Japanese should continue to follow their pacifist line with 
confidence. 
  Now, let us suppose that Japan revises the Constitution to 
strengthen its military, of course in the cause of self-defense. 
In the long run, some people will certainly begin to say that 
the most cost-effective solution for Japan is to go nuclear. 
Enforcing mandatory military service is practically impossible 
in Japan. A volunteer system is possible, but no matter which 
way it is done, military personnel costs will increase. 
Therefore, some people will insist that the best way is to 
become a nuclear power. Setting aside the question of whether 
it will be possible to deploy nuclear weapons on land, some 
people will certainly argue that Japan at least can have a 
submarine with a nuclear capability. 
  To say nothing of a despotic state, if a democratic nation 
wants to keep from using its nuclear weapons but wants to have a 
potential for deterrence, it absolutely should have a completely 
mature control system. What I would like to stress here is that 
it is not easy for Japan to have such a control system. 
  When President George Bush came to Japan in January 1992, he 
fainted during a banquet held at the prime minister's official 
residence. Instead of staying with her husband, Mrs. Barbara 
Bush continued to enjoy the banquet. She told me, "I am staying 
here because if I leave with him, I will give an incorrect 
impression to the world." 
  As a first lady, she was fully aware that the entire world 
is 
watching every move of the U.S. president, because the key to 
launching a nuclear attack is in his hands. I was deeply 
impressed by her stately manner. 
  [Tadaki] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has discharged 
its duties under the cold war era. Don't you think that the 
party needs to accomplish self-reform? 
  [Miyazawa] The LDP has lost the public's confidence because 
of its money-dominated politics. Its policy itself was not so 
bad. What we need is a structural reform of the party, and we 
are conscious that it will take time for the public to recognize 
that our party has undergone a drastic change. Once self-reform 
is achieved, I am sure that our party will be able to win the 
confidence of the public again as a political party that will 
carry out a comprehensive policy in the public interest.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial staffer Keiko Ito: "Popular </F>
Support Has Declined, and the JNP Is Bewildered"] 
  [Text] Recently, the office of Akio Nakajima, a Japan New 
Party [JNP] Diet member, has been receiving faxes and telephone 
calls one after another from his supporters in protesting: 
  "I have doubts about [the planned formation of] a joint 
parliamentary group with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. (In 
light of the JNP's philosophy) should not the JNP draw a line 
between themselves and the former Tanaka faction?" 
  "Are you going to take down the banner you raised during the 
election campaign?" 
  There have been nearly 10 [figure as published] calls so 
far. 
  Two months have passed since the relationship between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who heads the JNP, and Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads Sakigake [Harbinger], 
started to crack. Hosokawa has gradually started to tilt toward 
Ichiro Ozawa's Shinseito, and some media reported that "the JNP 
and Shinseito will form a joint parliamentary group." [The 
protests] were sent immediately after this. 
  "We never abandoned our slogan of clean [politics]," 
Nakajima 
explained earnestly at a meeting of his supporters. 
  After graduating from the Chinese Department at the Osaka 
University of Foreign Studies and the Ethics Department at the 
University of Tokyo, he worked at the Ministry of Education for 
27 years. Since his retirement, he had worked at a private 
education firm until the JNP asked him to be "a candidate." At 
the age of 57, he started his political career [as a Diet 
member] from the Kanagawa No. 3 lower house district. 
  "Frankly, I was elected because there was a `wind [blowing 
for the JNP].' Dirtying our `clean' image is most problematic," 
Nakajima says. 
  According to him, [the JNP and] Sakigake, the JNP's 
parliamentary group partner, are holding special committee 
meetings and staff meetings together every day, and all of their 
members get along well. 
  "The images of [the JNP and Sakigake] are similar, and their 
members are like-minded. At the same time, it is the power of 
Shinseito that is firmly supporting the shaky coalition cabinet. 
Both parties are important partners for us." 
<H5>  Plan To Form Joint Parliament Group: A Complete Surprise </H5>
  There are many troubled Diet members such as Nakajima. 
  "The secret of Hosokawa's popularity lies in the way he 
handles both Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa skillfully. Favoring 
one runs counter to why the people support him" (says Diet 
member Fumihiko Igarashi). 
  "If we had married Sakigake then [referring to the planned 
merger between the JNP and Sakigake last year], we would be able 
to talk frankly with Shinseito now" (says a young JNP member). 
  The talk of forming a joint parliamentary union was "a 
complete surprise" to most JNP Diet members (says JNP Secretary 
General Masuo Matsuoka). 
  According to Matsuoka, the misfortune of the JNP and 
Hosokawa 
is the fact that "the leader of the small `Hosokawa' party 
suddenly rose to be prime minister." 
  Since he assumed the post of prime minister in August, 
Hosokawa has been away from his party headquarters in Takanawa, 
Tokyo, for approximately seven months. During that time, he was 
extremely busy with his duties as prime minister and was not 
involved at all with party affairs. 
  [The frequency of] visits made by [JNP] party officials to 
the Prime Minister's Official Residence to brief [Hosokawa on 
party affairs] was every several days. Matsuoka says that this 
stood in contrast to the fact that members of Sakigake came to 
see Takemura, who is also at the prime minister's official 
residence, so often that members of the other parties would ask 
ironically, "Is this Sakigake's office?" 
  Hosokawa told JNP members, "I want to make a sharp 
distinction between the job of prime minister and party affairs. 
Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka used to do so." 
  And JNP members were said to be refraining from visiting 
Hosokawa because they thought, "It is not desirable for his 
`relatives' [members of his own party] to always be hanging 
around the prime minister." 
  "The owner," who had been managing all affairs, was absent 
for seven months. As a result, as a young JNP member described, 
"No `employee' knows what his `employer' is thinking." 
  Often, there were discrepancies in opinions and feelings 
regarding a change of personnel and party rules between young 
JNP Diet members, who were elected last summer, and the staff of 
the secretariat, who have been supporting Hosokawa since his 
days as governor [of Kumamoto Prefecture] and as a an upper 
house member. 
  "It is Diet members who develop a party!" 
  "A party has a history of its own!" 
  They shouted at each other, and this was reported as a 
"split 
in the JNP," or "internal strife." 
  After all, an agreement could not be reached within the 
party 
on the personnel changes for the new leadership for the JNP to 
begin in earnest as a party, and the matter was left to the 
leader's discretion. 
  Hosokawa reportedly told Nakajima, who visited the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence at the beginning of March, "The 
party and I seem to have drifted apart. I think I should visit 
the party at least once a week from now on." 
  Approval Rate Down From 17 Percent to 12 Percent 
  According to an opinion poll conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN at 
the end of February, the support rate for the JNP declined from 
17 percent, at the time of a poll in November, to 14 percent in 
December, and then to 12 percent. The JNP had difficult 
campaigns in which four of its eight official candidates were 
defeated in municipal assembly elections in Hino and Machida in 
Tokyo in late February. The party has about 30,000 members. 
  Ryozo Nagata, executive director of the JNP, said "due to 
the 
controversy over the national welfare tax, party membership has 
not increased since January." 
  The decline in the JNP's popularity is evident to everybody. 
  Soon after he was inaugurated as prime minister Hosokawa 
repeatedly told JNP Diet members: "Your greatest task is to be 
returned once again at the next election. Please devote all 
your energy to strengthening your home territory." 
  One Diet member commented: "We do not have networks of local 
supporters or national reputations, very must understand that we 
would have not been elected if we had not caught hold of the 
coattails of Mr. Hosokawa." 
<H5>  To Study Policies or To Visit Local Districts </H5>
  The JNP has 42 Diet members, 20 seats in the Tokyo 
Metropolitan Assembly, and more than 10 members in prefectural 
and municipal assemblies. The average age of JNP lower house 
members is only 42. 
  Takashi Kawamura, a JNP Diet member, plans soon to launch 
the 
"Raison d'Etre Study Group" and he is urging every JNP Diet 
member to join. The purpose of the group is to study the future 
course of the JNP in the coalition government. 
  In the 10 years since he started his career in politics, 
Kawamura has belonged to the Democratic Socialist Party and the 
Liberal Democratic Party, and he has been defeated twice. In 
the JNP, which has been ridiculed as "a group of amateurs," he 
is a senior member. 
  He thinks the JNP, which has been helped by the mood of the 
country to make progress, needs financial backing and a network 
of local supporters to become a real political party. 
  Visiting his local district, Kawamura takes bus trips or 
goes 
to the theater with his supporters. Young JNP Diet members 
criticize that as being "LDP-like." 
  Kawamura tells them to, "visit your local districts more," 
but the young members believe "the duty of a politician is to 
study policies." 
  "Standing at the bow of a small ship sailing into a troubled 
sea, I would like to sail out flying the flag of an idealism 
that we are in danger of losing," Hosokawa said in a declaration 
on the party's establishment two years ago. 
  The spirit that led to the formation of the party was a 
search for political ideals, not money or electoral territory, 
and that must have been why voters supported the JNP. 
  Now that the wind has died down, JNP Diet members find 
themselves tossed about by the calls for political realignment, 
and have only just started to work on finding a way for the JNP 
to survive.

  [Text] On 1 April, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa said he felt that now that the political reform bills 
have been enacted, the ruling coalition parties should reexamine 
agreements they made last July and work out agreements regarding 
such issues as security policies and tax system reform, in 
particular. He made the remark during a news conference at a 
hotel in Kyoto, where he made an appearance during part of his 
stumping tour. Specifically, Ichikawa proposed a plan to set up 
a new "council on basic issues" (tentative name) under the 
coalition party representatives' conference to coordinate 
policies among the ruling coalition parties in preparation for 
the next general election. He plans to formally present the 
proposal at a 4 April representatives meeting. 
  Regarding the political situation since the enactment of the 
political reform bills, Ichikawa said: "The situations at home 
and abroad have drastically changed since the coalition 
government's inauguration last July, as exemplified by such 
developments as the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development." 
He then stressed the need for working out agreements among 
ruling coalition parties to promote cooperation in the next 
general election, saying: "We should work out both an agreement 
on mutually essential points and a new outline of policies." 
  In the ruling coalition alliance, a plan to set up a "policy 
study group" was recently shelved due to opposition by such 
parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan. This study 
group was expected to serve as a stepping stone toward the 
formation of a new party to unify the coalition partners into a 
single party. In this regard, Ichikawa said: "In the future, 
even should the ruling coalition parties decide not to move 
toward (the formation of) a new party, they cannot cooperate in 
elections unless their basic policies are coordinated." 
  Regarding the process of making adjustments among ruling 
coalition parties in selecting candidates for the next general 
election, Ichikawa said: "I expected the process to begin in 
April, but the issue of setting up a policy study group has 
created unnecessary misunderstandings, resulting in straining 
the relations (among the coalition partners). Therefore, there 
may be a slight delay." He thus indicated the process is 
expected to start later than originally planned.

  [Excerpts] It has been said that the political and 
administration system has become obsolete. With such a view in 
mind, ASAHI SHIMBUN interviewed in late March administrative 
vice ministers of ministries and agencies, who are top-ranking 
career bureaucrats. In the interview, they were asked what they 
make of the criticism of bureaucrats. Asked how bureaucrats and 
the bureaucratic system should change, eight vice 
ministers--about 40 percent of the total vice ministers 
responding--admitted that there is "a harmful influence caused 
by bureaucratic sectionalism," and they said it is necessary to 
correct such a system. Meanwhile, most of them made the 
counterargument that it is not reasonable to criticize 
bureaucrats for playing a central role in decisionmaking in 
policy matters, and most denied that there is collusion between 
bureaucrats and politicians or business circles. [passage 
omitted on remarks by Education Ministry and Management and 
Coordination Agency vice ministers who hint that there are 
interministry struggles to protect the interests of their own 
ministries] 
  In suggesting how to get rid of the harmful effects of 
bureaucratic sectionalism, Shigeo Mochizuki, administrative vice 
minister for construction, said that "we want to promote 
personnel exchanges between ministries." Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito said that "the current administration system has 
to be corrected under the leadership of the government." 
  When asked to comment on the criticism that bureaucrats take 
the initiative in deciding on policies, 15 out of a total of 21 
interviewees made a counterargument by saying that "such 
criticism is not reasonable." Five vice ministers declined to 
give a clear-cut answer on this. 
  Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and 
telecommunications, said that "it is natural for the 
administrative sector to speak up about policy matters within 
their jurisdiction." Many of those who made a counterargument 
expressed a similar view. Vice Foreign Minister Saito said that 
"it is partly unavoidable for bureaucrats to have a greater say" 
because the coalition government has so little experience in 
governing. At the same time, however, he said: "It is natural 
for the public to have doubts about bureaucrats' role, and it 
may be true that bureaucrats are playing a leading role in 
decision-making in policy matters. Bureaucrats must heed the 
principle of not making the final decision." 
  When asked what they think of the criticism of Japanese 
bureaucrats leveled by the United States in the course of the 
recent Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito said: "It is regrettable to be the target of 
criticism. We will give careful attention to criticism in a 
humble way, and we hope to remove the misunderstanding, if there 
is any." Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, said that the criticism "was 
amplified" beyond bearable limits, thus expressing his 
dissatisfaction with the U.S. criticism. 
  As for the issue of the alleged deep collusion between 
bureaucrats on the one hand and politicians and business circles 
on the other, most of them, while denying their collusion with 
political and business circles, said that "it is necessary to 
exchange opinions with politicians and business leaders, and 
this is not collusion" (said Vice Transportation Minister 
Michihiko Matsuo). 
  When asked what they think of former bureaucrats' finding 
employment with companies formerly under their jurisdiction, 
many answered in the affirmative in view of finding a new job. 
Some indirectly admitted the fact that former bureaucrats find 
employment in this way, saying "I cannot say that no former 
bureaucrats find employment with companies which are related to 
ministries or agencies for which they worked, but...." 
(according to Shigekazu Mori, vice minister of home affairs).

  [Text] What do elite bureaucrats in "Kasumigaseki" think 
about public criticism of government officials' practices? From 
mid-March to 1 April, ASAHI SHIMBUN surveyed division 
chief-class bureaucrats of the central government through 
interviews or mailed questionnaires, and obtained 267 responses. 
Regarding an opinion that "the nation's policymaking 
authorities are concentrated to bureaucrats rather than 
politicians," over 60 percent of division chiefs acknowledged 
such tendencies. This presented great contrast with responses 
from vice ministers, as 15 out of 21 vice ministers denied 
"bureaucrat-led policymaking." In mailed questionnaires, we 
also asked about bureaucrats' post-retirement jobs in the 
industrial sectors under their control. Over 90 percent of 
respondents said such practices are "necessary" or "inevitable," 
and 80 percent said they would "take" such job offers. 
  While vice ministers took prudent attitudes toward our 
questions, division chiefs showed more straightforward responses. 
  In the questionnaire, we provided two questions about 
"bureaucrat-led policymaking." In response to a true-or-false 
question asking if public criticism of bureaucrats is true," 96 
chiefs (36 percent) said "true," and 127 (48 percent) said 
"false." The remaining 44 (16 percent) gave no answer. However, 
when asked to freely describe opinions on the criticism of 
"bureaucrat-led policymaking," 167 respondents, or 63 percent, 
acknowledged such tendencies, or noted "social backgrounds 
inevitably produces bureaucrat-led policymaking." 
  However, 66 respondents (25 percent) said they "do not think 
bureaucrats have superior policymaking power." 
  As "background of bureaucrat-led policymaking," many 
respondents indicated lack of politicians' leadership, political 
parties' policy staff, and the Hosokawa administration's 
managing ability. About two-thirds, or 109 out of 167 chiefs 
who acknowledged "bureaucrat-led policymaking" noted that it is 
caused by problems among politicians. 
  Some division chiefs showed bureaucrats' high self-esteem by 
indicating "politicians cannot compete with bureaucrats who are 
selected from very competitive universities and still face 
severe competition everyday" (as noted by a Labor Ministry 
division chief). On the other hand, they expressed complicated 
feelings by indicating the limitations in bureaucrat-led 
policymaking. 
  Regarding a public belief that "bureaucrats find 
post-retirement jobs in the private sector making the most of 
the government rules and authority," 147 respondents (44 
percent) said "true," and 98 (37 percent) said "false." 
  In the "comments" column for the question, 179 out of 212 
respondents (92 percent) who returned mailed questionnaires 
showed positive attitudes toward such post-retirement jobs. 
Some noted the practice is favorable from a viewpoint of 
manpower utilization. A National Land Development Agency 
division chief said: "(Bureaucrats) have experience, managing 
ability, and wide-ranging relationships. Their abilities must 
be utilized." Others noted most career bureaucrats are required 
to retire in their 50's, and "a post-retirement career in the 
private sector is needed make a living." A Management and 
Coordination Agency respondent even said "the practice is the 
only benefit for bureaucrats, and this must be left untouched." 
  Then we asked, "if you are offered a private-sector position 
after your retirement, would you take it?" In reply, 86 out of 
107 respondents (80 percent) "I would," "I would positively 
think about it," or "I would have to take the job to make a 
living." 
  The survey was intended for 1,028 division chiefs of all 
ministries and agencies, including the National Police Agency 
and the Imperial Household Agency. We conducted interviews for 
65 chiefs working with ministerial secretariats, and obtained 
other responses through the mail. Responses were obtained from 
267 chiefs, including 55 from those who were interviewed.

  [Text] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, made an appearance on a program broadcast by 
the FNN Television Network on 3 April and commented on such 
issues as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's controversial 100 
million yen loan from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking group 
which has caused a delay in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 
year 1994 draft budget. Watanabe said: "Although there may be 
arguments against my opinion, I feel that everyone will make 
efforts to resolve the situation this week. I plan to do my 
part." He thus indicated that the situation should be resolved 
this week in order to normalize the Diet's deliberations on the 
draft budget. 
  Concerning rumors regarding the possible dissolution of the 
lower house of the Diet and the resignation of the entire 
cabinet as a result of this, Watanabe said: "A dissolution of 
the lower house rarely occurs, but it cannot be ruled out." As 
for the resignation of the entire cabinet, however, Watanabe 
said, "It is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
intends to corner the cabinet into resigning altogether, but the 
party needs to think a little more about what to do afterwards." 
He thus indicated that the party should take a more cautious 
approach, taking into account the possibility of forming a 
cabinet "supported by the whole nation," in which the LDP would 
also participate. 
  In this connection, Watanabe also made a comment regarding 
the LDP's cooperation with the ruling coalition government. He 
said: "If requested to do so by the government, and should our 
demands be adopted, it is only natural for the party to 
cooperate. We also have the option of providing support from 
outside or within the cabinet." 
  Regarding the possibility of a further political realignment 
taking place this year, Watanabe said, "I think there is a 
70-percent chance of this happening." He added, however: "In 
case an emergency should arise concerning the Korean peninsula 
issue, it will be necessary to make prompt decisions (regarding 
how the government intends to deal with the situation). It 
(further political realignment) will not happen if the 
government fails to carry out political measures and merely 
continues to remain a lazy, diabetic cabinet (in responding only 
to symptoms while putting off the real problem)." He thus 
pointed out the possibility that a further political realignment 
could be triggered by a split between the ruling coalition 
parties regarding foreign affairs and other policies. 
  As for the emergence of moves within the LDP recommending 
that Watanabe assume the post of party vice president, Watanabe 
said, "Although I have not been directly requested to do so (by 
LDP President Yohei Kono), I have heard about them."

  [Text] Interested Diet members of the ruling coalition 
parties will start a new policy study group, "Study Group on 
Japan's Security and Future Course [Nihon no Anzen Hosho to 
Shinro wo Kangaeru Kai]," on 6 April. Yukihisa Yoshida, 
Democratic Socialist Party member of the upper house, will be 
the chairman of the group, and members will include Tatsuro 
Matsumae, member of the Socialist Democratic Party of Japan 
upper house; Hideaki Tamura, member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] upper house; and Natsuo Yamaguchi, memebr of Komeito 
lower house. Moves, mostly initiated by Shinseito, to form study 
groups across party boundaries on specific policy issues have 
been quite active after a plan to form a "Policy Study Group" of 
all ruling coalition parties to discuss overall policy failed to 
take off. However, this will be the first time a policy group 
on defense will be formed.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency [NASDA] and 
such space-related industrial firms as Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. plan to 
radically redesign the H-2 rocket, Japan's major large-scale 
launch vehicle, to make it practical for commercial use. 
Considerable modifications are to be made, including 
improvements to the "LE-7" main engine, in a bid to reduce 
current launch costs 30 percent within three years and 
eventually to cut costs in half. It cost 16 billion yen to 
launch the first H-2 rocket recently. 
  Currently, Arianespace of France holds a 60-percent share of 
the world's market in the rocket business for launching 
communications satellites and other payloads. NASDA and the 
Japanese companies plan not only to gain a foothold in this 
domain, but also to help promote further achievements in 
Japanese space development efforts, which include the "Hope" 
project. 
  Makers of space-related equipment and the Rocket System 
Corporation (based in Minato-ku, Tokyo, with Takaaki Yamada as 
president), a space industry consortium set up to handle 
procurement of the H-2, have compiled a list of several hundred 
modifications, the major points of which are as follows: 1) to 
reduce the number of components of the LE-7 main engine; 2) to 
use less expensive material for the rocket's fairings; and 3) to 
reconsider major components of the rocket's second stage "LE-5" 
engine. These modifications are expected to help reduce costs 
by taking full advantage of the merits of simplifying the 
manufacturing process and mass production techniques. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has proposed the development of 
a 
improved version of the LE-7, which is the heart of the H-2 
rocket. The company hopes to save several hundreds of millions 
of yen by saving extra work in the manufacturing process through 
such procedures as repositioning engine components, while 
leaving the engine's main structure untouched. 
  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries plans to reduce the 
number of parts for a turbo pump that is a major component for 
the LE-7 and LE-5 engines. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries has proposed using less expensive 
material where possible. For example, it has suggested changing 
titanium parts used in the H-2's fairings to steel parts for 
sections that do not require extremely high-quality parts. 
  Nissan Motor Company, which handles the production of 
auxiliary rocket boosters, plans to improve manufacturing 
processes. 
  NASDA plans to make a decision on which proposals to adopt, 
hopefully by mid-April. 
  Currently, it costs approximately 19 billion yen to launch 
one H-2 rocket, including both manufacturing and fuel costs. 
Costs cannot be cut back for the next two launches. There is a 
considerable difference between the cost of launching an H-2 
rocket and that of launching an Ariane rocket; it costs 
approximately 10 billion yen to launch the latter. Therefore, 
NASDA has asked concerned companies to submit proposals 
regarding improvements in the H-2's design. 
  Modifications are to be made to the H-2 for its sixth and 
seventh launches scheduled around 1997-99. Plans are to reduce 
manufacturing costs by 30 percent. 
  Furthermore, for the H-2's twelfth launch scheduled after 
2000, plans are to cut back manufacturing costs by 50 percent to 
8 billion yen, with total launch costs, which includes the cost 
of the rocket's maintenance and inspection as well as fuel, 
reduced to approximately 11 billion yen.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 4 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Dozens of 
herdsmen's gers, a national dwelling, and large pasture area 
were on fire and hundreds of head of cattle perished due to the 
steppe fire extending throughout the territory of a number of 
somons of the two eastern aymags of Mongolia, namely Suhbaatar 
and Dornod ones. Burnt in a fire lasting one and half day was 
an area 300 km long and 150 km wide. Fortunately, there are not 
any human casualties recorded in connection with this fire. 
  According to the MONTSAME correspondent from the Suhbaatar 
aymag, the fire flared up firstly on the territory of the 
Munhhaan somon of the aymag. So far the reason for the fire to 
have broken out has not been established.

<F P=106> [Article by Chipa Thar from MYANMA ALIN; date not given: </F>
"Do Not Slaughter an Elephant To Distribute to the Community" 
-- from the "Their Views" program] 
  [Text] We have been kept informed of the reports tabled at 
the National Convention plenary session through the extracts of 
important portions broadcast by the radio and published in the 
press. We are grateful for this. Being fully aware of the 
motto that the emergence of the new constitution is the duty of 
all citizens, the extracts are of particular interest to us 
because the future constitution will be based on what is being 
discussed at the plenary session. The following is our review 
of the proposals and discussions at the National Convention 
plenary session held from 23 to 31 March. 
  There were discussions aimed at altering, adding provisions 
to, and criticizing the basic principles that had been laid 
down. Frankly, they amounted to subtle and outright opposition 
to the basic principles that had already been laid down. The 
entire world -- not just Myanmar [Burma] -- is aware of the 104 
basic principles that have been welcomed and supported by 
hundreds of thousands of people at mass rallies. 
  As a member of the public, I believe that the National 
Convention must implement its work step by step. If 
retrospection, criticism, and blame for past events are 
accepted, then the implementation of the original objective will 
be marked by confusion and slowness instead of progress. It 
will be viewed as excessive magnanimity and concession. 
  The very essence of democracy is to follow the wishes of the 
majority of organizations. If the tendency to challenge the 
majority is practiced -- like the maxim of one against the 
entire village -- it will not only amount to disrespect for 
democracy, but the destruction of democratic practices. 
  In some matters, what the majority likes may be identical to 
what the individual likes, while in some cases what the majority 
likes may not be approved of by an individual or what an 
individual likes may not be acceptable to the majority. A 
genuine politician tends to concede to the wishes of the 
majority if his wishes clash with those of the majority. A 
self-centered and subjective person can end up fighting against 
the entire world. 
  We heard the discussions by flexible delegates who gave 
priority to the national interest over the interests of their 
own national races and regions. We respect and admire these 
people who expressed in their reports a willingness to be abide 
by whatever decisions are made by the National Convention and 
declared categorically that they would not secede from the Union. 
  At the National Convention there were those who were noble 
as 
well as those who were petty. There were expressions of belief 
and terms tinged with anger, pride, sarcasm, and insinuation as 
well as sincere and polite presentation of views. 
  We were amazed at how those self-centered people, who are 
prisoners of their own subjective views, made small concessions 
but then sought exorbitant and greedy demands in an intimidating 
manner from the other side, which was barely left with anything. 
  It is like killing an elephant for distribution to the 
community. They made the demands to exploit the existence of 
national races who are the same as them living in other regions, 
although the demands could mean the extinction of others living 
in these regions. The emergence of self-administered zones is 
not a matter based on one's wishes alone. Wishes can lead to 
anxiety, over zealousness, and one-sidedness. It is easy to 
remedy this matter if the basic principles are followed as they 
were laid down. 
  Merely having sufficient population is not enough for the 
emergence of a self-administered zone. To be more specific, a 
national race may have a population of 1 million, with 3,125 
people spread out in 320 townships. Are we to prescribe the 320 
townships for that particular national race? The crucial point 
to consider is collective residence in congruous territory. If 
a national race that does not constitute a majority in a 
township claims a self- administered township, it will amount to 
a blatant act of dominance over the majority of national races 
residing in that particular township. The use of pressure 
cannot bring about a stable administration; only concrete 
conditions will bring about a just decision. 
  Government organizations are fully informed of the concrete 
conditions regarding government work. Myanmar has its census 
figures with records and gazetteers in each village tract, ward, 
and township. Furthermore, it is not difficult for a government 
to carry out field work to assess the current situation. If a 
commission is formed and field work is carried out, it will take 
much time. 
  Let there be arguments and excuses. In the final analysis, 
the truth -- concrete evidence, records, gazetteers, and 
statistics -- will be presented, and time will determine what 
should happen. It is important, however, not to store arrows 
before war. Our delegates should not be overzealous and proud. 
They should say what they have to say and demand only what they 
have to demand in the interest of the entire nation and people. 
  We should avoid slaughtering an elephant to provide a single 
meal to the community.

  [TEXT][Excerpts][passage omitted]-Chairman of the State Law 
and Order Restoration Council Senior General Than Shwe said the 
central Myanmar gets insufficient rain and thereby becomes a dry 
zone resulting in the low yield of crops. The people of the 
area still lag behind in development as a result, he said. 
Irrigation networks are now being built under the project for 
greening the nine arid districts in central Myanmar, which will 
eventually raise the standard of living of the people in the 
area. He said it is necessary to make efforts in construction of 
irrigation networks for the speeding of the local populace. 
  The project for greening of the nine arid districts is 
amined 
at conserving water resources, he said. Although irrigation 
networks built in the area are not large, a great number of the 
facilities will provide sufficient water supply for greening the 
area. With an increase in the sown acreage there will be a rise 
in the standard of living of the people, he said. Hence, he 
said, local authorities have been instructed to strive for the 
success of project for greening the nine arid districts. 
  He stressed the need to give priority to establishing forest 
plantations as forests are essential for water supply, 
preventing land erosion and for favourable weather conditions. 
Irrigation networks are being implemented under special 
projects for regional development and enhancing the standard of 
living of the people, he said. He urged farmers of the 
different regions to make efficient utilization of water to earn 
their livelihood and to bring about regional development. 
  He urged service personnel to implement the projects, and 
try 
their best to serve the interests of the nation and the people. 
  He pointed out that Development of transportation and 
communication systems are vital for economic development. 
Hence, he said, attention must be paid to construction and 
repair of roads and bridges which are contributory to trade and 
commerce. He further noted that better transportation and 
communications links will contribute towards economic 
development in all regions, and growing contacts among the 
various national races will lead to consolidating friendship. 
  He spoke of the need to give priority in stages to transport 
and communications for national development. He emphasized that 
the projects for the construction of the six bridges across the 
respective rivers are to be implemented without fail for the 
development of national economy and local people. 
  He pointed out that the special projects are being 
undertaken 
according to the needs of the State. Hence, he said work must 
begin from wherever possible for the success of the projects. 
He said that the State will provide what is necessary in the 
process, and all those responsible are to work hard. 
  He also stressed the need to establish a system with 
responsible personnel who will be overseeing that State funds 
are put to good use. He called on the people to strive in 
concert with the local authorities and do best to complete the 
projects as scheduled. 
  The meeting ended at 3:45 pm. 
  Special pojects 
  Arrangements are being made under Special Projects 
Implementation programme to build six major bridges across the 
river in the various states and division and accordingly the 
bridge across the Thanlwin River near Hpa-an Townships will be 
built to forge national solidarity, bringing about proportionate 
development to border areas and states and divisions, ensuring 
secure and smooth transportation for regular and smooth flow of 
goods and to bring about economic and social development in 
Kayin State. 
  The bridge will be built with iron beams and frame and the 
piers will be built of reinforced concrete. It will be 900 
metre long and the motor road will be 8.5 metres and there will 
footpaths on either side of the road. The bridge will be built 
in such a way that it will be able to withstand 60-ton motor 
vehicles passing over it. 
  As Ayeyarwady River flows from north to south it divides the 
western bank from the eastern bank and therefore the 
communication links between the eastern sector and western 
sector is difficult. The Sagaing Bridge built in the upper part 
of Myanmar has enabled people to travel direct between Kachin 
State, Chin State, Sagaing Division, Mandalay Division and Shan 
State and has helped to bring about development to the region. 
  Similarly, if there is a bridge across the Ayeyarwady River 
near Pyay Township, then there will be a direct communication 
link between Rakhine State, Bago Division, Mayway Division and 
Ayeyarwady Division and this will not only ensure secure and 
smooth transportation, but will also bring about economic and 
social development of the people in the region and when people 
mingle and travel from one place to another it will assist in 
strengthening national unity. 
  In order to improve communication links between the states 
and divisions, a bridge will be built across Ayeyarwady River 
near Pyay Township. It will be a bridge made of iron frames and 
reinforced concrete. It will be 1,275 metre long and will 
include footpaths, each 8.5 metres wide. It will withstand 
60-ton motor vehicles using it. 
  New roads are being built and old ones renovated in 
Ayeyarwady Division in order to be able to transport goods 
smoothly and expeditiously as the division produces the highest 
amount of paddy, fish and meat and agriculture products. 
Arrangements are being made to build brigdes across the river 
so that the roads in the division are connected with one another 
and could be used without any disruptions and have direct links 
with Yangon. Hence Myaungmy Bridge will be built across the 
river near Myaungmya Township and another bridge across Toe 
River near Maubin Township. 
  The Myaugmya Bridge will be built near Payachaung Ward in 
Myaungmya and will be of a prestressed concrete bridge. On 
completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between 
Myaungmya-Einme-Kyaunggon Road, Myaungmya-Einme-Karka-Pathein 
Road and Myaugmya-Labutta Road. 
  The Toe Bridge is also a prestressed concrete type bridge. 
On completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between 
Twantay-Maubin Road, Maubin-Hsarmalauk Road, 
Maubin-Yaylegalay-Mawlamyinegyun Road and Maubin-Kyaiklat Road. 
  The Chaung-U Pakokku Railroad was built to ensure secure and 
smooth transportation and to bring about development to the 
border areas and national races. Arrangements are being made to 
build a bridge across Chindwin River on the Chaung-U-Pakokku 
Railroad between Minywa village in Yesagyo Township and a place 
near Tawkyaunggyi village in Chaung-U Township. 
  This bridge will be made of steel frames and will be 
7,111.04 
feet long and 60.68 feet wide. There will be a motor road, a 
railroad and footpaths on the bridge. 
  On completion of the bridge passenger and goods 
transportation will be speeded up and the development in regions 
on the western bank of Ayeyarwady River and on either bank of 
the Chindwin River will be greatly enhanced. 
  The Myanma Railways is laying the Pakokku-Gangaw-Kalay 
Railroad which will link up with the Chaungy-U-Pakokku Road. 
The Myittha Bridge will be built across the Myittha River at 
Kanywa on eastern bank of the river on the Gangaw-Kalay Road 
section. 
  The Myittha Bridge will be a prestressed concrete bridge and 
will be 680 feet long and 14 to 17 feet wide. On completion of 
the bridge people will be able to travel directly from Gangaw to 
Kalay. Goods produced in the region could be transported 
easily and the people in Chin state and those in the 
Gangaw-Kalay basin will be able to travel about most 
conveniently and this will bring about rapid development in the 
region. 
  The Irrigation Department is making field surveys to find 
good prospects for implementing dam construction projects and 
building new dams in order to realize the objectives of the 
State to produce more crops, to bring about regional development 
and greening of nine dry zones in central parts of Myanmar. 
  Out of these projects, eight dam construction projects in 
Mandalay Division, two projects in Mayaway Division, one project 
in Ayeyarwady Division and one project in Bago Division are 
being implemented. 
  The Mone Chaung Dam Project in Mandalay Division is being 
built across Mone Chaung near Kangyi village in Takkon Township. 
The dam is 60 feet high and 7,000 feet long is a earth-filled 
dam. It will be able to irrigate 5,600 acres of cropland on 
completion. 
  The Taungtha Dam Project will be implemented near Nabeikan 
village on the eastern sector of Taungtha Township. It will be 
50 feet high and 2,400 feet long. It will be able to irrigate 
2,000 acres of land for carrying of double and mixed cropping. 
It will also assist in supplying water to Taungtha. 
  The Wei-hlaung Dam Project is situated near Wei-hlaung 
village in Taungtha Township. It will be 60 feet high and 3,200 
feet long and will be an earth-filled dam. It will be able to 
irrigate about 5,600 acres of land. 
  The Myaukpinle Dam project is being built on Myaukpinle 
Chaung near San village in Myingyan Township. It is 70 feet 
high and 1,000 feet long is an earth-filled type. On completion 
it will be able to irrigate 2,000 acres of cropland. 
  The Pinchaung Dam is situated near Monegan village in 
Kyaukpadaung Township. On completion it will be able to irrigate 
about 10,000 acres and will assist in creating huge forests and 
greening the region. 
  The Sinthaychaung Dam will be built over the Sinthaychaung 
near Myaukmyaik village in Tatkon Township. It will be an 
earth-filled dam and will be able to irrigate 2,400 acres of 
paddy. 
  The Daungthay Diversion Dam project is being implemented in 
Yenangyoung Township in Magway Divsion and is situated on 
Daungthay Creek and its tributary. It will be able to irrigate 
over 2,700 acres of land. 
  The Yaychaung Dam Project is being implemented on Yaw Creek 
near Panzin village in Pauk Township in Pakokku District. It is 
100 feet high and 3,700 feet long and is an earth-filled dam. 
On completion it will be able to produce 6.5 million kilo-watt 
hours of electric power and the surplus water will be used for 
irrigating cropland. 
  The Thamekku Dam Project is near Thamekku village in 
Weilaung 
village-tract in Taungtha Township. It is 75 feet high and 
5,000 feet long and will be able to irrigate about 3,000 acres 
of paddy.

<F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman in Kampot on 4 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. On 3 April, there was a sarcastic report hinting 
that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had 
abducted an American woman and three Cambodians in Kampot 
Province and was holding them for ransom. 
  The NADK has nothing to do with this matter and vehemently 
rejects this accusation, which stems from bad political aims. 
  The NADK is an army that loves the nation and the people and 
has righteous ethics and moral principles. It is very different 
from the communist Vietnamese and imperialist aggressors and 
their puppets, who are bellicose and violate the human rights 
and right to self-determination of every nation and people. 
They have massacred and are continuing to massacre untold 
numbers of Cambodians without fearing anything. They are 
wicked, atrocious, and cruel brutes who live on the people's 
flesh and blood like Satan. 
  There is no reason for the NADK to kidnap anyone for ransom. 
They should look for the culprit among their own people instead. 
  2. Why do they keep accusing the NADK of doing this and 
that? It is a part of their psychological propaganda war aimed 
at disgracing the NADK, which enjoys the support of all 
Cambodian people. The people regard it as a national force that 
has dared to rise up and fight the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors for the past 14-15 years and to wage all forms of 
struggle against the Vietnamese alliance and the evil Western 
powers. We have thus trapped them in an impasse and are pushing 
the communist Vietnamese, their alliance, and their puppet 
two-headed government toward a comprehensive defeat. 
  3. The NADK is launching activities everywhere in Cambodia, 
together with the local people, to thwart and smash the evil and 
barbarous campaigns continuously launched by the forces of the 
communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government, 
which have persistently continued to fuel the flames of war in 
line with their masters' strategies and orders. All of this is 
to defend the Cambodian nation and people. There is no reason 
for the NADK to kidnap anyone for ransom. The NADK is not like 
the communist Vietnamese, the imperialists, and their lackeys 
who have killed nations and people across the world merely to 
scramble for money and benefit. 
  [Signed] The NADK spokesman 
  [Dated] 4 April 1994

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Pu Sothirak, minister of 
industry, energy, and mines received a delegation from China's 
Guangdong Province led by Deputy Governor Liu Weiming at his 
office on the morning of 2 April. The excellency said his 
ministry plans to cooperate closely with the PRC, especially 
with Guangdong, which is a well-developed province. This is 
because the ministry has a number factories donated by the 
Chinese Government that has now become dilapidated and 
inoperative and needs urgent investment. 
  Liu Weiming disclosed that he intends to build a power plant 
in Sihanoukville and factories to produce furniture and process 
sugar to meet the people's need and for export. He added that 
he also wants to help build bridges and import construction 
materials to Cambodia.

<F P=106> ["Declaration" by the spokesman of the party of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea (DK) dated 4 April; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] 1. The meaning and substance of Vo Van Kiet's visit 
to Phnom Penh can be seen as a dog with its tail amputated. 
Honey words were used to affirm Vietnam's respect for 
Cambodia's sovereignty and to describe the traditional bonds of 
friendship between Vietnam and Cambodia, which have coexisted 
since time immemorial. Many sweet words were also exchanged 
here and there to express greetings. Moreover, a joint 
Vietnamese-Cambodian communique was signed to set up technical 
groups to discuss the border problem and the problem of ethnic 
Vietnamese in Cambodia, with particular emphasis on the presence 
of 50,000 Vietnamese nationals at the Cambodian-Vietnamese 
border. 
  2. What is the small and the large significance of the 
above-mentioned substance? 
  In the smaller sense, it showed that Vo Van Kiet tried to 
woo 
the two-headed government and some segments of international 
opinion that do not clearly understand the Cambodia dilemma. He 
did that with honey words, but deep down he tried to bury and 
conceal problems vital to the survival of the Cambodian nation 
and race. 
  The substance and meaning of this visit could also be very 
profound. Cambodia is currently halfway toward becoming the 
second Kampuchea Kraom [Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
We are in possession of many critical pieces of evidence 
similar to Kampuchea Kraom: 
  a. The Vietnamese war of aggression against Cambodia is 
continuing. 
  b. UNTAC [United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia] 
did not control the aggressor Vietnamese forces in Cambodia. 
Consequently, Vietnam could ship Vietnamese nationals and 
Vietnamese troops into Cambodia at will. 
  c. The communist Vietnamese puppet authorities installed by 
communist Vietnam in 1979 remain totally intact and completely 
unchanged. This means that 99 percent of the authorities in 
Phnom Penh remain in place, as do 100 percent of them in the 
countryside. 
  d. Not a single word has been said about the treaties and 
agreements signed between the Vietnamese and their puppets 
between 1979 and 1991, before the Paris peace accord. These 
treaties and agreements chopped off tens of thousands of square 
kilometers of Cambodian territory. 
  e. There are now nearly 4 million ethnic Vietnamese in 
Cambodia, with more coming in. This is half of Cambodia's 
entire population. Such a phenomenon is unprecedented in the 
world. The communist Vietnamese are swallowing up Cambodia with 
impunity and no one has mentioned it. 
  f. The Vietnamese can cross the land border, territorial 
waters, and sea border back and forth freely through Ratanakiri, 
Mondolkiri, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, Kandal, 
Takeo, Kampot, and the sea. They have come in by land, via the 
rivers, by sea, and so on. A portion of the Vietnamese have 
come to live permanently in Cambodia, while others come in and 
out daily to fell Cambodian logs, catch Cambodian fish and 
shrimp, and dismantle and take away Cambodian houses, behaving 
just as if they were in Vietnam itself. 
  This is the profound significance of the problem. It 
concerns the survival of the Cambodian nation and race. 
Cambodia is halfway toward becoming another Kampuchea Kraom. 
  3. Through the above-mentioned substance of Vo Van Kiet's 
visit to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian nation and people clearly see 
that, on the one hand, it was an attempt to woo with honey 
words, and on the other hand, it directly concerned the very 
survival of the Cambodian nation and race. Therefore, the 
Cambodian nation and people believe that these issues must be 
solved. If the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese wish to coexist 
peacefully with the Cambodian people and consider each other 
good neighbors, the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese must clearly 
settle all the above-mentioned issues. Moreover, all of these 
issues concern not only the survival of the Cambodian nation and 
race but also the stability of the region as a whole. If 
Cambodia is halfway toward becoming the second Kampuchea Kraom, 
or if it already is another Kampuchea Kraom, and if the war 
continues as it is, the countries in the region surely cannot 
accept it. 
  If Cambodia and the Cambodian people oppose it, the 
countries 
and peoples in the region will also oppose it.

<F P=106> ["Communique of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) </F>
Spokesman Denouncing the Continued implementation by the Hanoi 
Communist Vietnamese of the Indochinese Federation Strategy to 
Occupy Cambodia Under the Label of their Criminal Military 
Cooperation Between Vietnam and Cambodia;" dated 1 April -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] I. On 30 march 1994, the communist Vietnamese 
summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat to Hanoi to receive 
orders for the puppets and lackeys and the two-headed government 
to allow communist Vietnamese and all kinds of weapons, 
particularly tanks, armored vehicles, multiple rockets 
batteries, and artillery pieces to flow into Cambodia. This is 
for continued offensives against the people and the Cambodian 
national resistance forces through the strategic policy of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam and the alliance and to continue 
fueling the war against peace, national reconciliation, and the 
king. 
  It is still remembered that in early March, the communist 
Vietnamese already summoned puppet Chea Sim to Hanoi. At that 
time puppet Chea Sim was ordered to use his titles of so-called 
acting head of state and assembly chairman to sign documents 
legitimizing Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia. This 
is done through, first, a demographic war by opening up 
Cambodia's eastern border to more Vietnamese nationals; second, 
through the annexation of large chunks of Cambodia's land and 
maritime borders; and third, through a military war by allowing 
the communist Vietnamese to bring various weapons into Cambodia 
under the label of military cooperation with Cambodia to join 
the mischievous alliance and continue to fuel the war. This is 
done to enable the comnmunist Vietnamese to continue annexing 
and exterminating the Cambodian race through the Indochinese 
federation strategy, which Vietnam calls special friendship 
among the three brother countries like teeth and tongue of the 
late Ho Chi Minh. 
  Now the Vietnamese have summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea 
Chamrat, who are the so-called co-ministers of national defense 
of the two-headed government, to Hanoi to concretely implement 
what they have ordered puppet Chea Sim to sign. 
  II. The communist Vietnamese, their puppets and lackeys, the 
alliance, and the two-headed government are panicking, now that 
their invading forces are being disgracefully attacked, 
defeated, and inflicted serious damage in terms of troops, 
command posts, and weapons on the Anlung Veng battlefield. They 
are being pushed toward more serious defeats on the Pailin 
battlefield. 
  This is why their puppets, the communist Vietnamese, and the 
mischievous alliance are running about frantically and are 
carrying out all kinds of military, political, economic, and 
diplomatic, and psychological propaganda activities to get out 
of their successive setbacks against the fighting and opposition 
by the Cambodian nation and people and the Democratic Kampuchean 
national resistance forces. They are trying to extricate 
themselves so that they can continue to fuel the war with one 
hand pushing puppet Cambodians to attack nationalist Cambodians, 
and the other allowing Vietnamese nationals up to four, five, 
six millions and more to flow into Cambodia at will. 
  One day after another, the entire Cambodian nation and 
people 
in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad more clearly 
realize the face of the Vietnamese and their allies as the ones 
who oppose peace, national reconciliation, and Cambodia's 
independence. They have been trying to hide all this under the 
elections organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia] and the two-headed government. 
  In this situation the PDK appeals to the entire Cambodian 
nation and people to continue carrying out all kinds of 
activities everywhere and through every means to oppose the 
communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys, the alliance 
and its puppets, to prevent the communist Vietnamese from 
achieving their Indochinese federation strategy through any form 
to annex and exterminate our Cambodian race. 
  Furthermore, the PDK appeals to peace-and justice-loving 
countries and people the world over to take concrete measures in 
every form to prevent the communist Vietnamese and their allies 
from fueling the war of aggression in Cambodia to kill people 
and the resistance forces. This not only destroys Cambodia's 
sovereignty and independence and exterminates the Cambodian 
race, a nation and a country that is a member of the United 
Nations, it also threatens the security and stability in the 
entire Southeast Asian and Pacific region now and in the future.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 5 (AFP) -- Thailand helped Pol 
Pot, the leader of the notorious Khmer Rouge, to flee a recent 
government offensive on the radical faction's resource rich 
headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, co-premier Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh said Tuesday. 
  "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to 
prove (it)," the prince told reporters during a break in the 
second session of parliament. 
  "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being 
attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks 
driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," the prince said. 
  The prince was adamant that the shadowy guerrilla leader -- 
who was responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to 1979 reign of 
terror during which some one million Cambodians died of illness, 
starvation or execution -- escaped through Thai territory. 
  "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such 
good 
smooth roads in that region," he said. 
  He did not specify how the photos were obtained. 
  Government forces seized the rebel headquarters and the 
surrounding resource rich region March 19. 
  The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organisation by 
selling logging and mining concessions to primarily Thai 
business consortiums, many of which are believed to be 
controlled by or have links with the Thai military.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 4 Apr (AKP) -- According to an assessment 
by Takeo Province's Agricultural Service, the province -- which 
is located 80 km south of Phnom Penh -- will need a supplement 
of 7,675 additional tonnes of white rice in 1994 to meet the 
demands of the population (666,905). 
  The rice shortage is due on the one hand to a demographic 
increase of 60,000 in 1993, and on the other hand to natural 
calamities that destroyed more than 6,710 of the 174,240 
hectares [ha] of crops planted during the previous monsoon. As 
for dry season crops, the province has transplanted some 39,240 
ha of short-term rice. About 20 percent of this rice had been 
harvested by the end of March, with an average yield of two 
tonnes per hectare. According to estimates by the same service, 
total rice production for both seasons will not exceed 293,575 
tonnes.

Pacific, the prince thanked this humanitarian organization for 
its food aid to Cambodia.

the international organizations operating in Cambodia and the 
various ministries. 
  In his reply, Jens Schulthes thanked the Cambodian 
Government 
for creating conditions favorable to the WFP mission in 
Cambodia. He also announced a new aid project for Cambodia. He

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 5 (ANTARA) -- Visiting Dutch Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers said that relations between Indonesia and 
the Netherlands, almost two years after a dispute leading to the 
break up of the Inter Governmental Group for Indonesian (IGGI), 
were now very mature. 
  "The relations are even better than in the past. It is 
really an advantage for we have now a mature relations in the 
economic field as well as in the political field," he told 
ANTARA in a special interview here on Tuesday. 
  The prime minister, who had just had a tete-a-tete with 
President Suharto, said that such a development had resulted in 
the increase of investment and trade volume between both 
countries. 
  Stating that the Netherlands is in the forefront of free 
trade and is now increasing international trade ties, he said 
that there is an excellent possibilities of Indonesia and his 
country to go on further in that part. 
  Indonesia and the Netherlands went through a disruption in 
their ties following Indonesia's decision to stop accepting all 
aid originating from the Netherlands to protest the interference 
of the Hague in Jakarta's domestic matters in 1992. 
  The cut of the Dutch aid also signalled the end of the 
Dutch-led IGGI international aid consortium. 
  IGGI was then replaced by the Paris based Consultative Group 
on Indonesia (CGI). 
  Some analysts believe that Prime Minister Lubber's visit to 
Indonesia marks a significant improvement in the 
Netherlands-Indonesia ties since 1992. 
  On the occasion, Lubbers also underlined that the two 
countries have given more emphasis on business aspects, saying 
that the Netherlands always take a close watch on Indonesia's 
rapid development. 
  "Your country is now in the start of the take-off era 
situation. In response to the situation, we will be very happy 
to participate in such a development," he added. 
  When addressing an Indonesia-Netherlands Association (INA) 
lunch on the same day, the prime minister said that Jakarta and 
the Hague hold regular economic consultations at a bilateral 
level as well as in multilateral fora. 
  He said that differences of opinion, when they occur, are 
discussed openly, frankly, and with determination on both sides 
to ultimately arrive at a solution that takes into account the 
mutual benefit of both, as partners and old friends should. 
  He said that trade relation between the two countries are 
expanding and have been, for some time now, to Indonesia's 
advantage. 
  In 1992, the Netherlands imported approximately 1,260 
million 
Dutch guilders worth of Indonesian goods, while export to 
Indonesia amounted to 730 million Dutch guilders. 
  In the first quarter of 1993, exports from the Netherlands 
to 
Indonesia rose by 31 percent, as compared with the same period 
the year before, while imports from Indonesia increased by 28 
percent. 
  In 1993, over 100,000 Dutch tourists visited Indonesia, an 
increase by more than 50 percent compared with that of in 1988. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers arrived in Jakarta on Monday for a 
four- day visit.

  [Text] President Suharto received a courtesy call from Kim 
Chang-kyu, deputy foreign minister of North Korea at Bina Graha 
Presidential Office in Jakarta this morning. Kim Chang-kyu was 
accompanied by Nana Sutresna, chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement's [NAM] Steering Committee. 
  Following the meeting, Nana Suresna told newsmen that the 
North Korean deputy foreign minister said his country is ready 
to implement the agreement reached with the United States to 
allow IAEA inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Nana Sutresna also quoted President Suharto as saying that 
Indonesia, being the NAM chairman, feels responsible in seeing 
that several accords reached at the 10th NAM summit in Jakarta 
1992 are implemented. 
  According to President Suharto, Indonesia feels that it is a 
good opportunity for developing countries to foster cordial 
relations and cooperation, especially economically, for the 
development of individual countries following the end of the 
Cold War. Indonesia's initiative taken in its capacity as the 
NAM chairman is aimed at creating stability in NAM member 
countries so that they are capable of carrying out national 
development. 
  Nana Sutrena said Indonesia is focusing its attention on 
efforts to solve the North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  [Begin Sutresna recording] President Suharto has reiterated 
that Indonesia, being the NAM chairman, has absolutely no 
intention of intefering in North Korea's domestic affairs, that 
is in connection with the nuclear issue. But, Indonesia is very 
concerned over the development of this issue. It is hoped that 
the issue will be immediately solved through a general consensus 
so that stability in the Korean peninsula, as well as in 
countries around the area, can be achieved. On the occasion, 
President Suharto was conveyed an invitation from North Korean 
President Kim Il-song to visit Pyongyang. President Suharto 
said that he had always wished to visit Pyongyang but has not 
been able to do so due to his busy schedule in Jakarta. He said 
he will try to find an appropriate time to visit North Korea 
after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, meeting in 
Jakarta. [end recording] 
  After handing President Kim Il-song's personal letter to 
President Suharto, Kim Chang-kyu, who is also the special envoy 
of the North Korean president, briefed newsmen on the various 
developments in the Korean peninsula.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- The Indonesian Government 
plans to reduce and put a brake on its growing foreign debt in 
view of the 15 percent appreciation of the Japanese yen against 
the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. 
  Speaking to reporters at his office on 21 March, Saleh 
Affif, 
coordinating minister for economics, finance, and develoment 
supervision, said Indonesia's foreign debt now stand at U.S. $90 
billion, 40 percent of which belong to the private sector, 20 
percent of which are short-term debt of less than one year, and 
the remaining 40 percent which are government debt. He added 
that 40 percent of the U.S. $90 billion debt are in Japanese 
yen. "We must be careful because the 15-percent appreciation of 
the yen in the last 12 months has increased our foreign debt by 
U.S. $3billion. This is quite a large amount," he said. 
  Therefore, the government is now making efforts to reduce 
the 
amount of new commercial loans, 25-year long-term soft loans 
from the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), as well as 
10-year long-term export loans, which has an interest of six to 
seven percent. 
  To reduce the amount of overseas debt, several steps have 
been taken, including the placing of restrictions on commercial 
loans by the Overseas Commercial Loans Coordinating Team. 
Meanwhile, the National Development Planning Agency will be in 
charge of monitoring export loans. "What is difficult is how to 
prevent the private sector from taking on new commercial loans," 
the minister said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Working Meeting Between Foreign Affairs </F>
Department and Heads of Foreign Missions"] 
  [Text] President Suharto opened a working meeting attended 
by senior officials of the Foreign Affairs Department and 103 
heads of Indonesian missions abroad on Monday 21 March. The 
meeting, which was also attended by Consul Generals and Consuls 
designate, ended on 26 March. We feel that the working meeting 
is an important event because it was held at the time when the 
Indonesian people and nation are about to enter into the Sixth 
Five-Year Development Plan, which marks the beginning of the 
Second 25-Year Long Term Development Master Plan (PJP II) 
effective 1 April 1994. The event is also relevant to our 
national development and the fast-changing global political map 
now or in the future. 
  Over the past several weeks, Indonesia's political policy 
had 
been viewed and criticized by several local observers of 
international politics. They consider Indonesia's international 
relations to be rather passive in determining an approriate 
course of action to keep pace with the fast-changing global 
political climate, which is becoming more complex. 
  The current trend of international relations has expanded to 
include various concerns and activities that cover all divisions 
in the Foreign Department and which can transform it into an 
executive branch. The time has come for the Indonesia's Foreign 
Department and its diplomatic representatives abroad to change 
their image to suit new global needs and changes that give 
priority to economic interests [preceding two words in English] 
and all issues related to it. 
  As a consequence of this meeting, our diplomats abroad will 
now realize that they have to be knowledgeable in national 
politics and be a "spokesmen" on issues relating to the economy, 
development, trade, privatization, capital investment, and other 
matters to tactfully "sell" Indonesia to countries they are 
accredited to. 
  Indonesian diplomats should be able to act as traders who 
can 
"sell" Indonesian products abroad and act as guides who can show 
their way around Indonesia to boost tourism and promote 
investment, or they can act as "shields" to smash negative 
reports on Indonesia. 
  In line with the current level of national development, the 
government's effort to eradicate poverty, and improvement to the 
people's welfare, our diplomats abroad are no longer required to 
merely attend formal functions and receptions for diplomats. 
  It has been mandated in the 1993 Broad Outline of State 
Policies that the ability to anticipate and comply with the 
unpredictable changes of a new world order should be stepped up 
through an appropriate diplomatic approach for the sake of 
national interest. 
  We hope that the meeting between senior officials of the 
Foreign Department and the heads of Indonesian missions abroad 
will not be a routine session or just an activity held once 
every five years. It should be a meeting that will really bring 
about plans in anticipation of current and future global 
changes. We also hope that the meeting would adopt relevant and 
practical decisions to cater to national development in the wake 
of the take-off period for the implementation of the PJP II. 
  In his keynote address at a similar meeting several years 
ago, President Suharto called on all Indonesian envoys to carry 
out the nation's "diplomatic struggle" when executing their 
duties abroad. In this context, the term " diplomatic struggle" 
has a wide-ranging interpretation. It is aimed at protecting 
national interest, as well finding ways to create a new world 
order based on sovereignty, peace, and justice. 
  In view of this, Indonesia's efforts to achieve the goal 
would make its position as the current chairman of the 
Nonaligned Movement, NAM, more significant. The NAM 
chairmanship is not merely an honorary post or a symbol of 
confidence given to Indonesia. It is more a challenge that 
requires strong backing, especially from the NAM-member 
countries. 
  Thus, the Republic of Indonesia is not isolated. It is 
supported by hundreds of countries that need to benefit from the 
"diplomatic struggle" carried out by its diplomats wherever they 
are accredited to.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 4 (KPL) -- Lao Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri on 
April 2 morning signed at Lan Xang Hotel in Vientiane an 
agreement concerning the friendship bridge across the Mekong 
River, scheduled to be officially opened on April 8. 
  The agreement deals with preparation for the official 
opening 
of the bridge in the presence of Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] Pesident Nouhak Phoumsavan and his majesty 
the king of Thailand. On the occasion, Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating will present the bridge, gift from the 
Australian government and people to the people of Laos and 
Thailand, to Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon and Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai. 
  The agreement represents a legal framework for Lao-Thai 
cooperation in all aspects concerning the management and 
maintenance of the bridge, including the ownership and 
cooperation in dealing with matters that may arise over the 
bridge. 
  This document also stipulates the following terms on the 
operation and maintenance of the bridge. 
  1. The two sides are jointly responsible for the management 
and maintenance of the bridge by equally sharing the cost of its 
management and maintenance. 
  2. A joint commission will be set up to determine and review 
procedures on the management and maintenance of the bridge to be 
carried out by a brigade with its routines according to the 
agreed procedures. 
  3. The sides have agreed that fees for cars passing the 
bridge will be charged only at one time at an equivalent rate as 
vehicles enter the bridge on either Lao or Thai sides, except 
for cargo trucks with drivers which will be charged for the 
passage on both sides. 
  4. The sides have agreed that each will try to simplify its 
transit formalities, making it convenient and fast to ensure the 
effective operation of the bridge. 
  Concerning the ownership over the bridge, the sides have 
agreed to divide it equally. This agreement will have no effect 
on the common border of the two countries as provided in the 
international law. On their cooperation on the bridge operation, 
the sides have agreed that each side sets up a permanent 
committee to monitor, coordinate, consult and discuss with each 
other concerning the operation of the bridge and matters that 
may arise over the area between the transition pier on both 
sides, including arrests of wrongdoers on the said area on a 
case-by-case basis. Solutions to the matters will be considered 
according to the law of each side, and measures against the 
wrongdoers will be taken as mandatory.

  [Text] Governor Masahide Ota's regular unofficial meeting 
with reporters at 1100 [0200 GMT] on 4 April suddenly became an 
emergency news conference on the crash of the U.S. Forces' F-15 
fighter. The incident has seriously shocked the prefectural 
government, and Ota has issued direct instructions to his Base 
Affairs Office to confirm the details of the accident. 
  Prefectural Policy Coordinator Choko Takayama, and Tatsuo 
Matayoshi, director of the Governor's Office, are now busy 
arranging the lodging of a protest with the U.S. Forces Okinawa 
area coordinator, and Kadena Air Base commander. They are also 
demanding an investigation into the cause of the crash. 
  The accident happened during Ota's preparations for the 
visit 
to Okinawa of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on 10 
April. He is now working on how to petition Mondale for 
solutions to the prefecture's base issues. 
  Ota said at the news conference: "It is extremely 
unfortunate and regrettable. Time and again, we have asked U.S. 
Forces and the U.S. Consulate General to take measures to 
prevent accidents. Each time, we are told that they are looking 
into the causes. Does this mean that as long as there are 
military bases in Okinawa, there will be no way to prevent 
accidents? We will exert even greater efforts in asking for the 
return of the bases." He reemphasized his position that the 
return of the military bases forms a major pillar of the 
prefecture's administrative policy. 
  The latest accident demonstrated once again that Kadena Air 
Base is inherently dangerous. Ota is scheduled to visit the 
United States in late May to discuss base issues. During this 
visit he will probably demand in strong terms that the U.S. 
Government take firm measures to "prevent any more accidents." 
  At present, takeoff and landing exercises at Kadena are 
conducted over civilian residential areas every day. The crash 
site of the F-15 fighter on 4 April was within the vicinity of 
the Kadena Arms Depot. One slip could have led to a major 
explosion, and brought about a disaster. 
  The F-15 fighter crash occurred with Kadena Air Base still 
unable to publish the findings of its investigation into the 
helicopter crash in September 1993. For this, the prefectural 
government is greatly dissatisfied with U.S. Forces.

  [Text] Mae Sot -- Ethnic Karen guerrillas will hold peace 
talks today with Burmese junta representatives at a Burmese town 
about 48 miles from Mae Sot in Thailand's border province of Tak. 
  The Karen National Union (KNU), the strongest ethnic group 
which has been fighting the ruling Burmese for more than four 
decades for greater autonomy, had earlier refused to enter 
negotiations with Rangoon unless the venue was outside Burma. 
It had also demanded that the talks be held in the presence of 
UN representatives and the media. 
  Informed border sources said the talks will take place at 
Myabadai village, which is located between Kyaido and Nabu 
district, and that powerful junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt will 
also participate, in addition to senior local Burmese Army 
commanders. 
  The Burmese junta or the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (Slorc) had earlier proposed Pa-an, the Karen capital, 
as the negotiating site. But the proposal was turned down by 
the Karen for security reasons, citing previous experience when 
Karen negotiating delegates were hunted down by Burmese troops 
after the failure of peace talks. 
  The sources said the Karen eventually agreed to meet inside 
the country at Myabadai because the village used to be under the 
control of the Karen and the KNU could easily provide security 
for its delegation from bases along the border. However, both 
sides agreed that they will not be accompanied by troops and 
that all delegates will be unarmed. The Karen were not 
available for comment as of the press time. 
  The sources said preparations have been going on for the 
past 
few days and that Burmese forces in Kawkareik, about 15 miles to 
the north of Myabadai village, recently went to Myawadi, which 
is opposite Mae Sot, to buy food and other provisions. Two GMC 
trucks were filled with the purchases, they said. 
  The meeting, the first since a new group of military 
officers 
under the banner of Slorc seized power in September 1988, is a 
preliminary forum aimed at building mutual confidence and paving 
way for future ceasefire negotiations, according to the sources.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 3 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas abducted an American woman with the Christian relief 
organization Food for the Hungry International (FHI) last week 
and have held her hostage for four days while demanding that the 
aid group digs them wells, the FHI director here said Sunday. 
  Melissa Himes, 25, from California, was abducted with eight 
Cambodian colleagues Thursday in southern Kampot province when 
they went to try to retrieve their truck that had been stolen at 
gunpoint from a work site near the Khmer Rouge zone, FHI country 
director Alan Haslett said. 
  Five Cambodians were let go on Friday with the demand that 
FHI agree to dig wells in their zone, he said. Himes and three 
colleagues remained captive through the weekend, he said. 
  "They have not asked for any money. I think they want wells 
put in specific villages," Haslett said. "They are holding our 
truck as well." 
  The released Cambodians said they had been well-treated but 
that they "had to pay for their dinner" with their captors, he 
said. 
  FHI had sent a message agreeing to discuss ways to meet the 
demand, but had not heard back yet from the Khmer Rouge, Haslett 
said. 
  "We're a Christian organization and we're here to help 
everyone" including people living under Khmer Rouge control, 
Haslett said. "We would like to find ways to help them 
(Cambodians) equally." 
  Himes has lived in Cambodia since January 1993, speaks the 
Khmer language well and has a good relationship with Cambodians 
living in the area, Haslett said. 
  Kampot, bordering the sea 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of 
Phnom Penh, is traversed by a mountain range harboring the Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas at the very end of the organization's supply 
lines. Guerrilla sorties to steal food in government-controlled 
valleys are common, and villagers are sometimes taken hostage in 
exchange for rice or cows. 
  The Khmer Rouge stole a number of UN cars during the United 
Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, which ended in late 
1993, and several UN peacekeepers were held hostage during the 
incidents. All were treated relatively well and later set free 
after negotiations. 
  The Food for the Hungry International (FHI) project in 
Kampot 
focuses on improving rural water supplies and on agricultural 
development. FHI is a Christian organization headquartered in 
Geneva and operates in 16 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America.

<F P=106> [Patrick Sabatier report: "Paris-Tokyo, the Price of a </F>
Difficult Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- A few minutes before his meeting with 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Alain Juppe was not entirely 
sure that it would take place. The Japanese diplomats assembled 
in the antechamber of the government chief's residence were 
anxiously following the debate under way in the Diet 
(Parliament), where the opposition was blocking the vote on a 
budget without which the government could not have functioned. 
Meetings were shortened or canceled for the same reason. 
  It is therefore a conflicting assessment which the foreign 
minister drew from the visit he made to Tokyo from 31 March to 2 
April. On the one hand, he had "the impression of a real desire 
by Japan to do something with France." On the other, he was 
able to assess the limits and difficulties of a "political 
dialogue" which his visit ("the first bilateral visit for seven 
years," he pointed out) was aimed at reopening after a period of 
relative "negligence" following the tensions created in 1991 by 
Edith Cresson's remarks about Japanese "ants." 
  The problems of the heterogeneous coalition which Mr. 
Hosokawa heads and the realities of a severe economic recession 
mean that Japan is still more focused on its internal problems 
than usual. Alain Juppe was also able to observe that Japan's 
foreign policy is limited almost entirely to relations with the 
United States. "Sixty-five percent of our diplomacy is concerned 
with Washington, 25 percent with our Asian neighbors, and 10 
percent with the rest of the world, of which 5 percent is with 
Europe in general. In that, France does not account for more 
than 2 percent," a Japanese diplomat said, despite being a lover 
of France. 
  Juppe twice heard Hosokawa stress the "special relationship" 
which links Tokyo and Washington. The Japanese certainly 
expected French support against the threats of American economic 
sanctions. Juppe criticized "unilateralism" while "hammering 
home" to his interlocutors that the Europeans would not smile on 
Japanese-American agreements giving preference to American 
interests alone. But, outside these tactics of the big 
three-sided game of international trade, can there be a real 
"political dialogue" between Paris and Tokyo when France has its 
highest trade deficit with this country (23 billion francs in 
1993) and when it continues to revolve around America? 
  "We are forced to have a dialogue with Tokyo," the Quai 
d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] replied. First, because Japan has 
become an economic and financial power (the second in the world) 
which is strictly speaking impossible to ignore. For instance, 
Alain Juppe approached his hosts asking them to participate in 
support for the policy of devaluing the CFA franc in Africa, and 
helping to try to save Algeria (of which they are the second 
biggest creditor). And the most practical plans discussed 
related to cooperation for development in Africa and Indochina. 
In addition, Juppe said, "a country which has this economic 
power will not remain a political dwarf." The Japanese are also 
more present, not only in Asia but on theaters as diverse as 
Africa, Latin America, and the Near East, and in the 
international bodies. Tokyo is lobbying for a seat as a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council and Paris is in 
favor of that. 
  "This is no longer 1945," Alain Juppe pointed out. "The 
world has changed..." However, it is necessary to find a way of 
expanding the Council without reducing its efficacy and without 
offending other candidates for a seat (India, Egypt, or Brazil). 
Above all, Japan would have to be prepared to meet the 
obligations of this status, starting with the dispatch of troops 
to take part in peacekeeping operations. However, it, like 
Germany, has not solved the constitutional and political 
problems which hamper it. The complexity of the question means 
that the French minister finds it "difficult to see how things 
could be decided in 1995" (on the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations). 
  The menacing question of North Korea's nuclear ambitions is 
more urgent. Japan preaches caution and moderation whereas 
France advocates a firm stance. "Our main concern is 
proliferation," Alain Juppe explained. France is campaigning 
for a definitive renewal of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 
1995. The Japanese position is more ambiguous. They sometimes 
link the question of the NPT and North Korea with that of the 
ending of nuclear tests. This is an embarrassing link for 
France which intends "to reserve the right to conduct a series 
of additional tests," deemed vital to the modernization of the 
deterrent force. 
  The French even go so far as to suspect the Japanese of not 
being very enthusiastic about ratifying an NPT which would 
prevent them from equipping themselves with nuclear weapons if 
necessary. It may be here that the French desire for "dialogue" 
finds its most convincing justification. In the long term, one 
diplomat explained in fact, if Japan becomes a big power "like 
the others," it is preferable to "bind the giant in every 
possible way by urging it to participate in a responsible way in 
the international community," to "channel the desire for power 
in the right direction," as Juppe puts it. 
  The latter left Tokyo for a visit to India (2 through 5 
April) then China (where he will join Edouard Balladur on 6 
April) at a time when the cherry trees were producing their 
first blossoms. Is this a promise of a new Franco-Japanese 
spring? Mr. Hosokawa should be in Paris in early May, followed 
by Emperor Akihito in the fall. But the Franco-Japanese hopes 
and good intentions have hitherto been forgotten as regularly as 
the blossoms falling from the cherry trees....

  [Text] Thailand and the United States have agreed to extend 
the bilateral agreement on textile and garment quotas with an 
appreciating quota base for exporters. 
  Thailand's negotiating team, led by the director-general of 
the Foreign Trade Department, Oranut Osathanon, held a third 
round of talks last Wednesday [30 March] and Thursday. 
  Both sides signed an exchange of notes on Friday. The 
agreement will be back-dated to January 1 to extend the 
agreement that expired last year. 
  A source in the Thai Garment Manufacturing Association 
(TGMA) 
said there is still confusion over the agreement because TGMA 
president Wirot Amatakunchai, who joined the private sector 
delegation is still abroad. 
  The Government delegation said the only two people who can 
give this information are Ms Oranut and Commerce Minister Uthai 
Phimchaichon but neither was available yesterday. 
  The source said the US agreed to increase the base of quotas 
for exports of garments from the current 202 million square 
metres to 220 million. 
  Quotas on clothes for babies aged below two years would be 
4.7 million kilogrammes or 29.6 million square metres. 
  So the total base quotas for garment exports will be 249.6 
million square metres. 
  He said the US agreed to an annual growth rate of quotas of 
6 
percent and increased the base quotas for Thai exports of cotton 
shorts and trousers by 24 percent from last year's 500,000 dozen 
to 622,000 dozen. However, the US wanted to add the control of 
wool jackets by setting the quota at 51,500 dozen, up 6,500 
dozen from Thai exports last year. 
  The source said the US allowed the swing of quotas from the 
unused category to other categories at 7 percent of the quotas, 
up from 3.5 percent in the last agreement, and permitted the 
special shift of quotas between woven shirts and cotton woven 
shirts by 10 percent. He said the private sector appreciated 
the new agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, because 
the amount of negotiated quotas is big enough to ensure the 
country's exports this year. 
  Meanwhile, there are still many points of information 
missing, such as the duration of the agreement -- whether it 
will be two or four years -- and details about punishment for 
transshipment or re-routing of products through third countries, 
known as "circumvention". This had earlier been a major problem 
in the extension of the agreement because the US wanted to slash 
quotas by three times if it discovered there was circumvention.

<F P=106> [From the "On the Level" column by Alex Magno: "Time for </F>
Fateful Decisions"] 
  [Text] Today, the New People's Army (NPA) celebrates its 
25th anniversary. In the past, this guerrilla army mounted 
numerous offensives to mark the day of its birth and demonstrate 
its capacity for war. Today, this is a tired army, plagued by 
confusion and confronting an "enemy" that has firmly established 
an ascendant moral position. 
  Few, if any, offensives will probably be mounted today. 
Logistical exhaustion dictates that. More, the guerrillas 
confront a nearly insurmountable moral wall: Government forces 
have declared a long unilateral cease fire to mark the Holy 
Week. The soldiers would rather pray than fight. 
  Last Friday, President Ramos signed the two amnesty 
proclamations that were being closely studied for two years now. 
The amnesty program, that shall come into effect as soon as the 
proclamations are confirmed by Congress, will open the door for 
six months to all rebels desiring to return to the mainstream. 
Congressional confirmation is expected to be ministerial. 
  The amnesty program is expected to have most significant 
effects on the ranks of the NPA. The ideological crisis 
plaguing the communist movement has diminished the will to fight 
of many guerrillas. Sen. Blas Ople surmised that the amnesty 
program, when put into effect, would quickly decimate what 
remains of the guerrilla "army." 
  A few days earlier, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon went on record 
calling on the government to break off talks with the exiled 
Sison-Jalandoni faction of the CPP. That faction has not only 
become a minority in the movement they purport to lead. It has 
also proven most reluctant in engaging government peace 
initiatives. 
  It is not for government to initiate the break-off of talks, 
contrary to what Biazon suggests. The government enjoys the 
moral higher ground in the peace process. It does not have to 
squander that advantage. It is for the other side to carry out 
their earlier threats and disengage from talks that have not 
even begun. 
  The exiled Maoist fundamentalist group that claims formal 
leadership over the fragmented CPP [Communist Party of the 
Philippines]-NPA has been dodging and feigning for many months 
now. After government conceded on their demand to meet at Ho 
Chi Minh City, the Sison-Jalandoni faction demanded that 
"preliminary" talks be held in Europe before "exploratory" talks 
are conducted in Vietnam. 
  That particularly crude trick, coming after many prior 
bluffs, convinced the government that the Sison-Jalandoni group 
has no intention at all of participating in the peace effort. 
  Some time ago, the exiled fundamentalist group threatened to 
disengage from the peace process if amnesty is proclaimed. The 
amnesty proclamation has, apparently, been indicated as the 
signal to formally disengage. The mere mention of the word 
"amnesty" drives their most avid local cadres into a frenzy. 
  The choice of disengagement point is rather curious. Amnesty 
is always a unilateral act on the part of government -- never a 
negotiated outcome. It is, too, generally considered an act of 
magnanimity, compassion and humanity. How the CPP is going to 
turn the amnesty proclamation into a demonic incident, and 
indication of government's "insincerity" in its pursuit of 
peace, should be interesting to watch. 
  Lately, Jose Maria Sison has been warning the government not 
to allow bail for captured CPP leader and Sison rival, Arturo 
Tabara. The right to bail, if Sison must be reminded, is a basic 
democratic right. By putting petty party rivalries ahead of 
basic principles, Sison ends up arguing against the government 
assuring one of his own comrades due process. 
  It is likely that he will fall into another of his logical 
contortions arguing that amnesty is a hostile act. The rest of 
humanity considers amnesty a benevolent gesture. 
  It matters very little at this point if Sison and his 
loyalists withdraw from the peace process. The prospects for 
fruitful engagement have been nil from the start. The 
government, by waiting for so long, has won the higher moral 
ground. Sison has not only lost much of what is left of the 
Left, he has also lost credibility long ago. 
  If he takes this benevolent gesture as his excuse for 
disengagement, he scores no political points. If the prospects 
for talks with the CPP are completely closed down by that 
withdrawal, government loses no political points. That is the 
nature of the dilemma Sison and his loyalists must now deal with 
in the face of the amnesty proclamation. 
  For the men in the field, the simple men rebelling against 
real grievances, the amnesty proclamation occasions a fateful 
decision. They will have six months to decide if the course of 
"revolutionary" violence that earlier seemed just is worth 
continuing. 
  There is no debate here about the validity of the grievances 
that forced many Filipinos to take to the gun. But there is 
much debate about the wisdom of continuing the carnage. 
  The amnesty program requires, not an organizational 
decision, 
but an individual decision on the part of those who found 
themselves enmeshed in abnormal politics during times of great 
turbulence. They are offered a backdoor to normal life, freed 
from legal obligations that they frenzied politics might have 
caused. 
  As much as the amnesty program is a unilateral decision on 
the part of government, premised on the higher value of 
achieving peace at the soonest possible time, the decision to 
avail of the amnesty package will be an entirely personal one. 
What matters is that a point of exit is available. If none 
avails of it, then the act of magnanimity on the part of the 
government comes to naught. If the dwindling insurgencies 
evaporate as a consequence of this proclamation, then it will be 
the sum of personal decisions taken. 
  Very clearly, an amnesty program cannot be the outcome of 
negotiations between movements and the government. It requires 
fateful decisions at the personal, existential level.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by KBS </F>
anchorman Yi Yun-song--live] 
  [Text] [Yi Yun-song] There are increasing voices worrying 
about the disarray in the government in dealing with the North 
Korean nuclear issue. They worry because the departments and 
officials of the government are expressing different views. We 
requested an urgent interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
who returned home yesterday from his visits to China, the United 
States, the UN Headquarters, and Japan. 
  How are you, Mr. Minister? You were on the spot when the UN 
Security Council issued its presidential statement. How would 
you appraise it? 
  [Han Sung-chu] The UN Security Council's action came in the 
form of a presidential statement. It is more important how many 
countries supported it and how strong the wording of the 
statement is than the form itself, whether it is the 
presidential statement or a council resolution. The permanent 
member states, including China, and all the 10 nonpermanent 
member states supported the presidential statement. Therefore, 
the statement has considerable weight. With the participation 
of China in the efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, the 
success of the presidential statement is appreciable. 
  [Yi] The preconditions for the U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks were North Korea's acceding to the inspection and the 
inter-Korean exchange of special envoys. There are views 
expressed, from the government, particularly the Foreign 
Ministry, that the envoy exchange can be withdrawn from the 
preconditions. What really is happening to this issue? 
  [Han] The Foreign Ministry has never come up with that 
policy. There is no change in our government's position. Our 
position, as well as the U.S. position, remains unchanged that 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can only be held 
after the envoy exchange is made. 
  [Yi] North Korea rejected the UN Security Council's 
presidential statement as soon as it was issued. North Korea 
says that it cannot accede to the resumption of inspections. 
Furthermore, it claims that it should normalize its nuclear 
activities. What is the government measure to cope with this? 
  [Han] North Korea is very repulsed by the UN Security 
Council's presidential statement. North Korea seems to be 
perturbed by the participation of China in the issuance of the 
statement. We will endeavor with continuous discussion and 
cooperation with the United States, Japan, China, and all other 
countries concerned, so that the objective of the UN Security 
Council's presidential statement may be fulfilled. 
  [Yi] Attention is focused on the recent remarks by U.S. 
Defense Secretary Perry, who said that North Korea has already 
developed two nuclear weapons. What is your view of this? 
  [Han] Secretary Perry is concerned that his remarks are 
often reported with exaggeration. He has never said, commenting 
on the North Korean nuclear capability, that North Korea has two 
nuclear weapons. One has no proof supporting one's statement on 
the number of the nuclear weapons North Korea has. We have to 
make efforts to prevent North Korea from making any further 
development of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [From the "Reporter's Eye" column, by Pak Kyong-kyun] </F>
  [Text] Even if the confusion were created on purpose, it 
is difficult to imagine any more confusion resulting from the 
series of extremely inconsistent remarks made recently by 
high-ranking government officials over the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  In a news conference on 29 March for reporters from home and 
abroad during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in China, 
Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae made remarks which amounted 
to saying that "the United States cannot apply sanctions against 
North Korea without China's cooperation," which were contrary to 
the atmosphere the government was trying to induce of China 
joining sanctions against North Korea. 
  This was followed with Ambassador Hwang's flurry to withdraw 
his remarks. Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide for 
foreign affairs and security, also tried to mitigate the public 
stir caused by Hwang's remark by saying that "Ambassador Hwang's 
remarks were a mistake," but that came only after we had lost 
face on an international scale. 
  Even before the swell of Ambassador Hwang's remark had been 
quelled, another bout of confusion took place domestically on 
the evening of 3 April. Attending the discussion session 
between ruling party and opposition lawmakers at the Academy 
House in Suyuri, Seoul, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong 
revealed that the government may consider amending its policy on 
realizing a South-North envoy exchange prior to North Korea-U.S. 
talks. 
  On the morning of 4 April, however, Chong Chong-uk said that 
"Vice Minister Hong's remarks reflect his personal opinion only" 
and strongly denied the remarks by saying that "It is absolutely 
false." During a monthly morning meeting, Yi Yong-tok, deputy 
prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, 
also expressed extreme displeasure by saying: "It is true that 
people who lack experience have made some verbal mistakes." 
Even Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting Japan, 
stressed: "There is no change in the government policy that the 
envoy exchange should be realized before the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks." Within the space of one day, the 
minister and vice minister of one ministry were saying almost 
the exact opposite thing. In February, Minister Han also 
experienced having to withdraw his remark that "he would 
consider a flexible method for deciding on a date and form for 
an envoy exchange" because of strong opposition from the other 
offices involved, such as Chongwadae [presidential office], the 
National Unification Board, and the Agency for National Security 
Planning. 
  Even with the issuance of a statement by the UN Security 
Council president, our policy on North Korea remains in disorder 
with inconsistent remarks being made by government officials 
irrespective of rank. Not to speak of public criticism, one 
worries about how our negotiation partner, North Korea, must 
view this panorama of confusing developments in our policy on 
the North Korean issue.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on DPRK's Position on UNSC `Presidential </F>
Statement'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Since the United States 
has opted the one-sided way to put pressure on the DPRK, 
reversing all its commitments with the DPRK, we cannot but 
normalize our peaceful nuclear activities frozen unilaterally 
for DPRK-USA talks, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry in a statement released Monday. 
  Noting that the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] on 
March 31 published its "presidential statement" imposing an 
unreasonable demand upon the DPRK, the spokesman said: 
  It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the 
UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to 
guarantee world peace and security discussed our issue on the 
basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced "conclusion" of the 
Board of Governors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] that the "scope of noncompliance with the safeguards 
agreement has expanded". 
  If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its 
mission, 
it should take issue with the United States which is gravely 
threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with 
huge nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution of the 
nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its henchmen. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council 
unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear 
activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are 
hell bent on a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of 
the United States. 
  This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the 
hands of the United States in executing the latter's hostile 
policy of stifling the DPRK, applying double standards. 
  This time the UN Security Council sympathized with the 
United 
States' hostile policy against the DPRK by including the 
question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the 
"presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our 
"nuclear issue" on purpose. 
  The effect of the safeguards agreement has virtually been at 
a standstill from the moment when the DPRK temporarily suspended 
the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for talks between the DPRK and 
the United States. 
  The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and 
additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for 
the DPRK now in a publicly recognized special status. 
  We have consistently maintained the steadfast policy of 
independence and correct lines in external relations and never 
changed our once clarified position. 
  The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the 
unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope 
of partiality against us, kowtowing to big countries, before 
demanding an additional inspection of us. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in 
further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining force 
with the United States in its intrigues against the DPRK. 
  We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for 
expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of 
making an apology. 
  Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised 
in its moves to step up a campaign for international pressure on 
our republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the 
IAEA and the UNSC. 
  Since the United States has opted the one-sided way to put 
pressure on us, reversing all its commitments with us, we could 
not but normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally 
frozen for the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the 
UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can 
never work with us. 
  The more desperately the United States and its followers try 
to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more 
immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party, 
people and People's Army will increase. 
  It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with 
strength, dialogue with dialogue. 
  The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is 
sure to end in failure. 
  Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs released a statement on 4 April regarding the UN 
Security Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's 
statement making irrational demands on us. 
  Noting that the UNSC published its presidential statement on 
March 31 making irrational demands and urging us to allow 
additional unjust inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], the statement pointed out: 
  The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to 
the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough 
inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States 
and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here. 
  Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the 
course of the inspection, they should be settled between the 
agency and the inspected country -- the actual parties concerned 
with the inspection. 
  Nevertheless, the UNSC discussed our issue based on the IAEA 
Board of Governors unjust and biased conclusion that the scope 
of the noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been 
broadened. It is clearly contrary to the purpose and principle 
of the UN Charter. 
  If the UNSC truly wants to fulfill its mission, it should 
raise an issue with the United States, which is posing grave 
threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a 
huge amount of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to the 
solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean 
authorities, the perpetrator of the United States. 
  The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear 
issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the 
safeguards accord in the president's statement and sided with 
the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK. 
  Before demanding additional inspections of us, the UNSC must 
first take steps to correct the unjust action by the IAEA 
Secretariat, which has expanded its unjust treatment while 
currying favor with the big country. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for further widening the 
area of unfair treatment while openly joining the U.S. 
anti-republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA 
Secretariat has gradually expanded the unfair treatment. We 
will repay this without fail. 
  Under the present situation in which the United States is 
onesidedly clinging to pressure after overturning all promises 
made to us, we have no choice but to normalize peaceful nuclear 
activities, which we had unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with 
the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. However, 
this cannot fool us. 
  The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to 
crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the 
single- hearted united might of our party, the people, and the 
People's Army will be. 
  Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue 
is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile 
policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin. 
  Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is 
consistent.

<F P=106> ["Clouds of War Hovering Over Korean Peninsula"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Now, a touch-and-go 
situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula in which a war 
may break out any moment. 
  As is known, U.S. President Bill Clinton revealed his 
intention to stage "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and 
ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. And 
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry cried for a dispatch of 
additional troops and weapons to South Korea, and chairman of 
the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn pushed home 
the need to make "steady war preparations" to counter an 
"attack". 
  The U.S. military has worked out an operational plan to hurl 
600,000 troops, more than 200 warships and 1,600 aircraft and so 
on from the U.S. mainland within 80 days in case of an 
"emergency" on the Korean peninsula. 
  The "New Operation Plan 5027" for a surprise attack on the 
DPRK by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South 
Korean puppet army in the event of "contingency" on the Korean 
peninsula has been made known to have been worked out between 
the master and the servant. 
  On bellicose orders from the U.S. ruling quarters and under 
their aggressive war plan, forty-eight U.S. missile [word 
indistinct] and a more than 800-men Patriot missile unit are on 
their way to South Korea at present. Overseas-based warplanes 
of various types are flying into U.S. Air Force bases in South 
Korea one on the heels of the other, and the airlifted aggressor 
troops and lethal equipment are being deployed in operational 
zones. And U.S. vessels including a nuclear aircraft carrier 
are at so close a range that they can reach the coastal area of 
Korea within 24 hours. 
  Meanwhile, the traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea shouted 
to 
army brasshats to establish a "thoroughgoing alert posture 
against the North", and the puppet prime minister turned up at 
puppet army frontline units and incited a war fever. 
  The South Korean puppet armed forces are on "an alert 
posture" from March 23. 
  The United States keeps more than 40 major Army, Navy and 
Air 
Force bases, over 200 military installations and 40,000 troops 
in South Korea. A large number of missiles and more than 1,000 
pieces of nuclear weapons have been deployed at these bases. 
Some 100 U.S. military bases and about 50,000 U.S. troops are 
also in Japan to cope with an "emergency" on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean 
puppets are staging various war exercises almost every day in 
the sky, on the ground and in the sea, in areas near the 
northern half of Korea. 
  The U.S. Secretary of Defense will reportedly visit South 
Korea in April to [word indistinct] himself with the 
preparations for a war. 
  Facts tell that the situation on the Korean peninsula 
resembles that on the eve of the past Korean war. The U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets had rapidly reinforced 
their aggression armed forces and committed armed provocations 
threatening the North on more than 5,100 occasions for three 
years and a half before unleashing the war on June 25, 1950. 
Dulles, dispatched to South Korea as a special envoy of the 
then U.S. President, had shown up at the 38th Parallel to 
inspect the preparations for mobilization and examined and 
ratified the plan of northward invasion on the spot. On the 
basis of this, the U.S. imperialists finally made an invasion of 
the DPRK on June 25, 1950, by instigating the Syngman Yi [Rhee] 
clique. 
  Now the world peaceloving people express deep apprehensions 
for the situation on the Korean peninsula and denounce the U.S. 
imperialists' anti-DPRK campaign and are conducting vigorous 
international movements to check and frustrate it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The April Spring 
Friendship Art Festival will soon open in Pyongyang, the capital 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Foreign artistes and acrobats and Korean artistes overseas 
from five continents of the world will participate in the 
festival. 
  It is a traditional art festival which has taken place every 
year from 1982 in celebration of the birthday of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song, the 15th of April. 
  The number of the art troupes and artistes participating in 
the festival is increasing annually. 
  About 700 art and acrobatic troupes and tens of thousands of 
artistes from the five continents have participated in the 
eleven rounds of the festival held so far. Among them there 
were hundreds of famous artistes including international contest 
prize winners. 
  Last year, though a rigorous situation that might lead to a 
war any moment prevailed in Korea owing to the frenzied moves of 
the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for a war of aggression, 
a large number of artistes of the world came to Pyongyang to 
participate in the grand festival. They included the Chinese 
symphony orchestra, a Cuban art troupe, folk song and dance 
troupes of Russia and Ukraine and other art and acrobatic 
troupes comprising international contest prize winners and 
famous artistes and overseas Korean artistes. 
  The songs, works of instrumental music, dances and circus 
pieces performed by them totalled more than 1,000. 
  Some 100,000 working people and artistes appreciated their 
performances at theatres in the city. 
  Art troupes from various countries and now arriving in 
Pyongyang.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata suggested Tuesday [5 April] Japan and the United States 
could discuss resumption of their stalled trade "framework" 
talks at two upcoming international gatherings. 
  Hata said the opportunity could come in Marrakech, Morocco, 
later this month when ministers from 119 nations gather for the 
signing of a global trade pact or at a meeting of Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in June. 
  At a press conference after a regular cabinet meeting, Hata 
dismissed remarks by a high-ranking Japanese Government official 
that nothing can be done about the trade talks until Japan 
hammers out economic reform measures in June. Japan still has 
to make macroeconomic efforts, including tax reform and 
deregulation, and relevant ministries and agencies are currently 
working on them, Hata said. 
  The government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
suggested earlier in the day that nothing can be done at the 
moment and that it is important to show Japan's efforts in the 
economic measures scheduled for June. 
  Hata said both Japan and the U.S. should make efforts to 
resume the trade talks. 
  The two countries have opportunities to hold meetings in 
Marrakech and at the OECD council meeting and Japan wants to 
inform the U.S. of Japanese efforts at those meetings, Hata said. 
  Hata is expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor in Marrakech next week at the signing ceremony for the 
global trade pact concluded in the Uruguay Round last December 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Construction Minister Kozo 
Igarashi said Tuesday [5 April] that his ministry will dispatch 
a research team to the United States in April or May to study 
using more imported construction materials to lower Japan's 
housing costs. 
  Igarashi said the purpose of the mission is to study 
construction costs. According to the ministry, housing 
construction costs in Japan are 30 percent higher than in the 
U.S. The ministry hopes to lower the cost by one-third by 2000. 
  Increased imports of housing materials from North America 
have been cited as a way to lower prices. 
  Officials from the ministry and the Housing and Urban 
Development Corp. will visit a factory that manufactures housing 
material and interview U.S. Government and trading company 
officials, the minister said. Igarashi said the schedule has 
not been fixed, but indicated that the team will also visit 
Canada, which also exports housing materials to Japan.

  [Text] A delegation of Japan Socialist Party [JSP] 
lawmakers of the Japanese coalition ruling party, which is 
visiting China, is seeking a way to visit Pyongyang by 
contacting a North Korean diplomatic office in Beijing. SANKEI 
SHIMBUN reported this today. 
  According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, JSP Vice President Inoue and 
other members of the party delegation held a secret meeting with 
North Korean Minister Pae Yong-chae in Beijing on 4 April and 
expressed their desire to visit Pyongyang to create an 
atmosphere for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. North 
Korea avoided giving an immediate response to this and only 
repeated its earlier attitude of denouncing the United States

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- A senior official of Japan's 
ruling coalition proposed Tuesday [5 April] holding summit talks 
in Beijing between U.S. President Bill Clinton and North Korean 
leader Kim Il-song to settle an international dispute over 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear development program. 
  Issei Inoue, vice chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the largest among the seven ruling 
parties, also proposed sending a group of coalition Diet members 
to North and South Korea, China and the United States to seek 
support for the U.S.-North Korean summit. Inoue, who visited 
China between Friday and Sunday as head of an SDP delegation, 
put forth those proposals during a meeting with Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, officials said. 
  Hata offered support for an idea of creating opportunities 
for North Korea to have dialogue through exchanges with Japanese 
Diet members. But the foreign minister was quoted as saying, 
"We should consider (sending Diet members) not only as the SDP 
but the coalition parties as a whole."

  [Text] Hiroshima, April 1 KYODO -- Two South Koreans 
forced to work for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in Hiroshima 
during World War II began proceedings Friday [1 April] aimed at 
recovering wages they say are owing them since the end of the 
war. The two men submitted a request to the Hiroshima District 
Legal Affairs Bureau for access to a list of people and money 
they say has been deposited on their behalf. 
  Hiroshima is the only place in Japan where the existence of 
such a list has been confirmed and if it is made public, it 
would be the first time in Japan. The South Koreans, Pang 
Hun-chae, 71, and Pak Chang-hwan, 71, are members of an 
association of former conscripted Korean employees of Mitsubishi. 
  A Japanese citizens' group which assists Korean "hibakusha," 
or people who have suffered from the Hiroshima atomic blast, 
invited them to Japan. 
  Pang and Pak were brought to Japan in 1944. Pang was working 
at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipbuilding yard and Pak at 
the Mitisubishi machine assembly plant when the United States 
dropped an atomic bomb on the city August 6, 1945. The bomb 
destroyed most of the city. 
  Both made their own way back to South Korea in September 
that 
year. 
  The citizens' group said the list kept at the district legal 
affairs bureau contains 1,951 names but only people on the list 
are allowed to read it. Pang and Pak say their wages for July 
and August, 1945 are unpaid. 
  During negotiations with staff at the bureau, they were able 
to show the staff extracts from their family registers, but the 
bureau staff said they will have to confirm what documentation 
is required to determine their identity. 
  Pak said he produced a pension identity card issued to him 
by 
a local insurance office in Hiroshima during the war, and was 
upset that the officials had not trusted his documentation 
despite having the copy of the family register which shows the 
"Japanese" name he was using at the time.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan renewed calls on 
Russia on Tuesday [5 April] to totally ban dumping of 
radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and work out as early as 
possible a plan to construct emergency storage and small-scale 
processing facilities. Commenting on reports that Russia may 
resume the dumping in the Sea of Japan next month, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said Japan "strongly hopes" 
that Russia will totally ban the ocean dumping by establishing 
the facilities for low-level liquid radioactive wastes. 
  Japan has repeatedly told Russia it is ready to help set up 
such facilities by using funds allocated to a bilateral 
committee for cooperation on the destruction of nuclear weapons 
in Russia, Terada said. 
  "In order for us to carry out this project, it is a 
prerequisite that the Russian Government actually decides on a 
construction plan for emergency storage and small-scale 
processing facilities," Terada told reporters. "We understand 
as a matter of fact that while we're engaged in dialogue to 
materialize this project, there will not be any ocean dumping by 
the Russian side," he said. 
  Last October, Russia dumped 800 tons of liquid radioactive 
waste in the Sea of Japan. It suspended its planned second 
dumping following protests from Japan and South Korea. 
  Russia's Pacific Fleet indicated it may resume dumping 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in May because its tanker 
TNT-5, loaded with about 500 tons of radioactive waste, is 
decaying and the risk of leakage of the waste is increasing.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak's planned visit to Japan in mid-April is likely to mark 
"the new phase of closer and deeper ties" between the two 
countries, an Egyptian state minister said in Tokyo Friday [1 
April]. "Japan should play much more central role in the 
economic development in Egypt," Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, state 
minister for international cooperation, said at a press meeting. 
  During his four-day stay in Japan prior to Mubarak's 
scheduled visit, Butrus-Ghali met with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and senior officials of 
the International Trade and Industry Ministry and other 
ministries and agencies. 
  He also spoke to Japanese business leaders about their 
on-going economic reform programs in Egypt at an investment 
seminar organized by the Federation of Economic Organizations. 
Ten Egyptian business leaders are also accompanying 
Butrus-Ghali, he added. 
  The state minister said he briefed Japanese Government and 
business leaders about the successful results of economic reform 
program in Egypt towards self-sustaining and marketed-economy. 
  "We have great faith in the way Japan has achieved its 
economic success," Butrus-Ghali said. "We are here to request 
Japan help us to achieve the similar success through technical 
assistance." 
  He cited "export promotion, industry policy management and 
management of monetary policy" as the fields of possible 
Japanese technical assistance. However, when he was asked about 
diminishing U.S. aid to Egypt, he said that the current economic 
reform program aims at a "self-sustained economy without 
reliance on external assistance." 
  Butrus-Ghali also said President Mubarak will discuss with 
Japanese leaders "all aspects of bilateral relations," Middle 
East and African issues as "Egypt represents Middle East and 
Africa." 
  Butrus-Ghali is scheduled to return to Cairo on Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Monday [4 April] called on the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to promote dialogue with 
nonmember nations such as China and Russia, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Hata said in a 40-minute meeting with OECD Secretary General 
Jean-Claude Paye that Japan wants the OECD to offer objective 
analysis and direction amid the changing international 
situation, the officials said. Specifically, Hata called on the 
OECD to provide intellectual support for countries that are 
trying to shift toward market-oriented economies, such as middle 
and Central European nations, Russia and China, they said. 
  He told Paye the OECD could provide know-how on 
democratization of markets, on beefing up investment 
environment, and on banking systems, they said. 
  Hata pointed out that promoting dialogue with Russia and 
China is important as the two nations have large populations and 
will affect the OECD nations, they said. 
  He also voiced expectations that the OECD would promote ties 
with the Asia-Pacific region, discussions on post-Uruguay Round 
issues, and make further efforts to solve structural problems, 
they said. 
  Paye, on a four-day visit from Sunday, said he agrees with 
Hata's views on the OECD's future role, the officials said. 
  Paye, a French national, told Hata international cooperation 
is becoming increasingly important as economic interdependence 
grows while political obscurity increases, they said. He was 
also quoted as saying it is necessary to study economic problems 
by linking them with social problems, citing unemployment as an 
example. 
  Paye is visiting major OECD member nations ahead of the 
international body's Council meeting in June in Paris. Earlier 
in the day, he conferred with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and the ministers responsible for trade, labor and agriculture. 
  On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with Science and 
Technology 
Agency chief Satsuki Eda, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Bank 
of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren).

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The OECD is likely to revise 
slightly upward the economic growth it forecast for the Group of 
Seven (G-7) industrialized economies for 1994, the Paris-based 
organization's Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye said Tuesday 
[5 April]. "The U.S. economic recovery is stronger than 
expected, there is the first sign of recovery in Europe and the 
very beginning of the first sign in Japan," Paye said. 
  In its economic outlook issued in December, the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast a 2.1 percent 
growth for member nations, with a 0.5 percent growth for Japan. 
The organization is expected to issue a new outlook in June. 
  Paye, currently on a regular visit to Tokyo to discuss the 
OECD's annual ministerial meeting in June with Japanese leaders, 
mentioned the possible upward revision at a press conference at 
the Japan National Press Club. 
  Regarding the agenda of June's meeting, Paye said the focus 
will be on the problem of unemployment among member nations, the 
future of world trading following the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of trade talks, and OECD relations with nonmember nations. 
  The main cause of the current unemployment problem is, Paye 
said, "the gap which exists between the need for adjusting our 
economy and ability or willingness to adjust." 
  He said the OECD nations need to tackle this problem through 
a macroeconomic approach and by revising structural policy, 
leading to a more flexible economy and a more skillful work 
force. 
  As for global trading following the conclusion of the 
Uruguay 
Round of talks, Paye pointed out the importance of balancing 
trade and protecting the environment. 
  In this respect, he stressed the necessity of creating 
international rules to prevent protectionist moves using 
environmental concerns as excuses. 
  Paye said the OECD has expanded its relations with nonmember 
nations in line with the rapidly changing global situation. As 
part of that, the organization will welcome Mexico as its first 
new member in 21 years at the forthcoming ministerial meeting, 
bringing the number of its member states to 25.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa expressed his desire Tuesday to quit as head of 
government after about eight months in office, two lawmakers 
said. 
  The premier made the remark at a dinner meeting with Kiyoshi 
Nishikawa and Yasushi Shimomura, both of the Niin Club, a tiny 
political grouping in the House of Councillors, the two 
legislators told reporters. However, an aide to Hosokawa denied 
the reported remark, saying, "the premier is saying he did not 
state such a thing." 
  During the two-hour meeting Hosokawa remarked with a 
straight 
face that he wants to quit as premier, Shimomura said. 
  Shimomura said he told the premier to step down if he wishes 
to. Nishikawa, however, said he took the remark as a joke. "It 
is unthinkable for a person in such a responsible position to 
make such a careless comment," Nishikawa said. 
  Hosokawa's reported resignation remark comes at a time when 
the Diet's budget negotiations remain paralyzed due to a gulf 
between the ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp 
over Hosokawa's questionable personal finances. Dismissing 
allegations about his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa 
Kyubin Co., a scandal-torn delivery firm, Hosokawa has spurned 
demands by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to 
summon a former aide who was in charge of his finances. 
  The LDP, toppled from government last summer after nearly 
four decades of rule, has refused to participate in Diet 
deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which started last 
Friday. While the deposed party suspects the loan was an 
undeclared political donation, Hosokawa insists he repaid the 
money in full, with interest, by January 31, 1991. 
  Political sources said the chances for an early start on the 
key budget debate are slim, predicting the stalemate to last 
through next week. 
  After returning to his official residence, Hosokawa told 
reporters his talks with the two legislators were a joy and did 
not touch on his alleged remark. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to meet reporters at his official 
residence at around 12:20 A.M. Wednesday, officials said. The 
prime minister is expected to deny reports that he expressed his 
desire Tuesday to quit as prime minister, political sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted former 
Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on Friday [1 April] on a 
charge of accepting a 10 million yen bribe from leading 
contractor Kajima Corp. 
  As a member of the House of Representatives, Nakamura, 44, 
pressured the Fair Trade Commission in 1991 not to file a 
criminal accusation against a group of 66 contractors over 
suspected bid-rigging, prosecutors allege. 
  Nakamura received the money on January 13, 1992, from Shinji 
Kiyoyama, then vice president of Kajima, the indictment said. 
At the time, Nakamura was acting head of the then governing 
Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly affairs. 
Kiyoyama, 68, was charged Tuesday with bribing Nakamura. 
  If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in 
prison, according to the penal code. 
  The indictment said Nakamura repeatedly urged then FTC 
Chairman Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation with 
prosecutors against the cartel. Umezawa announced on May 15, 
1992 that the FTC would not file the accusation against the 
group. It is not yet proven whether Nakamura influenced the FTC 
decision. 
  Prior to his arrest on March 11, the prosecution asked the 
Diet to lift Nakamura's parliamentary immunity, which provides 
that Diet members cannot be arrested while the House is in 
session. The lower house voted March 10 to approve the request. 
  Nakamura served as construction minister from December 1992 
to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. He is 
the only Diet member thus far to be arrested and indicted in 
connection with a series of scandals involving construction 
firms and politicians. 
  Since last June, two governors, two mayors and more than 20 
executives of eight top contractors have been arrested.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted Friday 
[1 April] former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on a 
charge of accepting a bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. 
in exchange for helping block a criminal accusation by the 
government's anticartel watchdog over a bid-rigging case. The 
indictment capped a one-year investigation by prosecutors into a 
string of payoff allegations involving the nation's top 
construction companies and politicians. 
  Nakamura became the first Diet member indicted in connection 
with the general contractor scandals. A total of 32 people, 
including two governors, two mayors, executives of eight 
contractors and a paper manufacturer, were indicted. 
  According to the indictment, in 1992 Nakamura, 44, 
repeatedly 
urged Setsuo Umezawa, then chairman of the Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC), not to file a criminal accusation with prosecutors 
against a group headed by Kajima. Kajima was then leader of 
Saitama Doyo-kai (Saturday Association), comprised of 66 
contractors in Saitama Prefecture which allegedly consulted over 
bid-rigging. 
  Umezawa announced May 15, 1992, that the FTC decided not to 
file the criminal accusation against the group. 
  The indictment said Nakamura received 10 million yen in a 
bribe from then Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, 68, on 
January 13, 1992, at the parliamentarian's office in Tokyo's 
Nagatacho. Nakamura was then acting head of the Liberal 
Democratic Party's lobby of legislators concerned with a 
revision of the antimonopoly law. Nakamura quit the LDP prior 
to the arrest. 
  The day's indictment followed a rare request by prosecutors 
on March 8 that the Diet lift Nakamura's constitutional immunity 
from arrest as a legislator while the Diet is in session. 
  The Diet voted to grant the request on March 10. The 
granting of the request and the request itself was the first 
such case in 27 years. 
  Nakamura was not in any governmental or Diet committee 
position to lawfully influence the action of the FTC when he 
allegedly pressured Umezawa not to file the criminal accusation 
against Kajima. 
  Nakamura has been under arrest since March 11. Since his 
arrest, the former minister has refused to answer questions from 
prosecutors seeking to corroborate the bribery charges. 
  In spite of his refusal to testify, the testimonies of other 
witnesses and other circumstantial evidence are convincing 
enough to prove his guilt, prosecution sources said. However, 
defense attorneys for Kiyoyama forwarded to prosecutors a legal 
statement in which Kiyoyama said his testimonies written in 
prosecutors' papers to be examined in court "contradict my 
memories." 
  The defense attorneys also plan to argue that the FTC had 
already given up a plan to file the accusation by the time 
Nakamura tried to persuade Umezawa not to file it, saying 
prosecutors were then opposed to filing any accusation due to 
lack of specific evidence, sources close to the attorneys said. 
  The attorneys are also expected to argue that Nakamura was 
merely acting on instructions from then LDP kingpin Shin 
Kanemaru, Nakamura's mentor, who reportedly advised Kiyoyama to 
seek Nakamura's cooperation to block the FTC's planned move, the 
sources said. Nakamura said in a press statement issued through 
his defense counsel, "I am determined to reveal the truth 
regarding the allegations at open court hearings." 
  "After I am released from detention, I will return to my 
parliamentary residence and participate in Diet deliberations 
from the day after my release," Nakamura said. However, 
prosecutors said they will oppose any move by his lawyers to 
seek Nakamura's release, saying he may try to destroy evidence, 
and three of Nakamura's political secretaries have vanished and 
not complied with prosecutors' court-authorized summons designed 
to obtain their testimonies. 
  Meanwhile, the special investigating squad of the Tokyo 
District Public Prosecutors Office will continue to investigate 
other reported payoffs to politicians other than Nakamura on 
suspicion of contravening the political funds control law, the 
investigative sources said. 
  In the course of the one-year investigation, prosecutors 
seized hundreds of documents, including financial records, from 
the offices of the major contractors prosecutors raided. 
  The law places a requirement to report acceptance of 
political funds while placing a ceiling on the annual amount of 
political funds that a lawmaker can lawfully accept from a 
single source. 
  In a related development, the prosecutors decided not to 
indict two LDP executives other than Nakamura earlier named by 
the media as the alleged recipients of bribes from the 
construction industry, investigative sources said. 
  It is impossible to indict former LDP Secretary General 
Seiroku Kajiyama on bribery charges in connection with the 
alleged acceptance of 10 million yen from Mitsui Construction 
Co. As the firm's ex-managing director told prosecutors he 
"embezzled" the money before delivering it to Kajiyama, the 
sources said. 
  The prosecutors also decided not to indict former Post and 
Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe on bribery charges, 
the sources said. 
  Watanabe was reported to have accepted 40 million yen from 
Kajima in exchange for using his influence in a bid to have the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government ease a regulation regarding 
construction of a high-rise building in a restricted area in 
Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- A former aide to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had asked an investment consultant 
who allegedly arranged Hosokawa's 1986 purchase of Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares not to identify 
Hosokawa as a client in his firm's tax returns, the consultant 
said Tuesday [5 April]. "When I received 10 million yen as a 
consulting fee from the prime minister's former secretary 
Masatoshi Miyama, he asked me to conceal the transaction," Shuzo 
Fujiki, president of the Tokyo-based consulting firm Random 
Walk, said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Fujiki, 60, said Miyama made the request after Hosokawa made 
a profit of 50 million yen by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT 
shares, for whose purchase Fujiki said he had helped Hosokawa 
secure a loan. Fujiki complied with Miyama's request by 
refraining from reporting to the tax authorities the consulting 
fee as an income of his consulting firm, thereby avoiding the 
identification of Hosokawa as the payer of the fee. 
  Hosokawa told reporters Tuesday morning he "does not know" 
whether Miyama asked Fujiki to conceal the exact details of the 
transaction. "I do not know it," the premier said. "I have to 
ask (Miyama)." 
  At a news conference last Wednesday, Fujiki quoted Miyama as 
asking him in 1986, "Mr. Miyama asked...`Because Hosokawa is the 
incumbent Kumamoto governor, may he use the name of another 
person for this transaction?'" 
  In the subsequent 1987 conversation with Miyama, Fujiki 
said, 
he took Miyama's remark as implying a request not to report to 
tax authorities the name of Hosokawa as the payer of the 
consulting fee, as publicity on such a deal might undercut 
Hosokawa's reputation as governor. 
  According to Fujiki, Miyama had promised to pay 10 percent 
of 
net proceeds from any selloffs of the NTT shares as a "reward," 
while allowing Fujiki to dictate the timing of the selloffs. 
However, Miyama reneged on the promise and sold off the 199 
shares in February and March of 1987 without any consultations 
with Fujiki, Fujiki said. 
  Later, Miyama asked for Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of 
the reward to 10 million yen, he said, adding that he accepted 
the request. 
  Out of the total, 7 million yen were handed over to Fujiki 
from Miyama in a few installations, while the remaining 3 
million yen was remitted to Fujiki's bank account, he said. 
  Fujiki said he is willing to testify on the NTT share 
transaction at a Diet session if the governing coalition 
complied with an opposition demand to summon him as a witness. 
Diet business over the fiscal 1994 state budget has been 
stalled over the witness demand. 
  Fujiki earlier told reporters that Hosokawa "lied" to the 
Diet when Hosokawa said his father-in-law, but not himself, 
asked Fujiki to act as an intermediary to facilitate the share 
purchase. 
  Hosokawa denied the allegations on the Diet floor, saying 
that Shohei Ueda, the father of his wife, Kayoko, asked for the 
share purchase, asking Hosokawa for help in securing a loan to 
finance the purchase. Hosokawa said he pledged his condominium 
in Tokyo's Moto-Azabu as collateral to take out the 418 million 
yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the 
money to his father-in-law. Hosokawa's father-in-law died last 
May. 
  In a related development, a well-placed government source 
told reporters Fujiki "appears to have received the 10 million 
yen" from Miyama. 
  However, the source denied the allegations that Miyama asked 
Fujiki to conceal the details of the transaction. 
  Hosokawa earlier told the Diet he purchased the condominium 
he offered as collateral with part of a 100 million yen loan he 
borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group, a 
company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal. 
  NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and 
large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100 
shares on October 4, 1986, before offering the shares for 
smaller-lot public subscription. 
  Hosokawa succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares for which 
he had submitted bids on advice from Fujiki, Fujiki said. 
  Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share 
purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of about 
50 million yen, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's chief 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa criticized the leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Monday [4 April] for refusing 
Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget because of a 
loan issue involving Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. At a 
press conference, Ozawa, co-founder of the coalition's core 
party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), said at a news 
conference, "It is unreasonable for the LDP to hold Diet 
deliberations hostage." 
  The LDP has refused to attend lower house Budget Committee 
sessions to discuss the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 
1994 for a month, demanding that Hosokawa submit further 
documents relating to a 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa 
Kyubin business group, the country's leading but scandal-tainted 
trucking group, and that his former secretary testify in the 
Diet. 
  The Diet last Friday enacted a 50-day provisional budget for 
the current fiscal year with a record outlay of 11.05 trillion 
yen to bridge the delay in Diet passage of the full fiscal 1994 
budget. 
  The LDP has said the loan might be an illegal donation, 
contrary to Hosokawa's assertion that he borrowed the money to 
buy a condominium in Tokyo and to repair the gate and walls of 
his house in his native Kumamoto Prefecture, western Japan. 
  The premier has resisted the LDP demands, saying he 
presented 
as much evidence as he could and there were no illegalities in 
the loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group, whose now-defunct Tokyo 
Sagawa Kyubin Co. was implicated in a mob-and-money scandal 
involving politicians such as disgraced former LDP don Shin 
Kanemaru. 
  On international affairs, Ozawa expressed dissatisfaction 
with the United States' reinstatement of the so-called Super 301 
trade legislation in early March, which allows the U.S. 
Government to take retaliatory steps unless Japan meets its 
demands for greater access to its markets. "This is a type of 
political fighting and could lead to nationalism, aggravating 
the feelings of the people of the two countries," Ozawa told 
reporters.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The Diet's budget business 
remained stymied Tuesday due to a stalemate in wranglings 
between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's controversial loan. 
  Political sources said the chances for an early start to 
deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee are slim, predicting an impasse 
to last through next week. 
  Hosokawa rejected the demand by the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) to summon his former aide, who was in 
charge of Hosokawa's finances when he borrowed 100 million yen 
from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. Top 
LDP officials refused to take part in the Budget Committee 
debate unless the seven-party coalition promised to bring the 
witness before the Diet. 
  The LDP also decided to boycott discussions at all 
committees 
if the coalition opens the Budget Committee meeting without the 
LDP. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura the LDP also demands that Hosokawa 
provides more information about the loan, which the opposition 
claims was an undeclared political donation. 
  After being briefed by Takemura on the meeting with Mori, 
Hosokawa told reporters that he has no intention to agree to a 
Diet testimony by his former aide. 
  Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan, which he says was used 
for personal affairs, with interest by 1991. 
  Diet discussions over a full state budget for fiscal 1994, 
which began Friday, have been suspended due to the stalemate.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the biggest group in the seven-party 
coalition, gingerly stepped Tuesday [5 April] toward approving a 
hike in the consumption tax in a policy reverse from its 
long-standing opposition to the idea. 
  An SDP committee endorsed a draft policy outline on tax 
reform that argues the aging society demands a larger role of 
the consumption tax as a fund source. The draft outline calls 
for redressing the inequity in the tax system and removing 
shortcomings in the current 3 percent consumption tax as 
conditions for endorsing the raise. 
  It noted the importance of creating a tax system with levies 
on income, assets and consumptions well balanced. 
  In view of the rapidly graying populace, the weight of taxes 
on assets and consumptions are bound to increase, while the 
income tax should remain as a principal revenue source, it said. 
The times require a shift in weight to the consumption tax from 
the income tax, which places a lopsided burden on workers, it 
said. 
  Support by the rank-and-file party members to the apparent 
change in the party's basic stance on the tax issue, however, is 
far from secured. The first vocal oppositions to the about-face 
may be voiced by local party executives at their meeting on 
Friday and Saturday, political sources said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, mindful of the possible 
turmoil within the party, downplayed the importance of the draft 
outline. 
  "We are still in the process of discussing the issue," he 
told a news conference. "(The policy outline) is only a very 
first proposal for the discussions. That doesn't mean we 
support a raise in the consumption tax." 
  A senior SDP policy-maker sounded a bit more supportive to 
the proposal. "We are not dead set against a consumption tax 
raise," said SDP Policy Board Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama. 
  Sekiyama was speaking at a meeting among senior ruling 
coalition officials and the Federation of Economic 
Organizations, the most powerful business lobby. "But there are 
a heap of things to do, like rectifying the inequality in the 
tax system before we talk about a raise," he said. 
  The draft outline called for lower consumption tax rates on 
food and other steps to improve the 5-year-old value-added tax. 
  It also recommended creating a local consumption tax to 
finance local projects in line with the growing calls for 
decentralization of power. The SDP's move received a warm 
welcome from other coalition partners. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the 
new 
party Sakigake [Harbinger], said at a news conference it is a 
"very good news." 
  The SDP, as the largest opposition party, strongly resisted 
the introduction of the consumption tax when it was instituted 
in April 1989 under the administration of then Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The SDP was also the main force for thwarting Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's attempt in February to introduce a 7 percent 
"national welfare tax," a new value-added tax to finance 
proposed income tax cuts. Hosokawa then cited the need to raise 
funds to prepare for the aging of the society and to offset 
revenue shortfalls from income tax cuts. 
  The ruling coalition scrapped Hosokawa's new tax proposal 
and 
decided to set up a forum within itself which would make a final 
decision by the end of the current ordinary Diet session on how 
to fund the 6 trillion yen tax cuts included in the economic 
stimulus package unveiled in early February. The 150-day Diet 
session lasts through at least late June.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- There is no problem with 
the government's procedures for buying grain, the farm minister 
said Friday [1 April], commenting on an ASAHI SHIMBUN report 
that the Food Agency sets import shares for grain traders who 
then collude on bids. 
  Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries 
did not deny, however, the newspaper's report that the agency 
informs trading companies of their share ahead of grain 
auctions. He said the procedures have been applied to imports 
of wheat, but not to the government's recent emergency imports 
of rice. 
  Hata said that allotting shares for trading companies ahead 
of grain auctions "prevents excessive competition among trading 
firms and therefore puts a stop to excessively high or low 
prices." He said, however, that "improvements must be made 
where necessary," noting that the general public, unlike 
experts, might find it difficult to understand the procedures 
and could feel suspicious. 
  In its Friday morning editions, the ASAHI said that the 
Agency gives written notifications to trading companies twice a 
year as to the share each will have in upcoming grain auctions. 
The daily said it obtained a paper dated October 1, 1993, sent 
from the director general of the Agency to one company stating, 
"We notify you that we have decided on the following," and 
giving the percentage share the company was to have in the wheat 
auction in latter half of fiscal 1993. 
  After receiving the Agency's notifications, the trading 
companies routinely confer among themselves so that their bids 
would be in line with their allotted shares, the newspaper said. 
  The ASAHI noted that such government instructions and 
"bid-rigging" have gone on for decades, and indicated that the 
practice was at the expense of the public.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Tuesday [5 April] praised efforts by private financial 
institutions to liquidate their bad loans. 
  "I have a feeling that it got off to a steady start," Fujii 
said of the bad-loan liquidation at a regular press conference 
after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to results 
for the October-March second half of fiscal 1993 reported Monday 
by a debt-purchasing body established by financial institutions 
in January 1993. 
  Cooperative Debt Purchasing Co. said it bought 2.65 trillion 
yen worth of principal of bad loans, up 2.2 times from the 
previous fiscal half year. 
  Welcoming the steady move without relying on public funds, 
Fujii noted financial institutions are expected to have also 
liquidated such problem loans through other measures in their 
fiscal book closing last Thursday. He said the government must 
support their efforts by promoting tax, information and other 
programs included in the September economic stimulus package to 
facilitate liquidation of real estate held as collateral for the 
bad loans. 
  The debt-purchasing firm reported it managed to recover only 
27 billion yen, with 24 billion yen collected, of the bad loans 
it purchased by selling collateral real estate. 
  Concerning recent declines in stock prices, Fujii stressed 
the importance of steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen 
stimulus package to buoy the economy. The finance minister 
declined to comment as usual on stock movements but said he 
would "quietly watch." 
  He said cabinet ministers agreed at the morning meeting to 
place priority on united efforts to start Diet deliberations and 
enact the fiscal 1994 budget "as soon as possible."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's economy is 
gradually moving in a better direction, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Tuesday [5 April]. In 
view of remaining structural problems, it will be difficult for 
the economy to recover rapidly in the immediate future but there 
is no danger any longer of its plunging into a double-dip 
recession, Kumagai told a regular press conference. 
  Corporate capital spending is still slack but personal 
spending has begun "clearly" picking up, he said. 
  Kumagai said he expects auto sales to lead an expected 
economic recovery. March auto sales fell 3.7 percent from a 
year before -- but this was an improvement from an 8.4 percent 
drop in February. 
  Kumagai said a coming ministerial gathering in Marrakech, 
Morocco, for the signing of the global trade pact may provide 
"the best opportunity" to open the way for a breakthrough in the 
stalled trade talks with the United States. Ministers from 
Japan, the U.S. and other member countries of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will meet in Marrakech 
later this month to ratify the Uruguay Round pact concluded in 
December. 
  Kumagai said he has yet to decide whether or not he will go 
to Marrakech, citing a tight parliamentary schedule.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange 
reserves jumped 3.305 billion dollars in March to 101.737 
billion dollars, posting the fifth consecutive month-to-month 
increase, the Finance Ministry said Friday [1 April]. Market 
dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the Bank of Japan 
was seen selling the yen actively for dollars to stem its rise 
in the reporting month. 
  The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, 
gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. 
The March-end balance hit a record high, breaching a previous 
high of 100.36 billion dollars posted in April 1989. 
  The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and 
reasons for the change in the foreign reserves when briefing 
reporters. 
  Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign 
reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan, and 
dealers said the central bank bought some 3 billion dollars in 
March to stop the yen's rise. 
  The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 
104.70 yen and ended at 102.80 yen, ranging from 102.52 posted 
on March 30 to 106.58 yen marked on March 24. 
  Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign 
reserves 
for the fifth month in a row, amassing 96.0 billion dollars as 
of January, the most recent figure comparable with those of 
other nations. 
  Germany came in second with 85.7 billion dollars, followed 
by 
Taiwan with 84.8 billion dollars. The United States posted 74.9 
billion dollars in December, the latest available month. Spain 
marked 42.1 billion dollars in January.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's imports of 
manufactured goods increased by a strong 7.0 percent in 1993 
from the previous year to 125.2 billion dollars, accounting for 
a record high 52 percent of total imports in the year, a 
semiofficial organization said Monday [4 April]. 
  The import value represents a strong recovery from a 2.8 
percent contraction in 1992 and a mere 2.0 percent rise in 1991, 
the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) said. It 
attributed the recovery mainly to lower import prices due to the 
appreciation of the yen on foreign exchanges and increased 
consumer preference for low-priced goods amid the recession. 
  The organization said Japan's total imports in 1993 amounted 
to 240.7 billion dollars on a customs-cleared basis, up 3.3 
percent. 
  By item, imports increased strongly in telecommunication 
equipment, up 49.4 percent from the previous year, in electronic 
parts, up 33.0 percent, in office equipment, up 13.8 percent, 
and in precision instruments, up 11.4 percent. It also 
increased 15.9 percent in clothing, and almost doubled in 
plywoods, Jetro said. 
  On the other hand, imports declined in industrial machines, 
down 7.7 percent, and aircraft and related goods, down 3.7 
percent. 
  By country, manufactured goods imports from the United 
States 
increased 6.7 percent, compared with a year-on-year 5.3 percent 
contraction in the previous year, to 34.1 billion dollars. 
Those from China increased by 31.4 percent -- the third 
straight year with an increase of more than 30 percent -- to 
14.2 billion dollars. 
  Manufactured goods imports from the Association of South 
East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) also increased 23.9 percent to 10.7 
billion dollars. Imports from European Union nations declined 
4.0 percent to 25.6 billion dollars, following a drop of 2.7 
percent in 1992 and a fall of 10.9 percent in 1991, Jetro added.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's current account 
surplus in February increased 0.1 percent from a year earlier to 
11.94 billion dollars, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [5 
April]. It was the third straight gain from year-earlier levels 
after a drop in November. 
  The current account surplus, the net balance in the nation's 
trade in goods and services and some unilateral transfers like 
grant aid, was calculated before adjustment for seasonal 
factors, the ministry said in a preliminary report. 
  The merchandise trade surplus rose 2.5 percent in February 
from a year before to 12.93 billion dollars, the ministry said. 
  Exports increased 4.7 percent to 28.79 billion dollars, 
while 
imports grew 6.5 percent to 15.86 billion dollars. 
  The February current account figure followed January's 
year-to-year gain of 30.9 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Local private organizations 
have proposed mergers of nearby municipalities in a total of 91 
regions in Japan to promote broad administration, a survey said 
Monday [4 April]. But in a small number of cases the local 
governments have already started merger moves through legal 
procedures, leading the government to support them. 
  The survey conducted by KYODO News Service showed the local 
governments concerned with the proposed merger plans totaling 
120 cities, 310 towns and 50 villages -- about 15 percent of 
Japan's municipalities. 
  The Home Affairs Ministry is planning to back the proposals 
by extending and reinforcing a special law to help merging local 
governments, ministry officials said. The law which grants 
financial support to local governments after incorporation is 
realized will expire in March 1995. 
  Of the 91 regions, local governments in four regions have 
already put their merger plans on track. 
  The Katsuta city government and the Nakaminato city 
government in Ibaraki Prefecture, north of Tokyo, are expected 
to merge in October this year. 
  Also, officials of the local governments in eight regions 
have started considering how to administer their future broad 
governments after incorporation is achieved, the survey said. 
  The survey said 60 percent of plans recommended by private 
organizations, such as local chambers of commerce, envisage the 
incorporation of nearby towns and villages into each core city. 
Of these, 14 cities, including the northern Japanese cities of 
Morioka and Iwate, are likely to be designated as new core 
cities with over 300,000 residents under a new law expected to 
be enforced within this year. 
  Furthermore, municipalities surrounding ordinance-designated 
cities such as Sendai, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu and Fukuoka have 
visions of their being incorporated into those cities. 
  In Saitama, Gunma, Niigata and Shizuoka Prefectures, local 
governments are aiming at being promoted to ordinance-designated 
cities with their prefectural capitals as the center. There are 
11 ordinance-designated cities in Japan. 
  Most of the local governments polled said they are in favor 
of mergers because they think broad administration is expected 
to bring more efficiency to their jobs and help develop their 
regions faster. But some local governments, which have been 
proposed for incorporation into core cities nearby, expressed 
concerns over the possibility of deterioration in their public 
services after mergers. 
  There are 17 prefectures in which no merger plans have been 
proposed by the private sector, the survey said.

  [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has left 
Australia for Laos to start his Southeast Asian tour. The 
eight-day visit to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam is aimed at 
improving Australia's trade relationship and developing the 
vision that Mr. Keating sees of Australia forging closer ties 
with Asia. 
  Mr. Keating says human rights issues will be raised during 
his visit to Vietnam, but they will be within a set framework. 
He says, as a democracy, Australia will put its views clearly 
and forthrightly, but in the interests of maintaining 
relationship with Asian countries; therefore, the situation had 
to be seen from an overall point of view. 
  One of the high points of Mr. Keating's visit will be to 
hand 
over the Australian-constructed and funded Friendship Bridge 
linking Laos and Thailand over the Mekong River.

  [Text] CANBERRA, April 3 (AFP) -- Australian Defence 
Minister Robert Ray warned Sunday that North Korea would be a 
far more dangerous opponent than Iraq if the present nuclear 
crisis escalated into military conflict. 
  The United Nations Security Council last week called on 
North 
Korea to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities -- 
which it has so far refused. 
  Ray told Nine Network Australia that North Korea, suspected 
of developing nuclear weapons, was the most serious flashpoint 
in the world and he predicted the crisis would drag on for 
several months. 
  "The Koreans have given a variety of assurances with regard 
to their nuclear program, yet they will not allow proper 
inspection of those processes," Ray said. "Allied with the fact 
that they are trying to develop ballistic missiles, that is a 
very dangerous mix for countries such as Japan and South Korea." 
  He said North Korea had a very strong and competent standing 
army and would be a far more dangerous opponent than Iraq had 
been against the United States in the Gulf War. 
  "But one hopes it won't get to that situation, I doubt it 
will," Ray said, adding that China would have a key role in 
pressing North Korea to change its stand. 
  Asked whether Australian troops would become involved 
engaged 
if hostilties broke out between North Korea and its neighbours, 
Ray said "That depends on the circumstances at the time and it 
is a very hypothetical question. 
  "I have been asked it a few times in the past. I just won't 
answer it at this stage." 
  Ray said a conflict in the region had implications for 
Australia's security and economic interests, as "Japan and Korea 
are two of our biggest trading partners and they would be 
inevitably involved in any conflict in this particular region." 
  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans expressed optimism 
after meeting Chinese leaders in Beijing on Saturday that China 
would not block efforts to impose sanctions on North Korea if 
talks on the nuclear crisis broke down.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Editor Gerg Sheridan: "Moments of Truth"] </F>
  [Text] The most important triangle of power in the world 
for Australia is that between China, Japan and the United 
States, the three giants of the Asia-Pacific region, in many 
ways the three giants of the world. While military conflict 
seems very distant, the relationship between the three has not 
been worse, or more inherently unstable, for decades. 
  In China, a terrified Government awaits the death of the 
third communist emperor, Deng Xiaoping, and the almost 
inevitable and potentially destabilising power struggle to 
follow, even as it presides over astonishing economic growth and 
social transformation. 
  In Tokyo, a courageous but partly crippled Government is 
beset with rising corruption allegations as it struggles to 
implement economic liberalisation and political reform. 
  In Washington, an administration grappling with its own 
spiralling scandal management problems is weak before a 
protectionist and sectional Congress. President Bill Clinton, 
who has constantly avowed the overwhelming priority for domestic 
issues in his administration, has identified only two themes in 
foreign policy of any consequence -- the use of foreign trade to 
promote American jobs, and the international promotion of human 
rights. 
  The interaction of these priorities with Japan and China 
means the US now risks seriously destabilising China and its 
reform program, at almost incalculable risk to Australia and 
East Asia, as well as stalling the Japanese economy, corroding 
the practice of free trade and undermining the global 
rules-based trade system. In the end, the stakes are nothing 
less than war and peace, for a China bloodied by vicious 
American trade sanctions will be unpredictable at best, and if 
the US persists with its unreasonable abuse of Japan, a 
nationalist reaction there cannot be ruled out. Moreover, Japan 
could be forced to respond to Chinese instability. 
  Australia must try to pick its way through a chaotic and 
unpredictable clash of forces. The Keating Government has 
consistently opposed America's basic policy on Japan and China, 
with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, sitting 
calmly beside US Secretary of State Warren Christopher at their 
recent joint press conference in Canberra, and saying that 
threatening to withdraw most favoured nation [MFN] status from 
China was neither right in principle nor effective in practice. 
  But there is a deeper historical process at work here. The 
staggering economic growth of East Asia is challenging US global 
dominance in a way the one-dimensional military challenge of the 
Soviet Union never did. We are now in a pivotal phase in the 
development of the triangular relationship, a time when we can 
make some provisional judgments and identify some looming 
moments of truth. 
  It is now clear, for instance, that the completion of the 
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade did 
not signal a renewed American commitment to free trade. 
Instead, the US will take what benefits it can get from GATT 
and multilateralism, will also seek special-favour regional 
deals where possible especially in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, and will increasingly use its might to bludgeon 
bilateral concessions out of individual trade partners such as 
Japan. 
  Several crisis points are near. In June, the US will have to 
decide whether to renew China's MFN status. MFN is the normal 
trade status afforded to virtually everybody. Not renewing it 
would be a savage act, tantamount to an act of economic war. 
  Then in September, the provisions of the newly re-activated 
Super 301 trade legislation will come into play. Super 301 will 
allow the US to declare the Japanese unfair traders and take 
punitive trade sanction actions against them. 
  MFN in June, and Super 301 in September -- the US stands 
poised to take two of the most destructive, anti-free trade 
actions in its history, actions which could have devastating 
consequences for Australia. 
  How did it get to this ridiculous impasse? 
  With Japan, the US complaint is an old one, that Japan 
discriminates against imports through invisible trade barriers 
and this is why it runs a trade surplus with the US of nearly 
$US60 billion ($84.17 billion). The problem is the facts do not 
square with this analysis. Japan imports, per head, about the 
same value of products as many affluent West European countries. 
Moreover, Japan is already moving as rapidly as reasonably 
imaginable towards a more import-friendly and deregulated 
economy. According to a study by the East Asia Analytical Unit 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Japan's 
manufactured imports tripled between 1985 and 1991, rising to 
$US113 billion, and falling very slightly the next year because 
of Japan's recession. In recent years Japan's imports have 
reached as high as 8 per cent of its gross domestic product, 
compared with about 9.5 per cent for the US. The prospect for 
continued growth in imports is good. 
  The real story of the second half of the 1980s was America's 
declining market share in Japan. The US share of the Japanese 
market for manufactured imports fell from 35 per cent in 1985 to 
27 per cent in 1992. The big winners in the Japanese market in 
that period were China, South Korea, South East Asia and the 
European Community. A huge part of the US deficit with Japan is 
thus unquestionably caused by American lack of competitiveness. 
  US administration figures from Clinton to Christopher, and 
trade representative Mickey Kantor, say they are not trying to 
impose managed trade on Japan. They want Japan's markets opened 
up to all comers but they want this opening measured by 
conformity with numerical targets. 
  But as Australia's trade minister Senator Bob McMullan 
pointed out to Christopher, with all the political pressure 
coming from the US obviously Japan could be pushed into 
accommodating that pressure by giving special preference to the 
US against other suppliers such as Australia. 
  The US's rough-house tactics of threatened sanctions against 
Japan even led to the remarkable sight this week of the European 
Union coming to Japan's defence. The European trade 
commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said the US was being 
"discriminatory" in its policies towards Japan. He also raised 
the question of the US's hypocrisy concerning its own vast array 
of trade barriers. Brittan said Europe had "a very long list of 
US trade barriers" that it wanted the US to remove. He also 
said "Any attempt to force (Japanese) markets open through 
numerical targets risks above all being counterproductive as 
well as being incompatible with Europe and America's mutual 
commitment to free trade and multilateralism." American 
policy-makers should also know their actions have brought 
American prestige in Asia to an all-time low. There is not a 
single Asian opinion maker of consequence who considers the US's 
behaviour justified. Indeed, Japan is assuming heroic status 
for resisting "managed trade". Even Prime Minister Paul Keating 
congratulated former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa for 
resisting US pressure for managed trade. 
  It is clear the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT has 
done nothing to solve the US-Japan tension. Moreover, 
Australia's brave attempt to multilateralise the 
Tokyo-Washington problems by putting them in an Asia-Pacific 
Economic Co-operation [(APEC] context has also so far been 
unsuccessful, although APEC remains immensely constructive. But 
if the US is successful in its Super 301 harassment of Japan, it 
will undermine many of the gains won in the Uruguay Round. The 
GATT system cannot really function if the world's most powerful 
economy flouts its spirit and devotes increased attention to 
one-on-one deals where its huge size is most effective. 
  In this kind of a world, trade blocs and regional trade 
associations will flourish, as smaller nations seek to combine 
for protection against the US. With Australia a natural member 
of no significant trade bloc, our interests would be very hard 
to protect. 
  Even worse for us, and for the region, would be cutting off 
China's MFN status if it does not make substantial improvements 
in its human rights performance. China and Russia represent 
opposite models of giant nations making the transition out of 
communism. Russia chose democracy (glasnost) first, and economic 
restructuring (perestroika) second. As a result it is a 
shambles and its prospects remarkably poor. China went the 
other way, opening up its economy first while delaying political 
reform. As a result human freedom is increasing almost 
exponentially in China. It is the fastest growing economy in 
the world. In Guangzhou, in Shanghai, in Fujian, the authority 
of the central Government is weakening; regional and personal 
autonomy is growing. 
  There are two great threats -- a savage clampdown by the 
central Government or the breakdown of all coherent government 
authority and the emergence of chaos on a big scale. Removing 
MFN status makes both much likelier. If economic reform fails 
because of American trade sanctions the Chinese Government will 
have a chance of re-establishing legitimacy on the basis of 
fervid nationalism and anti-Americanism which most Chinese in 
such circumstances may well share. 
  Evans drew Christopher's attention to the damage that would 
be done to Hong Kong's economy by revoking China's MFN status. 
Similarly, Taiwan and other regional economies would suffer. At 
worst, the region could be dealing with millions of Chinese 
refugees because of American trade sanctions against China. 
  China today is at a unique moment in its history. For the 
first time tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of Chinese have a 
chance of escaping from the poverty and tyranny which has 
normally been their lot and making a transition into a modern 
economy (which would eventually produce a modern polity). 
Allegedly in the interests of human rights, Washington is 
prepared to jeopardise all that. 
  As Richard Solomon, the US assistant secretary of State for 
East Asia under George Bush said this week on US television: 
"Its illogical. Why? Because I think there's a general 
realisation there has been really dramatic improvement in the 
situation in China if one takes a 10 or 20-year perspective. 
Economic growth and the trade that's been a driving force 
behind that has been a real force for positive improvement. To 
threaten to pull MFN is to undercut one of our major sources of 
positive influence for improving the situation in China." 
  China has always resented being pushed around by the West. 
During Christopher's visit, its leaders made absolutely clear 
they will make no significant concessions to the US to secure 
MFN status. But if Clinton backs down on his MFN threat, he will 
look to a domestic US audience like a hypocrite and a wimp. As 
Solomon comments: "The administration has boxed itself in." 
Either Clinton will maintain his credibility domestically and 
cause havoc in China and East Asia, or he will give in. 
  The world may be very badly served by having a Democrat 
Congress and a Democrat President. Reagan and Bush governed in 
spite of Congress. As a result they were not afraid of taking 
Congress on, which is essential in foreign policy. Congress 
could have passed resolutions cancelling China's MFN status 
every day of the week and twice on Sundays and Bush would have 
vetoed every one. 
  But Clinton needs Congress. East Asia could easily be thrown 
into chaos in order to salvage the Clinton health plan, such are 
the complexities, and the absurdities, of the trade-offs between 
the Congress and the White House. 
  The final irony is that the success of both China and Japan 
is a consequence of earlier farsighted American foreign policy 
-- its benign administration of Japan after World War II and 
Richard Nixon's brilliant innovation in bringing China into the 
wider world in the 70s. But the quality of American leadership 
in those days was very different from today. While there is 
some indication that senior administration figures understand 
the extreme danger of their current Asian brinkmanship, and 
while fortunately no military rivalry is as yet involved, a 
stable relationship between the three giants of the Asia-Pacific 
looks a distant prospect.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Developing Links With Indonesia"] </F>
  [Text] Australia has an abiding interest in the economic 
success, social progress and regional leadership of Indonesia. 
Indeed, no country is more important to our national interests, 
as the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said when launching an 
Australia-Indonesia trade and cultural promotion in Sydney on 
Wednesday [16 March]. This is a political tenet that will 
become even more apparent as the Asia-Pacific region fulfills 
its economic potential. 
  Three of the world's four most populous nations -- China, 
India and Indonesia -- are in Asia. All three are involved in 
phases of unprecedented economic growth. Australia's challenge, 
as a democracy becoming more independent of its non-Asian 
traditions, is to develop ways to participate in this expansion 
and to benefit from it. Our success depends on enhancing our 
relations with nations about which many Australians still hold 
alien and fearful views. 
  In these terms Indonesia is integral to Australia's destiny. 
Bilateral relations have been rigorously tested over the years 
-- hardly surprising between two such disparate neighbours. 
There will be other difficult encounters in the future. As Mr 
Keating said, "We are different people with different cultures 
and different views on issues which matter to us." The strength 
of the relationship will depend on being able to manage those 
differences. The evidence is both sides are prepared to make 
the effort. 
  The political understanding between Canberra and Jakarta is 
perhaps sounder now than at any time since the first few years 
of Indonesian independence. Efforts to broaden mutual contacts 
are supported on both sides. Both nations are committed to the 
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation [APEC] forum as a vehicle for 
regional policy development -- with most APEC members 
considering Indonesia's leadership as fundamental to the group's 
success. On issues of defence, security and regional 
co-operation, such as the United Nations effort to restore 
peaceful government in Cambodia, Jakarta has been active and 
positive in its involvement. 
  At another important level, the governments of Queensland, 
Western Australia and the Northern Territory have shown 
initiative by developing extensive links with Indonesian 
regions. Two-way traffic in trade, education, defence and 
tourism is growing -- though it continues to be modest in terms 
of potential projections. 
  These developments have been largely guided by the advent in 
Jakarta of a regime that, while not democratic in the western 
tradition, can be characterised as moderate. The challenge 
inside Indonesia to liberalise the political system without a 
loss of national stability is also being faced in a positive 
way. The prospects for a smooth succession from the long reign 
of President Suharto appear good. The system is not as open as 
Australians are used to. But in the peculiarly Indonesian 
context of having to balance complex political, military and 
ethno-cultural allegiances it has been successful in raising 
living standards for most people, and in a relatively stable 
manner. 
  It would be wrong to raise expectations about the Australia- 
Indonesia relationship beyond what can be sustained. Our 
peoples and languages are and ever will be different. So are 
the values we admire in our respective societies. However, the 
relationship is gathering strength. Continuing efforts to 
remove misconceptions on both sides are needed. But thanks to 
the broadening of mutually beneficial contacts, there is less 
excuse for the relationship to be clouded by misunderstanding or 
ignorance.

  [Text] Thailand may hold talks with the United States on 
reducing import duties on foreign films during GATT meetings 
later this month in Morocco, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak said yesterday. He said Washington wants Thailand 
to reduce its import tariffs on foreign films even further than 
it already has. 
  Dr Suphachai said the US should not use the issue as another 
stick with which to beat Thailand. Washington already has 
Thailand on its Priority Watch List pending passage by the Thai 
Parliament of an improved copyright bill. Once that bill is 
passed, then Washington should take Thailand off the list, he 
said. 
  Dr Suphachai also said that the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade talks would focus on establishing the World Trade 
Organisation [WTO]. Thailand faces only one problem in its bid 
to become a founding member of the WTO -- a tax-collection 
system based on prices and conditions. 
  GATT wants Thailand to base its tax collection on price, and 
Dr Suphachai said Thailand would do so. 
  In a related development, Business Economics Department 
deputy director-general Khanitson Nawanukro said Thailand had 
finally agreed to offer greater tariff cuts on five products 
under GATT in a bid to end negotiations on market access for 
industrial and agricultural products at the Uruguay Round. 
  The cuts, which apparently are being offered in reply to 
demands by the United States and Canada, will set the bound rate 
on compressors at 30 percent, other wood at 10 percent, 
herbicides at 20 percent, film at five baht per metre and gems 
at 1 percent. In exchange for the tariff cuts, the department 
expects Thai exports to gain about 102.4 billion baht, or 74.3 
percent of the total value of industrial goods exported to the 
US in 1991. The offer would help reduce the tariff on 37.6 
billion baht in imports from the US, or 43.4 percent of the 
total in 1991. 
  He said Thailand also agreed not to collect specific tariff 
rates more than ad valorem rates, to cut taxes more in five 
categories for the US and Canada, and to try to conclude the 
negotiations with the two countries at the market-access talks 
of the Uruguay Round. 
  Several countries have protested against Thailand's 
tariff-cut offer. Thailand added specific tariff rates to its 
list submitted last December 15 and on February 15, while only 
ad valorem rates had been put on its list submitted in March and 
December 1992. 
  There are considerable differences between these two rates. 
Thailand's proposed deductions are considered invaluable because 
the country will get more protection and higher net import 
limits, so it agreed not to collect more specific tariff rates 
than ad valorem ones. 
  The US and New Zealand were the major GATT members that 
complained about the Thai offer of specific tariff rates. For 
example, the 50,250 kilogrammes of Kiwi fruit worth 3.9 million 
baht that was imported by Thailand in 1993 would have been 
charged 1.17 million baht in tariffs if based on the ad valorem 
rate of 25 percent. But the tariffs would have totalled 1.25 
million baht if based on the specific tariff rate of 25 baht a 
kg.

  [Text] The continuing dispute between the Government and 
the Opposition-plus-Senators has jeopardised the country's 
status in multinational trade talks, Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday. The political wrangling 
also sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] index below 1,200 
points to its lowest level in five months. Hard hit by 
political uncertainty coupled with unfavourable situations in 
foreign exchanges, the market lost 35.94 points or 2.92 percent 
to close at 1,196.59, the first time since October 27 that it 
had slipped below 1,200. 
  Dr Suphachai said the disagreements over the Constitution 
have nothing to do with the country's economy and despite 
political differences, various projects are still moving 
forward. However, the parliamentary infighting has a 
psychological impact on the economy. The international 
community is questioning whether the political situation would 
affect government policies, he said. 
  "We will have to explain to them that the current situation 
has nothing to do with the Government's policies, that means the 
Government will have to work hard to explain this to them," said 
Dr Suphachai. "In other words the Government will have to 
rebuild the credibility of the country." 
  He said that if the Constitution is not amended this time, 
it's not the end of the world; there will be time to try again. 
  "We should focus on developing our economy first. If the 
economy is well developed and the people have a better living 
standard, then they will pay attention to the amendment of the 
Constitution." 
  Amid rumours of possible dissolution of the House of 
Representatives, the SET index tumbled and analysts forecast it 
would decline further. 
  The investment mood yesterday was bearish from the 
beginning. 
The three worst performers in prices were: finance (down 4.38 
percent), commerce (down 3.46 percent) and banking (down 2.97 
percent). 
  Wichet Tantiwanit, marketing manager of TFB Asset Management 
Co, said investors were worried about possible dissolution of 
the House of Representatives. 
  Even if Prime Minister Chuan Likphai does not dissolve the 
Lower House, uncertainty would linger, he said. However, he 
suggested that dissolution would create positive hope of getting 
a new prime minister. Dissolution would also provide a clearer 
investment picture, but only in the short term only, Mr Wichet 
said. He said his firm had to slow down its plan to launch more 
funds for sale to the public because of prevailing bearishness. 
  Asia Securities Trading Co managing director Prathip 
Yongwanit admitted that foreign investors were now sellers of 
local stocks as they feared political uncertainty. He added 
that HG Asia in Hong Kong, which normally channelled foreign 
funds for investment on the SET through his firm, had sold out 
its holdings for the moment. 
  According to the SET, between March 28 and April 1, sales by 
foreigners of local stocks accounted for 27.86 percent of total 
sales by four parties including brokers' portfolios, local 
mutual funds, foreigners and local investors. Foreigners' 
bought stocks amounting to 16.56 percent. 
  Sa-ngat Sathapatthana, a director of Baring Research Ltd, 
said that rising overseas interest rates had also caused the 
bearishness. The Easter holidays also accounted for slim trading 
value. 
  He said the Lower House would definitely be dissolved -- 
it's 
just a matter of when. Mr Sa-ngat said it could be next month. 
  He added that foreign investors realise there would be no 
major change in local fiscal and monetary policies after 
dissolution since any finance minister normally listens to 
suggestions of his permanent secretary. 
  He forecast a further decline in the SET index since 
companies must pay corporate tax in May. However, Mr Sa-ngat 
suggested investors gradually buy into fundamentally sound 
stocks since the local economy's long-term prospects are good 
and exports are on the uptrend.

  [Text] China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) will establish two committees to strengthen their 
cooperation on economic/trade and science/technology, Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday. 
  He made the disclosure after emerging from an hour-long 
discussion with visiting Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tang 
Jiaxuan. The two ministers discussed a wide range of issues in 
both bilateral and regional aspects. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong reaffirmed to the Chinese 
envoy that Thailand would not invite Taiwan to the ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF) as Thailand strictly followed the "one 
China policy". 
  "I told the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister that China 
should 
not be worried about a report that Taiwan would join the ARF 
meeting because Taiwan is not regarded as a sovereign state," he 
said. 
  Thailand is scheduled in July to host the ARF where the six 
ASEAN countries and their seven dialogue partners, two 
consultative partners and three observers would talk about 
regional security issues. China holds a consultative status 
with ASEAN. 
  During yesterday's talk, Mr Jiaxuan mentioned that China did 
not think that any economic sanctions against North Korea would 
solve the problem on the Korean peninsula, a senior foreign 
minister official said. 
  Mr Jiaxuan earlier in the morning held the annual bilateral 
meeting with Permanent-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha 
Khunakasem.

  [Text] Metropolitan police have insisted that missing 
Russian diplomat Igor Makeyev has left Thailand after they were 
criticized for releasing the information to the press. 
  "The evidence I have received indicates that Igor has most 
probably left Thailand," said metropolitan police commissioner 
Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Chaiyasit Kanchanakit, 
who is overseeing the search for the Russian Embassy's missing 
third secretary. 
  Chaiyasit said deputy commissioner Pol Maj Gen [Police Major 
General] Thawi Thiprat, who is investigating the case, told him 
yesterday that Makeyev's credit card records confirm he had 
visited the Limelight Restaurant, in Bangkok's Patpong Road 
red-light district, and where he had been spotted with a friend 
Van Nappier [not further identified] on March 19. Chaiyasit had 
previously listed the date as March 23. According to Thawi, 
Nappier told police that Makeyev planned to go abroad, after 
first sending his family back to Russia. 
  A search of Makeyev's Soi Saladaeng apartment in Bangkok 
revealed that his wife and daughter had moved out, Thawi said. 
  "But police are checking with the Immigration Division for 
further evidence that Makeyev has left the country, when he did, 
by what airline and to what destination," he said. 
  Neither Makeyev nor his laptop computer have been seen since 
March 22.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by Ekkaphum Wittayayut: "Who's behind the </F>
bomb attacks in the Kingdom?"] 
  [Text] The sound of bomb blasts reverberating throughout 
the nation does not seem to be instilling fear into the hearts 
of the populace as might be expected. It appears they have 
become familiar with the situation and are nonchalant despite 
the bomb attacks recently made on the residences of the Interior 
Minister and an opposition party leader. An attack made 
recently on a locomotive traveling on the southern rail line 
only succeeded in terrorizing the train crew. 
  The people of the South have now become so familiar with the 
bombings that as opposed to feeling that they are living in the 
shadow of fear it is quite to the contrary. If there were no 
bombings it would be beyond the realms of normality. 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut seems unperturbed 
by the bomb attack directed at his home, saying he would not 
allow the attacks to intimidate him wherever they may occur. 
  Despite this statement, the bombings are a genuine cause of 
concern for Chuan Likphai's coalition government. No matter 
what group is responsible for the attacks, if they are allowed 
to continue unabated, they are bound to undermine the confidence 
of the people in the government's ability to maintain law and 
order. 
  If apathy is allowed to set in, when considering the 
attitudes of the citizens of the country and the government to 
the bombings, there would seem to be little hope of locating 
those responsible and stamping out the attacks for good. 
  One confounding factor in the bombing issue is that the 
identity of the group responsible for the attacks is unknown and 
no demands have been made. At this time the attacks would seem 
to be pointless. 
  It is possible that Gen Chawalit believes he has received 
up-to- date information from his advisers on the issue but there 
is one point he may have failed to consider. 
  The group responsible for the bombings may be politically 
motivated with an ultimate intention of causing political chaos 
and disruption in the nation. Recent reports that foreign 
terrorist groups planned to attack the Israeli embassy in 
Bangkok were probably unconnected to the bombing incidents that 
have already been carried out in the capital, as attacks on 
local politician's homes are unlikely to gain anything for 
Middle Eastern terrorist groups, who would seem to be the most 
likely perpetrators of any such attack on the embassy. 
  Let's consider the probable intentions of the group 
responsible for the bombings: 
  A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the 
country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry 
out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to 
maintain stability. 
  To increase pressure on the government at a time when 
parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look 
incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible 
this could lead to the dissolution of parliament. 
  Prior political forces in the country might be able to 
return 
to power in this way. If the government is left alone to carry 
out its duties unhindered, the chances of any forces of the past 
returning to power would diminish. 
  Some observers say the planting of the bombs can clearly be 
seen as the dying throes of a spent political force but these 
are few and far between. 
  They can be narrowed down into two categories -- democratic 
and dictatorial. 
  Democratic political parties, or those who profess to be, 
come in several forms. Power swings to and fro depending on the 
opinions of the electorate during general elections. 
  Before the formation of the National Peace Keeping Council 
(NPKC), the Chatchai administration maintained a grip on power. 
  Coming from self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom to 
successfully defend himself against allegations of corruption, 
former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan's Chat Thai Party 
failed to get reelected in the last general election. Chat Thai 
have now been relegated to assume the role of opposition party, 
but are eagerly waiting in the wings for a final banana skin to 
bring down the government for good. All the opposition parties 
will have an opportunity to return to power, courtesy of the 
democracy system which necessitates the holding of free general 
elections. 
  Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts 
to 
pressure the government. Their use of criticism during 
parliamentary sessions is usually adequate. 
  Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the 
suspicions 
of those investigating the bombings. 
  Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of 
political power are the most deserving for the focus of 
suspicion as they have the most to gain. 
  With the democracy system now firmly in place they are 
unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their 
only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of 
creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to 
seize power again. 
  It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace 
those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an 
impression of competence. 
  The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a 
good place to begin investigations although some observers have 
said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks. 
  Does Gen Chawalit know who the culprits are?

  [Text] Terrorist bombings could not destabilize the 
government, police chief Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday, 
while admitting that the government's intelligence gathering 
ability is weak. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had tightened 
security along southern rail roads after the recent bomb which 
derailed a train. Police patrolled around the clock in certain 
areas. 
  Last week, a passenger train that left Hat Yai for the 
southern border town of Sungai Kolok detonated a bomb under the 
tracks, derailing 14 carriages and injuring 10 people. 
  Asked if the incident was aimed at ousting the government, 
Prathin said the government could not be removed because it was 
elected by the people. The government had done nothing wrong 
and was not involved in corruption. 
  "Those who want to oust the government by bombing are 
fools," 
he said. 
  He said the bombing was intended to create a disturbance. It 
was the work of the people with mental problems. 
  Prathin admitted that the country's intelligence service was 
ineffective. He had been told about the matter on several 
occasions, and found that it was true after he was appointed 
police director general. 
  Officers had not seriously performed their duty. They would 
try hard only when there was an incident. However, the 
intelligence had been improved, he said. 
  Prathin said police had done their best to provide security 
for people's lives and property. However, some acts of 
terrorism were impossible to prevent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Kitti Rattanachaya, </F>
commander of the Fourth Army Region, by Amonrat Mongkhonchat; 
place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Amonrat] There has been a series of bomb explosions 
in the southern region. In your opinion, who is behind the 
attacks. 
  [Kitti] Initial investigations suggest that those who were 
behind the 1992 bomb explosion in Hat Yai might have been 
involved in the recent incidents. Judging from their tactics, 
it is likely that they are from the same group, possibly allies 
of the Pulo (Patani United Liberation Organization). I've 
discussed the matter with Police chief Prathin (Santipraphop) 
and a working group was jointly formed (by the military and 
police) to investigate. 
  [Amonrat] Is it true, then, that the Fourth Army Region has 
not coordinated with the Police Department well. 
  [Kitti] It isn't a matter of good or bad coordination. Bomb 
explosions concern public security and that's the direct 
responsibility of the police. The military's role is simply to 
support the police. 
  [Amonrat] Does that mean that it was the police's fault in 
failing to solve the cases. 
  [Kitti] Police have failed to complete investigations into 
various cases. The military has proposed that they improve their 
intelligence network. 
  [Amonrat] What has disrupted police investigations. 
  [Kitti] Perhaps they have so much work to do that it's hard 
for them to concentrate on particular cases. Often, they fail 
to follow up those cases, especially when the public stops 
paying attention. So we'd like to propose that police form 
special investigation teams to follow up on the cases, no matter 
how long they take to complete. 
  [Amonrat] A few days ago, you put the blame on police and 
provincial governors for failing to perform their duties 
satisfactorily to curb violence. 
  [Kitti] I didn't mean that they don't perform 
satisfactorily. 
What I meant was their roles and duties are not clear enough. 
Whenever any violence takes place, we've got to know who -- the 
military or police -- should oversee the investigation. In the 
South, the military has played a supporting role. If the 
Internal Peacekeeping Act had not been abolished, the military 
would be authorized to take some action. 
  [Amonrat] Many people say that the military is trying to 
evade responsibility. 
  [Kitti] That is not true. I've been assigned by the prime 
minister to coordinate police and I still do it. 
  [Amonrat] Do you think the recent violence occurred because 
those who have lost power want to disturb the public. 
  [Kitti] Yes, it's a public disturbance, but not by those who 
have lost power. It is the direct responsibility of the 
Interior Ministry and the Police Department to avert such 
incidents. We in the military are ready to provide full 
assistance if they ask for it. We have to comply with the law; 
we don't have authority as they do. 
  [Amonrat] Do you want to see the re-enactment of the 
Internal 
Peacekeeping Act. 
  [Kitti] No, not at all. The Criminal Code is enough at 
present. The important thing is that the authorities should 
work more efficiently. The military is ready to coordinate. 
  [Amonrat] It seems that the Fourth Army Region would be 
blamed in the end if those behind the bomb attacks in the South 
were not arrested. 
  [Kitti] That's right. The military has been seen as so 
powerful in the past that it could form governments. However 
during the May crisis, the military could hardly find a place to 
live. If you were in my position as an army region commander, 
you would be upset. 
  [Amonrat] What is the military's policy to help police 
oversee public security. 
  [Kitti] We've got a clear-cut policy to coordinate with 
police. We are assigned to maintain security in the South. In 
the past three years, before the schools were torched last 
August, we were quite successful in overseeing peace and order. 
The situation got out of control because the Fourth Army Region 
commander doesn't have enough authority to handle the problems. 
After the prime minister empowered the military to coordinate, 
we were able to work satisfactorily, up to a certain level, 
before the occurrence of the recent bomb attacks. 
  [Amonrat] Are you upset about the various violent incidents 
in the South. 
  [Kitti] Certainly. All people concerned should seriously try 
to solve the problem. If that is the case, we would finally be 
able to maintain public security.

<F P=106> [From the "First Opinion" column by Ricardo Malay: "Birth </F>
of the Leftist Third Force"] 
  [Text] There were no cheers nor happy faces when Siglaya 
was unveiled as the newest and third formation to grace the 
political landscape of the Left. Its antecedents are, of 
course, the venerable CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] 
and the revisionist Forte factions, better known as the 
reaffirmists and the rejectionists, respectively. 
  The long faces at Siglaya's birth announcement could be the 
result of pondering the shaky future that the Philippine Left 
faces. The orthodox CPP leadership is in exile in Europe, its 
chairman-guru forever lecturing on the relevance of Maoism to 
the "Urgent Tasks" to his coterie of supporters who have seen 
the practicality of pitching camp in the Netherlands. 
  The second block, headed by Felimon Lagman (who uses Carlos 
Forte as a nom de guerre), may have seceded from CPP and 
recruited two or three regional party groups and individual 
party members to its "Urban Insurrection" cause. Yet no sparks 
have been flying from Forte's camp except for an ABB [Alex 
Boncayao Brigade] operation that resulted in the gunning down of 
same small-time miscreants. 
  Siglaya's leaders made it clear that they do not subscribe 
to 
armed struggle in pursuing their vision of "human liberation." 
Since it acknowledges that it's still in its infantile stages, 
Siglaya has yet to spell out its charter. Is it influenced by 
Marxism, by social democracy, by environmentalism? 
  The leading lights of the movement were only recently 
members 
of CPP. Hence, they are familiar with "democratic centralism," 
"proletarian dictatorship" and other practices which governed 
the lives of Marxist revolutionaries. 
  These theories were great when the party was united and 
growing in strength against an enemy that didn't hesitate to use 
fascist methods -- such as the Marcos dictatorship. Never had 
iron discipline been a great welder of party unity. 
  Of the three currents in the Philippine Left, Siglaya 
appears 
to be the moderate option. It steers clear of revolutionary 
rhetoric and speaks of the "hopes and dreams of our people," and 
being open to "changing realities and new ideas," and a manner 
that is "empowering and democratic." 
  In a word, it is fed up with tyranny, double-talk, 
rural-mindedness, impetuosity, infantile disorder and coercion. 
Although a proletarian party is expected to uproot these 
poisonous weeds, in practice the reverse is more likely to 
happen. 
  When Lagman allowed himself to be interviewed by a TV 
reporter, he mouthed hackneyed phrases taken from the works of 
Marx, Lenin and Mao. He had nothing new to say, except that his 
Manila-Rizal group was seceding from the CPP of Joma [Jose 
Maria] Sison due to differences in "line and ideology." Some 
differences. In a dramatic bid to dust up its image, his Alex 
Boncayao Brigade (ABB) swore to dispense revolutionary justice 
by executing corrupt officials and heinous criminals. 
  The ABB could only score minor hits but none of the big fish 
it promised. Meanwhile the Manila-Rizal group is languishing in 
inactivity. Its ideological leader is none other than Lagman 
who cannot talk without quoting from the revered names of the 
revolution. 
  Lagman's group has no prospect but extinction. It is in a 
muddled mess, neither having an agenda nor a steady source of 
financial support. As the latter crumbles, the group acquires 
two options: One is to apply for amnesty and start off on a 
different foot as peaceful reformists, and the other is to 
resort to "economic struggles," that is, robbing banks and 
extorting from businesses and rich people. Should the second 
option be preferable, the urban insurrectionists will be seen as 
the new lumpen proletariats of a new age. 
  The CCP [as published], in contrast to Lagman's group, has 
had a charmed life. Even if the party organization and NPA [New 
People's Army] units loyal to it gradually shrivels up, the 
leadership remains intact in Europe. 
  It is possible that Sison, in 1987, foresaw the decline and 
ebb tide of the revolution. Touring Europe at the time and 
proffered sage advice by Louie Jalandoni, he concluded that 
Europe offered him more space and security to inspire, direct 
and orchestrate the revolution than if he were to return to the 
Philippines. 
  Besides, the Europeans would be a perfect audience for the 
CPP founder whose "original" views made him a candidate (along 
with Abimael Guzman) for the "Revolution's Fourth Sword." In 
view of Guzman's capture and conciliatory statements attributed 
to him, Sison, according to his Filipino and European followers, 
has won the moral right to be crowned the "Fourth Sword." The 
three other swords are Marx, Lenin and Mao. 
  It is not known how Guzman will take these developments. 
Although the Peruvian has a whole continent of revolutionaries 
to ratchet him up, Sison has the militant Utrecht community and 
a portion of Belgium backstopping him in this epochal showdown.

  [Text] Bacolod City -- Reports about the emergence of a 
third faction in the rebel movement have yet to be confirmed 
because there are no concrete indications that another breakaway 
group is existing. 
  But Lt. Col. Marcos Ibanez, civil military operations 
officer 
of the Negros Island Command, said that "if it is true, then it 
is an indication that the rebel movement continues to weaken." 
  Ibanez said the emergence of another faction will be 
advantageous to the government. 
  It will also be good for the peace talks initiated by the 
government.

  [Text] Fort Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- New People's Army 
(NPA) rebel stragglers are intensifying terroristic acts against 
civilians as part of a last ditch propaganda campaign to show a 
still active presence of a rebel movement now in its dying 
throes, military authorities said yesterday. 
  Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Army 2d Infantry Division 
commanding general, said that last week alone, small teams of 
communist guerrilla terrorists attacked several groups of 
civilians in mountain barangays [villages] in three provinces. 
  In Barangay Casay, Lupi, Camarines Sur, last 24 March, 
rebels 
fired a grenade from an M-203 launcher at a "pulong-pulong" 
[gathering] of residents who were planning a livelihood project 
in cooperation with the military. A barangay captain, a woman 
and her seven-year-old son were wounded during the attack while 
scores of other residents were injured in the stampede for 
safety. 
  In a resettlement area in Barangay Caldon, Sampaloc, Quezon, 
three suspected NPA rebels sprayed another gathering of 
civilians, wounding a resident identified only as a certain 
"Boy" of the barangay last 20 March. 
  Last 25 March, at Barangay Salipsip, Polilio, Quezon, rebels 
fired on a house during a heavy rainfall. 
  Elements of the 236 PNP [Philippine National Police] Mobile 
Force who had taken cover from the rain in the house fired back 
at the rebels and a firefight that lasted for about 30 minutes 
ensued. 
  Residents said that three dead rebels were carried away by 
their companions when they escaped and policemen recovered from 
the encounter scene one M16 Armalite rifle.

<F P=106> [By An Hui-chang from the "News Behind the News" column] </F>
  [Text] With the people's criticism of the government's 
diplomatic policy regarding the North Korean nuclear issue which 
has been in a state of confusion, the National Unification Board 
[NUB] expressed strong displeasure over the remarks of Vice 
Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong suggesting withdrawal of the 
condition for an "envoy exchange first." 
  In a regular Monday morning meeting on 4 April, Yi Yong-tok, 
deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, said: While the 
government has coped effectively with the North Korean issue 
ever since it declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty by relegating work to each relevant 
office, people with less training have erred. 
  Thus, he expressed his displeasure as head of the diplomatic 
and security team. 
  Concerning the phrase "people with less training" mentioned 
by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, a relevant official at the NUB said 
that this phrase refers to Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK Ambassador to 
the PRC, who invoked public criticism for raising the "untimely 
theory of attaching importance to China," and to Vice Foreign 
Minister Hong, who revealed a readiness to "withdraw" the 
condition of "envoy exchange first" during a recent debate with 
National Assemblymen.

  [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea sent a letter 
to the United States in late March, saying it is willing to 
accept further inspection of its nuclear sites by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if the U.S. withdraws 
a precondition of exchanging special envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang, a senior government official here said on Tuesday. 
  Washington has called on North Korea to exchange special 
envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang as a precondition to resume a 
third round high-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea. 
  North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu sent the 
letter to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, 
the official said. 
  Both Kang and Gallucci are chief negotiators of North Korea 
and the U.S., respectively, at the high-level talks between 
North Korea and the U.S. 
  The U.S. Government informed South Korean Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu of the North Korean proposal, who visited the U.S. 
recently, and Han and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher 
discussed the matter, but gained no conclusion, the official 
said.

  [Text] Pochon, South Korea, April 5 (YONHAP) -- President 
Kim Yong-sam said on Tuesday that four neighboring countries -- 
the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- will not make any 
decision related to North Korea's nuclear problem without 
consultation with South Korea and that every clause of the 
United Nations Security Council president's statement to North 
Korea on March 31 was drawn up after close consultation with 
South Korea. 
  Kim, who is visiting Pochon, northeast of Seoul, to plant 
trees, had a lunch with officials of the Forestry Administration 
and local administrations, saying "the four neighboring 
countries decided to divide the Korean peninsula in the past 
without considering the will of the Korean people, but now these 
countries are consulting with us on all matters related to the 
Korean peninsula." 
  "China considers South Korea as an important partner in many 
respects and Russia becomes an important country to have good 
ties with us," Kim said.

  [Text] Pusan, April 4 (YONHAP) -- A nationwide group of 
university student activists has decided that improving 
relations between North Korea and the United States, rather than 
putting pressure on Pyongyang, holds the key to breaking the 
nuclear impasse. 
  The decision was made at a meeting of the Korea Federation 
of 
University Student Unions (Hanchongnyon), called to set a course 
of action for unification and other political "struggles" this 
year. 
  Hanchongnyon, led by its Chairman Kim Hyon-chun of Pusan 
University, said that the North has adopted a flexible and firm 
strategy and "efficiently destroyed a scheme by the United 
States and imperialists to isolate North Korea despite adverse 
international conditions against it since announcing its 
intention to leave the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty." 
  "It appears that North Korea could get a firm reply from the 
United States for the improvement of relations (with Washington) 
and receive (U.S.) assistance including light-water nuclear 
reactors," it said. "Such a resolution (of the nuclear problem) 
means normalization of U.S.-North Korean ties," it said. 
  Hanchongnyon's statement is being read as an indication that 
leftist student activists intend to adopt the "anti-U.S., 
pro-North Korean policy" of past student movements despite the 
recent threat of war by Pyongyang.

Sung-chu briefed President Kim Yong-sam Tuesday on the results 
of his trips to the United States and Japan. 
  Han flew directly to Washington from Beijing after 
accompanying President Kim on a state visit to China, briefing 
U.S. officials on the outcome of Kim's summit with Chinese 
leaders and discussions on the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
  The foreign minister was at the United Nations for 
negotiations when the Security Council approved a presidential 
statement demanding that North Korea allow further international 
nuclear inspections. 
  Han is said to have told President Kim about 
Seoul-Washington 
discussions on what to do about the joint military exercise 
"Team Spirit" this year and their future road map in dealing 
with Pyongyang. 
  Officials said Kim emphasized the importance of the 
coordination channel among South Korea, Japan and the United 
States and the need for a peaceful solution to the nuclear 
problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Yu Yong-won] </F>
  [Text] As tension is heightening due to the North Korean 
nuclear issue, there is growing concern over an attack by North 
Korea's Scud B and Nodong No. 1 missiles. 
  Even though the United States plans to deploy Patriot 
missiles to the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK in April, 
questions are being raised regarding the capability of 
effectively destroying North Korea's ground-to-ground missiles. 
  As if he had sensed the anxiety, Minister of National 
Defense 
Yi Pyong-tae gave a relatively detailed explanation on 
countermeasures against a Scud and Nodong No. 1 attack to the 
Standing Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March. 
  Minister Yi explained that once the Scud is launched, its 
camouflaged camp would be exposed. It would take more than two 
and a half hours to move to another camp and prepare for a 
second launching. Therefore, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces could 
locate the launcher through its surveillance system and 
immediately attack the launcher with Air Force fire power, 
special combat units, and guided missiles. 
  Minister Yi admitted there is a limit to this strategy 
because after the first Scud or Nodong No. 1 is launched, only a 
passive defense using the Patriot is possible and a preemptive 
attack is not possible. The Scud launcher loaded on a big 
vehicle must be moved to another place once it launches a 
missile to prevent an attack by its opponent. 
  Therefore, the only way for the ROK and U.S. Forces to 
repulse the first Scud attack is to identify its location using 
the U.S. ultra-red ray detective intelligence satellite right 
after the launching and intercept the missile with a Patriot. 
  After the first Scud launching, the hide-and-seek game 
between the Scud launcher vehicle and the ROK-U.S. Combined 
Force's Scud-hunting vehicle begins. While the Scud launcher is 
moved and preparing for the second attack, the ROK-U.S. Forces 
will begin the search using the U.S. intelligence satellite and 
various kinds of aerial surveillance devices, including the E8 
and E3C, which are able to detect the movement of ground 
vehicles from the air. 
  The weakest point of the Scud is that it requires more than 
two and a half hours to refuel and prepare for the second 
launching. 
  Military officials believe that considering the ROK-U.S. 
Forces' intelligence capability, it will be possible to discover 
the launcher before the second launching. 
  It is easy to destroy the Scud launcher once it is 
discovered. An air attack by fighter-bombers and Apache 
helicopters, or bombing by infiltrated special units are 
possible. 
  The "Scud hunting system" was designed during the Gulf war 
in 
1991. The United States had overlooked the threat of Iraqi 
Scuds and later had difficulties destroying them after civilian 
damage had increased. Considering North Korea's hilly terrain, 
which provides more cover than deserts, most specialists view 
that the Scud hunting will be more difficult than during the 
Gulf war. 
  Military officials stressed that although the Scud and 
Nodong 
No. 1 pose a great threat, militarily, they are less a threat 
than multiple rockets and fighter-bombers. 
  The Scud has low accuracy -- sometimes it lands 1 km away 
from the target -- and its warhead weighs only 660 kg -- less 
than the total weight of bombs carried by one average 
fighter-bomber. 
  Considering that ground-to-ground missiles such as the Scud 
had substantial effect in actual combat, including the 
psychological effect by attacks on big cities, some military 
officials pointed out that better full-scale countermeasures 
against the Scud should be developed in case North Korea attacks 
Seoul.

  [Text] It has been learned that the war capacity of the 
ROK forces, including the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK, is 
71 percent of that of North Korea, and a simulated war scenario 
has come to a conclusion that in the event North Korea commits a 
full- scale southward aggression, ROK forces are capable of 
defending themselves for 10 days after the commencement of a war 
without additional U.S. troops. 
  Attending a forum of ruling and opposition party lawmakers 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue held at Academy House 
in Suyuri, Seoul, Chong In-kyun, president of the Defense 
Research Institute explained countermeasure scenarios against 
aggression by North Korea. He said, "However, approximately 
350,000-strong reinforcement troops must be quickly deployed 
after 10 days. The ROK and the United States have discussed a 
deployment plan for immediate deterrence troops using the early 
warning system to complement such weaknesses." 
  President Chong also said, "The immediate deterrent troops 
will be Navy and Air Force troops in the initial stage. Four 
hundred to 500 ultra-modern Air Force planes can take off from 
U.S. bases in Japan to secure air supremacy within three days 
after the commencement of the war. A carrier-based naval force 
can also be deployed within a week. A substantial reinforcement 
of ground forces could take one to two months but the airborne 
forces and marine brigade should be deployed sooner." 
  Regarding the assumed damage in the first 10 days after the 
commencement of the war, President Chong estimated: "The 
friendly forces will lose 15 percent of the front forces and the 
aggressor forces will lose 20 percent of the committed forces." 
  President Chong added: "Even if North Korea had nuclear 
weapons, it would never use them unless it is determined to 
cause common destruction. The 1,000-tonnes of biochemical 
weapons are more of a threat than nuclear weapons."

  [Text] Amidst some doubts abroad about the transfer of 
power, North Korean leader Kim Il-song has been praising up his 
eldest son and heir-apparent, Chong-il, for his "simplicity and 
frugality." 
  In the latest issue of NODONG SINMUN, the Workers' 
(Communist) Party organ, the senior Kim was quoted as saying 
that he felt a lump in his throat whenever he saw the junior Kim 
wearing a plain jacket and that people should lead a plain 
lifestyle like him. 
  Kim also said that Comrade Kim Chong-il does not care much 
to 
appear in the limelight, as he thinks all he has to do is to 
give devoted servitude to the people and the nation. 
  Earlier, the senior Kim also told the party rank and file 
that Kim Chong-il was "the people's leader" fit to succeed him. 
  In a letter to a national conference of "party cell 
secretaries" which opened in Pyongyang March 31, the North 
Korean top leader said that the cause of the party was 
"honorably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as 
the people's leader," according to the Korean Central 
Broadcasting Station.

  [Text] The ubiquitous badge featuring North Korean 
President Kim Il-song has disappeared from the lapels of North 
Korean officials attending international conferences, fueling 
speculation as to what the development signifies. 
  Rep. Pak Chong-su, who led a South Korean delegation to the 
91st International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Paris, 
said last week he noticed that all nine members of the North 
Korean delegation were not wearing the Kim Il-song badge. 
  In addition, all six North Korean representatives at a Paris 
meeting of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural 
Organization (Unesco) did not wear the badge, according to Pak. 
  The absence of the badge, the symbol of Kim Il-song's 
"chuche 
(self-reliance)" ideology, is drawing attention because all 
North Korean officials had until recently worn one as though it 
were a bodily appendage, Pak said. 
  "It is a big change, considering the rigidity and 
inflexibility of North Korean regime and society," Pak said. 
  Pak speculated that North Korea's leaders may be preparing 
"a 
grace period" during a transition of power from Kim Il-song to 
his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] The government plans to send a team to China this 
month to look into the allegedly desperate state of North 
Koreans roaming around the country after slipping out of North 
Korea. 
  The move follows reports that not a small number of North 
Koreans live in fear of being caught and sent back to North 
Korea. 
  And North Korean agents are said to be on their trail. 
  They are not protected by the Chinese authorities because of 
an extradition pact between Beijing and Pyongyang. 
  According to recent press reports, it is estimated that the 
number of North Koreans in this pathetic state comes to a few 
thousands. 
  Most of them left North Korea to escape abject poverty. 
  Some of them carry poison to put an end to their own lives 
in 
case of arrest because this means an outright deportation and 
subsequent capital punishment in North Korea. 
  Meantime, the National Assembly has decided to send a 
parliamentary team to Russia to help with the fate of North 
Korean loggers who deserted the logging camps run by North Korea 
in Siberia. 
  They are also roaming around in Russia, hoping to escape the 
reach of North Korea. Most of them are learned to be seeking 
shelter in South Korea. 
  The South Korean government is studying ways of accepting 
them because the Russian authorities are said to be ready to 
help them leave Russia for South Korea. 
  But the situation is said to be a little different for the 
North Koreans hiding in China because of the still strong ties 
between Beijing and Pyongyang. 
  Notwithstanding, the government cannot turn its eyes away 
from the terminal situation where the North Koreans find 
themselves in, government officials said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Pak Song-yong] </F>
  [Text] In February, a letter from G. Toloraya, Russian 
minister and deputy chief of mission in Seoul was delivered to 
THE KOREA TIMES. It was about North Korean escapees from 
logging camps in Siberia. In the letter, he said, "It is up to 
the government of the Republic of Korea to determine whether to 
accept them as refugees or not," apparently tossing the ball 
into Seoul's court. 
  "The escapees are free to go to South Korea. And needless to 
say, the Russian authorities do not restrict or prevent foreign 
nationals from exercising their rights, including the right of 
political asylum," he continued. 
  According to government sources, hundreds of North Korean 
have escaped from logging camps in Siberia notorious for their 
substandard working conditions. Since their escapes from what 
are often dubbed "concentration camps," they have been wandering 
around in Russia seeking settlement there or defection to South 
Korea. 
  Currently, an estimated 15,000 to 25,000 North Koreans are 
working at 16 logging camps in Russia, which are run by the 
Pyongyang government under a contract with the Russian 
government. And recently the number of North Korean escapees 
from North Korea into China is also reported to have been on a 
sharp increase. 
  News reports say that about 1,000 to 2,000 North Koreans 
have 
fled into China but exact number is hard to determine because 
they are hiding from North Korean intelligent authorities' 
manhunts. A rumor has even been spreading in the Korean 
autonomous prefecture in Yanbian, China that North Korean 
escapees have set up "Korean villages" in the deep forests 
there. "Because of the severe food shortage in Hamkyong and 
Yangso provinces in North Korea, it is common for residents 
there to cross the border after getting travel permits to secure 
food, and many of them don't go back to their hometowns," said a 
ranking government official. 
  The North Korean escapees in Russia and China are not 
"protected." Under the Convention and the Protocol Relating to 
the Status of Refugees, escapees from logging camps have the 
right to escape to Russia or third countries and if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, they can appeal to the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees [UNHCR]. 
  The Seoul government has asked the UNHCR for help and 
discussion with the Russian government to solve the problem is 
underway. But the protocol faces an apparent limitation. And 
the government also fears it could provoke North Korea at this 
time when the tension between the two sides is extremely high 
because of the nuclear issue. 
  The state of the North Koreans who have escaped to China is 
worse because the Beijing government has not signed the 
convention or the protocol on refugees and it has an extradition 
pact with the Pyongyang government. The Chinese authorities 
repatriate North Korean escapees, regarding them as criminals 
who have violated the immigration law. 
  There are lots of "political problems" in South Korea 
getting 
Chinese help in solving the "humanitarian" issue. Meantime, the 
government plans to send a fact-finding team to China this 
month, hoping to find a solution in the interest of the 
desperate North Koreans. Besides this, a parliamentary team is 
to visit Moscow in order to help the roaming loggers come to 
South Korea if they so wish. 
  The move follows public outcries that the government should 
not turn its eyes away from the desperate situation of Koreans 
on the ground that the humanitarian value is universal, 
overriding political considerations. In a recent meeting of a 
panel of the National Assembly, lawmakers lambasted the 
government for not taking any action for the Korean wanderers. 
They demanded that the government should be resolute in helping 
the Koreans even at the expense of hurting North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme People's 
Assembly of North Korea will meet Wednesday [6 April] amid 
rising tensions after the United Nations Security Council issued 
a presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow further 
inspection of its nuclear sites. 
  The seventh meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly, 
a 
two-day affair, is likely to express its position on the 
council's presidential statement, South Korean Government 
officials said Tuesday. 
  The North's chief constitutional organization will also 
issue 
statements on the country's nuclear and foreign policies, they 
said. 
  "We expect the Supreme People's Assembly to stick to the 
North Korean Government's hard-line policy of rejecting further 
inspection of their nuclear sites rather than complying with the 
Security Council's warning," said an official. 
  The prediction was based on a North Korean Foreign Ministry 
statement issued Monday that Pyongyang would resume "peaceful 
nuclear activities" if the international community continued to 
apply pressure. 
  "It is not likely that Kim Il-song will take measures to 
transfer power to his heir-apparent Kim Chong-il during the 
upcoming assembly meeting," the official added. 
  As the top constitutional body of North Korea, the Supreme 
People's Assembly has the authority to elect and impeach party 
and government officials including the state president, craft 
government policies and approve the state budget.

  [Text] Opposition lawmakers yesterday alleged that South 
Korea has bowed to U.S. pressure and has agreed to further lower 
import tariff rates on 33 American farm products from the 
current 40 percent to 20 percent on average. During a session of 
the National Assembly agriculture committee, two Democratic 
Party (DP) lawmakers said the agreement was included in the 
"side letter" between the two countries with regard to 
modification of the nation's final schedule of tariff 
concessions in the farming sector. 
  Citing a report on tariffs on agreed items between Korea and 
the United States submitted by the Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Ministry to the Assembly committee, Reps. Yi Kil-chae 
and Yi Kyu- taek insisted that the Seoul government made 
considerable tariff concessions to the United States on major 
agricultural items through the side letter. 
  Among the 33 items dropped in the agreement are wheat, corn 
chips, sweet corn and almonds. For example, they said, tariff 
rates on wheat will be lowered from the current 10 percent to 3 
percent. 
  Rep. Yi contended that the nation's farming industry is 
expected to be dealt a serious blow by an influx of American 
farming goods in the wake of a sharp reduction of tariffs. 
  Rep. Yi urged the government to make public the full 
contents 
of the side letter, saying that there is a possibility that the 
two countries might have made another secret agreement. 
  Another DP lawmaker Kim Yong-chin charged that the 
government 
failed to keep its promise not to revise the final country 
schedule, calling for the National Assembly to immediately set 
up a fact- finding team to probe into why the government 
modified the schedule. 
  The team also should discover the truth about whether there 
was any secret negotiations between Seoul and Washington to open 
the domestic farming market wider, Kim claimed. 
  DP lawmaker Kim Chang-kon criticized the government for its 
revision of the final country schedule, saying that the 
government had cheated farmers and forced them to sacrifice. He 
demanded that President Kim Yong-sam offer an apology to the 
public and dismiss relevant ministers. 
  In response to lawmakers' allegations, a spokesman of the 
agriculture ministry said the 33 farming products are the items 
under which the two countries had already agreed to reduce 
tariff rates during bilateral negotiations in December 1993. 
  Testifying before the committee, Kim Yang-pae, the minister 
of agriculture, offered an apology to the public, saying that he 
feels sorry for creating "unnecessary" misunderstanding by 
failing to make public the modifications of the country 
schedule. But Kim dismissed some allegation that South Korea 
made further concessions through the side letter as totally 
untrue. He told lawmakers that the side letter was exchanged 
between ambassadors of the two countries to guarantee the 
bilateral agreements and there is no secret agreement with any 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on 4 April 
said that it will be prudent in applying the recently revived 
Super 301. 
  Peter Collins, assistant deputy representative of the USTR, 
said this at the ROK-U.S. trade talks held in Washington that 
day. He said that regarding international unfair trade 
practices, the United States will first make an effort to solve 
the dispute through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and will 
be as prudent as possible in the application of the Super 301. 
In the first-day sitting, the two sides discussed the pending 
issues, such as the easing of regulatory measures for the ROK 
automobile market, the term of distribution for heat-treated 
refrigerated sausage, the annual antidumping investigation of 
ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes by the United States. 
  The U.S. side positively appraised the action taken by the 
ROK Office of National Tax Administration deleting the space in 
the taxation data form requiring the foreign car owners to fill 
in the type of their cars, and demanded again that the tariff be 
lowered for foreign cars. The U.S. side also claimed that 
because of the ROK Health and Social Affairs Ministry's 
alteration of interpretation of regulations on the heat-treated 
refrigerated sausage, $1 million worth of U.S. sausage awaiting 
customs clearance at Pusan port is about to be dumped as 
inedible. In this connection, the U.S. side protested the 
abrupt alteration of regulations. 
  The United States has been exporting the heat-treated 
sausage 
to the ROK with a 90-day distribution period in refrigeration, 
but the ROK Government claims that the heat-treated sausage 
should not be allowed to be distributed in refrigeration after 
30 days. 
  The ROK side made an issue of the U.S. delay in its annual 
investigation of ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes, thereby 
delaying the opportunity for the revocation of the antidumping 
charges. Hence, the ROK side demanded an early annual 
investigation.

Southeast Asia, including South Korea. He said in Seoul that 
South Africa has in the past virtually ceased trade with eastern

African officials are on a two-day visit to South Korea to

  [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang apologized to the nation Tuesday over the controversy 
surrounding the modification of Seoul's country schedule for the 
Uruguay Round (UR) agreement. 
  "I am truly sorry for the failure of the government to let 
the people know the correct contents (of the modification), 
giving rise to misgivings," Yi said. 
  In a statement, the premier said he had to acknowledge a 
loophole that existed in the government's initial negotiations 
with UR authorities. 
  The government ought to have included supplemented and 
corrected items in its initial schedule during the UR 
negotiations last December, he said. 
  It also was a mistake, Yi said, to not have given a clear 
explanation of a supplemented and corrected final UR schedule, 
thus making the final schedule look as if it ran counter to the 
government's earlier statement that "the established UR schedule 
cannot be modified through renegotiation." 
  The prime minister said, however, that the UR schedule was 
supplemented due to the efforts of working-level officials from 
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry seeking to 
obtain a better deal for Korean farmers. 
  "In fact, we have been able to secure a substantially better 
outcome than the original agreement of last Dec. 15," he said. 
  Yi said it was not that the Ministry had changed the 
original 
agreement: All it did was simply supplement or correct those 
clauses which needed to be supplemented in terms of 
interpretation, he said. 
  Therefore, he said, the supplements and corrections cannot 
be 
taken as a change made through renegotiation of the existing 
agreement. 
  Saying that the government would strive to develop rural 
areas with the UR accord serving as an impetus, Yi asked the 
people to understand the government and help it surmount rural 
problems.

  [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- An overseas South Korean 
clergyman's plan to visit the home country is doomed to fail due 
to objection by government authorities. 
  The government is loath to allow the home visit of Rev. Yi 
Yong-pin, 68, active in Germany, on the ground that he had 
engaged in pro-North Korean activities abroad. 
  Yi, an outspoken critic of the past authoritarian regimes, 
had not been allowed into the country for decades in the past. 
  An official of the "committee for the promotion of Rev. Yi 
Yong-pin's return home" in Seoul said his committee on Thursday 
received a notification that the government would not allow Rev. 
Yi's return home unless he repents in writing of the "seditious 
activities" he made while visiting North Korea. 
  "The government notification is something unexpected. But, 
we will go ahead with the plan to have Rev. Yi come to Seoul on 
April 4," he said. 
  Rev. Yi who went to West Germany in 1955 for study, is noted 
for his struggles against the authoritarian governments of the 
past, and also for arranging talks between South and North 
Korean Christian leaders since early 1980s, in the course of 
which he visited Pyongyang in 1980.

  [Text] The Vietnamese Government is developing a strategy 
for the gradual development of the railway service system. 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that in 1994 priority should be 
given to investment in upgrading and step by step modernizing of 
the Vietnam railway. 
  He said expenditure on rail infrastructure would be above 
and 
beyond the system's operation aimed at paying for itself. The 
railway service would be formulating development goals to be 
achieved in the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 respectively.

  [Text] Construction is due to start within the next week 
on the first stage of a project to pipe offshore gas from Bach 
Ho oil field to Ba Ria in southern Vietnam. 
  According to the Ministry of Energy, construction will start 
on April 9. The first stage includes collecting gas from Bach 
Ho oil field and building a pipe line from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria 
power plant. The pipeline will include 10 km under the sea and 
20 km on land. 
  This stage is expected to be completed by September this 
year 
to directly supply gas to turbines in the Ba Ria power plant. 
The associated gas of the Bach Ho oil field will replace oil 
currently being used at 50 percent cheaper price. 
  The capacity of the first stage will be about 300 million 
cubic meters a year. The second stage will begin in 1994 and 
complete at the end of 1995 or early in 1996. 
  Investment in capital construction for the first stage is 
valued at about $100 million and about 15 billion Vietnamese 
dong, equivalent to $1.5 million.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies were held 
in Haeju and Kaesong to denounce the U.S. imperialists and the 
Kim Yong-sam group's shipment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  Speakers at the rallies branded the introduction into South 
Korea of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
ruling quarters as an outrageous challenge to the desire of the 
entire Korean nation for peace and denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, as an unpardonable nation-annihilating act to 
provoke a nuclear war by intentionally straining the situation. 
  They warned that though they are bringing dark clouds of a 
nuclear war to this land, the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets should clearly know that the Korean people are 
never afraid of a war. 
  The speakers declared that the Korean people and 
revolutionary Armed Forces, rallied rock-firm behind Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il, would make a thousand-fold 
retaliation against the aggressors, annihilating them at a 
stroke, if they dare to provoke the socialist motherland of 
Korea.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] released a statement today warning that if the U.S. and 
South Korean bellicose quarters brought Patriot missiles into 
South Korea and persistently sought a war in spite of the strong 
opposition of people at home and abroad, they would have to pay 
dearly for it. 
  Viewing their aggressive arms buildup and war provocation 
moves as a heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and 
security of the Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean 
nation into a nuclear war holocaust, the statement says: 
  The United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons into 
South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war games. This 
indicates that it seeks a solution to the issue not through 
negotiation but by strength, unilaterally reneging on its 
promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear 
weapons which was stipulated in the DPRK-USA joint statement. 
  The South Korean puppets continue introducing U.S. nuclear 
weapons into South Korea to slay the fellow countrymen in the 
North with the help of outside forces. This is an anti-national 
criminal act which can be committed only by flunkeyist traitors 
without a shred of national independence and an unpardonable 
perfidious act of unilaterally denouncing and reducing to a 
sheet of waste paper the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearization banning the production, introduction and 
possession of nuclear weapons. 
  If the strained situation is to be relaxed in Korea and a 
correct solution to be found, the U.S. hostile policy toward the 
DPRK must be changed and such flunkeyist traitors as Kim 
Yong-sam be removed from power in South Korea to be replaced by 
pro-reunification, democratic forces, national independent 
forces which value the sovereignty of the Korean people. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppets would be well 
advised to stop running riot, clearly mindful that with no 
amount of military threat, can they frighten the Korean people 
united in one mind around the party and the leader or stifle 
Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The International 
Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) 
published a statement on March 25 concerning the grave situation 
prevailing in the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States not only broke up the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks but is openly threatening to resume "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises, deploy Patriot missiles and 
beef up the U.S. forces in South Korea, the statement said, and 
continued: 
  A grave situation is now prevailing on the Korean peninsula 
due to such provocative moves of the United States. 
  The Cilreco condemns such dangerous moves of the United 
States that pose a threat to peace and security in Asia and the 
rest of the world, and calls upon the world's peaceloving forces 
to turn out for the relaxation of the tensions on the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Pressure of `Economic Sanctions' Has No Effect on Korea"-- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- U.S. and British papers 
said the "sanctions" have no actual effect on the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, but may bring undesired consequences. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES March 23 said the pressure of "economic 
sanctions" against North Korea is like trying to squeeze blood 
from a stone. 
  Recalling that the Clinton administration and its Asia 
allies 
found themselves in an embarrassing position as regards the 
"economic sanctions" against North Korea one year ago, the paper 
asked what was the use of another "sanctions" against the 
country which was virtually suffering from sanctions. 
  The paper said North Korea, unlike other countries of the 
world, has long since adhered to "chuche", "self-reliance", the 
keynote of the idea of the great leader President Kim Il-song, 
and he has taught the people that dependence on any other 
country results in the loss of the political independence of the 
state in the long run, encouraging the Korean people to walk 
without the help from outside. 
  Predicting that the world would know the viability of his 
independent policy, the paper quoted a Japanese official as 
saying that getting on the nerve of North Korea causes an 
adverse effect. 
  The British paper THE TIMES March 22 noted that the U.S. 
diplomacy was now in the worst phase, adding that "economic 
sanctions" against North Korea could not be regarded as a wise 
option and some countries do not like "sanctions" much.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Public organizations of 
different countries expressed support to the March 21 statement 
of a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman which denounced the 
perfidious act of the United States in totally reversing the 
agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of 
the DPRK said in a statement March 24 that the United States 
will be unable to evade the blame for the aborted third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The statement said: 
  The United States announced to the world a suspension of the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the date of the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, but has taken no step to put them into 
practice. On the contrary, it has committed a brigandish and 
brazen act of urging Korea unilaterally to implement the 
agreement. 
  The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
must know clearly that hostility against Korea is an act of 
provocation against mankind. 
  If the United States dare provoke Korea, it will suffer a 
more ignominious defeat than in the 1950s. 
  The Rwandan Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea and 
the Rwandan Committee for Support to Korea's Reunification, in a 
joint statement March 22, charged that the United States 
invented the "nuclear issue" and has premeditatedly raised it in 
the international arena in an attempt to isolate and stifle 
socialist Korea. 
  The statement demanded an immediate halt to its acts of 
mocking at the sovereignty of Korea. 
  The Society for the Study of the Chuche Idea of the 
University of Madagascar, the Madagascan National Committee for 
the study of the Chuche Idea, the Madagascan Institute for the 
Study of Chuche-based Idea on Literature and Art and the Society 
for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Journalists of Madagascar in 
a joint statement March 22 expressed full support and solidarity 
for the Korean people's just struggle to defend the dignity of 
the nation and security of the country. 
  The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement March 
23 strongly demanded that the United States think matters over 
and solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a 
peaceful way through dialogue in accordance with the spirit of 
the February 25 DPRK-USA New York agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (KNS-KCNA) -- Han Tok-su, chairman of 
the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), supported the appeal 
published by the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for 
the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] as regards the 
exposure of the Korean peninsula and the Korean nation to the 
grave danger of nuclear war caused by the criminal acts of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  The appeal dated March 29 called on the Koreans in the 
North, 
South and overseas to turn out in the struggle to remove the 
danger of nuclear war and pave the way for peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  Han Tok-su in a statement March 31 said if the nuclear war 
provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppet clique are tolerated, the whole territory of Korea will 
be laid waste and the Korean nation with a long history of five 
thousand years will suffer an irrevocable nuclear disaster in 
the present era. 
  He urged the Japanese authorities to refrain from joining in 
the war provocation moves of the United States and the 
anti-national acts of the South Korean authorities, renounce the 
hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately give up the 
repressive scheme against Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan. 
  He called on the compatriots under the influence of the "ROK 
Residents Association in Japan" to reject the treacherous forces 
and outside forces and join Chongnyon on the patriotic road, 
irrespective of ism and affiliation. 
  "We will firmly unite with the compatriots in the North, 
South and overseas under the banner of `10-point programme of 
the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country', a great charter of national unity, and more vigorously 
fight to remove the danger of war and pave the way for peace and 
reunification of the country," Han Tok-su stated.

  [Text] New York, April 5 KYODO -- North Korean Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam warned U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali in a letter last month that war might return to the 
Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear arms 
development program. 
  In the March 24 letter released by the United Nations on 
Monday [4 April], Kim suggested that if the U.N. Security 
Council followed U.S. calls for a resolution against Pyongyang, 
the unfortunate history of the 1950s might return to the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Last month, after a team of experts reported difficulties 
inspecting North Korean nuclear sites, the United States began 
lobbying members of the Security Council for a resolution urging 
Pyongyang to comply with international safeguard accords. 
  In the letter, Kim also declared that North Korea would 
resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it may 
follow through with its decision last year to withdraw from the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  On March 31, at the urging of China and nonaligned nations, 
the Security Council adopted a softened presidential statement 
calling on Pyongyang to comply with the inspections demands of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The letter requested Butrus-Ghali's help in attaining a fair 
resolution to the issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its 
development of nuclear weapons stepped up behind the facade of a 
nuclear row against the fellow countrymen and remove its heavy 
water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor before it is 
too late, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The puppets' nuclear row is aimed at hurling abuses and 
slanders at the DPRK to create the impression that its reactors 
are being used to develop nuclear weapons. However, it is the 
pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong and the 
multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, not the 
graphite moderated reactor in the North, that are actually being 
used to develop nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets has stockpiled spent nuclear fuel 
containing more than ten tons of plutonium obtained through the 
PHWR and the multi-purpose research reactor they put into 
operation for the purpose of development of nuclear weapons. It 
will increase to twentyfour tons by the year 2000. 
  Referring to the aim sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in 
raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "North's nuclear 
problem", the analyst says: 
  The puppets seek in this to create the impression that the 
North is developing nuclear weapons and thus mislead public 
opinion and find an excuse for keeping the U.S. troops and 
nuclear weapons in South Korea. At the same time, they intend 
to use their nuclear row as a smokescreen for covering up their 
own nuclear arms development, while pretending to have any 
concern for a solution of the nuclear issue. 
  If they are really interested in a solution of the nuclear 
issue, they must stop taking issue with the fellow countrymen in 
a far-fetched manner and demand the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear 
weapons from South Korea. And they must discontinue their 
nuclear row, immediately give up their own nuclear arms 
development and prove this through the elimination of the PHWR 
in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok.

<F P=106> ["Pro-Japanese Flunkeyist Treacheries of Traitor Kim </F>
Yong-sam Denounced" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
The Japan mission of the South Korean National Democratic Front 
[SKNDF] (Hanminjon) issued a statement on March 29 denouncing 
the pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam which were revealed during his trip to Japan. 
  "The traitor Kim Yong-sam blared that he `will work to 
strengthen the triangular cooperative system of South Korea, the 
United States and Japan' to `get rid of' the North and lay aside 
the past history of aggression of Japan, crying for 
`future-oriented relations'," the statement said, and went on: 
  "Kim Yong-sam is trying to slay fellow countrymen in league 
with outside forces while turning back on the independent, 
patriotic stand and sincere efforts of the North for the peace 
and peaceful reunification of the country, and wipe off the 
slate the brutalities of Japanese imperialism which we can never 
pardon. He is, indeed, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and a 
dyed-in-the-wool pro-Japanese element who far outdistances the 
successive rulers. 
  "The Japan mission of Hanminjon bitterly denounces with 
towering national resentment a sequence of acts committed by the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam during his tour of Japan, branding them as 
heinous treacheries and shameless flunkeyist acts. 
  "By stating that the `Self-Defence Forces' of Japan could be 
dispatched to the Korean peninsula in `case of emergency,' the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam embarked upon a very dangerous road which 
might lead to a nuclear holocaust annihilating the nation, 
encouraging the Japanese reactionaries who are dreaming of 
overseas expansion." 
  The statement called upon the entire South Korean people to 
reject the dependence on foreign forces and treacheries by 
taking the road of independence and patriotism and turn out as 
one in the struggle for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon Spokesman Denounces South Korean Authorities for </F>
Mocking Envoys of Peace" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) in a 
commentary on March 30 denounced the South Korean authorities 
for having blocked the Pyongyang trip of former presidents and 
prime ministers and other high-level politicians of different 
countries through Panmunjom, according to the radio Voice of 
National Salvation from Seoul. 
  "This is a rude act of the `civilian' fascist group mocking 
the envoys of peace from different countries, ignoring the 
elementary international usage and courtesy and morality," the 
spokesman said. 
  Noting that the Kim Yong-sam fascist group barred the 
northern trip of the foreign envoys of peace through Panmunjom 
by applying to them the uncouth fascist act of blocking the home 
people's visit to the North, and thus made it quite plain that 
South Korea is a barren land of human rights under the 
"civilian" dictatorship and the Kim Yong-sam regime is an 
anti-peace group, he said: 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group blocked their Pyongyang visit 
because 
it was deadly afraid that they might sympathize with the just 
stand of the North which is pursuing a policy of independent 
reunification and a nuclear-free peace policy which are totally 
contrary to its flunkeyist splittist policy and war moves. This 
fully shows which of the North and the South of the Korean 
peninsula is a closed fascist society and which of them is a 
democratic society, who seeks confrontation, war and division 
and who wants peace and peaceful reunification."

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Welcomes H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk's Visit </F>
to Pyongyang" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an editorial warmly welcoming His Majesty [H.M.] King 
Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia due here today for an official 
goodwill visit to Korea at the invitation of President Kim 
Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  His visit will mark another important milestone in 
developing 
Korea-Cambodia friendship to a new, higher stage, the editorial 
says, and goes on: 
  He began visiting Pyongyang from 1960s. And this visit 
continues in the 90s through the 70s and the 80s. 
  His current visit reflects his deepest respect for the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and fully demonstrates the close 
friendly and cooperation relations established between the 
Korean and Cambodian peoples. 
  It is also another expression of solidarity with the Korean 
people, who are defending and developing socialism, while 
smashing the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists 
and the international reactionaries. 
  The many positive changes which have taken place in the 
political developments of Cambodia in recent years are 
unthinkable apart from the experienced leadership and patriotic 
spirit of H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot 
produced by the Khmer nation. 
  He is still making energetic efforts to build the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, sovereign, independent, peaceful, permanently neutral 
and non-aligned. 
  The editorial continues: 
  The Korean people are rejoiced as over their own over the 
achievements made by the H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, the royal 
government and the people in the efforts to achieve the 
stability of the country and the reconciliation and unity of the 
nation and build an independent and prospering new Cambodia and 
express full support and firm solidarity for their just cause. 
  To constantly consolidate and develop Korea-Cambodia 
friendship is the unanimous desire of the two peoples. 
  The Korean people are pleased to have such true-hearted 
friends as the Cambodian people and make strenuous efforts to 
strengthen and develop the friendly and cooperation relations 
with them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- President Kim Il-song 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today arranged a 
banquet in honor of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of 
Cambodia on an official goodwill visit to Korea and made a 
speech there. 
  He said: 
  Although you are unwell, receiving treatment, you have not 
forgotten my birthday and have come to congratulate me. This 
moves me deeply. From this I feel warmly again how sincere and 
cordial our friendship and fraternity are. 
  In spring, in April, every year we have met and shared our 
inmost feelings, but this year's reunion is more significant 
than ever. This is the first historic visit you are paying to my 
country since you came to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
It is an eventful visit on which you have brought with you the 
fresh news of Cambodia which has greeted the spring of her 
revival. 
  Today, in support of esteemed Your Majesty's noble patriotic 
cause, the Cambodian people are working hard to promote national 
reconciliation and unity, rebuild their country and create a new 
life. The Kingdom of Cambodia has already established state 
relations with many countries, and her international position is 
daily rising. 
  The changes and great successes being made in Cambodia are 
unthinkable apart from the leadership of Your Majesty esteemed 
King Norodom Sihanouk, the outstanding patriot and pre-eminent 
statesman of Cambodia and the father of the Khmer nation. 
  With an intense love for your country and an unbreakable 
will 
in spite of many tortuous events and storms since the early days 
of your political career, you have devoted everything to the 
struggle to shape a bright future of your nation. Since your 
accession to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia, held in high 
respect and trust by your people, you have been working harder 
to build a prosperous country and promote her peace. Even on a 
sick-bed now you administer state affairs optimistically and 
unremittingly. We admire you for your patriotic devotion. 
  I sincerely wish your majesty, my most intimate friend and 
brother, to be in good health and live long to give continued 
leadership to the Cambodian people in their effort to build a 
new society. As in the past, so in the future, the Korean 
people will render an active support to your majesty's 
independent policies and peace-loving proposals and extend firm 
solidarity with the just cause of the Cambodian people. 
  Even under the difficult circumstances created by ceaseless 
challenges and obstructive manoeuvres of the imperialists and 
reactionaries, our people are stepping up the building of 
socialism and making every effort to denuclearize the Korean 
peninsula and reunify their country. 
  Your Majesty and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia 
are extending active support to the just cause of our people. 
This is a great encouragement to our people. 
  Nearly 30 years have passed since we first met in Jakarta. 
In these years we have deepened our friendship and trust, 
sharing joy and sorrow. I consider it a great pleasure to have 
my most intimate brother in Your Majesty who treasure our 
friendship and loyalty invariably even in the storms of 
chequered history. 
  The relations of friendship and cooperation between the 
peoples of our two countries are now developing fully in all 
fields of politics, the economy and culture. Your present visit 
will be another important event in further deepening our 
intimate relations and strengthening the friendly ties between 
the peoples of Korea and Cambodia. 
  I hope from the bottom of my heart that you will spend happy 
and pleasant days during your stay in our country by taking rest 
and recuperating your health.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia made a speech at the banquet 
arranged by President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall today. 
  Norodom Sihanouk said he had the highest honour of visiting 
again the DPRK in auspicious April greeting the birthday of 
President Kim Il-song. 
  He further said: 
  Having been seriously ill and hospitalised between early 
October 1993 and late February 1994, after my election as King 
of Cambodia in September 1993 by the beloved people of Cambodia, 
I am extremely happy and profoundly moved and honored to have 
returned today beside Your Excellency who accord me the supreme 
honour by considering me forever your close anti-imperialist 
comrade-in-arms and your own brother. This is my greatest 
happiness. 
  The forthcoming April 15 will be a very glorious historic 
day 
marking the 82nd birthday of Your Excellency, that the nation 
and patriotic people of Korea within and without it will 
celebrate with the greatest fervour and the greatest enthusiasm. 
  With our brothers and sisters of Korea, the Cambodian people 
and all the other anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, 
anti-neocolonialist, anti-dominationist and anti-expansionist 
progressive peoples aspiring after justice and freedom are full 
of joy and pride to celebrate your august birthday and render a 
vibrant hommage to Your Excellency the Great Leader who are the 
greatest hero in Korea's history of thousands of years, the 
great and immortal father of the chuche idea and the greatest 
champion of the just cause of the Third World peoples fighting 
against the injustice and menace from certain big powers and 
against underdevelopment and for progress, freedom, 
independence, territorial integrity, non-alignment and peace in 
mutual respect and equality between all countries, big and small. 
  Your Excellency Generalissimo President Kim Il-song are and 
will be the irreplaceable champion of this just cause. 
  We sincerely hope that Your Excellency will live more than a 
hundred years for the greatest happiness of the nation and 
valiant people of Korea and for that of us all and all peoples 
who are indefectibly attached to Your Excellency the Great 
Leader and who are united with the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea, the unique symbol of the independence of Korea. 
  Thanks to the wise leadership of His Excellency President 
Kim 
Il-song and His Excellency Marshal Kim Chong-il, the DPRK has 
turned into a veritable paradise on Earth for the greatest 
happiness and prosperity of the Korean people and a great 
military power, modern and invincible, Norodom Sihanouk noted, 
and continued: 
  Your formidable military power fully supports and will 
support the cause of peace in your geographical region and the 
rest of the whole world. 
  At present, certain foreign powers threatening peace in this 
region and world peace are posing unjust threat to the DPRK. 
  As king and head of state of Cambodia, I have the honour of 
expressing my full and invariable support to Your Excellency 
the Great Leader and to the DPRK not only in the important 
process of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea 
but also in the present dramatic situation in which the DPRK has 
the absolute reason to defend with greatest fortitude its right 
to be "the sole master of its own home" and of expressing my 
total rejection to all foreign interference in the internal 
affairs of the DPRK whose military policy is and will be purely 
defensive. 
  Between 1955 and 1969, the Kingdom of Cambodia worked to 
firmly defend its legitimate frontiers and its complete 
independence and repulse all the attempts of interference in its 
internal affairs on the part of certain foreign powers. 
  They did not allow its uncompromising spirit of independence 
and this led to the coup d'etat of Lon Nol on March 18, 1970 and 
the ensuing great war (1970-1975). 
  Today the danger of war is grave in the region in which the 
DPRK is situated and consequently in East Asia and Far East, 
nay, in all our Asia. 
  In this regard, the DPRK has committed no fault. It only 
defended uncompromisingly its sacred right to complete 
independence in its own territory and the pancha shila of 
bandung and the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 
including non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. 
  Your Excellency the Great Leader revered and beloved by the 
Korean people have declared that the DPRK will not attack or 
invade anyone. 
  The DPRK has the right to defend itself from the attack or 
aggression of another country or administration. 
  The fidelity of the DPRK to peace and the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence and the 10-point programme of Korean 
reunification is indisputable and should be appreciated for its 
just high courage by the United Nations organisation and others. 
  Cambodia and I stand and will always stand for this peace 
and 
the five principles and 10-point programme. 
  We Cambodian people will invariably solidarize with Your 
Excellency the Great Leader and the glorious DPRK.

<F P=106> [Report given by Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central </F>
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at the national 
meeting of party cell secretaries held at the Pyongyang 
Gymnasium in Pyongyang on 31 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today we are holding the national meeting 
of party cell secretaries under a ferment atmosphere in which 
the whole party, all the people, and the entire Army are waging 
the general onward march to effect an upsurge in the revolution 
and construction and to further glorify the popular 
mass-centered socialism of our own style, upholding the militant 
tasks set forth in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New 
Year address and his letter to the National Agricultural 
Meeting, and the decision of the 21st plenary session of the 
sixth party Central Committee. 
  It is very significant that the national meeting of party 
cell secretaries is held at a time when all party members and 
people firmly defend and adhere to the socialism of our own 
style, and demonstrate its superiority and vitality by smashing 
all sorts of challenges and obstructive maneuvers of the 
imperialists and reactionaries. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a message in which 
he warmly congratulated the delegates to the meeting, as well as 
all the party cell secretaries of the entire party. He also 
clearly expounded the programmatic tasks of the work of party 
secretaries, and ways and means of its implementation to bring 
about a new upturn in the work in conformity with the 
requirements of development of the party and revolution. 
[applause] 
  This is a highest honor to the delegates to the meeting, as 
well as the party cell secretaries of the entire party, and 
greatly encourages them. [applause] 
  The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il personally is a historic meeting, the first of its 
kind since the founding of the WPK. [applause] 
  It will powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and 
unshakable will of the entire party cell secretaries and party 
members who have resolved to remain loyal to the party and the 
leader [suryong] and have accomplished the cause of socialism to 
the end without the slightest vacillation under today's complex 
situation. Likewise, it will also mark an epochal turning point 
in further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and 
accelerating the general march of socialism of our own style by 
enhancing party cell secretaries' role and function. [applause] 
  Comrades: A long time has passed since our party's history 
took root and the Korean revolution grew. The WPK scored great 
accomplishments on the road of a long and arduous struggle, 
which contributes greatly to realizing mankind's independent 
cause and triumphantly advancing the Korean revolution. 
[applause] 
  Under the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea, our party 
audaciously overcame manifold difficulties and trials by 
organizing and mobilizing the popular masses, firmly believing 
in them. In so doing, our party turned our country into an 
independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist power 
that is the envy of all the people of the world. Furthermore, 
it staunchly defended the most superior socialism of our own 
style centered on the fatherland, the revolution, and the 
popular masses, smashing all the enemies' aggressive and 
provocative maneuvers. [applause] 
  Our party is highly trusted by all the Korean people, as 
well as by international progressive people, because it 
excellently carried out the national and international duty of 
the Korean revolution and the international revolution. 
[applause] 
  Through the long, difficult, and glorious struggle, the WPK 
has been strengthened and has developed into a mature and tested 
party with accumulated great revolutionary achievements and 
extraordinarily rich experience and into the most mighty 
revolutionary party that can advocate and complete the chuche 
revolutionary cause and the socialist and communist cause to the 
end through any storm and trial. [applause] 
  For the past few decades, taking the opportunity of the 
collapse of communist and labor parties, which had pioneered 
socialist causes in various countries, the imperialists and 
reactionaries unprecedentedly strengthened their antisocialist 
and anti-republic maneuvers. Amid such a circumstance, it is a 
great source of pride and unequaled dignity of our party members 
and people that they are vigorously advancing in front of the 
times and mankind, while firmly defending and advocating the 
chuche socialism following the leadership of the indomitable 
party. [applause] 
  Party cells, which are the most basic organization of the 
party to strengthen and develop our party and to enable the 
Korean revolution to advance in victory, and which are direct 
combat units for implementing the party's line and policy, 
played a very important role. 
  In a congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the 
meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The 
founding, strengthening, and development of our party cannot be 
separated from the strengthening and development of the basic 
party organization -- party cells. 
  Party cells are the most basic organizations of the party, 
which is a organic body of party organizations. A man is 
healthy when all cells composing the human body are healthy. 
The party can become stronger and properly carry out its 
mission and duty as the guide of society only when all party 
cells composing the party smoothly play their functions and 
roles. 
  A party without strong party cells deeply rooted in party 
members and popular masses is merely a building in the sky that 
cannot even maintain its own existence. This is a lofty truth 
and a serious lesson that was proven during the process of the 
construction of our party and by the history of the 
international communist movement. 
  For the first time in the history of the communist movement, 
the WPK had the chuche idea -- the most scientific and 
revolutionary world outlook of the working class -- as the 
guideline and brilliantly embodied it and uniquely pioneered a 
new road for building a revolutionary party. 
  The WPK is a new chuche-type revolutionary party founded by 
the method of forming basic party organizations first, and then 
expanding and strengthening them. [applause] 
  In the historic Karun meeting held in 1930, the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song presented a unique party founding policy of 
founding a party not by promulgating the party center first, but 
by forming basic party organizations after sufficient 
arrangements and then endlessly expanding and strengthening them. 
  This policy put forth by the great leader was the 
chuche-oriented policy that elucidated the most correct way to 
make it possible to solve all the problems in founding the party 
smoothly in conformity with the specific reality of our country 
and the demand of our revolution and to build a strong and 
mighty revolutionary party of the working class. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the first party 
organization, the origin of our party, with the new generation 
young communists, whom he himself had brought up immediately 
after the Karun meeting. This became the original form and 
mother's body of the party organizations that were organized one 
after another thereafter. 
  The anti-Japanese armed struggle, which the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song organized and led, was a sacred war for 
democracy and liberation to defeat the Japanese imperialist 
aggressors and restore the stolen country under the banner of 
the chuche idea. At the same time, it was a glorious struggle 
to establish the revolutionary party, the general staff of the 
Korean revolution. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, organizing and leading 
the overall Korean revolution, with the anti-Japanese armed 
struggle at its center, brought up numerous communists who were 
firmly armed with the working class revolutionary idea and 
tempered in the practice of the revolutionary struggle. At the 
same time, he firmly realized the purity of the communist ranks 
and their ideological and volitional unity. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song saw to it that many 
party organizations were formed in the country and in the Korean 
residential areas in the northeastern region of China, and 
orderly established the uniform guiding system of party 
organizations of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, thus 
firmly realizing the party's leadership for the overall Korean 
revolution. 
  Because our party had a strong organizational and 
ideological 
foundation of party building and the glorious revolutionary 
tradition, which were formed in the blaze of the long and 
arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, it was able to 
promulgate its founding to the entire world without delay on a 
solid base in the difficult and complicated condition after the 
liberation. [applause] 
  After its founding, our party accepted many advanced 
elements 
from the working popular masses, including workers, peasants, 
and intellectuals; expanded the party ranks; and organized many 
party cells everywhere there were party members and the masses, 
including plants and rural areas. At the same time, our party 
emphasized strongly bringing up the organized party cells and 
enhancing their role. 
  Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, the party cells and party cores increased in great 
numbers and the party members' political and ideological 
standard and vanguard roles were enhanced. Therefore, our party 
was brought up strong organizationally and ideologically within 
a short period of its founding, took root deep in the masses, 
and was able to smoothly carry out its leadership role for the 
revolution and construction as a ruling party following its 
founding. 
  During the Fatherland Liberation War, our party further 
strengthened the party cells' militant function and role and 
enhanced the party members' party consciousness in conformity 
with the wartime conditions. By so doing, our party vigorously 
organized and mobilized all party members, soldiers of the 
People's Army, and all the people of the country to the struggle 
to win the war. 
  By forming the party organizations, including party cells, 
in 
the units, large and small, of the Korean People's Army [KPA] of 
all levels, our party ensured that the party's leadership of the 
People's Army is strengthened and the party's political work is 
vigorously conducted in the Army. 
  Even in those busy days of shouldering the heavy burden of 
the war all by himself, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
went deep among the soldiers of the People's Army and the people 
and vigorously aroused them to new victories and exploits. At 
the same time, he exercised his leadership so that the party 
cell work is militantly conducted and core party members are 
brought up in large numbers in conformity with wartime 
conditions. 
  During the days of fierce war, the heroic defenders of 
Wolmido and 1211 Meter Hill, the 10 party members of Nagwon, and 
all other party members, soldiers of the People's Army, and 
people highly displayed the boundless loyalty to the party and 
the leader, enthusiastic love for the country, and mass heroism, 
and attained a historic victory in the difficult war with the 
joint imperialist forces led by the U.S. imperialists, thus 
demonstrating the spirit of the heroic Korea to the entire 
world. [applause] 
  Our party firmly established the chuche in all fields after 
the war, firmly and strongly brought up the basic party 
organizations, including the party cells, and enhanced the party 
members' party consciousness and vanguard role in order to 
vigorously push ahead with the socialist revolution and 
construction. 
  In the difficult days after the war, our party cells and 
party members, with the firm faith to believe and follow the 
great leader with all their hearts and minds, resolutely 
protected and defended the party Central Committee headed by the 
respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song. Effecting the 
Chollima upsurge in socialist construction, they resolutely 
crushed the anticommunist offensive and push-to-the-North 
commotion of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and the 
antiparty and counterrevolutionary maneuvers of the factionalist 
elements colluding with outside forces. 
  After the liquidation of factions, which did enormous harm 
to 
the party and the revolution's development with the 
establishment of the socialist system and with the passage of 
its history, our party vigorously organized and mobilized all 
the party cells and party members to the struggle to further 
enhance the party's unity and cohesion and leadership role and 
to effect a revolutionary upsurge in all fronts of socialist 
construction. 
  The great leader put forth the formula for the first time in 
history that the basis of party work is work with people, and 
exercised his leadership so that the party organizations of all 
levels, including the party cells, may conduct effective 
organizational and political work to firmly rally the party 
members and masses around the party and organize and mobilize 
them to the implementation of the party policy. With ceaseless 
on-the-spot guidance, he energetically guided the party cells' 
work. 
  Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, the party organizations of all levels, including the 
party cells, were brought up strong and the party members' party 
consciousness and vanguard role were further enhanced. This 
enabled our party to strengthen its militant might and 
leadership role enormously, thereby bringing forth an 
unprecedented revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction. 
As a result, the relations of kinship between the party and the 
popular masses became so firm that no force could break them. 
[applause] 
  In conformity with the demand of our party's chuche-oriented 
party building ideology, the work to strengthen the party cells 
was more vigorously pushed ahead in the grand struggle to model 
the entire party membership and entire society on the chuche 
idea under the outstanding and tested leadership of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely led the work to 
bring up strong the party cells, the lowest level basic party 
organization, and enhance their role in order to strengthen and 
develop our party to be the chuche-type revolutionary party 
forever and to develop the chuche revolutionary cause 
continuously and vigorously. 
  The works the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published 
early in the 1960's: "On Effectively Conducting the Guidance 
for Party Members' Party Life in Conformity With the Party 
Cells' Duty," "The Party Cells Should Correctly Organize the 
Party Assignment and Sum It Up in a Timely Manner," "Let Us 
Strengthen the Party Members' Ideological and Volitional Unity 
and Cohesion Based on the Leader's Revolutionary Idea," and many 
other works of his became a programmatic guideline to improve 
the party cell work and the party members' party life. [applause] 
  In that period, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave 
on-the-spot guidance in detail to the party cells of the 
Department of Political and Economic Science of the College of 
Economics of Kim Il-song University; of the No. 1 machinery work 
team of Pyongyang Spinning Machinery Plant's tool shop; of the 
rolling machine repairing team of Hungnam Fertilizer Plant 
synthetic shop; of Komidae, Ohyon-ri, Yanan county, South 
Hwanghae Province; of the No. 6 party cell of the actors and 
actresses group of the Korean Film Studio; and many other party 
cells. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il declared it as our 
party's supreme program to model the entire society after the 
chuche idea and presented the party construction policy on 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea in the 1970's. 
He presented principles for establishing the party's unitary 
ideological system in accordance with the new demand of our 
party and the developing revolution and enabled party cells to 
vigorously push out with the work of raising party members as 
enthusiastic, chuche-type communist revolutionaries, who are 
boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader, and who uphold 
the leadership of the party central. [applause] 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has led party cells to 
effectively carry out work to firmly arm all party members with 
our party's chuche idea and to make them firmly establish the 
view of revolution, the view of leader, the view of 
organization, and the view of masses. Developing the way of 
summing up the party life, which was used by anti-Japanese 
guerrillas, in accordance with today's reality, he established a 
new system of summing up the party life for the entire party. 
He has also made it possible to regularize and standardize the 
party life and has led party members to constantly season their 
party-oriented traits [tangsong] by participating in the party 
life with a sincere and self-conscious attitude and with a 
correct view of party organization. 
  The national party cell secretaries training held in May 
1991 
was a remarkable momentum in strengthening our party cells. In 
the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" he sent to 
the national party cell secretaries training, the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il presented the programmatic task of further 
strengthening party cells in accordance with the development of 
our party and the revolution to create a new turning point in 
party cells' activities, and he clearly elucidated the way to 
implement it. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "Let us make all 
party cells loyal ones." This is an important slogan presented 
by our party today, as well as a primary task that party 
organizations should implement. 
  All party cells and cell secretaries have vigorously 
struggled for the past three years to make each party cell a 
cell with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader, 
upholding the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" 
that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent to the national 
party cell secretaries training. 
  Many party members of various party cells, including the 
party cells of the No. 1 machinery work team of Pyongyang 
spinning machinery plant's tool shop and of the high-speed 
heading section of Tokchon mine's No. 4 pit in the Tokchon 
district mining complex, humbly sent letters of loyalty to the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expressing their will to be 
faithful to the chuche revolutionary cause to the end and to 
entirely entrust their destinies to him, following the party 
invariably, and they have been brilliantly putting their 
determination into practice. The dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il sent his personal letter of love to many party cells 
and party members, extending his sublime intent to give them the 
greatest honor and confidence and boundless expectations and 
encouragement. [applause] 
  As mentioned above, the leader [yongdoja] firmly trusts 
party members and gives them great confidence and benevolence, 
and party members absolutely trust and follow the leader and 
fulfill their loyal and filial duties for him. Therefore, our 
party has become great today, and socialism of our own style 
becomes more victorious as days go by. [applause] 
  In the course of the vigorous movement to create loyal party 
cells, many people have grown to be genuine loyal servants, who 
faithfully trust and follow the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as resolutely 
protect and defend the party and the leader [suryong] 
politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly. 
  There are lofty examples and steady efforts of cell 
secretaries, who are boundlessly loyal to our party, in the 
heroic struggle and precious feats registered by many party 
members and working people, who protected and defended the party 
and the leader politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly 
by sacrificing even their valuable lives in unexpected 
emergencies. 
  The lofty traits of Comrade Hyon Chang-sik, a party cell 
secretary of the Pukkyongju railway section of the Kaechon 
Railway General Bureau's Chongju railway division, who 
guaranteed the safety of a train in a heavily rainy midnight by 
displaying his peerless self-sacrificing and heroic spirit; of 
Comrade Yi Chong-hun, a secretary of No. 1 party cell of the 
fishing sector of the Pochon Fishery Cooperative in Myongchun 
County, North Hamgyong Province, who threw himself into the dark 
blue sea without hesitation after handing over his life vest and 
portraits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to a young member of the League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea as all fishermen who were with 
him on a fishing boat adopted the general party cells meeting's 
decision to keep their portraits undamaged, risking their lives 
when the boat faced a crisis of shipwreck due to a sudden 
typhoon and a tidal wave; and of party members of this cell show 
our party members' firm and pure loyalty to the party and the 
leader. [applause] 
  Party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly struggling to 
resolutely protect, defend, and add luster to the achievements 
made by the party and the leader. Considering our party's 
honorable, chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition to be the 
lifeline of our revolution, party cells and cell secretaries are 
resolutely struggling to firmly protect it under any stormy 
circumstances and to thoroughly embody it in all areas of the 
revolution and construction. 
  A great number of party cell secretaries and party members 
throughout the country have discovered scores of thousands of 
new revolutionary slogans, remains, and relics in the past 
several years alone, going up and down the rocky mountains, with 
the revolutionary determination to glorify our party's honorable 
revolutionary tradition through generations. 
  When an unexpected fire took place in the mountains one day 
several years ago, party cell secretaries of Yongsindae, Saebyol 
County, North Hamgyong Province surrounded trees engraved with 
slogans thick and threefold and ultimately protected the slogans 
despite of being seriously burnt in the fierce fire. [applause] 
  There are many party cell secretaries who are making devoted 
efforts to further glorify our party's revolutionary tradition. 
For example, Comrade Choe Chae-yong, a party cell secretary of 
the Sinpa Revolutionary Museum, has located and examined many 
underground revolutionary organizations and revolutionary 
remains of the anti-Japanese struggling period for the past 26 
years. 
  Party cells of units, to which the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave 
on-the-spot guidance, are protecting and defending the great 
achievements of the party and the leader by completely 
implementing tasks presented during their on-the-spot guidance. 
  In the work to follow and learn about the No. 2 cell party 
members of the fifth bureau of KCNA, the party cells and cell 
secretaries are closely linking and substantially carrying out a 
living example of loyally upholding the great leader by all the 
generations of the revolution and the work to follow and learn 
the positive example that is being manifested in their party. 
Thus, many loyalists and dutiful children of the nineties were 
fostered. 
  Through the loyal party cell creation movement, the party 
cells are fostering the party members to advocate, adhere to, 
and all the more elucidate socialism of our own style centered 
on the popular masses so they can become resolute fighters. 
  In the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's immortal classical 
works including, "Socialism of Our Own Style Centered on the 
Popular Masses Is Invincible and Ever-Victorious," "The 
Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's 
General Line," "On the Fundamental Problem of the Revolutionary 
Party Construction," and "Slander of Socialism Cannot Be 
Tolerated," he wholly analyzed and summed up our party's 
immortal revolutionary achievements and struggle experiences 
that were achieved through his iron-like theories and gem-like 
theses while walking along the long and glorious road of the 
historical lesson of socialist construction and as the socialist 
ruling party. He also made it possible to all the more adhere 
to and elucidate socialism of our own style, and brightly 
elucidated the future road to revive socialism from a worldwide 
scope. [applause] 
  The party cells and cell secretaries regarded the 
chuche-oriented scientific socialist ideology and theory 
elucidated by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a firm 
guiding principle. They also freshly carried out through 
various forms and methods the indoctrination work for the party 
members and workers to deeply recognize the truth of the true 
superiority and invincible vitality of socialism of our own 
style, the inevitability of the ultimate victory of socialist 
cause, and that we will be victorious if we defend socialism and 
die if we throw it away, by linking them with the lively reality. 
  Today, as long as our party members and people are possessed 
with the spirit that the Korean nation is the best--that is the 
spirit that our leader is the best, that our party is the best, 
that our chuche idea is the best, and that the spirit that 
socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses is the 
best--and are possessed with the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader; the single-hearted unity of the leader, the 
party, and the masses; and a strong self-supporting national 
economy and self-defensive national defense power--they have the 
firm faith that our socialism is invincible and ever-victorious. 
With this, they are carrying out a devoted and heroic struggle 
to thoroughly advocate, adhere to, and all the more elucidate 
socialism of our own style that is their living and life. 
[applause] 
  The party cells and party members of the ship, Loyalty No. 
5, 
of the 24 May export goods fishery work site were confronted 
with the South Korean puppet naval vessels many times on the 
high seas during the past several years. However, each time 
they triumphantly fully loaded their ship with goods by smashing 
[chitbusyoborigo] the rascals' provocative maneuvers with the 
faith of victory and spirit of exterminating the enemy without 
the slightest wavering. Also, when the enemies made 
provocations by burying thousands of explosives, the party 
members of (Yiman)-ri, Panmun county, Kaesong city, held open 
party meetings and vigorously sang songs like "Let's Defend 
Socialism," at places where the rascals were clearly looking and 
removed all the explosives, thus making the enemies shiver with 
fear. Such struggle feats, as well as other struggle feats 
carried out by many party cells and party members, show well the 
resoluteness and firmness of the faith and will of our party 
members and people, which are preciously treasured in their 
hearts. 
  However, the imperialists and reactionaries rave to block, 
suffocate, and crush [apsal] us, they cannot by any means 
surprise our party members and people who are resolutely 
fighting for the just cause by impregnably uniting around the 
party and the leader. The rascals' maneuver is rather all the 
more encouraging the revolutionary will and struggle enthusiasm 
of our party members and people who are highly upholding the 
revolutionary banner and socialist banner. [applause] 
  Upholding the slogan, "What the party decides, we will 
do!" the party cells and cell secretaries are vigorously 
inspiring party members and workers to the valuable struggle to 
strengthen the might of socialism in our country and to fully 
demonstrate its genuine superiority and vitality to the entire 
world. 
  The party members and workers registered proud feats on all 
fronts of socialist construction by more highly displaying 
loyalty and filial piety to the party and to the leader and 
invincible faith in and indomitable will for the socialist cause 
even under complex situations and repeated difficulties. Thanks 
to their devoted struggle, the might of our socialism has been 
consolidated into an ever-victorious and indomitable one. 
[applause] 
  By vigorously waging the struggle to thoroughly carry to 
accomplishment our party's self-defense military line, party 
cells are greatly contributing to strengthening the nation's 
defense capabilities so we can smash the enemy in a stroke, no 
matter how strong it may be. 
  Since we have highly upheld the respected general Kim 
Chong-il as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the 
DPRK National Defense Commission, the traditional fine custom of 
military-civilian unity has bloomed more brilliantly. 
  Our party members and workers are sincerely looking after 
soldiers of the People's Army--fighters of comrade supreme 
commander--just like their own brothers, and soldiers of the 
People's Army are unhesitatingly dedicating their youth and 
lives to defending happy life, property, and lives of the 
people. [applause] 
  Last year, when the U.S. imperialists frantically waged a 
nuclear inspection row and the Team Spirit 1993 joint military 
exercise in a bid to isolate and crush our republic--the 
stronghold of socialism--a touch-and-go crisis resulted in which 
a war threatened to break out at any time, all soldiers of the 
People's Army, who heartily accepted the order of the respected 
general Kim Chong-il, and people, rose like a rigorous mountain 
and honorably defended the socialist fatherland and 
revolutionary gains. [applause] 
  The party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly 
struggling 
to further consolidate and develop the single-hearted unity of 
the leader, the party and the masses, which is the most precious 
asset of our party and the revolution and invincible might of 
our socialism. 
  The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught us that the 
whole party and all people, inheriting the glorious tradition of 
our party and revolution on the single-hearted unity, should 
firmly unite with dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. By upholding his 
teaching, the party cells and cell secretaries firmly grasped as 
the key task in the work of party cells to further strengthen 
the single-hearted unity of the party and revolutionary ranks, 
which is a decisive factor for success in the chuche 
revolutionary cause and for the destiny of socialism. [applause] 
  Today all party members and people, in firm unity with the 
party and the leader in one mind and one intention, are 
breathing only according to the party's idea and will, no matter 
how many of us there may be; are making exactly the same remarks 
as that of the party; and are moving as one only according to 
the party's order. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il inherited intact the 
respected leader's lofty intent for welfare of the people and 
society, and implemented politics of boundlessly lofty 
benevolence and humanity. Highly praising the fine custom of 
communists and beautiful acts of pioneers who dedicated 
everything to the nation, to the people, to society and to 
groups, he saw to it that all party members and people follow 
and learn from them. 
  The fine custom of communists has brilliantly bloomed each 
day among our party members and workers, such as an act of 
voluntarily advancing to mines and cooperative farms, to which 
the party directs strength, without wishing any reward, honor, 
and comfortable life, by departing their beloved home and work 
site; an act of unhesitatingly offering their own lives to 
rescue people who are at the point of death; an act of sharing 
their lives with soldiers who were wounded and disabled in the 
sacred struggle to defend the nation, by marrying them; and an 
act of fostering and sincerely looking after orphans and old men 
without sons, like their own sons and daughters and parents. 
  This is a great pride of our party and people, and is the 
true shape of our-style socialism under which the whole country 
constitutes a great harmonious and happy family, sharing the 
destiny. [applause] 
  In the course of vigorously waging the movement to create 
loyal party cells, the party cells and cell secretaries effected 
great improvement in strengthening the organization and guidance 
of party life of the party members. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il stressed that the party 
cells are the stronghold in the party life of party members, and 
that proper organization and guidance of party life are the 
basic mission of the party cells. 
  Only when the party's cell secretaries properly carry out 
organization and guidance of the party life of party members can 
they successfully resolve all problems raised in strengthening 
our party and in enhancing its guiding role. Keenly realizing 
this, the party's cell secretaries are making active efforts to 
establish a diversified and revolutionary outlook on the party 
life among the party members. 
  The party's cell secretaries are consciously leading the 
party members so they realize that party organizations are their 
protector that forges blood ties between the leader [suryong] 
and party members and that looks after and leads them to 
constantly glorify their political life and to love and respect 
party organizations. The party's cell secretaries are leading 
the party members so that they consciously accept guidance and 
control by party organizations. 
  Today our party members truly follow party organizations, 
just as a son does his mother, and call on their party cells to 
frankly speak out what they cannot speak even to their own 
family and relatives, thus seeking new encouragement and 
strength from party organizations and party cells. 
  All of our party members are participating in the party life 
voluntarily and faithfully according to the demand of the 
party's regulations and of the rule in the party life. They 
assumed the position of equal party members worthy of 
revolutionaries who voluntarily joined the party, not at a 
directive of anyone else, for the party and for the revolution, 
regardless of their positions, merits, conditions and 
circumstances. Thus, they are constantly disciplining their 
loyalty to the party. 
  The party's cell secretaries are leading party members so 
that they enhance their consciousness of the party, making such 
consciousness their constitution, and put emphasis on enhancing 
their loyalty to the party and to the leader in the course of 
faithfully implementing the decision of party organization and 
assignment given by the party. They are leading the party 
members so they will successfully carry out the revolutionary 
tasks on a lofty political and ideological level. 
  The party's cell secretaries are leading the party members 
so 
that they correctly realize that the party life is a course of 
implementing the revolutionary tasks assigned by the party and 
the purpose of strengthening the party life is to satisfactorily 
carry out the revolutionary tasks. The party's cell secretaries 
make efforts to ensure that all factors involving party 
conference, summing up of the party life, organization of 
assignments, study, and guidance of party life, will contribute 
to implementing revolutionary tasks. The party's cell 
secretaries are leading the party members so that they play the 
vanguard role in satisfactorily implementing the revolutionary 
tasks. 
  By establishing the revolutionary outlook on study among the 
party members, the party's cell secretaries are leading the 
party members so that they will educate the masses with 
temperament and traits as political activists, and will fulfill 
honorable missions and duties as educator and propagandist of 
the masses to actively inspire the masses to implementing the 
revolutionary tasks. 
  The party's cell secretaries are the core of our party and 
primary political functionaries who directly organize and guide 
the party life of party members by bearing the responsibility 
for our party's lowest [maltan] basic organizations. Therefore, 
it is a prerequisite and important guarantee for strengthening 
the party cells to properly organize the party's cell 
secretaries and to enhance their role. 
  After the national lecture of party cell secretaries party 
committees at all levels held more firmly meetings of party cell 
secretaries, attended by those party members who are infinitely 
loyal to the party and the leader [suryong], whose party and 
working class position are firm, and who enjoy confidence among 
party members and are firmly prepared politically and 
administratively. 
  Party organizations, including party committees of 
Mangyongdae-kuyok of Pyongyang, Onsong County of North Hamgyong 
Province, and Songjin Steel Works, have given the work 
directives to party cell secretaries in a timely manner, and 
organized lectures, workshops, and discussion sessions for party 
cell secretaries on a regular basis and in a substantial manner. 
In these party organizations, party functionaries directly go on 
the spot to assist party cell secretaries in conformity with the 
party's demand, "Let us party functionaries mingle with party 
cells and the masses." 
  Today, our party has hundreds of thousands of vigorous and 
militant party cells which have grown up with the first party 
organization organized by a few young communists in the period 
of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle as the parent body. 
Through these party cells our party members and people are 
breathing together with our party regardless of whether they 
live in remote rural villages, islands, and oceans which are far 
from the fatherland. [applause] 
  Party cells and party cell secretaries have more firmly 
rallied the masses of all strata around the party by properly 
carrying out their work with the masses. The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il has elucidated that properly carrying out the work 
with the masses is an important problem related to the destiny 
of the party and the revolution and that it is an important duty 
of party cells and party cell secretaries. 
  Party cells and cell secretaries, by concentrating special 
efforts on their work with the masses, have seen to it that they 
thoroughly abide by their class position without forgetting 
their past situation and class origin and play the leading role 
in upholding the party and the leader [suryong] and safeguarding 
and defending socialism. Party cells have led the bereaved 
families of revolutionaries, the families of fallen soldiers, 
the families of those killed by the enemy, disabled veterans, 
and discharged soldiers, and other core masses to be model in 
all fields of their work and life and to be loyal to the party 
and the leader generation after generation. 
  By paying interest to indoctrinating young people of new 
generations, who are the successors to our revolution, in a 
revolutionary manner party cells and cell secretaries are 
fostering all of them into young vanguards who are infinitely 
loyal to the party, the leader, and the socialist cause like the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters--who were infinitely loyal 
to the great leader [suryong] on the days of anti-Japanese 
struggle--and like the heroic fighters--who struggled for the 
party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people at the risk of 
their lives during the fatherland liberation war. 
  Party cell secretaries have become the standard bearers who 
lead intellectuals in their units to carry out the oath they 
swore before the party at the Korean intellectuals meeting and, 
thus, to perform the honorable mission and duty as the party's 
eternal companion, faithful supporter, and outstanding adviser 
and as the enthusiastic protector and thorough implementer of 
the party's policy in the rewarding struggle of resolutely 
safeguard and defend the party and the leader [suryong] and of 
demonstrating the honor of chuche Korea and further 
strengthening the might of our own style socialism. 
  Party cells and cell secretaries trust the masses as 
indicated in the party policy of putting emphasis on their 
present work and lives, rather than on their family background 
and social and political life habit. They are also leading the 
masses to sincerely trust the party and follow it. 
  It is thanks to the devoted struggle and unheralded efforts 
of all party cell secretaries that the WPK has been strengthened 
and developed into an ever-victorious revolutionary party taking 
roots deep among the masses and that our party and people are 
winning victory in succession in the political and military 
confrontation with the enemies who are running wild to crush our 
socialist cause. [applause] 
  By exerting efforts to possess the 10 characters of cell 
secretaries set forth by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
our party cell secretaries are fondly called "our cell 
secretary," "our cell secretary father" among party members and 
working people and are highly respected and loved. 
  Among our party cell secretaries, there are martyrs like 
Comrade Nam Sung-u, the late party cell secretary of Unit 3, Pit 
No. 3 of Chuhung Mine, who sacrificed himself without hesitation 
to save a revolution comrade at a critical moment; and there are 
models of war victory movement of the nineties like Comrade Son 
Suk-chin, secretary cell No. 7 of the People's Clinic of Hosan 
County, who devoted her all for the recovery of patients working 
as a nurse for 35 years since her days as a short-haired young 
girl. 
  The tens of thousands of party cell secretaries, who are 
endlessly loyal to the party and the leader and devoting their 
everything for the fatherland and the people, are precious 
treasures for our party and revolution. It is our party and 
people's great pride to have such outstanding party cell 
secretaries. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il are putting the party cell secretaries at 
the highest by calling them our party's core, professional 
revolutionaries without particular position, and unpaid and 
unheralded heroes, and are warmly holding their hands and 
leading them to properly implement their honorable mission and 
duty as the supervisors of the lowest basic-level party 
organization and elementary political functionaries. 
  The WPK was given birth and brought up by the mother body 
Construction Comrades Company, which was our party's first party 
organization personally formed by the great leader. The fact 
that the WPK was able to strengthen and develop itself into an 
ever-victorious indomitable party with tens of thousands of 
combat party cells endlessly loyal to the party, the leader, and 
the chuche revolutionary cause; and the fact that our party cell 
secretaries were able to fulfill their honorable mission and 
obligations as elementary political functionaries in charge of 
the party's basic organizations while leading happy lives and 
walking along the single rewarding road of struggle are indeed 
wholly a result of the wise leadership and family love of the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il and a great victory and lofty fruition of our party's 
unique line for the construction of party organizations. 
[applause] 
  Taking the opportunity of the meaningful occasion of the 
meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party, I pay the 
utmost honor and the warmest thanks to the great leader of our 
party and our people Comrade Kim Il-song, and to our party's 
outstanding leader and the supreme commander of the Korea 
People's Army [KPA] dear Comrade Kim Chong-il with the single 
heart of enthusiastic admiration and endless loyalty from the 
meeting participants and all the party members and people. 
[applause] 
  Comrades, our revolution, which has victoriously advanced 
under the banner of chuche ideology, stepped into a new stage of 
development today, and our party and people are faced with the 
weighty and honorable task of defending and advocating the 
popular masses-centered socialism of our style from the 
challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries, endlessly 
developing it, and expediting the achievement of the nation's 
long-cherished desire of the cause of fatherland reunification. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To smash 
[chitpusigo] all kinds of challenges and interfering maneuvers 
of the imperialists and reactionaries, and to defend, advocate 
and further glorify our socialism is an honorable task of our 
party and people. 
  As in the past, so in the future, we should vigorously 
expedite the ultimate victory of chuche revolutionary cause and 
socialist cause by courageously overcoming all trials and 
difficulties with the might of the single-hearted unity 
displayed by all the party members and people, who are firmly 
united around the party and the leader, and with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, and by 
continued reform and advancement while upholding the banner of 
chuche ideology. 
  Our-style socialism, which has embodied and built chuche 
ideology under the leadership of our party, is true socialism 
designed in conformity with the popular masses' aspiration and 
demand for independence. Our people have acquired the belief 
through experience from actual living that the road of 
defending, advocating, and glorifying our socialism, which 
guarantees true freedom and equality, and a happy and rewarding 
life, is the only way to a glorious life and to victory. 
  Socialism is our people's living and life. The question of 
smashing the vicious political and ideological offensives, 
military threats, and economic blockade maneuvers of the 
imperialists and reactionaries, and defending, advocating, and 
completing to the end the popular masses-centered socialism of 
our own style depends on how to strengthen the party, which is 
the staff department of revolution, and how to enhance the 
leader role of the party. 
  The party cells are the bedrock which upholds our party, and 
the revolutionary outposts which defend our socialism. The 
party cells are the bases for assimilating the party members as 
revolutionaries and working class, linking them with the party 
Central Committee, and achieving the blood-tie relationship 
between the party and the masses. They are the direct combat 
units for organizing and mobilizing the party members and 
working people to follow and implement the party's line and 
policy. 
  To strengthen the party cells is to strengthen the main body 
of our party and our revolution and an important guarantee for 
advocating and glorifying our socialism. All party cells must 
be strong so that our party becomes strong, and that the main 
body of our revolution can bear indomitable might. When party 
cells properly carry out their functions and roles, the 
superiority and vitality of our country's socialism can be 
highly demonstrated. [applause] 
  In his congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the 
meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: With 
high responsibility and sense of honor, all the party cell 
secretaries should make their cells as loyal cells endlessly 
faithful to the party and as combat cells that vigorously 
organize and mobilize the masses to the struggle to defend, 
advocate, and glorify the socialist cause. 
  In order to make all the party cells endlessly faithful to 
the party and the leader, and in order to make them combat 
organizations for defending, advocating, and glorifying the 
socialist cause, the five major tasks of the party cell 
presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the meeting, and 
the pragmatic tasks presented by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in his historic letter "Let Us Strengthen the Party 
Cells" sent to the participants of the national party cell 
secretaries training held in May 1991 should be thoroughly 
implemented. These are the basic duty and the most honorable 
and responsible revolutionary tasks of the party cell and cell 
secretaries today. [applause] 
  To uphold the unitary leadership of the party and the leader 
with loyalty is the very life of the party cells. [applause] 
  To guarantee the unitarity of leadership within the party is 
the fundamental principle of the party construction and 
activities. When all party cells become loyal cells endlessly 
faithful to the leadership of the party and the leader, the 
party can be strengthened and developed into an ever-victorious 
and indomitable revolutionary party. 
  The socialist cause is the cause of the working class, and 
also the cause of the leader and the party. The leadership of 
the party and the leader is the decisive guarantee for the 
victorious advance of the socialist cause. [applause] 
  Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, 
has been brilliantly inherited and is being developed under the 
outstanding and tested leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, who has an excellent appearance and qualification of 
the people-oriented leader [yongdoja]. [applause] 
  Our party has satisfactorily resolved [wonmanhui haegyol] 
the 
issue of inheriting leadership in compliance with the demand of 
the revolution's development and the popular masses' 
aspirations. This is the proudest achievement in party building 
and firmly guarantees the bright future and brilliant victory of 
our party and our revolution. [applause] 
  All party cell secretaries must persistently carry out the 
work to establish the party's monolithic leadership [yuilchok 
yongdo] system, cherish deep in their hearts great pride in 
upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center of 
unity, the center of unity, and the supreme commander of the 
revolutionary armed forces, and uphold the party's leadership 
with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness. [applause] 
  To have single-hearted, unchanging loyalty toward the party, 
it is important for party cell secretaries and party members to 
positively learn from the firm attitude and position of Comrade 
Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, toward the leader 
[suryong]. Because Comrade Yi In-mo had an incomparable faith 
and will for his leader [suryong], his leader [chidoja], he 
adhered to to the end the revolutionary principle and clear 
conscience as a WPK member despite the enemy's harsh tortures 
and various appeasement ploys when he was serving his prison 
term behind the enemy lines for as many as 34 years. And, after 
entering the embrace of the socialist fatherland, he tried to 
repay the love and considerations of the party and the leader 
[suryong] and wrote refined dedicated poems and lyrics which 
extol the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the savior of his 
destiny [unmyongui kuseju]. Those poems and lyrics impressed 
all people. 
  Party cell secretaries must substantially carry out the 
educational work of instilling a revolutionary outlook on the 
leader [suryong], an outlook on morality, and an outlook on life 
among the party members by closely linking this work to the work 
of learning from the firm attitude and position of Comrade Yi 
In-mo toward the party and the leader [suryong] and his high 
party spirits. In this way, party cell secretaries must raise 
the party members into indomitable communist revolutionaries who 
adhere to the resolves, which they conveyed when joining the 
party, share the same destiny with the party, and sincerely 
uphold the party and the leader [suryong] without any personal 
desire, change of mind, or hypocrisy under any circumstances or 
environment. 
  Loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong] must be 
demonstrated in the struggle for revolution and construction. 
Party cell secretaries must have a revolutionary habit of 
unconditionally accepting and completely implementing the great 
leader's teachings, the dear comrade leader's words [malssum], 
and the party's lines and policies which embodied those 
teachings and words. 
  Party cells and party cell secretaries must positively make 
efforts to more thoroughly establish the revolutionary 
discipline under which the entire party, all the people, and the 
entire Army move like one under the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's monolithic leadership. They also must not allow the 
slightest phenomena to obstruct [chohae] the party's monolithic 
leadership but powerfully wage struggles to overcome [kukpok] 
them in a timely manner. 
  Party cells and party cell secretaries must make all party 
members impregnable fortresses and enthusiastic guns and bombs 
who resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] 
politically and ideologically by devoting their lives under any 
circumstances and environment. [applause] 
  Defending and maintaining the achievements by the party and 
the leader [suryong] and glorifying them generation after 
generation is an important demand for upholding the leadership 
of the party and the leader [suryong] with loyalty and 
completing our party's revolutionary cause to the end. 
  Party cells and cell secretaries should lead all party 
members and the working people so that they can firmly arm 
themselves with our party's revolutionary tradition, resolutely 
safeguard and defend it, and thoroughly embody it in their work 
and life. Those party cells which received the on-the-spot 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il should thoroughly implement the 
tasks presented at the on- the-spot guidance to demonstrate a 
model in all aspects. 
  It is the basic duty of party cells to foster party members 
to be resolute revolutionaries who carry out indomitable 
struggles for the party, for the revolution, and for the victory 
of the socialist cause by properly organizing and guiding party 
members' party life. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Properly 
carrying out the organization and guidance for party members' 
party life is the basic duty of party cells and is also an 
important key to successfully solve all problems. 
  Party cells are the strongpoint of the party life of party 
members. They are also the basic unit which directly organize 
and guide their party life. Party cells should grasp the 
organization and guidance to party members' party life as the 
basis of party cells' work and concentrate great efforts on 
this. Thus, party cells should foster party members into 
indomitable revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to the 
party and the leader [suryong] and who risk their lives to 
struggle for the victory of the socialist cause of chuche. 
  Party cells should strengthen the organization and guidance 
to the party life of cadres, who are the commanding members of 
the revolution, and, thus, should thoroughly revolutionize them. 
Party cells and cell secretaries should see to it that cadres 
who lead party lives under their units become standard bearers 
and hands in upholding the party and the leader [suryong], 
enthusiastic communist revolutionaries who fight to the end with 
loyalty for the party and the leader with the firm determination 
to defend the revolutionary outposts assigned by the party at 
the risk of their lives, and genuine servants who devotedly 
serve the people. 
  Important in party life organization and guidance is to 
establish a voluntary and revolutionary party life habit among 
party members. Party members cannot live for even a moment nor 
maintain their political life apart from their party 
organization. Party cells should see to it that all party 
members emulate the lofty model of the view of the party 
organization that the great leader Comrade and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il have personally shown and, thus, respect 
and treasure party organizations and make active efforts to 
willingly receive the guidance and control of party 
organizations. 
  Party cells should see to it that party members are clearly 
aware of the regulations of the party and the rule of party 
life, lead their party life in accordance with these regulations 
and rule, and sincerely implement party organizations' decisions 
and assignments. 
  Party meetings, summing-up sessions of party life, and party 
lectures are important in party organizational and ideological 
life. Party cells should thoroughly do away with such phenomenon 
of sticking to unnecessary formalities and conducting empty 
talks in their general cell meetings and should see to it that 
all party members fully present their creative and constructive 
opinions at the general meetings by properly carrying out 
meeting preparations and operations. At the same time, party 
cells should also establish a strong discipline under which 
party members do not fail to implement the problems discussed 
and decided on at party cell meetings in a timely manner. 
  Party cells should lead party members so that they can 
sincerely and conscientiously present summaries at their party 
life summing-up meetings and frankly accept fellow comrades' 
criticism and make sincere efforts to correct their mistakes. 
  Party cells should properly hold study sessions and lectures 
in close combination with reality so that party members can 
obtain political nutrition and good knowledge and technology 
which can be used in carrying out revoltuionary tasks. Party 
cells should correctly organize and guide party members' party 
life in close combination with the implementation of their 
revolutionary tasks so that all party members can play a leading 
and model role in the implementation of their revolutionary 
tasks. 
  It is the responsible duty of the party cell to make the 
broad masses firmly unite around the party by properly carrying 
out the work with the masses. The work with them is an 
important work to consolidate the party's mass-oriented 
foundation and to strengthen the main force of the revolution. 
  Our people were able to become ever-victorious in the ardent 
and harsh road of the revolution in which they had to go through 
a sea of fire and blood in fighting against Japan; conduct a 
fierce battle against the U.S. imperialists -- who are proud of 
being the greatest power in the world; rise to their own feet 
again on the ruins of war in which everything was destroyed; and 
fiercely struggle against the imperialists who wanted to crush 
[apsal] our socialism. This is due to the single-hearted unity 
of all the people firmly united as one around the party and the 
leader [suryong]. 
  Today our revolution is being vigorously advanced under the 
leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is 
endlessly loyal to the popular masses' cause for independence. 
Also, the tradition of single-hearted unity has been 
excellently inherited. [applause] 
  To firmly consolidate the great unity and cohesion of 
loyalty 
and filial piety which have been handed down generation after 
generation, we must lead all people to more firmly unite around 
the party by constantly concentrating great efforts on the work 
with the broad masses. 
  In carrying out the work with the masses, it is very 
important to enhance the role of party cells and the party cell 
secretaries who are directly engaged in the work with the masses 
and who live together with them. The party cells and the party 
cell secretaries must foster the popular masses to become the 
cornerstone [chosok] that can truly and constantly uphold the 
party and the leader [suryong] and to be the enthusiastic 
revolutionaries loyal to the socialist cause and not forgetful 
of their origins, by concentrating preferential efforts on the 
work with the masses, a class foundation of the party. 
  The party cells must lead the bereaved family members of the 
revolutionaries, the bereaved war family members, the family 
members victimized by enemy barbarities, and the key members of 
our party, including heroes and veterans, to set an example for 
their works and lives by excellently carrying out their pledge 
of loyalty made to the party during the national meeting of 
heroes, the national meeting of the family members of martyrs, 
and the national meeting of veterans, and to be endlessly loyal 
and dutiful to the party and the leader [suryong] generation 
after generation. [applause] 
  The party cells must vigorously carry out the work of making 
all agricultural working people become loyal to the party, the 
leader [suryong], and the socialist cause to the end by 
constantly strengthening the leadership role of the working 
class. 
  Youth are the successors to our revolution, flowers of the 
future, and the most powerful army units in our society. Only 
when the loyalty and revolutionary spirit of the previous 
generation who braved the ardent storm of the revolution under 
the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] are 
constantly handed down to the next generation can our 
revolution's life be strongly retained and the socialist cause 
be endlessly consummated. 
  The party cells must foster all members of the League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] to become the true 
vanguard fighters who resolutely safeguard the party and the 
leader [suryong] and take the lead in implementing our party's 
plans and intents after becoming five million rifles and bombs, 
as well as 5 million (Yi Su-poks), by actively backing the work 
of the primary LSWYK organizations to implement their pledge 
made to the party during the eighth meeting of the LSWYK. 
[applause] 
  The party cells must properly carry out the work with 
intellectuals so that they can properly carry out their 
honorable mission and duty with their high revolutionary 
awareness and clean communist consciousness, as the eternal 
companions, the faithful supporters, the outstanding advisers of 
our party, and as the warm supporters and the thorough 
implementors of party policy, thus brilliantly carrying out 
their pledge made to the party during the meeting of Korean 
intellectuals. [applause] 
  Party cells should properly carry out work with the masses 
of all strata who have different social and political life 
circumstances, upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
noble polititics of benevolence, so that they sincerely trust 
and follow our party and faithfully work, devoting their all for 
the party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people. 
[applause] 
  Party cells and cell secretaries should properly lead cadres 
to take the initiative, party members to play the leading and 
key role, and public organizations to vigorously wage work with 
their members in conformity with their duty and characteristics 
in further strengthening the singlehearted unity of the party 
and the revolutionary ranks by embodying our party's traditional 
work method in which one person indoctrinates and moves 10 
persons, 10 persons indoctrinate and move 100 persons, 100 
persons indoctrinate and move 1,000 persons, and 1,000 persons 
indoctrinate and move 10,000 persons. 
  Effecting constant innovations and upsurges in socialist 
construction by vigorously waging the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--is an 
important revolutionary task facing party cells. The three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--are the 
revolutions at the highest plane to completely realize the 
popular masses' independence. Therefore, the key and basic way 
of effecting revolutionary upsurges on a continuous basis in 
socialist construction lies precisely in vigorously waging the 
three revolutions. 
  Party cells should vigorously carry out the ideological 
revolution, grasping it as a most priority revolution. The 
ideological revolution is an important work which strengthens 
the main force of the construction of socialist and communist 
society by making all people revolutionary, assimilating them 
into the working class, making them socialist, and modeling them 
after the chuche idea. It is also the basis in human reform 
work. 
  Confrontation between socialism and capitalism is synonymous 
with ideological confrontation. The imperialists are 
strengthening more viciously then ever before the ideological 
and cultural offensives to break up the peosple's faith in 
socialism and to destroy the revolutionary ranks politically and 
ideologically. 
  To thoroughly smash ideological and cultural infiltration by 
imperialism and to firmly protect the purity of socialist 
ideology, it is imperative to give priority to the ideological 
revolution over all work and, thus, to firmly arm all party 
members and the working people with independent ideological 
consciousness. 
  The basis in carrying out the ideological revolution is to 
firmly arm all people with the chuche idea, which is the only 
guiding ideology of our party, the revolution, and socialism. 
  Party cells should constantly strengthen indoctrination in 
the chuche idea among party members and the working people so 
that they take the chuche idea as their firm faith and think, 
work, and live in accordance with the demands of the chuche idea 
wherever and whenever. 
  Party cells should resolutely struggle against all sorts of 
old and reactionary ideologies, including capitalist ideology, 
revisionism, dogmatism, and flunkeyism, and, thus, should 
prevent different ideologies running counter to the chuche idea 
from infiltrating into our society. Party cells should conduct 
ideological indoctrination work among party members and the 
working people in a substantial manner to make loyalty to the 
party and the leader the faith, conscience, morality, and 
routine life, to firmly arm them with the Korean-nation-is-first 
spirit, and to lead them to live our own style. Thus, party 
cells should foster party members and the working people to 
become enthusiastic revolutionaries and genuine patriots who 
struggle for the party, the leader, the grandeur and prosperity 
of the socialist fatherland, and the final victory of the chuche 
revolutionary cause, devoting their all. 
  Socialism is mankind's ideal. It is the rule of history that 
socialism wins victory in the struggle against capitalism. 
  Party cells and cell secretaries should conduct in various 
up-to-date forms and methods not only the indoctrination to 
plant firm faith in and strong will of the victory of the chuche 
revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, among party members 
and the working people, but also the indoctrination to lead them 
to view and judge all social phenomena from a working class 
viewpoint and from the revolutionary principle, to clearly know 
the inherent nature of imperialist aggression and the 
inevitability of defeat of capitalism, and to resolutely 
struggle for the victory of the socialist cause. 
  Party cells should conduct indoctrination to influence 
people substantially by positive examples to make the beautiful 
communist virtues of helping and leading each other, of being 
all for one and one for all, and of sharing joy and sorrow bloom 
further throughout the whole society. At the same time, party 
cells should also fill the whole society with the noble and 
revolutionary ethos. 
  Party cells should concentrate great efforts on carrying out 
the cultural revolution so that all party members and the 
working people have high creative ability and enjoy a genuine 
socialist cultural life. The cultural revolution is a task to 
lead all people to enjoy a cultural life to their hearts' 
content by liberating them from the constraint of old culture, 
making them have a high technological and cultural level, and 
creating a socialist culture which serves the popular masses. 
  Party cells should actively contribute to making 
intelligentsia of the whole society by establishing a 
revolutionary study habit among party members and the working 
class. Party cells should assiduously build all work sites, 
villages, streets, and houses so that all the people can enjoy 
working and living under cultural circumstances and conditions. 
  In particular, party cells should thoroughly implement the 
five major tasks of completing electrification, the introduction 
of piped water services, and (urbanization) of rural areas to a 
higher level and of realizing the introduction of the 
central-heating system and the introduction of the gas system in 
rural villages. Thus, they should eliminate differences in 
living conditions between the urban and rural people. 
  Party cells should see to it that party members and the 
working people bring their wisdom and talent into full bloom in 
developing the socialist culture and enjoy their socialistic 
cultural life to their hearts' content with a lofty cultural 
ability. 
  Party cells at the front of socialist cultural construction, 
including education, science, culture, arts, public health, 
sports, should actively struggle to thoroughly implement our 
party's line of socialist cultural construction to fully 
demonstrate our nation's outstanding ability and wisdom. At the 
same time, party cells at this front should vigorously 
demonstrate the superiority of our own style socialism over 
capitalism in the scientific, technological, and cultural 
fields. [applause] 
  Developing socialist culture is an important condition to 
successfully blocking the imperialists' ideological and cultural 
infiltration. Party cells should vigorously organize and 
proceed the cultural life of party members and the working 
people in conformity with the ideological feelings of our people 
and with the demands of our revolution to block corrupt 
bourgeois culture from infiltrating our society. 
  Party cells should actively inspire party members and the 
working people into the implementation of the technological 
revolution and, thus, should lead them to effect new and great 
upsurges in socialist economic construction. 
  The technological revolution is the basic way of remolding 
nature, liberating workers from arduous work, and providing the 
material and technological foundation that complies with the 
demands of the socialist, communist society. Party cells should 
vigorously inspire party members and the working people into 
implementing the technological revolution and, thus, should lift 
our science and technology to the advanced level of the world at 
the earliest possible date. 
  Based on the scientific analysis of today's situation and 
the 
present status of our country's socialist construction, our 
party has designated an adjustment year of three years and 
presented its economic strategy of thoroughly implementing the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy, 
of giving priority to the coal industry, power industry, and 
railway transport, and of developing the metal industry during 
this adjustment period. 
  The basic goal of our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy 
is to decisively solve the problem of the people's livelihood in 
the two to three years to come by concentrating efforts on 
developing agriculture, light industry, and trade; to regularize 
production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading 
sectors of the national economy; and to fully enhance the might 
of existing economic foundations. 
  Party cells and cell secretaries should vigorously wage the 
struggle to thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary 
economic strategy, holding aloft the slogan of loyalty, "What 
the party decides we will do." [applause] 
  Party cells should continue to struggle vigorously to 
carry out the technological revolution in rural areas, upholding 
the historic letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
to the National Agricultural Conference, so as to actively 
accelerate industrializing and modernizing agriculture. 
  Party members and agricultural working people of the rural 
economic sector should do farm work scientifically and 
technologically in accordance with the demand of the chuche 
farming method, with self-awareness as masters in charge of the 
country's food supply. By doing so, they should realize, 
without fail, the high goal of agricultural production presented 
by the party this year, which marks the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the rural theses. 
  Party cells in the light industry sector should well 
maintain, strengthen, and modernize light industrial plants, and 
should operate all facilities at full capacity to produce 
various quality consumer goods at a large scale, upholding the 
party's light industry-first policy. 
  Party cells in various sectors of the national economy 
should 
actively support light industry and drastically increase the 
production of daily necessities and 3 August people's consumer 
goods in all units. 
  Party cells in all sectors and units of the national economy 
should actively inspire party members to struggle to produce 
many quality export items and to develop processing trade by 
firmly preparing export item production bases and by actively 
exploring and mobilizing technological resources [kisul 
wonchon], upholding the party's trade-first policy. 
  Party cells and party members in the sector of trade with 
foreign countries should actively explore [kaechok] overseas 
markets and gain our credit in trade [muyok korae-eso sinyongul 
cholchohi chikidorok hayoya], in conformity with changing 
environments. 
  In order to realize the party's strategic goals of economic 
construction, it is important to give priority to the coal and 
electric power industries and railway transportation, which are 
primary sectors of the national economy, as well as to develop 
the metal industry. 
  Party cells of the coal industry sector should vigorously 
struggle to firmly uphold our party and our socialism by 
increasing coal production. Party cells and party members of 
the electric power industry sector should use our existing power 
generation capability to the utmost and hasten the ongoing 
construction of many power plants, so that they can smoothly 
supply people's ever- increasing demand for electricity. 
  Party cells of the railway transportation sector should 
strengthen the sector's material and technological basis and 
completely implement the party policy on revolutionizing 
transportation so they can deliver materials required by each 
sector of the national economy in a timely manner. 
  Party cells of the metal industry sector should vigorously 
carry out the struggle to increase steel products, with the 
Chollima revolutionary spirit, which was demonstrated in the 
great postwar Chollima upswing period. 
  We should greatly display the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude in order to completely implement the 
party's revolutionary economic strategies, to smash the 
imperialists' maneuver to apply economic sanctions [kyongje 
pongswoe chaektong], and to constantly effect upsurges in 
socialist construction. 
  All party members and working people [as heard] should 
organize and mobilize party members and working people for the 
struggle to completely implement the party's revolutionary 
slogan "Let us accelerate the general onward march of socialism 
with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude." 
They should also create a new, great revolutionary upsurge in 
all sectors of the national economy with the spirit of the 
nineties' speed added to Chollima, by finding what is lacking 
and creating what does not exist. [applause] 
  It is the party cells' important duty to reliably protect 
the 
socialist fatherland and revolutionary gains from the enemy's 
aggression. We must not, even for a moment, neglect the work of 
strengthening the national defense ability, under today's 
condition that the imperialists are posing military threats 
against us and are viciously conducting war provocation 
maneuvers to crush our republic. 
  Party cells and party cell secretaries should help all party 
members and working people always maintain great revolutionary 
awareness to cope with the war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and help them 
make every preparation to firmly defend the socialist fatherland 
and revolutionary gains under any unexpected situation. 
  Party cells and party cell secretaries should firmly arm all 
party members and people with the chuche-oriented view of war 
and establish a social trait of valuing and learning from the 
military [kunsa] in a sincere attitude, so that they can make 
the whole country an impregnable fortress and make thorough 
material preparations to cope with any enemy attack. [applause] 
  Party cells should vigorously wage the organizational and 
political work to more highly display the traditional fine 
custom of military-civilian unity. 
  The fine custom of military-civilian unity, which blooms 
brilliantly in our country today, is the expression of one 
intention and one will of the entire Army and all the people to 
uphold General Kim Chong-il, our respected supreme commander, to 
the end. It is also the expression of their lofty idea and 
spirit to share the destiny with the party, no matter how 
violent a storm may blow. [applause] 
  Only when the military actively helps the people while the 
people sincerely support the military to achieve perfect harmony 
and unity, can the People's Army be strengthened and developed 
into an indomitable army and win victory in the fight with the 
enemy, regardless of how strong it may be. 
  Party cells should encourage all party members and workers 
to 
always love and care for soldiers of the People's Army as their 
own brothers and sons, who are defending the fatherland in 
snowstorms and cold rain. Thus, they should help the soldiers 
actively, sincerely, and warm-heartily. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique 
provoke a new war, the Army and people, in firm unity with 
respected supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, should rise, 
like a stern mountain, in the struggle to defend the party, the 
leader and popular mass-centered socialism of our own style 
which we gained with blood, and should land an exterminatory 
blow to the aggressors. Thus, we should again display dignity 
and honor of heroic Korea. [applause] 
  National reunification is the supreme national task which 
should no longer be delayed for our party and people. Upholding 
the 10-point programs for great unity of the whole country which 
was personally prepared and published by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar of 
national reunification, party cells and cell secretaries should 
achieve the unity of the whole country. They should vigorously 
carry out the struggle to achieve national reunification in 
accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, based on the confederal 
system. 
  We should make all party cells endlessly loyal to the party 
and the leader and the militant organization to staunchly defend 
and protect and carry to accomplishment the socialist cause, and 
should enhance more highly the role and responsibility of the 
party's cell secretaries. 
  By deeply cherishing a lofty pride and a sense of 
responsibility in being our party's core responsible for the 
lowest basic party organizations, all party cell secretaries 
should devotedly struggle to satisfactorily carry out the work 
for party cells. 
  For the party cell secretaries to fulfill their honorable 
and 
responsible missions and duties, they should completely and 
perfectly preserve loyalty, revolutionary spirit, principle, 
sense of responsibility, creativeness, sense of dedication, the 
mass spirit [kunjungsong], humanity, optimism, and 
integrity--the basic outlook defined by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il--and should make efforts to constantly enhance 
their political working level. [applause] 
  By cherishing the firm determination to share their destiny 
with the party forever, the party's cell secretaries should make 
loyalty to the party and leader their faith and constitution, 
and should struggle by dedicating their lives to the party, the 
leader, and victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, without 
the slightest degree of wavering or change of heart [pyonsim] in 
whatever trial they may face. 
  The party's cell secretaries should carry out all works in 
the interest of the party and revolution with the lofty 
revolutionary spirit and firm principle of the party and class, 
and should staunchly defend the party's policies and line. 
Thus, they should become the standard-bearers of the revolution 
and struggle to lead the masses at the van of the struggle to 
implement the party's policies and lines. 
  The party cell secretaries should endlessly love and respect 
the people with a precise outlook on the masses, and should 
become genuine servants who faithfully serve the people. 
  The party cell secretaries should always share the joys and 
pains of the people according to the demand of the slogan put 
forward by the party, "We serve the people," and should listen 
to their voices. The party's cell secretaries should strive to 
determine the difficulties and demands of the people with a 
motherly love and should resolve them in a timely manner. 
  The party cell secretaries should never wield power or 
expect privileges and special favors. Instead, they should 
always lead a clean and upright life. 
  The party cell secretaries should make constant efforts to 
enhance their political working level. Unless they constantly 
enhance their standard in compliance with the demand of 
developing realities, they cannot precisely organize and lead 
the party life of the party members nor can they rightfully 
organize and mobilize the party members to implement the party's 
policies. 
  By studying hard and making constant efforts, the party cell 
secretaries should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche 
idea, policies, and lines. Thus, they should prepare themselves 
to become able functionaries with lofty working-level 
capabilities. 
  Party organizations at all levels, including city and county 
party committees, should make the conference of the party cell 
secretaries a meeting of the core party members who are 
unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader, whose party 
spirit and working-class position are firm, who are trusted by 
the masses, and who have lofty, political, working-level 
ability. All party functionaries should go down to the party 
cells, and should properly help and substantively teach cell 
secretaries. 
  Our party treasures the party cell secretaries as its core 
and precious valuables. Through cell secretaries, our party is 
leading the party life of all cadre members and party members, 
and has forged blood ties with all people. Thus, our party 
organizes and mobilizes party members and workers to implement 
the party's policies and lines. 
  Trust in and expectations for the party cell secretaries by 
our party and people are indeed great. The participants in the 
meeting and all cell secretaries of the whole party should 
excellently fulfill their honorable missions and duties in the 
struggle to further strengthen our party and to defend, protect, 
and accomplish the chuche revolutionary cause--the socialist 
cause--and should meet without fail the lofty trust and 
expectations by the party and people. [applause] 
  Our revolutionary cause is just, and our victory is sure. As 
long as we have the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary 
leadership of the great leader and great party, the immortal 
chuche idea, the heroic people firmly rallied behind the 
outstanding leader, the firm, self-reliant national economy, and 
the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed forces, no strength 
in the world can block our victorious advance. [applause] 
  Our party and people will not retreat even a step from the 
revolutionary road which we chose ourselves, no matter how 
complex or how acute a situation may be created and no matter 
how grave the trial or difficulties of our revolution become. 
We will effect a greater victory in the future, as we have in 
the past, in the struggle to further glorify popular 
mass-centered socialism of our own style by following the wise 
leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] and 
outstanding leader [tagwolhan yongdoja] with revolutionary 
optimism and with the firm conviction in the justness of our 
cause and of our victory. [applause] 
  Let us all vigorously fight to strengthen and develop our 
party into a glorious chuche-type revolutionary party forever in 
firm unity with the party Central Committee headed by the 
respected Comrade Kim Il-song by upholding the ever-victorious 
banner of the chuche idea. Let us all vigorously advance to the 
final victory of the socialist cause, the party's cause. 
[applause] [shouting of slogans, "Let us become the vanguard 
and shields to defend with our lives the great leader and dear 
comrade leader!" "All party cell secretaries should thoroughly 
carry to accomplishment the five-point tasks of the party 
cells!" "Let us uphold supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il 
with single-hearted unity!"]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Public organizations 
and figures of different countries have published special issues 
of bulletins and statements on the occasion of the birthday of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The Togo-Korea Friendship Association recently released a 
special issue of its bulletin. 
  The bulletin said in an article entitled "President Kim 
Il-song Is Veteran of World Politics": 
  Comrade Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea was known in the 1940s as the youngest state leader in the 
world. 
  Still now, when nearly half a century has passed since then, 
he is publicly recognized as the most experienced and 
authoritative veteran of world politics and leader. 
  In another article entitled "The President's Outlook on 
cvalue of Happiness" the bulletin wrote that the whole life of 
President Kim Il-song is a history of love devoted to the people. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of 
the DPRK and the Maputo City Committee of the Frelimo Party 
jointly issued a bulletin on the occasion of April 15. 
  Stephen Nkomo, Politburo member and secretary of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the Zimbabwe African National 
Union-Patriotic Front, in a statement issued to the press on the 
occasion of the birthday of President Kim Il-song said President 
Kim Il-song is the genius of geniuses and the great of great. 
  He said the Korean people and the world people deeply 
respect, follow and hold him in high esteem because he has made 
immortal contributions to accomplishing the cause of 
independence of the popular masses with his distinguished idea, 
rare ability of leadership and noble popular virtues. 
  T.B. Mukherjee, president of the Asian Regional Institute of 
the Chuche Idea, said in an interview with the KCNA 
correspondent in his country: 
  The chuche idea founded by President Kim Il-song holds the 
most brilliant place in his revolutionary activities, and it is 
of epochal significance in the development of human thought and 
the accomplishment of the cause of independence. 
  He enjoys deep respect of the world's progressive people for 
his undying exploits and contributions to the times and mankind. 
  It is the greatest fortune of the people aspiring after 
independence in the present era that they have President Kim Il- 
song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The birthday of the 
great leader President Kim Il-song was celebrated in different 
countries. 
  A celebration meeting was held in Moscow on April 1. 
  Vladimir Tolstikov, chairman of the Central Council of the 
Russian Association for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in his opening 
address said that the people of the world are now significantly 
celebrating the birthday of President Kim Il-song. "His life is 
the life of an ardent patriot and an outstanding revolutionary," 
stressed tolstikov. 
  Russian writer Vladimir Uspenskiy in his speech said: 
  "President Kim Il-song is the most distinguished leader in 
the international political circles. The Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea was founded and has been developed by the 
chuche idea founded by him. The Korean people are now advancing 
under the uplifted banner of the chuche idea in face of the 
machinations of the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries." 
  Alexandr Kobalyov, professor and doctor of philosophy at 
Moscow University, said: 
  "President Kim Il-song is a modest and unassuming true 
leader 
to the people. Under his wise leadership the Korean people have 
become a heroic people, a devoted people and a people strong in 
organisation. 
  "It is the desire of the Korean people to reunify the 
divided 
country in a peaceful way. The day is sure to come when the 
Korean people will acclaim President Kim Il-song at the plaza of 
reunification." 
  Meanwhile, DPRK book, photo and handiwork exhibitions, 
lecture sessions, seminars and film shows were arranged by the 
Stockholm Committee of the Communist Party-KPML (R) of Sweden,

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The Song and Dance 
Ensemble of the Korean People's Army is giving performances at 
the February 8 House of Culture in Pyongyang amid the interests 
of the People's Army soldiers and the working people. 
  The colorful program includes the chorus "Our General Is the 
Greatest," the male vocal solo "Wherefrom Come Exploits", the 
dance "We Are a-Match-for-a-Hundred Soldiers" which present in 
strongly appealing artistic depiction the great appearance of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a brilliant commander, 
the loyalty of the People's Army soldiers who resolutely defend 
him with arms and their optimistic life. 
  The ensemble is the first stage art group of Korea formed in 
March 1947. 
  Since its foundation it has created more than 1,000 stage 
pieces of high ideological and artistic plane which cater to the 
requirements of the times and given 25,800 performances. During 
the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), it put on stage "Song 
of the Defence of the Country", "To a Decisive Battle" and "My 
Song in the Trench" and other famous songs, rousing the People's 
Army soldiers to heroic feats. 
  The ensemble greeted the heyday in its development in the 
1970s. In that decade Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated the 
orientation and ways of creation so that it might conduct art 
activities in keeping with its mission and gave a meticulous 
guidance to it. 
  Under his energetic guidance, it completed the creation of 
the revolutionary opera "A True Daughter of the Party", a 
people's prize laureate, in December 1971. The opera portrays 
heroine of the republic An Yong-ae, a nurse of the Korean 
People's Army who fought courageously during the Fatherland 
Liberation War with unfailing loyalty to the party and the 
leader. The opera has been performed on more than 1,100 
occasions at home and abroad. It is still acclaimed by the 
audience for its high ideological and artistic level. 
  The ensemble has writers Sin Un-ho and Choe Chun-kyong who 
are "Kim Il-Song Prize" winners, people's actor Choe Chang-nim 
and people's actress Kim Ok-son, who are singers, dancers Pak 
Ae-na and Hong Chong-hwa who are people's actresses and other 
veteran actors and actresses and promising new faces. 
  It has produced a merited male chorus and a merited 
Kayagum-accompanied singers group and it is playing a leading 
role in creating a new form of the song and dance performance in 
the country. 
  Vivid artistic presentation of the reality and militant 
dignified and grand style are what distinguish it from others. 
  The song and dance ensemble was awarded the Kim Il-song 
order, the supreme order of the DPRK, for its meritorious 
services in art creation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Great quantities of 
highly efficacious Koryo medicines are being produced by the 
General Bureau of Koryo medicine production in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. 
  According to data available, pharmaceutical factories in 
various parts of the country hit the first quarterly target at 
102.5 percent on the 29th. 
  The pharmaceutical factories under the Pyongyang municipal 
management bureau of Koryo medicine production have topped the 
daily and monthly quotas by expanding the equipment of the 
extracting and enriching processes and raising the standard of 
modernization. 
  The technicians and workers of the central district 
pharmaceutical factory have developed a new pharmaceutical 
material from medicinal herbs abundant in the country and 
introduced it in the production of widely-used medicines by 
pooling their creative wisdom and efforts. 
  The Yomju County pharmaceutical factory under the North 
Phyongan provincial management bureau of Koryo medicine 
production has turned out large quantities of highly efficacious 
medicines with selfmade bonding agents. 
  Pharmaceutical factories under the Kaesong municipal and 
South Phyongan provincial management bureaus of Koryo medicine 
production have produced much more tonics with insam (ginseng) 
and antlers as their main ingredients and widely used medicines 
than the plan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The diametrically 
different social systems in the North and South of Korea 
represent a sharp contrast in the morality of the people. 
  In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which is based 
on collectivism all the members of society devote their all for 
the country and people, the society and collective in a large 
harmonious family. 
  Some time ago, Yim Kwang-chol, a soldier of the Korean 
People's Army, covered a handgrenade with his body on the point 
of its explosion, saving several dozen comrades at the cost of 
his youthful life. 
  A coal miner Kim Kwang-ho threw himself under a coal car 
rolling down at breakneck speed to save more than sixty fellow 
workers and a schoolmistress Hwang Kil-yon died after saving 
children from drowning. They were honest persons of the times 
who dedicated their lives to the society, collective and 
comrades. 
  It is not uncommon that men and women become parents of 
orphans and sons and daughters of old folks with no one to 
support them and looked after them like Yu Chong-sil living in 
Haeju and Choe Hye- yong living in Pyongyang. Countless are 
stories about beautiful deeds of working people. To cite a few 
examples, Kim Yong-hui, a nurse at the Kim Man-yu Hospital, 
donated her cornea to a blind man to give him sight, and many 
medical workers donated their blood, flesh and bones without 
hesitation to save critical cases, and train conductresses Kwon 
Chong-hui and Pak Sun-yo found a brief-case containing more than 
200,000 U.S. dollars and bank notes and returned it to its 
owner, Hatsushi Akirashi, sales director of the Nippon Union Air 
Service Company, Ltd. 
  But in South Korea, egoistic mode of life is prevalent in 
the 
society where the people think of only money, owing to the 
infiltration of the American way of life and the anti- popular 
policy pursued by the authorities. 
  A girl O Chong-hwa in Chinju, South Kyongsang Province, 
stabbed her mother to death for money and valuables, a young man 
in Iri, North Cholla Province, knocked down his father before 
rushing to a bank and Ho Nam-kil murdered his son with a dagger 
in Puchon, Kyonggi Province. Such crimes are reported every day. 
  Yi Chong-in in Yongdungpo-tong, Seoul, strangled his old 
parents, saying they were burdensome, profiteers of the Kuro 
Hospital attached to the Korea University threw away a moribund 
patient on to the street when he, without a guardian, could not 
pay the doctor's fee and young men and women killed their 
girlfriends or boyfriends for a few dollars. 
  The South Korean ruling quarters, far from protecting the 
orphans, sell them off to other countries to gain foreign 
currency. The exported children average four thousand annually. 
  To the astonishment of the people, wives of the privileged 
quarters form "gambling gangs playing for heavy stakes running 
into hundreds of millions of won," and unhesitatingly commit 
crimes, travelling everywhere. 
  If such vices are to be cleared away, the working people 
must 
become the master of the country.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
and Swedish companies today signed four memoranda of 
understanding (MOU) including one to establish a scholarship 
fund. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and his 
visiting Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt witnessed the signing of 
the MOUs. 
  The first of the MOU, on the establishment of the Swedish- 
Malaysian Scholarship Fund, was signed among seven Swedish 
companies, namely Armitage Shankf, Bofors Sdn Bhd [Private 
Limited], Celsius Tech, Ericsson Perwira Telecom, SKF Bearing 
Industries, Skanska International Building AB and Volvo/SMA 
(Malaysia). 
  The fund would establish closer links between Malaysia and 
Sweden in the areas of engineering, technology and business 
development. 
  The establishment of the fund is seen as a contribution 
towards the implementation of Vision 2020, the Swedish Embassy 
said in a statement issued through the Foreign Ministry. 
  The statement said the fund would undertake to finance and 
facilitate graduate and post-graduate studies at Swedish 
universities and other educational institutions as well as 
on-the-job training in companies for suitably qualified 
Malaysian students. 
  In the longer term, the fund would expect to provide similar 
opportunities for Swedish youths in Malaysia, the statement said. 
  The seven companies have pledged an initial sum of RM 
[Malaysian ringgit] 1.8 million for the fund. Dr. Mahathir and 
Bildt have agreed to be the patrons of the fund. 
  The second MOU, to construct the Wisma Scandinavia building 
here, was signed by Uniphoenix Corporation Berhad's Mohamed 
Saufi Abdullah, Melker Schorling, the managing director of 
Skanska, and Wisma Scandinavia Property Sdn Bhd's Hans 
Wetterberg. 
  The third MOU, to develop port Langkasuka in Langkawi, was 
signed between Ting Pek Khing, chairman of the conglomerate 
Ekran Sdn Bhd, and Schorling, while the fourth, on technical 
cooperation in relation to hydro-electric power development in 
Malaysia, was signed between Ekran Sdn Bhd and Skanska 
International Civil Engineering AB.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 5 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
hopes that Swedish participation in the European Union (EU) will 
lead to a more liberal economic approach internationally, Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Monday night. 
  He said as a trading nation, Malaysia's future well-being 
depended very much on open and unmanaged international trade. 
  Malaysia had noted with interest the recent completion of 
the 
negotiation process in the application of Sweden, as well as 
Austria, Finland and Norway, to join the EU. 
  An enlarged EU, stretching into the Arctic Circle and the 
borders of Russia, with a single market of over 370 million 
people presents us with an enormous challenge and opportunity of 
increased trade and cooperation, he said at a dinner for Swedish 
Prime Minister Carl Bildt here. 
  He said as Malaysia welcomed the recent agreement on the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations and 
the proposal for a world trading organisation, it hoped that 
everyone would abide by the terms of the agreement. 
  Dr. Mahathir said it would be disastrous if some were to 
renege or take unilateral action. 
  A developing country like Malaysia, he said, had very few 
comparative advantages. 
  When we industrialise we have to pay interest on foreign 
capital, royalty on foreign technology, access to penetrate the 
markets or the rich and considerable amounts on consultancy. 
  Our sole advantage is our lower cost of labour, made 
possible 
by our low cost of living. We have to forgo many luxuries, and 
even some necessities, he said. 
  The prime minister said if this sole advantage was taken 
away, the country would not be able to develop, much less catch 
up with the developed countries, and yet there had been talks of 
levelling the playing field by removing the labour cost 
advantage. 
  Bildt, in his speech, said he was impressed with Malaysia's 
economy and social development. 
  He said Malaysia's racial cooperation was a good example to 
the world. 
  He was convinced of the need for closer cooperation between 
the two countries, especially in trade.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Rural 
development may help Cambodia to counter the threat of the 
communist Khmer Rouge guerillas, visiting Cambodian Deputy Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut said Monday. 
  He said Cambodia wanted to learn from Malaysia's experience 
in developing its rural areas which contributed to the 
elimination of the communist terrorists. 
  The rural development policies of the Malaysian Government 
were also successful in maintaining national unity, he told 
reporters after a briefing at the Rural Development Ministry 
here. 
  The briefing was given by the ministry's Planning and 
Coordination Division Head Zakaria Mohamed Taib. 
  Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and 
international cooperation, said Cambodia needed to develop its 
rural areas to stop its people from supporting the communists' 
armed struggle. 
  For example, if they get water supply, rural industries, 
jobs 
and so on, the need to fight would no longer exist, he said. 
  He said Cambodians could live and work peacefully once they 
put their trust in the government to implement rural development 
programmes. 
  Sirivut commended Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed for 
playing a major role in Malaysia's success and also invited 
Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa to visit Cambodia. 
  The Cambodian deputy premier arrived Sunday with a 10-member 
delegation for a three-day official visit. He will meet Dr. 
Mahathir Tuesday.

  [Text] The Malaysian economy is expected to enjoy another 
good year this year with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
growth projected at 8.4 per cent. 
  The [Central Bank] Report said some of the positive factors 
favouring this growth were prospects for recovery in economic 
activity internationally, the recent conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of trade negotiations and a pick-up in growth in the OECD 
countries. 
  However, it cautioned that inflationary pressures could 
persist in 1994. The conduct of monetary policy would remain 
cautious to ensure that the level of bank liquidity was 
maintained, consistent with sustainable growth. 
  Last year the economy recorded a higher than expected growth 
with a GDP growth of 8.5 per cent compared with 7.8 per cent in 
1992. 
  Market expectations of some moderation in growth for last 
year did not materialise despite initial uncertainty over the 
economy's prospects. 
  On a quarterly basis, growth in real GDP picked up from 
seven 
per cent in the last quarter of 1992 to 7.6 per cent in the 
first quarter of 1993, rising to a peak of 10.1 per cent in the 
second quarter. 
  The Report said that in real terms, the Gross National 
Product rose by 8.8 per cent compared with 7.2 per cent in 1992 
while nominal per capita income rose by 10.1 per cent to RM 
[Ringgit Malaysia] 8,299 or equivalent to about US$3,073 (1992: 
11 per cent to RM7,541). 
  After some consolidation in 1992, domestic demand picked up 
in 1993, with real aggregate domestic expenditure registering a 
growth of six per cent (1992: 2.5 per cent). 
  Real public investment continued to expand by 12 per cent 
during the year (1992:11.1 per cent), mainly to address 
increasing infrastructural bottlenecks and expand social 
facilities and amenities. 
  On the supply side, the strengthening of the economy was due 
mainly to the impressive performance of the manufacturing, 
construction and services sectors. 
  The agriculture sector continued to grow, albeit moderately. 
  Gross national savings rose moderately by 8.7 per cent to 
RM49.7 billion. 
  The ringgit depreciated against most major currencies at the 
end of 1993 and in terms of the composite basket comprising 
currencies of major trading partners depreciated by 5.2 per cent 
from its end 1992 level.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Banking on Prudence"] </F>
  [Text] No Central Bank worth its salt can afford to shape 
the nation's monetary policy on the basis of short-sightedness, 
an inadequate grasp of economic realities and myopic ad-hoc 
improvisations. Any action and decision operating on the above 
justification reflect no vestige of the financial wisdom and 
prudence expected of an important and distinguished institution 
such as the Central Bank. 
  Thus, we find the disclosure by the Governor of Bank Negara 
[Central Bank], Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein, that the bank had 
incurred a loss, which he referred to as a net deficiency, of RM 
[Ringgit malaysia] 5.7 billion in foreign exchange transactions 
in 1993 very disturbing. The transactions were obviously 
carried out beyond the fundamental needs of protecting the 
country's foreign reserves and stabilising the ringgit. They 
were treated as a profit-making venture. No matter how sincere 
and well-meaning its intentions were, the Central bank, in doing 
so, had compromised its prime function of protecting the 
reserves and stabilising the ringgit. 
  The admission by the Governor of this abominable loss may 
place the seemingly endless tirades of speculation about the 
matter in the coffin of history although the loss is, by any 
measure, significant. It is, undoubtedly, a costly lesson but 
it should be a lesson well-learnt and heeded by the bank in all 
its future foreign exchange dealings. 
  We are gratified that the Governor had assumed full 
responsibility for the loss and accordingly, had instituted 
immediate steps to re-instil public confidence by removing the 
officer or officers responsible for the decision and action that 
ultimately led to the bank's losses. At this point there is 
nothing to suggest that a fraudulent act had been committed. 
What went wrong was that the officer or officers responsible 
for managing the bank's foreign exchange trading had obviously 
gone beyond the tasks of protecting our foreign reserve funds 
and stabilising the ringgit but had been involved in currency 
trading instead. 
  We accept the fact that monetary policy planners are not 
prophets but, surely, they must be able to make forecasts and 
formulate a monetary direction based on a deep understanding of 
economic fundamentals. More importantly, they must be capable 
of differentiating a well-discharged task from short-sighted 
profit- making indulgence, the pulses of responsible 
consciousness from the impulses of money-spinning desires and 
the demarcations of duty from the whims of misplaced financial 
wizardry. Therefore, all future foreign exchange transactions 
by the bank must strictly be for the purpose of defending our 
reserves and stabilising the exchange rate of the ringgit and 
they must be prudently carried out and regularly reported to the 
relevant authorities. 
  Having admitted responsibility for the loss, the position of 
Tan Sri Jaffar as the Governor of the bank is no longer tenable. 
Although he did not say when he will submit his resignation, he 
did inform the press that when he does, they would be the third 
-- after the Prime Minister and Finance Minister -- to know. It 
is expected that he would submit his resignation before the next 
sitting of Parliament, when Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar 
Ibrahim will certainly have to explain the losses. 
  It is fortunate for us that the loss suffered by the bank 
had 
not affected the nation's robust economy which is projected to 
grow at 8.4 per cent this year. Our economic health is good, if 
not better than ever, but there must be greater accountability 
to ensure no misadventures jeopardise its growth.

  [Text] Davao City -- Senior economic ministers from Brunei, 
Indonesia and the Philippines [no mention of Malaysia as 
published] signed yesterday an agreement creating the East Asean 
Growth Area (EAGA). 
  The agreement calls for the formation of a regional economic 
market of some 40 million people living in Mindanao and border 
areas of East Asean countries . 
  Signing the agreement for Brunei are Pehin Dato Haji Abdul 
Rahman Haji Taib, Minister of Industry and Primary Resources; 
Indonesia's Ir. [academic title] Hartarto, Coordinating Minister 
for Industry and Trade; Malaysia's Tun Daim Bin Zainuddin, 
Minister Coordinating Growth Triangle Projects and the 
Philippines' Rizalino Navarro, Secretary of Trade and Industry. 
  Conference chairman and Philippine head delegate Paul G. 
Dominguez said the document contains strong recommendation for 
expanded air links and sea transport services, expanded 
fisheries cooperation, improved telecommunications, and joint 
tourism promotions. 
  The document was forged following two days of talks among 73 
delegates of the four countries at the Davao Insular Hotel. 
  "It is a dream come true," Syvelyn Tan, project director of 
Private Investments and Trade Opportunities -- Philippines 
(PITO-P) said at the end of the talks. 
  Tan, chief organizer of "Mindanao Worldbound" conferences 
over the past two years, who is also organizing the East Asean 
Business Conferences this May, said it took 20 years to realize 
the dream, first seen by Mindanao planners in the 1970's. 
  Local businessmen said they were "thrilled" at the prospect 
of engaging in power, transport, skills training projects in 
Mindanao's neighbors. 
  Philippine delegate and former senator Vicente Paterno, 
meanwhile, said "the progress of the talks had been very fast" 
since the state visit of President Ramos to Malaysia in January 
1993. 
  He hailed the document as less legalistic than a Memorandum 
of Understanding and more business-like. 
  The signing rites marked the climax of President Ramos' 
economic diplomacy to increase cooperation in the East Asean 
subregion, Dominguez said. 
  He said the desire of the four countries of Brunei, 
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to establish EAGA was 
confirmed bilaterally over the next one and half years.

<F P=106> [By Indochina correspondent Harish Mehta] </F>
  [Text] It has been billed as Indochina's big-ticket 
economic enterprise. Backed by Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and 
Vietnam to harness the potential of the region's largest river, 
the 4,350 km-long Mekong, the multi-billion dollar project will 
ultimately create three large economic zones in the region's 
most backward areas. 
  Should China and Myanmar [Burma] join in, the investments 
flowing in is expected to turn into a flood. 
  The four Mekong countries envision the setting-up of the 
Strategic Study Projects, comprising the three large economic 
zones, along the course of the river and its tributaries that 
flow through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. 
  These zones will come alive with 11 hydroelectricity 
generation plants, half a dozen harbours and bridges, and an 
ambitious agriculture and irrigation programme to be cranked 
into motion by multilateral loans. 
  But politics often got in the way of economics. 
  The future of the 37-year-old Mekong Committee -- a 
four-country group that coordinates the development -- is in 
jeopardy due to differences among the four. 
  The four dissolved the committee in December 1992 and agreed 
to forge a new deal on sharing the river water. However, a 
September 1993 deadline for setting up a new committee passed 
without agreement being reached. 
  Thailand has now blocked Cambodia's bid to rejoin a new 
Mekong Committee until a water-sharing pact is hammered out. 
  Cambodia, which quit the committee when the Khmer Rouge took 
over the country in 1975, is however, supported by Vietnam and 
Laos. Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly told Thailand not to 
link the membership issue with the water sharing pact. 
  But Thailand, facing a severe drought, wants more freedom in 
using water. However, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia would like the 
four to reach prior consensus before any water is used. 
  Tie Limthong, deputy permanent secretary of the Cambodia 
National Mekong Committee told BUSINESS TIMES [BT] this week: 
"Cambodia has not yet been re-admitted to the Mekong Committee. 
A date for the next committee meeting has not yet been set." 
  Other differences are over inclusion of China and Myanmar in 
the Mekong Committee. Thailand recently proposed the inclusion 
[of] both countries, but as the other three members were not 
enthusiastic, the proposal was dropped for the time being. 
  Efforts to get the committee running are on, and a 
breakthrough is expected. The committee's work has since been 
carried out by an interim committee financially supported by the 
United Nations. 
  In the face of this dithering, the well-fleshed out economic 
zones will have to bide their time. 
  The first one, called the Upper Mekong Navigation zone lying 
up-stream in the north, consists of Myanmar, Laos, and small 
parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan province. 
  The concept to build effective navigation and transport 
systems on the river and its tributaries will benefit a wide 
swathe from Jinghong in China's Yunnan province, down to Luang 
Prabang in Laos, covering distance of about 700 km. 
  The Mekong Committee says that riverine and cross-border 
trade between Laos, Thailand, China and Myanmar will increase 
from the present annual level of 20,000 tonnes to over 250,000 
tonnes in the year 2000 -- of which 210,000 tonnes are expected 
to be transported on the Mekong River, and the remaining on its 
tributaries such as Nam Ou in Laos. 
  To prevent bottlenecks from choking off the Mekong, the 
committee plans an ambitious study. 
  Economic development in the zone was boosted with the recent 
completion of a landmark 700 metre-long bridge over the Mekong 
connecting the Lao capital of Vientiane with Thailand. 
  This makes it possible to drive from Singapore to China 
across Malaysia, Thailand and Laos. The US$30 million (S$ 
[Singapore dollars] 47 million) bridge was funded by Australia. 
  However, Laos was cool to a Thai proposal to build a second 
bridge over the Mekong. The Lao government told the Thais to 
wait until the country's internal roads and telecommunications 
had improved. 
  Landlocked Laos has also been eyeing prospects of trade with 
the Chinese province of Yunnan. Both countries have opened a 
river route to accommodate 150-tonne barges. 
  Cars from Thailand travel through Laos to markets in Yunnan, 
and business is booming as middlemen en route take their cuts. 
  The Upper Mekong Navigation area is also the focus of a 
major 
road development programme. Last year, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar 
and China agreed to set up transport links through the remote 
Golden Triangle -- a move that will give the booming southern 
Chinese provinces their first overland access to Southeast Asia. 
  A second economic zone is the Southern Lao Transport 
Corridor 
straddling southern Laos, northern Cambodia and central Vietnam. 
  The development rationale for this area is to provide 
landlocked Laos with access roads to a seaport in Vietnam. 
  Lao Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha told BT 
that 
his country plans to build a deep seaport in Quang Binh in 
central Vietnam, financed by a build-operate-and-transfer scheme 
or multilateral loans. 
  The idea for a port and a road linking Laos with Vietnam was 
first suggested several years ago by Laos' late president 
Kaysone Phomvihan. Thailand entered the picture when former 
Thai premier Chatchai Chunhawan adopted the concept as a way to 
flesh out his policy of turning Indochinese battlefields into 
marketplaces. 
  Thailand, too, is keen to build economic ties with Vietnam 
and wants to extend a road from Thailand to Vietnam through 
Laos. Under this plan, Laos would serve as a land-bridge for 
Thailand to enter Vietnam. 
  The region is integrating ever closer with an agreement 
between Thailand and Laos to build a road linking the 
north-eastern Thai province of Ubon to the southern Lao province 
of Champassak. 
  A third economic zone that goes by the name of Inland 
Navigation Strategy stretches in a wide arc across Cambodia and 
encompasses a small part of southern Vietnam. 
  The thrust is on improving river-borne transport of people 
and cargo that is crucial to the predominantly agricultural 
Cambodia economy. 
  Destroyed by the long civil war, the river's infrastructure 
such as ports and bridges need urgent repair, and large parts of 
the river are silted and need to be dredged. 
  By far the biggest investments are being drawn into building 
electricity-generating plants in all three economic zones. As 
many as 11 plants are to be built along the course of the Mekong 
and its tributaries in Laos, Cambodia and Laos in addition to 11 
existing plants. 
  The Mekong basin possesses a potential to generate 58,000 mw 
[megawatts] of hydroelectricity. Studies show it would be 
technically and economically feasible to harness about 37,000 
mw. Of this amount, a mere 245 mw -- less than one per cent of 
the basin's potential -- has been exploited through the 
construction of 11 dams along the tributaries. 
  These include the Nam Pong and Lam Dom Noi in Thailand and 
the largest, the Nam Ngum in Laos with an installed capacity of 
150 mw -- 80 per cent of which is exported to Thailand. 
  Power projections in the lower Mekong basin show that demand 
will rise three-fold from about 10,000 mw in 1990 to 24,000 mw 
in 2000. Thailand will account for about 70 per cent of the 
demand and require an additional power generation capacity of 
about 1,000 mw a year from the year 2000 onwards. 
  To hook up the Mekong region, an integrated transmission 
system is planned to link the river-based generating plants 
which will be economically more attractive than either isolated 
national grids or several parallel regional systems. 
  While this is still in the distant future, another regional 
system is set to take off. Next week, Vietnam will be fully 
linked with a new 1,500-km power line connecting the Hoa Binh 
hydroelectric plant, 74 km north of Hanoi to Phu Lam in Ho Chi 
Minh City. 
  The 500 kv [kilovolts] transmission line will supply 2.5 
billion kwh [kilowatt hours] for Vietnam's southern cities. 
  While large projects are the order of the day, the Mekong 
countries are also keen on micro-hydropower to accelerate rural 
electrification. 
  Micro plants -- already operational in some Indochinese 
countries -- are considered environmentally safe compared with 
diesel generators which have mushroomed all over Cambodia and 
Vietnam in order to beat the power shortage. 
  Micro plants, moreover, do no dislocate huge numbers of 
people from their homes and their ecological impact is much 
less. For instance, the 20 mw Nam Mae Kham power project in the 
Thai part of the lower Mekong basin will enable the state to 
reduce electricity generation by a diesel plant to help meet 
demand in Chiang Rai which is just 40 km from the plant site, in 
addition to supplying 5,000 farming families in the area. 
  It's a different story in Laos where mini-hydropower plants 
supplying only the domestic market often turn out to be costly 
as the power market to be served is small and the energy price 
low in comparison to the investment. 
  Still, a 115 kv transmission line from Nam Ngum to Luang 
Prabang is being planned as a first step to electrify remote 
northern Laos. 
  But the line's full power-carrying capacity cannot be 
utilised during the initial years of operation due to the small 
domestic power market. However, by connecting various small 
power plants to the line, the line can operate at full capacity 
right from the start. 
  After Laos, Cambodia has the second-largest hydropower 
potential of over 8,000 mw. At present, the country has a few 
plants, each with a capacity of less than 10 mw and a combined 
capacity of 85 mw. 
  Construction of some of Cambodia's projects, such as Prek 
Thnaot dam, commenced in 1969 but stalled due to the war. The 
process began again in 1989 but got bogged down in issues 
relating to resettlement of some 11,000 people. 
  The Mekong projects also involve enormous river works such 
as 
rehabilitating Phnom Penh port which threatens to become a major 
bottleneck in the water transport system if further expansion is 
not carried out early. 
  All this must wait until the Mekong Committee gets its act 
together.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 5 -- Guangdong Province, the 
People's Republic of China, plans to invest in Cambodia in the 
fields of industry, agriculture, trade and civil aviation, the 
visiting Deputy Governor of Guangdong Liu Weiming said. 
  Liu Weiming who arrived here for an official visit paid a 
courtesy call to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen Friday and said 
Guangdong Province was willing to establish raw-material 
processing factories in Cambodia for both local consumption and 
export, especially to the Chinese province. 
  He also asked the Cambodian second prime minister for 
linking 
direct flights from Guangdong to Phnom Penh and vice versa so as 
to facilitate the merchandises' transportation between the two 
cities. 
  For his part, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said Cambodia 
needs foreign investors and investment must be done on the basis 
of mutual interests. 
  The royal government of Cambodia has requested China to help 
restore a Chinese-built textile factory in Kompong Cham Province 
which will re-employ 700 Cambodian workers. 
  With regard to the above request, the delegation of 
Guangdong 
pledged to do its best so as to put the textile factory into 
operation again.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 5 (AFP) -- Thailand helped Pol 
Pot, the leader of the notorious Khmer Rouge [KR], to flee a 
recent government offensive on the radical faction's resource 
rich headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, Co-premier 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Tuesday. 
  "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to 
prove it," the prince told reporters during a break in the 
second session of parliament. 
  "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being 
attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks 
driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," the prince said. 
  The prince was adamant that the shadowy guerrilla leader -- 
who was responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to 1979 reign of 
terror during which some one million Cambodians died of illness, 
starvation or execution -- escaped through Thai territory. 
  "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such 
good smooth roads in that region," he said. 
  He did not specify how the photos were obtained. 
  Government forces seized the rebel headquarters and the 
surrounding resource rich region March 19. 
  The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organisation by 
selling logging and mining concessions to primarily Thai 
business consortiums, many of which are believed to be 
controlled by or have links with the Thai military. 
  The Thai consortiums that were working in the Pailin area 
were eager for the government to honour contracts they signed 
with the guerrillas. 
  The prince, however, was evasive on this issue. 
  "Before talking about any kinds of contracts we need to have 
regional security from both sides ... we need to request that 
Thailand consider us as the one legitimate government," he said. 
  Although Bangkok has said it recognised the royal government 
and did not support the Khmer Rouge in any way, recent actions 
cast this into doubt. 
  The prince criticised the Thai government for not consulting 
Phnom Penh about the fate of some 25,000 refugees, most of whom 
were the family members of guerrillas, who fled to Thailand from 
Pailin. 
  The government wanted Thailand to give the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or the Red Cross access 
to the refugees in order to give them a choice whether they 
wanted to return to government or Khmer Rouge controlled areas 
in Cambodia. 
  "Where did the Thais send these people? They sent them to 
the place the Khmer Rouge decided they should go" the prince 
said. 
  The prince said he had "lowered himself" to meet with Khmer 
Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan to discuss a peace proposal 
put forward by his father King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  But while Khieu Samphan was expressing his support for the 
peace proposal, Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked a former 
stronghold of the Prince's party in northwest Cambodia and burnt 
down 265 homes, he said. 
  "If we don't attack them they will attack us," the prince 
said, adding: 
  "But the government's stand is that the door is still open 
to 
the Khmer Rouge." 
  He said talks were still possible but they would have to 
take 
place in a different "mood" as the guerrillas had lost 
bargaining power since the government forces now controlled 
Pailin and had pushed the Khmer Rouge out of another major base 
at Anlung Veng in northern Cambodia. 
  Meanwhile co-Defence Minister Tie Banh refused to comment on 
reports that the government was planning to attack a Khmer Rouge 
base at Phnom Malai some 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of 
Pailin. 
  "We cannot say when we will attack because we cannot arrange 
military schedules like some festival programme," he said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
reported that 18 Cambodian Government soldiers, who were 
captured by the Khmer Rouge during a battle in an area opposite 
Ban Khlong Loek, Aranyaprathet District of Sakaeo Province, were 
released at 1530 today. The Phnom Penh Government asked 
Thailand to provide convenience for officials of international 
organizations to cross into the Khmer Rouge-controlled area to 
bring back the soldiers. The Thai Government agreed with the 
request as it is for a humanitarian purpose. The Foreign 
Minister said the Thai Government would not approve Khmer Rouge 
requests on other matters.

  [Text] Here is an additional report on the Pailin 
battlefield from 30 March to 2 April. During these days: 
  1. Our forces continued to block the entire Sala Krau-Kon 
Damrei route. The invading forces were completely cut off from 
their communications and supplies. 
  2. The entire route north of Pailin remained disconnected. 
The invading forces tried hard to contact their colleagues by 
travelling in small groups on foot through the jungle. We kept 
attacking them, though, and they also hit our land mines, 
suffering continuous losses. The survivors fled, leaving 
ammunition, dried food, and medicine along the way. Some fled 
into the dense forests. No one knows whether or not they are 
still alive. 
  3. On 1 April, we launched four attacks on the invading 
forces along a stretch of road from Veal Cheng to Sala Krau, 
killing 18 of them on the spot and wounding others. 
  4. The road from Sala Krau to O Rum-el was blocked by our 
forces in several places. On 2 April, we attacked the invading 
forces fleeing from the western part of Sala Krau in waves, 
killing 42 of them. 
  5. We are continuing to cut off the invading forces from all 
corners, and are waiting in the bamboo forests to smash them. 
They only have a small number of tanks left. These tanks do 
not dare to dash about and launch operations. They are in 
hiding, fearful that we will smash them. 
  6. Every day, we cut off the stretch of road from Suosdei to 
Chisang and Treng. The battle is continuing within the 
perimeter of Pailin and along the communications lines the 
invading forces are trying to use to send supplies to their 
colleagues within the perimeter of Pailin. The invading forces 
cannot bring their dead or wounded colleagues out because they 
cannot get there either on foot or by air. More puppet soldiers 
are continuing to desert the Pailin battlefield for fear of 
being killed.

part of Pailin. We attacked them continuously -- shooting, 
detonating mines, and lobbing hand grenades at them along the 
trails in the thick bamboo forests. We killed 36 of them, 
including a general commander, and wounded some others. We 
destroyed two trucks. The survivors who fled through the bamboo 
forests were bruised by the bamboo thorns; their faces and 
bodies were bruised and their clothes were torn. Some lost 
their way and are still fumbling their way out of the forests. 
Others were killed or wounded by stepping on land mines planted 
in the bamboo forests by the Vietnamese. 
  2. On 5 April, the invading forces mobilized troops to blaze 
a trail from Boeng Pra-lit to O Rum-el through the bamboo 
forests. We ambushed them there. We ambushed them 12 times 
along an 8 km stretch. We killed 19 of them, wounded some 
others, and destroyed two trucks. Some retreated along the 
trail and some fled in disarray into the bamboo forests. No one 
knows how many were killed or wounded or how many were bruised 
by the bamboo thorns. 
  The fighting on 4 and 5 April took place mostly on small 
trails inside thick bamboo forests within the perimeter and in 
the western part of Pailin. 
  3. On 4 April, we completely swept the invading forces from 
Bos S'am, north of Pailin. We killed nine of them and wounded 
16 others. The survivors fled in great panic into the forests. 
  4. On 4 and 5 April, we surrounded and attacked Sala Krau. 
The invading forces were in great panic. We killed 27 of them 
and wounded some others. The survivors fled in disarray into 
the forests. 
  (Lay Veareak), commander of the 12th Division in charge of 
Sala Krau, whose field radio code name is Satan, fled north 
toward Kon Damrei along with 100 soldiers. He stripped off his 
uniform to hide his identity as a general. It is generally 
known that (Lay Veareak) has always been a bandit chieftain 
operating on the border in the Poipet-Sisophon zone. 
  5. Also on 4 April, we opened fire on a car -- a French 
Renault -- and set it ablaze near Boeng Pra-lit. 
  6. On the morning of 5 April, one of the invading forces' 
tanks ran over a land mine and broke down near Pang Roloem on 
Route 10.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 4 (AFP) -- Government forces 
killed eight Khmer Rouge and wounded 11 others when they overran 
a guerrilla division base near the radical faction's former 
headquarters of Pailin in northwest Cambodia, the state news 
agency AKP said Monday. 
  The troops captured the guerrillas' 450 Division base in the 
troubled Bavel district of Battambang province in the operation 
last Thursday after an hour-long fight in which three government 
soldiers were wounded, AKP said. 
  A guerrilla ammunition store, a vehicle and 20 huts were 
burnt by the troops, who also took four prisoners and seized an 
unspecified quantity of weapons, it said. 
  The capture of the division base near Prey Kpos in Bavel 
district came as another blow to Khmer Rouge, on the heels of 
the loss of the ultra-nationalists' headquarters at Pailin on 
March 19. 
  Western defence attaches said a Khmer Rouge division can 
consist of anything from just 100 to several hundred men. 
  The guerrillas in the Bavel area staged recent hit-and-run 
attacks which government officers described as diversionary 
strikes aimed at forcing the army to pull back men from Pailin.

<F P=106> ["Press communique" issued by the Royal Government </F>
Spokesman's Office in Phnom Penh on 5 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] A cabinet plenary session was held on the morning of 
4 April at the Cabinet Office under the chairmanship of His 
Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], and Second 
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen. The session examined a bill on 
the press code, a bill on the organization and operation of the 
cabinet, and a bill on urbanization and the infrastructure. 
  1. The bill on the press code: 
  Following thorough discussion, the cabinet approved this 
bill, which has four chapters and 20 articles on freedom of the 
press and publication as defined in Article 41 of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia [KOC] Constitution and Article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, stipulating the freedoms and 
responsibilities of the press in a multiparty liberal democratic 
society. 
  Although the KOC has just achieved peace and political 
stability, and even though the RGC has yet to solve many 
difficult and complex problems involving national rehabilitation 
and reconstruction, the cabinet was very pleased with its 
approval of this bill, which provides greater freedom than other 
countries in the world that have a long tradition of the press. 
  The cabinet also expressed its firm conviction that by 
approving this bill, the Royal Government will certainly receive 
more active and effective cooperation from press organizations 
in the restoration and development of Cambodia, in the process 
of strengthening peace and political stability, and in promoting 
democracy and respect for human rights. 
  2. The bill on the organization and operation of the 
cabinet: 
  The cabinet thoroughly examined, discussed, and approved the 
bill on the organization and operation of the cabinet, which has 
six chapters and 38 articles. Its aim is to improve the 
administrative structure in line with the KOC Constitution, 
which stipulates the need for a clear separation of executive, 
legislative, and judicial organizations. This law also serves 
as a very important basis for use by various ministries, 
departments, and state institutions as a legal criterion in 
arranging their organizational structures and determining their 
roles and tasks. 
  3. The bill on urbanization and construction: 
  The cabinet also discussed and approved this bill, which 
consists of four chapters and 25 articles. With the current 
situation in the KOC, this is a very essential and necessary law 
for promoting urban and rural restructuring and ensuring a 
harmonious development effort in the spirit of respecting 
collective interests, individual rights and interests, and the 
legal regulations governing construction. It will also ensure 
development aimed at securing a balance between the cities and 
the rural areas based on the prevailing situation and 
peculiarities of each area, while ensuring protection for and 
increasing the value of natural and cultural assets and engaging 
in the development of tourism by preserving environmental 
quality. 
  The cabinet concluded its session in a spirit of unity and 
with a high sense of responsibility.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Japanese Government has 
told the United States it will take "all available measures" to 
ensure the implementation of the recent bilateral accord on the 
opening of Japan's mobile telephone market, the postal ministry 
said Wednesday. 
  Japan's intentions were notified in a letter to U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor from Japanese Ambassador to 
Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, published the same day by the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In the letter, dated 
March 12, the day when the bilateral deal was struck, Kuriyama 
said the Japanese Government will "monitor and oversee 
completion of the actions described in the letter," referring to 
the agreement. 
  If the actions called for in the agreement have not been 
implemented, Japan, in consultation with the U.S., "will take 
all available measures to ensure compliance with the letter by 
the next quarterly review." 
  Under the bilateral agreement, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) will take several steps to help improve access for 
Motorola Inc. of the U.S. to the Japanese market, including the 
establishment of 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula 
telephone services by October 1995. 
  The two governments agreed to meet every three months or on 
request by either government to assess implementation of the 
agreement. The accord came just in time for the deadline for 
threatened U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. 
  Washington had accused Japan of breaching a 1989 Japan-U.S. 
trade accord meant to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones and 
set March 17 as the deadline for an announcement of sanctions 
over its trade disputes with Tokyo.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Evening Network Okinawa" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Regarding today's helicopter crash on Futenma Air 
Station, Policy Coordinator Choko Takayama of the prefectural 
government held a news conference and issued the following 
statement: 
  It is a matter of sincere regret that such accidents should 
happen so frequently, as U.S. Forces just caused an F-15 crash 
on 4 April. We cannot help feeling great anger against repeated 
accidents. Since Okinawa's reversion to Japan in 1972, CH-46 
[Chinook-46] helicopters have already caused accidents 18 times, 
and the latest helicopter crash on Futenma Air Station was 
caused by a CH-46 in October 1992. In addition, U.S. Forces 
have not yet reported to us on what the cause of the 1992 
accident was. We must say that CH-46 is a helicopter with a 
structural defect. The prefectural government would like to 
urge U.S. Forces to suspend all operations involving CH-46's 
until all of them undergo mechanical rechecks. 
  Governor Masahide Ota is scheduled to visit Tokyo tomorrow. 
Taking into account today's accident, he will call at the 
Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency to urge definite action by the Japanese 
Government to prevent the recurrence of accidents by U.S. Forces. 
  In response to the report on the accident, Ginowan Mayor 
Seiken Tobaru stated the following: 
  I am shocked by the helicopter crash in the wake of the 4 
April accident on Kadena Air Base. I was struck with horror 
when I heard of the recurrence of accidents which endanger the 
safety of local residents. I want the national government to 
draw up remedies for such abnormal circumstances. I will file 
complaints tomorrow to both the national government and the U.S. 
Forces. 
  In protest against the F-15 crash on 4 April, the Okinawa 
Prefectural Assembly's Special Committee on U.S. Base-Related 
Problems has decided to call for an emergency plenary session on 
8 April to adopt a resolution calling for all trainings of 
fighter planes to stop. In addition, today's accident provoked 
strong reactions among prefectural assembly members. They are 
contacting members of the U.S. Base Special Committee to 
incorporate their protest against the helicopter crash into the 
8 April resolution.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Japan should be able to use 
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) ships in addition to government 
aircraft and SDF transport planes to evacuate Japanese nationals 
abroad in the event of hostilities, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official said Wednesday [6 April]. The official made the 
comment in connection with the problems involving North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Japan 
would be unable to evacuate an estimated 8,000 Japanese 
nationals living in South Korea if hostilities broke out there, 
unless SDF ships were made available in addition to government 
planes. Private planes or ships will not go to places where 
hostilities are occurring, he said. 
  The official called for early revision of the SDF Law which 
would enable SDF planes to be dispatched abroad to evacuate 
Japanese nationals. Offering his personal view, the official 
added Japan should also be able to evacuate South Koreans who 
have permanent resident status in Japan.

years. The opening of regular flights is the beginning of a new 
history." 
  The fare is 48,200 yen for a one-way trip and 94,000 yen for 
a round-trip. 
  After the welcoming ceremony, the plane left for Sakhalin

city in Hokkaido, will dispatch an official mission to 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in May, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa voiced hope Monday [4 April] that the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will play a more 
prominent role in studying structural problems facing the world, 
a Foreign Ministry official said. Hosokawa made the comment in 
a 15-minute meeting with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye 
at his official residence, the official said. 
  Paye agreed it was a good idea to compare notes on problems 
shared by OECD members and strive together to overcome them, the 
official said. The OECD chief, who is French, said growth and 
employment will be at the top of the agenda of OECD's council 
meeting in June. 
  Paye also spoke of the need to strengthen ties between OECD 
and nonmember countries, the official said. 
  As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Paye 
described his talk with Hosokawa as "interesting and friendly." 
  He also told KYODO News Service, "He (Hosokawa) told me 
about 
his intent to go on with a program of reform, which is very 
important for the further success of Japan." 
  Paye, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day visit, 
conferred earlier Monday with the ministers responsible for 
trade, labor and agriculture. 
  On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with the chief of the 
Science and Technology Agency, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The leaders of the Group of 
Seven industrial nations will likely discuss how to secure 
growth and employment at their summit in Naples in July, a 
Japanese Government source said Wednesday [6 April]. The topics 
of growth and employment will be high on the agenda as the 
number of people out of work in the G-7 nations stands at about 
23 million, the source said. 
  Following the "jobs summit" held in Detroit in March, the 
G-7 
leaders are expected to agree on the need to take measures to 
create jobs, the source said. 
  The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan 
and the United States. 
  The U.S. is also pressing for discussion of labor issues 
such as goods made by prison labor, the source said. 
  Also on the agenda will be financial support to Russia and 
Ukraine, potentially unsafe nuclear reactors in Russia, and 
trade and the environment, the source noted. 
  Personal representatives of the G-7 leaders, known as 
Sherpa, 
are to meet once or twice a month to discuss details of topics 
to be on the agenda at the Naples summit before fine-tuning them 
at a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development in June, the source added.

The regular flight service will be the first to open between 
the two countries since the Vietnam war. 
  The officials said both Japan and Vietnam will operate 
thrice-weekly Boeing 767 flights via Hong Kong or Bangkok. 
Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Vietnam Airlines plan to 
operate the flights. 
  The two countries failed to agree, however, on opening a 
route between Narita Airport, outside Tokyo, and Hanoi since the 
Japanese airport has no additional space, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- The number of Chinese who 
disappeared after coming to Japan to receive higher professional 
training while working for business firms almost doubled in 1993 
to 65, the national police agency said Saturday [2 April]. Most 
of these Chinese overstayed their visas and went underground to 
get higher-paying jobs at places of employment other than the 
original business firms where they received job training, the 
agency said. 
  The number of Chinese who disappeared under similar 
circumstances in 1992 was 35, it said. Of a total 76 foreign 
business trainees who went missing in 1993, 85 percent were 
Chinese. 
  Many of the missing hid themselves shortly before the 
expiration of their agreed training tenures and then overstayed 
their visas to land higher-paying work than their previous jobs, 
an agency official said. 
  The Philippines ranked second with nine missing persons, 
followed by Bangladesh with two, the agency said. 
  A total of 19,000 foreign business trainees from 108 
countries are presently working in Japan, of which Chinese 
account for about 10,000. 
  In addition to the missing trainees, 17 Chinese university 
and college students have disappeared while the whereabouts of 
58 Chinese students of technical and language schools also 
remains unknown, it said. The reasons for the disappearance of 
the students were not immediately known. 
  An agency official said, "disappearances among Chinese 
business trainees may increase further in the future."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday [6 April] for 
a four-day visit, and talks with Japanese political and business 
leaders. 
  Nazarbayev is scheduled to meet business leaders Thursday 
and 
hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the evening. 
On Friday, he is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, 
and hold a press conference. 
  Nazarbayev, 53, is accompanied by Kazakhstan business 
executives and cabinet ministers, including Akezhan 
Kazhegeljdin, first deputy prime minister, and Galym Abilsiitov, 
deputy premier, and minister of science and new technology. 
  In talks between Nazarbayev and Hosokawa, Japan is expected 
to voice support for Nazarbayev's efforts to promote 
democratization, economic reforms and a shift toward a market 
economy, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Japan will give high marks to Kazakhstan's entry into the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state last 
December and reaffirm its intention to cooperate in dismantling 
Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons in accordance with an agreement 
signed last month, the officials said. 
  Specifically, the Japanese Government will agree to help 
people who were exposed to radioactivity near the former Soviet 
Union's Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site by sending medical 
experts and providing medical equipment, ministry sources said. 
  An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are 
left in Kazakhstan. 
  The costs will be covered by 100 million dollars Japan 
pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics dismantle 
nuclear weapons. The four are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan. 
  Also on the agenda for talks are environmental cooperation, 
economic cooperation and expanding personnel exchanges, the 
officials said. The environmental cooperation involves 
preservation of the environment in the Aral sea, they said.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The idea has surfaced within the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] of appointing former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe as LDP vice president to strengthen the party 
leadership in a bid to recapture power. 
  The idea has unofficially been discussed, mainly by 
executives of the Watanabe faction. Some leaders in other 
factions have also made remarks supporting it. Meanwhile, 
although Watanabe has not yet decided whether he should accept 
the offer, he reportedly intends to accept if a consensus is 
formed within the party. 
  It is said that while the idea is aimed at strengthening the 
party's leadership to recapture power, it is also considered a 
means to keep Watanabe in the party amid speculation that he has 
been strengthening ties with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa. However, LDP President Yohei Kono and some other party 
leaders have expressed strong opposition to the idea, saying it 
might cause a struggle for leadership over party operations. 
Thus, it is uncertain whether or not the idea will be adopted 
in the end.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, acknowledging deteriorating ties with new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger], said Monday [4 April] a once widely 
anticipated merger between his Japan New Party (JNP) and 
Sakigake is not "a commitment." 
  The relationship between Hosokawa, the JNP leader, and 
Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and head of 
Sakigake, has deteriorated so badly that the premier 
unsuccessfully tried in early March to dump the top government 
spokesman. The two parties floated the idea of a potential 
merger last summer. 
  The two parties currently maintain a loose 
intraparliamentary 
group within the House of Representatives. 
  Asked Monday to elaborate on the JNP stand on the merger 
plan, Hosokawa replied, "it's still in limbo." Some Sakigake 
leaders are demanding that Hosokawa's JNP honor "the commitment" 
to merge with Sakigake.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [6 April] he has no intention of giving 
up the premiership, reiterating his denial of reported remarks 
by him that he wants to quit, officials close to the premier's 
Japan New Party (JNP) said. 
  The officials said the premier told a JNP legislator over 
breakfast, "I neither said such a thing nor have I developed 
such an idea. I am dismayed." He was referring to reported 
remarks by two legislators that he said Tuesday he wants to 
resign. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, however, told a 
news conference, "Given the circumstances, the premier should 
not make remarks indicating he might step down." 
  Takemura denied the incident will affect the Diet budget 
debate, currently stalled by a dispute between the ruling 
coalition and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's allegedly 
dubious personal finances. The chief cabinet secretary spoke of 
the need for the government to redouble efforts to achieve a 
breakthrough in the stalled Diet business next week. 
  Hosokawa told reporters early Wednesday that he has not said 
anything about resigning over dinner Tuesday evening at a 
Japanese-style restaurant in Tokyo with two legislators of the 
House of Councillors. 
  One of the two legislators, Yasushi Shimomura of the Niin 
Club, a small political party, quoted Hosokawa as telling him 
and his colleague Kiyoshi Nishikawa, "I want to resign as I am 
exhausted." Nishikawa confirmed what Shimomura said but added 
he took the premier's remark as a joke. 
  In the stalled Diet budget proceedings, the opposition has 
pressed the premier to account for his 1982 acceptance of 100 
million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Network, a 
conglomerate at the center of a scandal involving gangsters, 
politicians and money. 
  Hosokawa described the 100 million yen as a loan but 
legislators of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
said they suspect it is an unreported political donation. 
  The opposition camp has also demanded summoning Hosokawa's 
former Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama to testify in the 
Diet on allegations that Hosokawa distributed the money in 1982 
to Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly legislators during his campaign 
to secure the governorship of the prefecture. Hosokawa has 
rejected the demand to have Miyama testify. 
  Meanwhile, the premier's coalition partners scrambled to 
defend him Wednesday morning. 
  Kozo Watanabe, a Shinseito leader, told reporters, "Whether 
it is a lawmaker or cabinet minister, it can happen that a 
person develops a desire to resign when the person is going 
through difficult times." 
  "I think his remarks were carelessly uttered," Watanabe 
said. 
Shinseito is a key member of the seven-party ruling coalition. 
  Watanabe also told reporters, "I believe the prime minister 
has not renounced his determination to continue to live up to 
his prime ministerial duties." 
  The reported resignation remarks "were a mere happening 
whose 
repercussions will fade away in a day," Watanabe said. 
  Watanabe said he contacted Hosokawa by telephone Tuesday 
night to ask him about his reported resignation remark. 
Watanabe quoted Hosokawa as telling him, "It puzzles me why it 
has caused such a stir. I do not have any desire to do so." 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
told 
reporters, "The prime minister denied that he made such remarks. 
We really have to take his denial at face value. He has 
demonstrated his desire to exercise his power." 
  Murayama also denied that the reported remark will affect 
the 
political situation. 
  Another senior SDP official, however, said of the premier's 
reported remarks, "Without question, the premier has lost his 
nerve." The SDP is the largest coalition party. 
  A senior official of new party Sakigake, also a coalition 
partner, said, "Whether the premier made that statement or not, 
he will not be able to revive his fortunes. The political 
situation has become fluid."

  [Text] Mito, April 6 KYODO -- Ibaraki Gov. Masaru 
Hashimoto received more shady political donations during the 
election campaign last September in addition to the one already 
revealed, well-placed sources said Wednesday [6 April]. 
Hashimoto received a total of 1.05 million yen from a surveying 
company and the president of a construction firm, both in 
Ibaraki Prefecture, which had obtained contracts from the 
prefecture. 
  Hashimoto was criticized at the prefectural assembly last 
month for receiving 1.5 million yen from Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries Ltd., which was involved in a bribery scandal 
concerning the garbage disposal facilities in Tsukuba. 
  The Sumitomo contribution was suspected to be illegal since 
the Tokyo-based company was a contractor for the prefecture's 
public works projects. Hashimoto later donated 1.5 million yen 
to a public organization and revised his report on political 
funds during the election campaign. 
  According to an investigation by the prefecture, Hashimoto 
received 50,000 yen from the Ibaraki surveying firm, which 
received contracts from the prefecture. He also received a 
contribution of 1 million yen from a construction company 
president, but this was apparently not illegal because it was 
made by an individual. 
  Hashimoto said it was a "simple, elementary mistake," and 
has 
already revised the declarations concerning the two donations in 
his campaign financial report. 
  Hashimoto was elected governor last September to succeed 
Fujio Takeuchi, who was indicted on charges of taking bribes 
from Hazama Corp., a major construction firm.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The head of the influential 
business leaders' group expressed his optimistic outlook on the 
economy Tuesday [5 April], saying it is heading for a steady 
recovery. 
  "Economic indicators are increasingly showing the evidence 
(that the economy is on the rise) and corporate sentiment is 
gradually improving," said Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan 
Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), at a 
regular news conference. But Hayami, calling the yen's advance 
against the U.S. dollar "excessive," said, "the current 
dollar-yen level will have an adverse effect on export-oriented 
companies." 
  "The U.S. Administration apparently hopes the yen will post 
a 
further gain in the face of a `triple' decline of stocks, bonds 
and dollars," Hayami said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The state of Japan's 
economy remains mixed with good signs and bad, and has entered 
an "extremely delicate" stage, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Wednesday [6 April]. Economic indictors have been patchy 
and the experts are split in their views, Fujii told a regular 
evening press meeting. 
  After describing the current state of the economy as 
"extremely delicate," he reiterated the importance now of 
steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus 
package launched in February. Fujii made the comments after 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno virtually declared an end 
to the three-year recession at an earlier news conference, 
saying the economy is gradually showing signs of bottoming out. 
  Considering a full-fledged tax reform to be enacted by the 
end of the year, Fujii said the coalition government's basic 
policy is unchanged from the aborted "National Welfare Tax" plan 
announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The plan called 
for a permanent income tax cut and an offsetting 7 percent 
welfare tax to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax. 
  A tax reform panel of the coalition parties reportedly 
decided at Wednesday's meeting to compile an outline in late 
June. Japan promised in its March market-opening package it 
would reveal the details in June. 
  The Social Democratic Party, which strongly rejected the 
welfare tax plan and forced Hosokawa to drop it, indicated in 
its policy report Tuesday it would accept a consumption tax hike.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
on tax affairs is poised to offer several options on how to 
finance income tax cuts beyond next year, sources close to the 
panel said Monday [4 April]. These options include a rise in 
the consumption tax rate, a new tax on returns from gambling and 
a cut in tax-free corporate reserves set aside for bad loans, 
they said. 
  These tax increase proposals will be detailed in a report to 
be presented by the Tax Commission to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa by the end of June, they said. 
  In an interim report submitted last November, the Tax 
Commission proposed raising the consumption tax rate, but 
stopped short of making a proposal on how much. 
  The sources said the final report may offer three proposals 
on the size of the tax rate increase -- "big," "medium," and 
"small." 
  The issue of how to finance income tax cuts and how to 
reform 
the tax system in the face of the aging of Japan's population 
have been in the spotlight for months as Hosokawa failed to sell 
a plan to introduce a new welfare tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency on Friday 
[1 April] retained 20 trading companies as government-designated 
rice importers for fiscal 1994, turning down applications from 
other firms to become such agents, agency officials said. 
  The Agency also retained 26 companies as 
government-designated importers of wheat, barley and rye for the 
year that started Friday, they said. It was the first time in 
nearly a quarter of a century that the Agency accepted 
applications from firms other than designated importers to enter 
the rice import business. However, it approved none of the 
applications. 
  Industry sources said a dozen nondesignated companies filed 
applications following Japan's agreement in December at the 
Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice 
market. Under the designated agent system, established in 1957 
when Japan was importing rice, the government imports the grain 
but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Japan has been urged to 
enhance its efforts to secure a stable rice supply in the wake 
of a multilateral agreement to open agriculture markets, 
according to a draft of the annual government report on farming 
obtained by Kyodo News Service on Saturday [2 April]. The white 
paper on agriculture for fiscal 1993, to be submitted to a 
cabinet approval on April 12, has been drafted by the 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry. 
  Japan has accepted a partial opening of the long-closed 
market of the staple food by allowing minimum access to the 
market from 1995 under an accord to be signed by a ministerial 
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 
Marrakech, Morocco, in the middle of this month. 
  Maintaining its stance that a major rice supply depends on 
domestic production, the annual paper said that, to secure a 
stable rice supply, a flexible mixture of imports and 
inventories is needed. Japan has decided to import 2 million 
tons of rice from Thailand, the United States, China and 
Australia because of a shortage as a result of last year's rainy 
and cool summer. 
  The paper said damage on farm products like rice and 
vegetables reached a record high 1.3 trillion yen, having 
serious adverse effects on farmers' households and Japanese 
consumers.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's product liability 
law will not incorporate a provision requiring consumers simply 
to prove that damage from defective products was caused by their 
normal use when they seek damage, under a report approved Monday 
[4 April] by a ruling coalition task force. Consumer groups 
have been pressing for the controversial provision as a way to 
fight court battles over damage from defective products. 
  The report instead calls for a rule allowing manufacturers 
to 
be free from responsibility for damage caused by defective 
products if they prove that such defects were not foreseeable at 
the time of development. 
  Among other proposals, the report rejected a request from 
the 
Health and Welfare Ministry that blood products be exempt from 
the law for the sake of stable supply. The proposals are 
roughly in line with a report presented last December by the 
Social Policy Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister. 
  Government officials said they intend to submit a bill on 
product liability on the basis of the latest proposal by the end 
of April.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Monday [4 April] he will do his utmost to put into 
force a recommendation by the national personnel authority to 
raise civil servants' salaries. Hosokawa made the remarks 
during a meeting at his official residence with labor unions' 
leader Akira Yamagishi. 
  Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
(Rengo), urged the government to raise public servants' salaries 
fully in accordance with the recommendation. "If a 
recommendation is offered, I will respect it and make utmost 
efforts to realize it at an early date," Hosokawa said. 
  The premier was also positive about the idea of granting 
Japanese firefighters the right to organize and engage in labor 
movements. Among industrialized nations, only Japan has refused 
to grant its firefighters such a right. 
  Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, who also attended the 
meeting, proposed the establishment of a new consulting body 
with representatives of the government, labor unions and 
employers to exchange views on promoting employment. 
  Yamagishi invited Hosokawa to a Rengo-sponsored "May Day" 
assembly on May 1 as the government representative.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- A discount race is 
intensifying in the recession-plagued steel industry as Tokyo 
Steel Mfg. Co., Japan's top electric furnace steelmaker, 
announced plans this week to lower prices of H-beam steel for 
construction firms. 
  Nippon Steel Corp., the world's largest steel manufacturer, 
and other major blast furnace steelmakers have joined Tokyo 
Steel in cutting prices of H-beam steel for construction firms 
to make up for slumping demand from automobile and electric 
appliance industries. Tokyo Steel's decision was regarded as a 
challenge to blast furnace steelmakers in anticipation of growth 
in demand for H-beam steel for public works projects, industry 
sources said. 
  The company earlier said it will join four major blast 
furnace steelmakers in marketing steel sheet piles for the 
construction industry. 
  Tokyo steel said it will slash prices of H-beam steel to 
33,000 yen per ton from 40,000 yen. It also said it plans to 
sell steel sheet-pyles at 55,000 yen per ton, far below the 
present average price of around 100,000 yen. 
  The company has opened new branches in Nagoya, Fukuoka, 
Hiroshima and Takamatsu to step up sales of steel products for 
the construction industry.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's electric power 
consumption in February increased 3.4 percent from a year 
earlier to 68.9 billion kilowatt-hours, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Power consumption for nonindustrial use rose 6.9 percent to 
33.6 billion kilowatt-hours, while that for industrial use edged 
up 0.2 percent to 35.3 billion kilowatt-hours, the ministry said 
in a preliminary report. 
  Of the nonindustrial consumption, household use grew a 
marked 
7.2 percent thanks to lower temperatures from a year before 
during the reporting month, while use at office buildings 
climbed 7.5 percent. 
  Large-lot power consumption for industrial use decreased 0.9 
percent for the eighth straight month of declines from a year 
earlier. The slack demand reflected the long-stagnant business 
activity in the materials sector and sluggish demand from the 
machinery industry, MITI said.

  [Text] President Suharto says economic globalization which 
has drastically changed the patterns of production, trade, and 
finance is being accompanied by the emergence of large economic 
groups among developed nations. This has in turn led to 
protectionism, discriminatory practices, and unhealthy 
competition. President Suharto said this during a state dinner 
banquet in honor of Netherlands Prime Minister and Mrs. Ruud 
Lubbers at the State Palace in Jakarta tonight. Accordingly, 
the head of state called for efforts to narrow the economic gap 
between the North and the South through constructive 
international cooperation, consultations, and dialogue. 
  Touching on human rights, President Suharto said Indonesia 
and fellow nonaligned nations as well as other developing 
nations have on various ocasions voiced a clear united stand on 
the matter. According to the head of state, all nations must 
protect and promote human rights through international 
cooperation on the basis of equality. 
  In a return speech, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said he 
regarded Asia as a fast-growing important region. The varied 
traditional characteristics and assets of Asian nations are a 
factor that has contributed to the current growth of the region. 
The prime minister added that Indonesia plays an important role 
in developing ASEAN, attaching importance to South-South 
relations, and contributing to the emergence of new economies in 
the region. 
  An exchange of souvenirs took place before the state dinner 
banquet. The Netherlands prime minister and his wife presented 
President and Mrs. Suharto with an ancient wall clock made in 
1880 and a porcelain fruit container. In return, President and 
Mrs. Suharto gave Prime Minister and Mrs. Ruud Lubbers an animal 
carving, books on Indonesia, batik shirts and material, and a 
set of silver handicrafts.

  [Text] Indonesia's foreign debt -- which has already 
reached $90 billion, or about 180 trillion rupiah -- should be 
given serious attention because it is nearing $100 billion. 
Speaking at a seminar on the national economic situation in 
Jakarta, Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for economy, 
finance, and development supervision, warned that when the 
foreign debt exceeds this level, it will have a psychological 
impact in the form of decreasing confidence by donor nations in 
giving additional loans to Indonesia. 
  According to the minister, the government has set a ceiling 
for commercial loans. The private sector is expected to manage 
their loans in accordance with the government ceiling, set in 
1991. The ceiling is about 10 trillion rupiah for five years. 
Because the level of soft loans and export credits is still 
within normal limits, the government is optimistic that it can 
continue to meet its debt servicing obligations on time.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 5 (ANTARA) -- The investment in the 
non-oil/gas mining accounted only for 3.8 percent of the total 
investment of 415.4 trillion rupiah in the period of 1967 to 
March 1994. 
  The investment in the minerals processing sector reached 7.4 
percent, or 31 trillion rupiah, head of the Investment 
Coordinating Agency (BKPM) Sanyoto told a seminar on the Role 
and Prospects of Private Capital Investment in the development 
of the mining sector in the second long term development (PJP 
II), in Jakarta Tuesday. 
  He explained that investment in mining other than in the 
oil/gas sector consisted of mining of strategic minerals, vital 
minerals and C-category minerals. 
  Strategic minerals including tin, iron ore and copper are 
for 
domestic capital investment of 1.4 trillion rupiah (11 
projects), 7.8 trillion rupiah for foreign capital investment, 
and domestic investment of 187.7 billion rupiah (19 projects) in 
the vital minerals sector including coal, and 5.2 trillion 
rupiah for foreign investment. 
  In the meantime, the C-category minerals such as phosphate 
and zeolit covered 99 projects with a total domestic investment 
of 871.4 billion rupiah, and one project with foreign investment 
of 64.6 billion rupiah. 
  The investment in the mineral mining industrial sector 
outside oil and gas, such as non-metal minerals (cement, 
ceramics, glass and marble) amounted to 24.8 trillion rupiah for 
domestic investment projects and 6.2 trillion rupiah for foreign 
investment projects. 
  Sanyoto said further that in the Sixth Five-Year Development 
(Pelita VI), foreign and domestic investment may reach 19.9 
trillion rupiah. 
  The projection is to help collect investment funds amounting 
to 660 trillion rupiah needed to boost the economic growth rate 
of 6.2 percent per year during Pelita VI, he said. 
  In this context the government has taken steps to improve 
the 
investment climate in Indonesia by simplifying the process of 
licencing of investment projects, the lowering of import duties 
and the simplification of import procedures. 
  He said with a clear-cut and transparent capital investment 
policy, it is hoped the investors will become increasingly 
enthusiastic in doing business in this country. 
  "This is of vital importance, because in attracting foreign 
investment Indonesia has to compete with other countries which 
are also offering their business facilities," he added.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 5 April PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Salute and </F>
Welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government Delegation"] 
  [Text] In response to an invitation from His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of 
the Commonwealth of Australia, will lead a Commonwealth of 
Australia Government delegation on an official, friendly visit 
to the LPDR on 5 April. The multiethnic Lao people throughout 
the country -- elated at this event, which is significant in 
Lao-Australian relations -- feel greatly honored to have the 
opportunity to welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government 
delegation. 
  This official, friendly visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
follows the official, friendly visit to the Commonwealth of 
Australia by H.E. Khamtai Siphandon in mid-December 1993. The 
visit is considered a new and significant event since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 
over four decades ago. This visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
reflects the Australian people's good friendship with the 
multiethnic Lao people. It is also considered a very 
significant event in the history of relations between the two 
countries. It will, therefore, serve as a firm basis for 
strengthening friendly relations and cooperation effectively in 
the immediate and long terms in the interest of the peoples of 
Laos and Australia, thus contributing to the common trend for 
the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship, 
and cooperation among various countries in this region and the 
rest of the world. 
  Laos and Australia have maintained good relations for a long 
time. Over the past 10 years or so, the two sides have made 
efforts to promote relations in various fields. It is 
noteworthy that following the visit to Australia by H.E. Prime 
Minister Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Australian relations have 
developed ever more extensively and rapidly. On this occasion, 
the multiethnic Lao people would like to express their profound 
gratitude to the Australian Government and people for the 
significant support and assistance they have rendered to the Lao 
Government and people in building and developing the LPDR's 
economy and society, especially in building the communications 
infrastructure, training technicians in various branches, and 
developing communities. The assistance in the construction of 
the Friendship Bridge, which serves as a good token of the 
friendly relations and fruitful cooperation between Laos and 
Australia, is noteworthy. 
  We wish H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth 
of Australia, and his party glorious success in this official, 
friendly visit to the LPDR. Its success which will contribute 
to further promoting and expanding relations and cooperation 
between the two countries ever more fruitfully for the benefit 
of the peoples of Laos and Australia.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live] 
  [Excerpt] Ladies and gentlemen, let me first issue a 
statement on the situation in the Korean peninsula: 
  The Philippines views with serious concern the categorical 
rejection by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Korea 
[as heard] of the appeal made by the United Nations Security 
Council in its non-binding call to Pyongyang, issued last week, 
to give the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, full 
access to its nuclear sites. We call on the Pyongyang 
government to favorably consider the request of the United 
Nations Security Council. 
  We welcome reports that a Chinese delegation will visit 
North 
Korea next week to urge a negotiated settlement of the disputes 
over inspections of its nuclear sites. We have been calling for 
China to take a more meaningful role in this potential conflict 
in terms of impressing upon Pyongyang the need to comply with 
the nuclear inspection requirements of the IAEA. 
  We also welcome reports that King Sihanouk of Cambodia is in 
Pyongyang for a visit and that it is possible that he will take 
up the matter of nuclear inspections. 
  We see here the concerns and efforts of the entire region -- 
our Asia-Pacific region -- to ensure that the Korean nuclear 
issue be kept from escalating. We join the other countries in 
the region in calling for the Pyongyang government to take heed 
of our concerns and desires to maintain peace and stability in 
our region. We ask the Government of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea to be more forthright and to continue its 
dialogue with the Untied Nations as well as with South Korea and 
the United States. While the issues appear to be unresolved, we 
remain confident that there will be no outbreak of hostilities.

  [Text] The New People's Army (NPA) has resumed its small 
tactical offensives and has succeeded in getting back under its 
control large areas that were previously wrested from it by 
government forces. 
  In a statement issued on the NPA's 25th anniversary, the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) admitted that the 
leftist underground movement has suffered reverses because of 
errors which it attributed to those who were subsequently 
expelled from the party. 
  But Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal, CPP spokesman, said 
yesterday, "Kasabay ng Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas at 
National Democratic Front, and Bagong Hukbong Bayan ay 
nagpapatupad ngayon ng kilusang pagwawasto upang puspusang 
maiwaksi ang mga kamalian sa maaga at di masustening pagpapataas 
ng antas ng gera at paglalaro sa insureksyon, at upang 
mapangibabawan ang mga pinsalang dulot ng mga kamaliang iyon 
[Alongside the Communist Party of the Philippines and the 
National Democratic Front, the New People's Army is implementing 
rectifications in order to correct errors as early as possible 
and to avoid elevating a war that we cannot sustain to a higher 
level and mocking insurrection; it is also to indemnify the 
havoc brought about by these errors." 
  As a result of its rectification efforts, Rosal said, "Sa 
iba't ibang dako muling sumisigla ang mga taktikal na opensiba 
na isinasagawa ng mga relatibong maliliit na yunit ng Bagong 
Hukbong Bayan na umaasikaso kapwa sa gawaing masa at gawaing 
militar. Malalawak na erya ang muling nababawi sa pamamagitang 
puspusang gawaing masa [In different areas, tactical offensives 
launched by smaller units of the New People's Army which have 
charge of both military and civic activities are gaining 
momentum. We have regained wide areas through intensified civic 
activities]." 
  He did not say which areas have returned to rebel control 
but 
indicated that the Ramos government has not been successful in 
crushing the rebellion as it claims.

  [Text] Speaker Jose de Venecia unveiled P [Philippine 
pesos] 29. 7 billion worth of public works and private sector 
infrastuctural and development projects in ceremonies in Baguio 
City yesterday. 
  Most of the projects were being financed with long-term 
Japan 
loans with counterpart allotments approved by Malacanang 
[presidential office] and Congress, De Venecia said before 
Rotarians from Bulacan, Nueva Ecija Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, 
Quirino, and Cagayan. 
  The projects include the P1.2-billion highway between 
Rosario 
and Pugo Marcos to Baguio City and the P536-million road from 
Naguillan to Burgos, La Union, to the Pines City. 
  With the speaker in surveying the Northern Luzon projects 
were Representatives Rolando Andaya head of the House 
appropriations committee; Representative Bernardo Vergara of 
Baguio City, who helped package the rebuilding program from La 
Union to the summer capital for President Ramos; and Secretary 
Gregorio Vigilar of public works and highways. 
  At the former Camp John Hay gathering, De Venecia said 
Taiwan's Tuntex Group has allocated P25 billion to redevelop the 
tourist city within the former United States military resort 
complex. 
  The Shoemart group led by Henry Sy has decided to build a 
P3-billion five star hotel with a shopping megamall in the old 
Pines Hotel location. 
  De Venecia and Vergara announced a P100-million flyover 
system between the city and La Trinidad, Benguet, to decongest 
the metropolis and create new satellite settlement areas. 
  De Venecia addressed the 75th anniversary of the Rotary 
International District (3770) convention. The district is 
headed by its president, Mar Tupaz. 
  The speaker challenged the Rotarians to harness their 
resources in participating in the government's 
agro-industrialization program through the 
build-operate-transfer law.

Vietnam. 
  The talks were also attended by, among others, Deputy 
Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Dy Nien, deputy head of the External Relations 
Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Coa Van 
Tai, and Palestinian Ambassador to Vietnam Sa'id Khalil 
al-Masri. [sentence as received] 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam reiterated the firm stance 
of the Vietnamese party, state and people in supporting the just 
struggle of the Palestinians under the leadership of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) for their sacred and 
fundamental national rights which include the right to 
self-determination and the right to establish an independent 
Palestinian state. He said Vietnam supported the PLO's correct 
position in the on-going Israel-Palestine talks. 
  For his part, the Palestinian chief diplomat said he was 
glad 
at his first visit to Vietnam, a nation which had fought 
undauntedly in the struggle for national independence and 
freedom in the past and which was achieving great success in the 
current renovation process and national reconstruction. 
  The two sides condemned the killing of the innocent 
civilians 
in Hebron by Israeli extremists, which they said was intended to 
hamper the Middle East peace process. They demanded, that the 
Israeli authorities take effective measures to stop the 
recurrence of similar acts. The two sides also exchanged views 
on a wide range of international and regional issues of common 
concern, and steps to consolidate and enhance the friendly and 
cooperative relations between the two countries.

  [Text] The Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] fighting 
for independence of the island from Papua New Guinea [PNG] has 
dissociated itself from a suggestion that secession is no longer 
achievable. In a statement issued in Sydney, the leader of the 
BRA, Francis Ona, attacked the rebel government's United Nations 
representative, Mike Foster, for comments he made in an 
interview on Papua New Guinea Radio. Sean Dorney reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Dorney] In what appeared at the time to 
be a conciliatory statement, Mr. Foster told the NBC (National 
Broadcasting Corporation] of PNG, the war would drag on 
indefinitely unless there was some give and take. 
  [Foster] We don't believe that the request for unconditional 
surrender is realistic and we don't believe either that the 
complete and immediate secession is realistic but somewhere in 
the middle there is a shared ground and I think for the sake of 
the whole of the Pacific region we should cease the arm conflict 
and begin the discussions that can lead to peace and restoration 
of understanding and human rights values. 
  [Dorney] However, Mr. Foster has now been attacked by the 
secessionists, who accused him of creating confusion and 
misunderstanding. Francis Ona is quoted as saying he'll 
maintain struggle for independent Bougainville. [end recording]

  [Text] A split is emerging between Bougainville 
secessionists who favor a negotiated settlement of the 
five-year-old war and those who are against making any 
concessions in their demands for independence. Sean Dorney 
reports on a flurry of conflicting statements that had followed 
comments on Papua New Guinea [PNG] national radio by the 
secessionist representative to the United Nations, Mike Foster. 
  [Begin Dorney recording] Interviewed on the PNG National 
Broadcasting Commission last week, Mr. Foster said there had to 
be some give and take from both sides and that the Wingti 
government's expectation of an unconditional surrender was as 
unrealistic as the rebel's expectation of complete and immediate 
secession. A statement issued from Sydney in the name of 
President Francis Ona attacked Mike Foster for letting down the 
revolution. He was also accused of being the White Judas of 
Bougainville by Lilian Cross, the Bougainvillian who is recently 
granted political asylum in Australia. However, a statement 
issued from Honiara in the name of Vice President Joseph Kabui 
sharply defended Mr. Foster and said the Bougainville freedom 
movement in Australia had no right to speak for the Bougainville 
interim government. In Papua New Guinea, there is division too. 
The minister for Bougainville affairs can't get the Wingti 
cabinet to endorse his support for Pan-Bougainville talks. [end

  [Text] PORT MORESBY, April 6 (AFP) -- The Papua New Guinea 
government on Wednesday banned national radio from broadcasting 
news of a controversial provincial premiers' conference. 
Communications minister Martin Thompson ordered the National 
Broadcasting Commission (NBC) not to broadcast news from the 
conference this week. The move was thought to be one of the 
first acts of media censorship here, and it came from the 
minister who only last month presented the country's first 
official communications policy which guaranteed press freedoms. 
  Premiers from the five island provinces of Manus, New 
Ireland, East and West New Britain and Bougainville were meeting 
to discuss Port Moresby's move to take away powers from 
provincial governments and give them to national 
parliamentarians and village level governments. The provinces 
have threatened to secede if the government does not back down. 
  In a statement released from Prime Minister Paias Wingti's 
office, Thompson said the NBC had been told not to broadcast 
anything arising from the premier's meeting. The statement said 
the order was issued to NBC chairman Alkan Tololo and all 19 
provincial station managers. It said the order was issued under 
sections of the NBC Act which allowed him to direct the 
commission not to broadcast certain issues. 
  Thompson said while it was NBC's duty to provide balanced, 
objective and impartial broadcasting service, it was paramount 
that such services should reflect the overall drive for national 
unity and that extreme care should be taken in broadcasting 
material that could inflame racial or sectional feelings. NBC 
management was not immediately available for comment. Other 
media organisations including three newspapers and a television 
station were bracing for confrontation if the news ban was 
extended to them. 
  Thompson's communication policy presented to parliament last 
month said in part that "the radio industry should grow as a 
free medium following the rights provided by the PNG 
constitution. The extent of this freedom is underscored by the 
laws which prohibit censorship of broadcast material."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Yi Pyong-tae, "defence 
minister" of South Korea, will reportedly fly to Japan on April 
25 for talks with his counterpart in Japan, at which he will 
discuss full-scale "military exchange" with Japan. 
  Earlier, while on a trip to Japan, the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
had discussed the "joint counteraction" with senior brasshats of 
Japan over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The facts prove once again that the Kim Yong-sam group is 
the 
enemy of the nation who does not hesitate to bring a nuclear 
holocaust upon the nation, putting spurs on the establishment of 
a criminal "international cooperation system" in collusion with 
outside forces. 
  But their act is as foolish as bumping one's head against a 
rock. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its dirty 
remaining days with the help of outside forces will be punished 
by the nation. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must stop maneuvering against the 
DPRK in a conspiracy with the foolish Kim Yong-sam group and act 
with discretion.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An 
emergency meeting was held in Tokyo on March 28 with regard to 
the situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  Present at the meeting were Secretary General of the Japan 
Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful 
Reunification of Korea Hiroshi Wakabayashi, chairman of the 
Japan-Korea Association of Scientific and Educational exchange 
Kiyoo Nakakoji, honorary professor of Rikkyo University 
Yasusaburo Hoshino and other Japanese figures and Tokyo 
citizens, more than 200 in all. 
  In his lecture at the meeting, Prof. Yashuhiro Maeda of 
Kitakyushu University said the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea did not want a war and dealt with the United States on an 
independent principle. He charged that the United States was 
encouraging the Japanese and South Korean authorities to 
intensify the moves to isolate the DPRK. 
  A resolution was adopted at the meeting. 
  Noting that the demand of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency in the course of its recent inspection was a deliberate 
interference in socialist Korea, it said it resulted in creating 
a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula which might 
lead to a war any time. 
  It stressed that as long as the United States sought "world 
supremacy by strength," an anachronistic design, military 
tensions would be increased and the danger of a war would 
persist in the world. It urged the United States to renounce 
"the policy of strength." 
  The resolution demanded that the Hosokawa government, 
instead 
of following the United States, make an apology for Japan's 
colonial domination and war of aggression, renounce its hostile 
policy toward the DPRK, show all sincerity in liquidating the 
consequences of its colonial domination and make efforts for 
the resumption of the Japan-DPRK negotiation for the progress of 
the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries on the basis of the joint declaration signed by the 
Workers' Party of Korea, the Liberal Democratic Party and the 
Social-Democratic Party of Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The Amnesty 
International in a statement March 31 reportedly expressed 
apprehensions over the human rights abuses in South Korea and 
urged the South Korean authorities to release all the prisoners 
of conscience and scrap the "National Security Law" (NSL). 
  It demanded the release of two members of the opera troupe 
"Huimangsae" (Birds of Hope) and members of the Fellowship 
Society for Modern Philosophy and others who had been arrested 
some time ago, concluding that they were conscientious prisoners 
detained for demanding the freedom of expression.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, in a statement 
today, demanded that the Pyongyang trip of Yi Ki-taek, president 
of the South Korean Democratic Party, be realised 
unconditionally without any hindrance. 
  Recalling that Yi Ki-taek expressed more than once his wish 
to visit Pyongyang, the spokesman said: 
  "Should he visit Pyongyang and discuss the outstanding 
issues 
of the nation including the problem of national reunification 
and jointly seek a solution, a new progress will, no doubt, be 
made in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the 
development of the North-South relations. 
  "The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, are blocking the 
Pyongyang trip of the opposition political figure, arguing that 
he `might fall a prey to the strategy of the North.' This is a 
very improper act." 
  The spokesman expressed the belief that Yi Ki-taek would 
visit Pyongyang in a short time and do a good work for the 
nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- More than two thousand 
students belonging to the South Korean Federation of General 
Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) Tuesday [5 April] held a rally 
in the amphitheatre of Konkuk University before going over to an 
anti-U.S., anti-"government" demonstration to check the 
"parliamentary ratification" of the "Uruguay Round accord 
fulfilment schedule", urge renegotiation and protest the U.S. 
arms sale pressure, according to a report from Seoul. 
  In a resolution they adopted, the students expressed 
indignation at the fact that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique 
was inflicting colossal losses upon the people by opening the 
farm market wider and voiced strong opposition to the 
"parliamentary ratification" of the "fulfilment schedule" slated 
for April 12. 
  At the end of the rally they took to the streets and had a 
fierce clash with the riot police. 
  The demonstrators were carrying a large streamer reading "No 
U.S. arms sales" and shouting: "We urge renegotition on basic 
farm products". 
  On the same day, more than one thousand students held a 
rally 
in demand of the boycott of the Uruguay Round accord in the 
Jongmyo Park, Seoul, and then staged a street demonstration.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The North Korean parliament 
convened Wednesday [6 April] and adopted three bills, including 
the budget for fiscal 1994, Korea News Service reported. 
  The Tokyo-based news service, monitoring a KOREAN CENTRAL 
NEWS AGENCY [KCNA] dispatch, said the Seventh Meeting of the 
Ninth Supreme People's Assembly was convened with North Korean 
President Kim Il-song, and his son and heir apparent Kim 
Chong-il in attendance. 
  The new legislation included the execution of a socialist 
economic readjustment period ordered in December by the Korean 
Workers Party and the approval of laws adopted by the assembly's 
Standing Committee during the assembly's absence. 
  The KCNA report made no mention of any policy initiatives as 
international demands mount for Pyongyang to comply with nuclear 
safeguards inspections and calls for economic sanctions against 
North Korea continue to grow. 
  The report also gave no indication of any change in the 
North 
Korean leadership. Speculation has grown over when the dynastic 
succession in Pyongyang may occur.

<F P=106> ["Tasks of Socialist Economic Construction in Adjustment </F>
Period Discussed at SPA Session"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The 7th Session of the 
Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK opened here is 
discussing the first item on the agenda "On Successfully 
Fulfilling the Tasks of Socialist Economic Construction in the 
Period of Adjustment Set Forth by the Workers' Party of Korea". 
  In his report Deputy Kang Song-san, premier of the 
Administration Council, recalled that the 21st plenary meeting 
of the sixth Central Committee of the WPK held in December last 
year reviewed the fulfillment of the third seven-year plan and 
set a three-year period of adjustment, putting forward a 
economic strategy, on the basis of a scientific analysis of the 
current situation and the present condition of socialist 
economic construction in the country. 
  The tasks of socialist economic construction in the 
adjustment period, the reporter said, is to thoroughly implement 
the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign 
trade-first policies, give definite precedence to the coal and 
power industries and railway transport, which must advance ahead 
of the other sectors of the national economy, and continue to 
develop the metal industry. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of 
adjustment in socialist economic construction carries the 
unshakable determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea 
to radically improve the people's living standard in the next 
few years and develop the national economy to an economy strong 
in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining 
unshaken under any circumstances, he said. 
  Turning to the tasks of socialist economic construction in 
the period of adjustment, the reporter said: 
  The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields should 
be 
raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than 
10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future. 
  Textile output will be boosted 20 percent or more and 
chemical fibre and synthetic resin more than 10 percent in the 
period of adjustment. 
  We should expand the production bases of export commodities, 
broaden economic ties with countries which have good relations 
with our country and further develop trade and economic dealings 
with Southeast Asian countries which are within easy reach 
geographically. 
  Coal and power output and railway freight turnover should be 
increased over 30 percent respectively in the adjustment period.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting 
took place at the People's Palace of Culture today to mark the 
20th anniversary of the abolition of the tax system in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  As the nation's economic potential increased the great 
leader 
President Kim Il-song took steps to systematically reduce the 
tax burdens upon the population and saw to it that the taxes 
including the agricultural tax in kind were abolished by 
degrees. And in March, 1974, he proclaimed to the whole world a 
decree on totally eliminating the tax system at the 3rd meeting 
of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly. 
  Thus, the DPRK became the first tax-free country in human 
history. 
  In his report, Hong Sok-hyong, alternate Politburo member of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and 
chairman of the state planning commission, said the total 
elimination of the taxes in Korea was a brilliant crystalization 
of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's grand strategic 
plan to free the Korean people who had been freed from 
exploitation and oppression even from the fetters of leftovers 
of the old society and provide an independent and creative life 
for them, and another great feat performed by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il in the course of carrying forward the 
revolutionary cause of chuche through to completion. 
  He said the total elimination of taxes in Korea had a great 
inspiring effect on the working class and other labouring masses 
in capitalist countries who were molested by exploitation and 
oppression and weighed down under exacting taxation and, through 
a vivid reality, showed the peoples of different countries who 
set about the building of a new society, freed from the 
imperialist colonial yoke, and the revolutionary people fighting 
for the rebuilding of socialism that socialism was the only way 
of attaining development and prosperity of the country and 
bringing genuine happiness to the people. 
  He pointed out that communist policies including the 
universal free medical care system, the free compulsory 
education system, the popular social insurance system and social 
security system and the food policy are in force in the DPRK 
now, enabling all the people to enjoy a dignified and happy life 
evenly in all domains of politics, the economy and culture. 
  He stressed the need to cherish the great national pride and 
honour of living in the tax-free country and defend and further 
exalt the Korean-style socialism. 
  "In order to step up the revolution and construction and 
defend and further glorify the socialism of our own style 
centred on the masses in sharp confrontation with the enemy, we 
must uphold the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with loyalty," the reporter said. 
  The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, member of the 
Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], WPK and 
vice-president, and other senior party and state officials and 
working people in the city.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held in Pyongyang today to observe the first anniversary of the 
publication of "10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation for the Reunification of the country," a work of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The 10-point programme worked out and published by President 
Kim Il-song on April 6, 1993, was adopted as a great political 
charter common to the nation at the Fifth Session of the Ninth 
Supreme People's Assembly. 
  The programme outlines the general purpose of great national 
unity for founding an independent, peaceful and neutral 
pan-national unified state through the great unity of the whole 
nation, the ideological basis of great national unity for 
uniting on the basis of patriotism and the spirit of national 
independence, and the principle of unity for promoting 
co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and 
subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification. 
  The programme also comprehensively indicates practical ways 
for great national unity such as ending all political disputes 
and promoting trust and unity between the North and the South. 
  Kim Yong sun, secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, in his report, said that the 10-point 
programme, for the steadfast patriotic stand running through all 
its points and its fair content, serves as a most reasonable and 
realistic great political programme of national unity and a 
great charter of national reunification acceptable to all who 
truly love the country and the nation and want the reunification 
of the country, irrespective of idea and religious belief, 
system and political affiliation, and place of residence. 
  "The 10-point programme evoked the full sympathy and support 
not only of the entire compatriots in the North, South and 
overseas but also of the revolutionary people worldwide as soon 
as it was published, and its invincible might and vitality have 
been eloquently proven through practical life," he stated. 
  He called for rejecting the interference of outside forces 
and paving the way for the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country with the great unity of the nation 
under the banner of the 10-point programme. 
  To hasten national reunification through concerted efforts 
of 
the whole nation, both the North and the South must firmly 
maintain the principle of national independence. 
  The South Korean authorities must relinquish the reckless 
confrontation and war moves, repeal the "National Security Law" 
hindering the nation's unity, dissolve the "Security Planning 
Board", stop suppressing the patriotic students and people who 
rose up for independence, democracy and reunification and set 
free, at once, all political prisoners and prisoners of 
conscience who are illegally detained. 
  The United States must discontinue its unjustifiable 
campaign 
of pressure upon the DPRK and take a proper stance for a 
solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The United Nations Security Council must maintain a fair 
stand as an international organization, abandoning such unfair 
double standard attitude as not calling in question the United 
States and the South Korean authorities, its servants, 
increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula 
and as turning a blind eye to the countries engaged in dangerous 
nuclear development under the aegis of the United States, while 
putting unjust pressure upon the DPRK which is conducting 
nuclear activities for peaceful purpose. 
  The patriotic democratic movement organizations in South 
Korea and the organizations of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) at home and abroad should 
intensify various forms of mass movement to implement the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and 
invigorate dialogues and contacts between the North, the South 
and the overseas sides. 
  The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member 
of C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and 
vice-president, and other officials concerned.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- A symposium 
commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of 
"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country" by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song was held at the People's Palace of Culture Thursday 
with politicians, scholars and pressmen in attendance. 
  Present at the symposium were Kim Chung-nin, secretary of 
the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, officials 
concerned, officials of political parties and public 
organisations and men of science, education and press. 
  Speakers at the symposium proved that the 10-point programme 
is a great program of independent reunification and a great 
charter of national unity for putting an end to the history of 
division and confrontation covering nearly half a century with 
the strength of the nation. 
  They said the 10-point programme is a banner of powerful 
unity for actively breaking the deadlock with the united 
strength of the nation in the grim situation in which the 
destiny of the nation is at stake and a great charter of unity 
and reunification for achieving the reunification of the country 
and the prosperity of the nation with the strength of the nation 
by uniting all the compatriots. 
  They said the foundation of a pan-national unified state by 
confederacy formula is a most reasonable goal for uniting all 
fellow countrymen of different classes and quarters, 
transcending the regional and institutional differences between 
the North and the South at present. 
  They branded the "three-phase reunification formula" of the 
Kim Yong-sam group as an imitation of the "formula of 
unification through Korean national commonwealth" brought 
forward by its predesessors, a proposal of division and 
confrontation in every aspect, which is no more than formulae of 
"unification of systems" and "unification by prevailing over 
communism". 
  They said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation is a program of great unity embodying the great 
idea of benevolent politics of President Kim Il-song, because it 
provides for granting special favours to those who have 
performed exploits for the reunification of the country and, if 
those who had betrayed the nation in the past, take the 
patriotic road, repentant of their past, for dealing with them 
leniently to enable them to contribute to the cause of national 
reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- "With the Century", 
reminiscences of the great leader President Kim Il-song, has 
been widely disseminated and evoked lively responses in many 
countries. 
  Ludo Martens, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Belgian Labour Party, said: 
  "President Kim Il-song's reminiscences `With the Century' 
not 
only consummates the revolutionary history of a peerless great 
man but has won the hearts of people as it has rich and profound 
content, great attraction and vitality. 
  "It is a brilliant and immortal, grand revolutionary 
encyclopedia which leaves every reader caught up in a flood of 
solemn feeling. 
  "It is an event worthy of special record in human history 
that progressive mankind today has received the reminiscences 
consummating the history of a great man." 
  H.K. Kapil, president of the society for the study of the 
chuche philosophy of Agra University in India, said the 
reminiscences "With the Century" is an inspiring banner that 
gives unswerving confidence and strength to the peoples who are 
fighting against imperialism and all manner of exploitation and 
oppression. 
  He said he could hardly take his eyes away from the 
reminiscences, attracted by the warm love of President Kim 
Il-song for and his trust in his revolutionary comrades and his 
great magnanimity, broad-mindedness and noble personality 
reflected in every page of it. 
  President Kim Il-song is, indeed, a person who descended 
from 
heaven, and his is a history of trust and love for the people, 
said the president. 
  Gumercindo Celedonio, president of Huacho National 
University 
of Peru, said: 
  "The reminiscences of President Kim Il-song is a most 
valuable asset of mankind. 
  "Mankind must always accept the precious truth elucidated by 
their great teacher as their guideline." 
  Yoko Miyajima, a doctor in Aichi prefecture, Japan, said 
after reading the first three volumes of Part I of the 
reminiscences -- The Anti-Japanese R evolution: 
  "The three volumes of the reminiscences had a far greater 
influence on me than my six-year school education, and I 
accepted it with sincerity. 
  "I think the reminiscences is not only a truthful history 
book but a textbook, because the most important question of how 
to fight for the national liberation is described with the words 
of President Kim Il-song. 
  "I will tell the younger generation what I have learnt from 
the reminiscences."
