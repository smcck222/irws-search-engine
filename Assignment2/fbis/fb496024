soles of their feet.

<F P=106> ["Statement of DPRK Forestry Ministry Spokesman" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities dared to mock at the human rights of the workers of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea now engaged in a 
regular felling in the far eastern region of Russia, volubly 
talking about "dispatch of a fact-finding team" and "defection 
operation", said a spokesman for the Ministry of Forestry of the 
DPRK in a statement today. 
  He condemned this as another premeditated act of treachery 
to 
expand overseas the present-day North-South confrontation which 
they have carried into extremes and thereby create a more 
serious national antagonism and impair the ever growing prestige 
of the DPRK and the might of its singlehearted unity. 
  At "the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the 
National Assembly" on March 30 the South Korean authorities 
reportedly brought up the "human rights" of the DPRK's lumbermen 
and impudently blared that "a fact-finding team" would be sent 
to Russia. They went so far as to say that they would induce 
the DPRK's lumbermen to "defect" to South Korea, getting them 
recognized as "refugees" through the offices of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  The statement says: 
  It is clear to anyone that such "human rights problem" as 
the 
South Korean authorities described has never existed and can 
never exist for our lumbermen. 
  Under our anthropocentric socialist system the human rights 
of the people from all walks of life are fully ensured legally 
and institutionally. Our lumbermen too are guaranteed a free 
and happy life like in the homeland, though they are working in 
an alien land. Each of them enjoys a true political life and 
adequate material and cultural life. They live a stable life, 
engaged in normal production activities pursuant to our labour 
law and the law of the Russian Federation. 
  This notwithstanding, the South Korean ruling quarters are 
insolent enough to mock at and provoke the dignity and human 
rights of our workers. This impudent behavior is a shameless 
interference in the internal affairs of our republic and a 
criminal act that cannot be permitted under the international 
law. 
  Unjustifiable and unpardonable is the insidious attempt of 
the South Korean authorities to create a new national discord 
and aggravate the North-South confrontation by inventing the 
"human rights problem" of our lumbermen at a time when the 
national concord must be promoted by transcending the difference 
in idea, ideology and system and an independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country be accelerated through the great 
unity of the whole nation. 
  If the South Korean authorities send "a fact-finding team" 
to 
do harm to our workers who are engaged in creative production 
activities in an alien land for the socialist motherland, or 
launch into an unjustifiable "defection work" among them, we 
will decisively counter it. 
  And we will never tolerate any country or international 
organization joining the South Korean authorities in their 
criminal intrigues. 
  Should any other country or international organization join 
the South Korean authorities in their reckless act, it would 
extremely complicate things and entail irretrievable, grave 
consequences would. [sentence as received] 
  In case some of our lumbermen now in the far eastern region 
should disappear in the days ahead, we will consider that the 
responsibility entirely rests with the South Korean authorities 
and that they kidnapped our workers, motivated by their sinister 
political purpose, and will immediately take a decisive 
countermeasure.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- Spring tree-planting 
is in full swing throughout the country. 
  According to data available at the Forestry Management 
Department of the General Bureau of the Land Administration, 
nearly 200 million trees were planted across the country in 
recent 20 days. 
  Many counties of South Hwanghae Province and Kaesong and 
Nampo municipalities have already fulfilled their plans for 
spring tree-planting. 
  Korea has set the target to create 200,000 hectares of 
respective forests of oil-bearing trees and industrial trees in 
a few years and channelled big efforts to the work. 
  April, a good season for tree planting, was set as a 
tree-planting month and trees are planted through a social 
movement. 
  The nation's forests have been assigned to organs, 
enterprises and organizations and protected and managed by them 
with much care. 
  Afforestation in cities is being pushed ahead. 
  In recent years alone, thousands of hectares of forests have 
been created and a number of parks and recreation grounds built 
in major industrial and residential quarters. 
  In Pyongyang, more than 250,000 trees have already been 
planted in streets, residential quarters, parks and recreation 
grounds this year.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu flew to Tokyo on Tuesday [12 April] on his 
way for a weeklong visit to Russia, Britain and Belgium, 
government officials said. 
  During a stopover in Tokyo, Han will meet Hans Blix, 
director 
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to 
discuss North Korea's refusal to grant inspectors unhampered 
access to its nuclear facilities. 
  The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were 
insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States 
and other Western nations. 
  North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection 
criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear 
program serves strictly civilian purposes. 
  The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he 
will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other 
government leaders from Wednesday through Friday. 
  "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an 
eight- way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I 
will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP News Agency quoted Han as 
saying before departure. 
  Moscow has suggested that both Koreas, China, the U.S., 
Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA try to resolve 
the nuclear controversy through a special conference. 
  According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian 
proposal but prefers that the UN handles the North Korean issue 
for the time being. 
  Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday 
after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission 
chiefs in Brussels.

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman 
of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, declaring that North 
Korea's nuclear program must be stopped at any cost, said Friday 
that a "package solution" and use of "the China card" are the 
only way. 
  "A military confrontation against reckless provocation by 
the 
North Korean hard-liners has to be avoided," Kim said in a 
prepared text for his lecture at Pusan University. 
  The package solution Kim was referring to has also been 
proposed by North Korea. It aims at resolving the nuclear 
dispute through an overall package deal with the United States 
calling for, among other things, normalization of relations 
between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  South Korea and the United States should not resume their 
joint military exercise "Team Spirit" as it would impede 
dialogue, Kim said. 
  Seoul will have to reconsider deploying Patriot missiles or 
purchasing other new military weapons, said the former leader of 
the opposition Democratic Party. 
  "Nuclear proliferation has to be stopped not only in North 
Korea but also in other countries," Kim said, adding that the 
United States, Russia, France, Britain and China must show their 
commitment to making the world free of nuclear weapons. 
  It isn't very persuasive for these big powers to oppose the 
possession of relatively cheap but hugely destructive nuclear 
bombs by smaller countries while they have their own nuclear 
weapons, Kim argued. 
  South and North Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan and 
China must undertake a serious study of security in Northeast 
Asia, including the matter of keeping the region nuclear free, 
Kim said. 
  Such a study would provide a means to resolve the North 
Korean nuclear issue as well as help maintain peace and 
stability in Northeast Asia, he added.

  [Text] Members of the Advisory Committee of the ROK Foreign 
Ministry have urged the government to fully review its nuclear 
policy indicating that the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks can be held only if the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and South is held. The government has 
so far made efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Members of the "Unification Subcommittee" under the Foreign 
Ministry Policy Advisory Committee -- which includes scholars, 
journalists, and former Foreign Ministry authorities -- held a 
behind-closed-doors meeting at the Foreign Ministry on 11 April 
with the presence of high-level Foreign Ministry officials, 
including Pak Su-kil, chairman of the Institute of Foreign 
Affairs and National Security. They agreed that it is desirable 
not to link the exchange of special envoys with the third round 
of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. 
  Participants in that meeting said: "The UN Security Council 
president's statement has called upon North Korea to accept 
additional nuclear inspections by early May, at the latest. 
Therefore, the government should not link the exchange of 
special envoys with the nuclear inspections in order to make 
North Korea accept the additional nuclear inspections by then. 
  Such recommendation by the Advisory Committee members has 
been made at a time when the ROK, the United States, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency have made efforts to seek the 
multilateral plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear issues. 
Thus, it attracts the people's attention. 
  They said that "either U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry or U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had stated 
that diplomatic efforts to get North Korea to allow 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities will last 
another six months," and that "there are some signs of change in 
the U.S. position toward North Korea." 
  They have pointed out that there are differences in opinions 
between the ROK and U.S. Governments regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue. They also stressed that the government should 
comprehensively review its nuclear policy toward North Korea and 
formulate concrete plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  Furthermore, some participants said that the government 
should not be restricted by time during nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea, and that it should be patient in resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue, while properly using both a hardline 
and moderate policy.

  [Text] Taegu, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Former opposition leader 
Kim Tae-chung said Saturday that hard-liners in Seoul, Pyongyang 
and Washington are hampering solution of the North Korean 
nuclear dispute. 
  Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the 
Asia- Pacific Region, told nearly 150 supporters here that the 
government should adopt a soft policy toward North Korea in 
order to bring about change. 
  "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing 
division 
of the Korean peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North 
Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into 
third- rate countries," he warned. 
  Kim called on the government to solve the nuclear problem 
through a "package deal," under which Western countries would 
recognize the Pyongyang Government while North Korea gave up 
nuclear weapons. In doing so, the government should secure the 
cooperation of China, he said. 
  "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear weapons and the 
United States will establish an embassy in Pyongyang," he 
predicted. 
  This was Kim's first visit to Taegu since he was defeated in 
the presidential election in December 1992.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea turned down 
Tuesday a North Korean proposal to take delivery of a letter, 
rebuffing the suggestion as "turning the other way from the 
normal inter-Korean dialogue channel" and "of no help to 
improving relations." 
  Yi Chun-ku, Seoul's liaison officer, phoned his Pyongyang 
counterpart Yi Song-tok to say that South Korea will not accept 
the letter. 
  Pyongyang had notified Seoul Monday that it wanted to 
deliver 
a letter Wednesday addressed to the South Korean Government, 
political parties, social organizations and individuals. 
  Officials here said the letter is believed to ask Southern 
figures to participate in a conference on Aug. 15, the 49th 
anniversary of Korean liberation from Japanese colonial rule, of 
party and social leaders on ending national division. 
  Unification Board Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki issued a statement 
accusing North Korea of attempting yet "another tactic on the 
unification front." 
  "Stop political propaganda which only stirs up distrust and 
confrontation among the people," the statement said. 
  Kim urged North Korea to realize the mood of the 
international community and accept nuclear inspections and 
resumption of inter- Korean dialogue.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- More than half of South 
Korean adults do not think that North Korea will actually 
provoke a war against the South, a poll said Monday. 
  The poll by the state-run Advisory Council on Democratic and 
Peaceful Unification showed 54.1 percent of the respondents were 
not worried that North Korea would start a war, with 13.8 
percent saying it was impossible and 40.3 percent highly 
unlikely. 
  But 45.5 percent of the pollees had a negative opinion: Very 
probable (6.8 percent) or relatively probable (38.7 percent). 
  The advisory council commissioned the Hyundae Research 
Institute to survey 1,000 adult men and women across the nation, 
selected using the probability proportionate to size sampling 
(PTS) method, from March 28 to April 2. 
  Some 80.3 percent foresaw the need for military preparations 
-- very appropriate measures (46.5 percent) or inevitable (33.8 
percent) -- as far as deploying Patriot missiles here and 
resuming Team Spirit, the joint South Korean-U.S. military 
exercise, following the rupture of inter-Korean working-level 
talks. 
  Meanwhile, 58.7 percent of the respondents supported 
patience 
such as inter-Korean dialogue to resolve the nuclear problem, 
while 16 percent said hard-line countermeasures including 
military methods should be used. 
  And 38.8 percent thought the United Nations should urge 
North 
Korea to allow inspections of its nuclear sites through a 
Security Council presidential statement, while 28.8 percent 
favored U.N. sanctions. 
  On the effect of possible U.N. sanctions against North 
Korea, 
39.6 percent said that "as a result, tension will be heightened 
on the Korean peninsula," while 25.3 percent said "North Korea 
will eventually accept further inspections." 
  Meanwhile, 75.6 percent felt that North Korea has already 
developed nuclear weapons or will produce them in two or three 
years, but only 18.3 percent said Pyongyang seems to have 
stopped developing nuclear arms.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Hwang Yu-song: "Closure of North </F>
Korea's Operational Office in Macao"] 
  [Text] Macao has been reportedly known as a base of North 
Korea's overseas activities. "Korea International Tourist 
Corporation in Macao" is the name of North Korea's such office 
in Macao. In the mid-seventies, North Korea opened it to 
attract foreign tourists to Pyongyang and to promote its trade 
with other countries. Many people have so far denounced, 
however, that this office has played a great role as a base of 
the North Korean intelligence organization's overseas activities 
in Southeast Asia without doing its own business, such as 
tourism and trade. 
  Recently this office was closed and stopped issuing visas 
for 
tourists to go to North Korea. It is, therefore, very 
significant. 
  On 30 March, a female clerk working in this office said to a 
person who visited there to apply for visa: "We no longer 
handle visa or consular business in Macao. If you want to apply 
for a visa, you should go to Beijing, China." She also said 
that "North Korean officials in the office had already left 
Macao for Beijing." 
  North Korea's past kidnapping of actress Choe Un-hui is a 
model case of its overseas operational activities through the 
office in Macao. Actress Choe was kidnapped by North Korean 
agents in Hong Kong in early 1978, then transferred to North 
Korea via its office in Macao. 
  The overseas activities of the North Korean Macao office 
reached the peak of its intelligence activity with the explosion 
of KAL [Korean Air] 858 by Kim Hyon-hui in 1987. Kim Hyon-hui 
studied Chinese language there, as well as received a training 
course to adapt herself to capitalist society from July 1985 to 
January 1987, immediately before the explosion of KAL 858 took 
place. 
  Since the incident by Kim Hyon-hui, the Macao Government has 
expelled some North Korean officials from Macao and kept an eye 
on the others who worked in the office because of the ROK 
Government's strong protest. As a result, since then, the 
office -- which at one time had more than 30 employees -- have 
reduced the number of its employees by ten. Also, the number of 
North Korean residents in Macao have decreased from 380 to 100 
since the late 1980's. 
  It has not been disclosed why North Korea has closed down 
the 
office in Macao. It can be assessed, however, that North Korea 
could close the office under the following reasons: the 
reduction of its value as a base for overseas intelligence 
activity, the rapid reduction of foreign tourists to North Korea 
through Macao since the North Korean nuclear issue has emerged, 
and the difficulties in maintaining the office as a result of 
its economic situation.

<F P=106> [YONHAP from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Emotionally-charged mutual distrust has reportedly 
increased between the ROK and the United States as the ROK-U.S. 
trade conflict becomes more specified. Complaining that the ROK 
is speaking with a double tongue over the issue on implementing 
the Uruguay Round [UR] agreement, the United States picks 
quarrels with the ROK in each and every field, including autos, 
sausages, cod-jowls, and even carpet cleaners. 
  The government's dissatisfaction has become apparent as the 
United States, far from appreciating the extent of cooperation 
provided by the ROK Government for the UR agreement, continues 
only to step up pressure for market opening. 
  Emotional portions appeared between the ROK and the United 
States in the 16th meeting of the ROK-U.S. working-level trade 
committee held in Washington on 4-5 April to exert a negative 
influence upon the meeting. After the meeting, some U.S. 
participants openly complained, saying "Far from making 
progress, this meeting is a step back in negotiations." 
  A U.S. official who attended the Washington negotiations 
cited the sausage issue as an example of an emotionally-charged 
ROK-U.S. trade conflict. Pointing out the customs procedure as 
a major point of dispute, he stressed, "Although the sum in 
question may only amount to several million dollars, it is a 
firm policy of the United States that no matter how small the 
amount, it will straighten it out without fail. He also said 
that, considering the symbolic significance of the issue, the 
U.S. Trade Representative plans to resolve the sausage issue as 
soon as possible. 
  The cod-jowls issue is similar to the sausage issue. The 
U.S. official said that both sides held intense negotiations on 
the cod- jowls issue for over an hour and a half in the 
Washington talks. Stressing that the United States "is angry" 
with the ROK attitude toward negotiations, he complained, "There 
has been no progress in resolving this issue since it was first 
raised four years ago." 
  The emotionally-charged ROK-U.S. conflict is also reflected 
in negotiations on the auto issue, the focal point of U.S. 
pressure listed on its list of "unfair trade manners." Although 
the ROK Government has expressed its attitude that it will seek 
more specific methods to resolve the ROK-U.S. trade conflict at 
the upcoming UR ministerial talks, the United States seems 
unconvinced. The government's ill feeling against strong U.S. 
pressure is apparent. 
  Observers say that the ROK's clear expression of its basic 
policy in the recent Washington working-level negotiations 
paradoxically caused relevant U.S. officials to complain about 
negotiations regressing instead of making progress. 
  The U.S. side's abrupt complaint about the ROK's attitude in 
a recent meeting in Washington between ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor which 
caused a strain in the atmosphere of the meeting, may be seen as 
an expression of pent up emotions. 
  With the United States stepping up trade pressure with the 
principle of attaching primary importance to its own economy, 
the ROK is making every effort to voice its position in a manner 
quite different from that of the past. This is today's reality. 
However, amplified mutual distrust and emotional conflict 
caused by the ROK attitude will only burden us, the weaker side 
in trade relations with the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the main opposition Democratic Party, held back from officially 
announcing his plan to visit the United States at his party's 
Supreme Council Monday amid rising intra-party criticism of its 
timing. 
  Yi had been determined to report details of his schedule for 
a U.S. visit in a Supreme Council meeting Monday as a formal 
step before embarking on the trip. 
  The opposition leader, who has already postponed his 
departure originally scheduled for Sunday, however, expressed 
his intention to go ahead with the plan, saying, "If the 
domestic political situation worsened, it would be difficult for 
me to leave, but it is neither easy nor good to delay for the 
second time, or cancel, it." 
  "Even if I went there, I would come back in a hurry if the 
domestic situation warranted," Yi said, hinting that the visit 
is still on. 
  Meanwhile, sources close to Yi said he would leave for 
America on April 19 for a 13-day visit featuring a meeting with 
Vice President Al Gore, speeches at the National Press Club in 
Washington and the Asia Society in New York, and a tour of 
California's silicon valley. 
  Some members of the DP Supreme Council strongly opposed his 
departure, however, as the party is demanding a special session 
of the National Assembly to deal with a "national crisis." 
  The Democratic Party has launched a nationwide movement to 
oppose the Uruguay Round trade agreement and vowed not to ratify 
the accord at the National Assembly. It is also demanding a 
probe into the power struggle gripping the Chogye Buddhist order 
and alleged diversion of Buddhist slush funds into the political 
arena.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney complained Tuesday that South Korea is only playing 
up the negative side of the Uruguay Round [UR] trade accord, 
ignoring its positive effects. Laney also said the United States 
has no intention of using Section 301 of the Omnibus Trade Bill 
against South Korea. The recent resurrection of the "Super 301" 
provision was aimed at Japan, he said. Washington will not apply 
Super 301 against Seoul since the U.S. trade deficit with South 
Korea is not as large as that with Japan, Laney added. 
  "The Uruguay Round means that world markets are open to 
Korea, not just that Korean markets are open to the world," 
Laney said in a speech to a breakfast meeting of leading 
industrial managers sponsored by the International Management 
Institute, an affiliate of the Federation of Korean Industries. 
  The most important open door for Korea, in fact, is the 
Uruguay Round, Laney said. "Yet I read in the papers... that the 
round is a loss for Korea -- that countermeasures' have to be 
devised to limit the damage imposed from abroad," notably the 
United States, he said. Under the Uruguay Round, however, Korea 
does not have to climb high tariff walls in other countries, he 
said. Korean products, which are excellent, will compete even 
more effectively in the world market. 
  The Uruguay Round hasn't sounded the death knell for farming 
in Korea, Laney insisted. The farming population has already 
declined 50 percent in one generation. "That's not something the 
United States has forced upon Korea. It's already been 
happening for 30 years." Open markets mean more investment and 
more technology for Korea, Laney went on. Korea is already one 
of the world's largest beneficiaries of free trade, and will 
continue to reap gains in the future. The ambassador said, 
"trade and openness mean that Korea has come of age. Korea is 
no longer weak and poor. It is one of the 15 largest economies 
in the world -- larger than most of the countries in Europe." 
  The United States is proud of its relationship with Korea, 
proud of its military and commercial alliance, Laney said. "But 
we are not in alliance to exploit each other, to take unfair 
advantage, but to find ways that we can grow together in more 
prosperous freedom."

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The opposition launched 
an offensive Friday against the government over the Uruguay 
Round [UR] accord, which will open up Korea's farm market, as 
the Morocco signing of the agreement fast approaches. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) set in motion a 
"struggle committee," aimed at stopping parliament from 
ratifying the Uruguay Round (UR) accord, at a ceremony attended 
by Chairman Yi Ki-taek and 100 postholders and lawmakers. 
  Chairman Yi, who also steers the committee, said the party 
must struggle for the national interest because dialogue has not 
helped in redressing the problem. 
  The DP also agreed with the three splinter parties and the 
pan- national movement to preserve agriculture, in a meeting 
held Friday morning, to hold rallies against the UR agreement in 
Seoul and other major cities over the weekend. 
  At the meeting DP Chairman Yi, United People's Party leader 
Han Yong-su, New Korea Party representative Yi Chong-chan, New 
Political Reform Party leader Pak Chan-chong and movement 
representative Yi Chang-pok decided to demand that President Kim 
Yong-sam apologize to the nation for government wrongdoings in 
the course of negotiating the UR pact, while guaranteeing the 
right of ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) lawmakers to 
express their opinions on the trade accord. 
  According to the movement, all 112 opposition lawmakers had 
pledged to vote against the UR pact and some DLP lawmakers 
expressed their intention to follow suit as of Friday. 
  Prof. Chang Won-suk of Tankuk University, one of the 
movement's leaders, said it will press the government to 
renegotiate the accord. Although it is a multilateral pact, its 
"unfair contents" should be renegotiated through bilateral 
talks, he added. 
  Some 180 colleges and universities of Hanchongnyon (the 
Federation of Korean College and University Student 
Associations) began a two-day strike Friday to oppose the UR 
agreement, while 20,000 students took to the streets of Seoul to 
denounce the pact. 
  After the accord is signed at the Morocco meeting, the DP 
will hold its own rallies to oppose parliamentary ratification 
while launching a nationwide signature-collection campaign. 
  Concerned that the anti-UR struggle by opposition forces 
could plunge the nation into a political crisis, the government 
and the ruling DLP are busy taking countersteps. 
  DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong warned the DP would earn public 
censure for a struggle that could lead to political unrest just 
as the nation is starting to enjoy political and social 
stability under the civilian government. 
  The DLP plans to obtain National Assembly approval of the UR 
accord by the end of August and promote the need for the pact in 
this era of internationalization and market opening. 
  The government will advance the announcement of a 
wide-ranging rural investment plan from the target date of June 
30 to assure farmers that the UR agreement is a good opportunity 
to make agriculture truly viable. 
  A Chongwadae [presidential office] official said the 
government would deal with all anti-UR pact rallies and 
demonstrations strictly in accordance with the law. 
  To cope with rallies and demonstrations by activist students 
in Seoul at the weekend, over 16,000 riot policemen have been 
deployed to ensure that these events are carried out in a 
peaceful manner.

  [Text] Kim Chol-su, minister of trade, industry, and 
energy, said on 9 April that "Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations 
had been already finished," and that "it is almost impossible to 
renegotiate the UR accord." 
  In his roundtable talks with reporters that day, Minister 
Kim 
said that "after its ratification at the National Assembly, the 
government will sign an agreement on the formation of the World 
Trade Organization [WTO] during the nation-ministerial 
conference in Marrakesh," and that "this is not related to UR 
renegotiation but rather a matter of domestic procedures of 
ratification." 
  Minister Kim said: Every country has its own policy 
different from that of others regarding the signing of the World 
Trade Organization agreement. Therefore, the government has so 
far prudently calculated the loss and gain of the agreement 
during the meetings of related ministers. As a result, it has 
boldly decided to sign the agreement after its ratification at 
the National Assembly. 
  He said, however, that "regardless of the change of the 
signing form of the agreement, the government will officially 
participate in the World Trade Organization system, an order of 
international trade," and that"it is the government's firm will." 
  He added that "the ROK, which has so far achieved economic 
development through free trade, must not be isolated from the 
international community because of its failure to participate in 
the World Trade Organization," and that "it would never be a 
good choice if the government brings international isolationism 
on itself."

  [Text] Marrekesh, Morocco, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Foreign and 
trade ministers from 125 countries applauded the opening of the 
Trade Negotiation Committee (TNC) meeting in the 11th century 
Moroccan city of Marrakech Tuesday to officially sign a new 
world trade accord. 
  The general agreement on tariffs and trade's seven-year 
multilateral trade round, which set sail in the Uruguayan beach 
resort of Punta del Este in 1986, was finalized last December 
and will be signed by all member countries on Friday. 
  Moroccan Prince Sidi Mohamed welcomed participants, TNC 
Ministerial Chairman and Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu 
Bonilla opened the conference, and GATT Secretary-general Peter 
Sutherland looked back on the long and hard journey to the final 
ceremony. 
  South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim 
Chol-su, 
the 14th representative to address the floor, voiced the same 
enthusiasm as his counterparts and pledged his country's 
commitment to implement the agreement fully. 
  Korea will sign the final act, promising to abide by the 
results of the UR [Uruguay Round] negotiations, but will hold 
off on inking the mandate for the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), GATT's successor, until domestic ratification. It will, 
however, initial the new government procurement agreement, an 
annex to the WTO package. 
  There is no deadline to sign the WTO accord although 
countries must finish the ratification process within two years 
after the treaty takes effect in order to join the new global 
organization. "All parties have shown the needed political will 
to make the round a considerable achievement. Some may have 
gained more than others, and some might be affected more than 
others. We know, however, that all parties are winners in both 
the economic and the political sense," Kim said. 
  Asserting that all parties will benefit enormously from the 
new agreement in the long run, Kim reminded that Korea has 
participated in the round from the beginning. "I would like to 
emphasize that my government has made extremely difficult 
decisions, particularly with respect to agricultural 
liberalization... Korea is now undergoing wide-ranging 
structural adjustment in the agricultural sector, which, you can 
well imagine, is far from being a simple and easy undertaking," 
he said. 
  Pointing out that the UR agreement has substantially 
strengthened the principle of multilateralism, he urged all 
members to complete the necessary domestic procedures soon. Kim 
then voiced concern over the non-multilateral approaches taken 
by some members, which could undermine the recent multilateral 
achievements and jeopardize the viability of the new world 
organization, taking a shot at Washington for its 
reauthorization of Super 301. All parties should abide by the 
new rules, and bring any trade cases to a multilateral forum 
instead of handling them bilaterally or resorting to unilateral 
action, he said. In the same vein, he expressed concern about 
the trend toward exclusive trading blocs. 
  In approaching the future work of the WTO such as 
identifying 
the relationship among trade, environmental and labor measures, 
Kim advised a balanced view respecting the concerns of 
developing countries. Recognizing the sharp differences of 
interest between developed and developing countries, he said 
that Korea, a newly industrializing country facing the problems 
of both, could help to resolve any potential conflicts. "I would 
hope that Korea would play a facilitating role in addressing the 
content of the agenda and parameters for discussion under the 
new WTO regime," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly 
Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee has in effect 
cancelled a plan to send a fact-finding team to Russia to look 
into the human rights conditions of North Korean loggers in 
Siberia. 
  The committee initially planned to send four of its 
legislators to Moscow and Khabarovsk to observe loggers' 
conditions before a special assembly sitting opens in May. 
  "The dispatch of a fact-finding team is not always needed in 
determining the conditions of North Korean loggers there," Kang 
Sin- che, chairman of the committee's ad hoc committee on North 
Korean loggers, said on Tuesday. 
  He said Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visits Moscow in the 
immediate future and there have been other frequent contacts 
between the two countries over the diplomatic channel. 
  Kang said he was withholding the dispatch. But, the plan 
seems to have been scrapped altogether. 
  "At the moment, we have no plan to send a survey team to 
Russia," an official of the Foreign Affairs and Unification 
Committee said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, which won 
the most shipping orders in 1993, has been supplanted by Japan 
this year, the Korea Shipbuilders' Association (KSA) said Friday. 
  Korea received shipping orders worth 339,000 tons in 
January-February and 672,000 tons in March to total 33 vessels, 
or 1.01 million tons in the first quarter of the year, 97 
percent of the 1.04 million tons recorded a year earlier. 
  Japan, on the other hand, won orders for 43 vessels, or 1.92 
million tons in January-February. 
  Considering it landed almost all large ship orders in March, 
Japan received nearly three times as many orders as Korea. 
  There is little profitability in Korea's workload as each 
ship averages 30,600 tons, far below last year's 43,900 tons and 
Japan's 44,900 tons. 
  Due to low-priced offers by the Japanese industry, 
international ship prices slumped from 20 percent to 30 percent 
this year from recent years. 
  Korean shipbuilders therefore tend to bid for small ships 
and 
leave the riskier and bigger vessels to their Japanese rivals, 
KSA officials said. 
  The double-hull very large crude carrier (VLCC) that cost 
100 
million dollars two years ago now sells for 85 million dollars, 
prompting Korean companies to avoid bidding for large ships, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Cheju, April 12 (YONHAP) -- The maritime police on 
Tuesday rescued eight crew members from a stranded Chinese 
fishing boat off the southwestern part of Cheju island, the 
Cheju Maritime Police said. 
  The maritime police said lifeboats were sent to waters off 
Mosulpo, Namcheju-kun, Cheju-do, around 8 A.M. to rescue Chinese 
fishermen from the vessel "Luyu 107," which ran aground earlier 
in the morning, the police said. 
  According to the police, the 80-ton fishing boat registered 
with Weihai City, Shandong Province, China, was swept away by 
high waves earlier in the morning while seeking a safe harbor in 
bad weather. Three of the 11 fishermen on the Luyu 107 had 
already swum to the port of Mosulpo, the police said.

  [Text] Hai Phong, Vietnam, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Ground was 
broken Friday for a steel rolling mill here with an annual 
production capacity of 200,000 tons of steel bars in a joint 
venture between Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (Posco) and Vietnam 
Steel Corp. (VSC) at a cost of 56 million U.S. dollars. 
  Attending the ground-breaking ceremony were Posco President 
Kim Chong-chin, Vietnamese Heavy Industries Minister Tran Lum 
and VSC chairman Ngo Huy Phan. 
  The 18,000-pyong (59,400-square-meter) VPS (VSC-Posco 
steel), 
due to be completed by September next year, will produce 70,000 
tons of rebar, 70,000 tons of round bars and 60,000 tons of wire 
rods. 
  Posco and its affiliate Keoyang Co. hold respective 45 
percent and 5 percent stakes in the company with 34 percent and 
16 percent holdings by VSC and the Hai Phong People's Council 
(HPC). 
  Posco has run a joint-venture factory called "Posvina" with 
an annual output capacity of 30,000 tons of corrugated steel 
sheet since April 1992 in Ho Chi Minh City, and is almost 
finished with work on a pipe mill with an annual capacity of 
30,000 tons in Hai Phong. 
  Korea's steel-making reached 33 million tons last year, 
compared with Vietnam's 210,000 tons, and the Vietnamese 
Government hopes to boost the industry as a major state project 
by joining up with Posco. 
  Due to increased steel demand brought by various 
infrastructure programs, Vietnam imported more than 60 percent 
of its steel bars -- 67 percent of its steel imports. 
  Encouraged by various joint ventures with Vietnam, Posco 
plans to advance into other Southeast Asian countries like 
Myanmar and Malaysia.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Floor leaders at the 
National Assembly could not agree Tuesday on convening an 
extraordinary session to discuss holding a public hearing on the 
Uruguay Round trade accord and other pending issues. 
  The leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and 
the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], however, did decide 
to meet again Wednesday. 
  In addition to the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party wants 
to talk about invoking parliamentary rights to investigate the 
"three major suspicious affairs." 
  These affairs include an opposition allegation that a large 
slush fund created by a construction company for a buddhist 
temple may have flowed into the political sector, to be used by 
the ruling party during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
  The DP also wants to investigate the ongoing power struggle 
at the nation's largest buddhist sect, the Chogye order, and 
suspicions over political surveillance of the residence of 
former DP leader Kim Tae-chung. 
  As for the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party has joined 
with student activists and farmers at "outdoor" rallies and 
demonstrations protesting the government's weak-kneed 
negotiating tactics at the round, which led to the opening of 
Korea's market to rice and other foreign farm products. 
  The opposition party has vowed to block ratification of the 
Uruguay Round accord unless the government renegotiates it. 
  But sensing a lukewarm public response and drawing sharp 
criticism from the ruling party, the DP appeared to agree Friday 
to bring the Uruguay Round issue "indoors" and discuss it at the 
National Assembly. 
  After Tuesday's meeting, DP Floor Leader Kim Tae-sik 
indicated that talks with his DLP counterpart, Rep. Yi Han-tong, 
had made some progress toward holding an extra session. 
  Kim said, "I shared the opinion with Rep. Yi that the 
National Assembly has to play a role in resolving all national 
issues. When it can't, the nation is left with only one way to 
go -- toward a crisis." 
  Yi also acknowledged that he had "detailed talks" with Kim, 
but no conclusion was reached because his party had yet to set 
clear policy goals on all pending issues. 
  "But in any event, we agreed that the National Assembly 
should not proceed toward a dead-end," he said. 
  Yi is expected to consult with DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil 
and 
Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Tuesday afternoon, then rejoin 
the opposition floor leader Wednesday morning to resume their 
discussion. 
  Yi hinted that the ruling party might go along with 
opposition moves to investigate pending issues, saying, "we will 
study their (opposition) proposals positively, depending on 
their attitude."

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang has instructed government ministries and agencies to 
complete their reorganization plans for "a small but efficient 
government" by the end of April, although it is unlikely that 
all will meet the deadline. As of Monday only nine, or 25 
percent, of the 38 ministries and agencies subject to downsizing 
had completed their plans. Among them were the Foreign Ministry 
and five other ministries whose reorganization plans were 
approved by the cabinet on Monday. 
  The completed plans of the nine ministries and agencies call 
for a combined staff reduction of 301: Two by the prime 
minister's office, 15 by the Economic Planning Board, 52 by the 
Foreign Ministry, 33 by the Home Ministry, 43 by the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry, nine by the Health and Social 
Affairs Ministry, four by the Labor Ministry, 28 by the 
Government Administration Ministry and 115 by the Korean 
National Railroad. 
  Of the remaining 29 ministries and agencies, the Finance 
Ministry and 15 others have submitted their plans while the 
rest, including the Defense Ministry, have yet to do so. The 
National Unification Board, the Legislation Ministry, the 
National Statistical Office, the Patriots and Veterans Affairs 
Ministry, the Military Manpower Administration and the Korean 
Customs Administration have not yet prepared their plans, 
whereas the Environment Ministry, the National Tax 
Administration and the Korean Industrial Property Office 
submitted plans calling for a staff increase of 300 to 1,000 in 
spite of President Kim Yong-sam's streamlining policy. 
  A Government Administration Ministry official said 
examination of the plans submitted by the ministries and 
agencies takes time. "But we're pressing them to complete their 
plans by the end of the month," he added.

and six divisions closed down. 
  The plan was approved by the cabinet as part of the 
government's overall strategy on streamlining. 
  Ministry officials said the restructuring does away with the 
controversial attempt to amend the Diplomat Employment Law, 
which initially envisioned changing the retirement age and 
lowering the limit in service years to rectify a promotion 
bottleneck. 
  The 17 special grade 1 positions will be demoted over the 
next three to five years. Five of the positions will be 
distributed to special grade 2, seven to grade 1 and another 
five to grade 2. 
  Officials said this finally reshapes the structure of the 
number of officials -- from an urn to the ideal pyramid. 
  The Ministry earlier planned to change its employment law to 
achieve this effect, but the move is no longer necessary since 
the reorganization will naturally lower the retirement age and 
service years. 
  The division reorganization affects Middle East Division I 
and II, which are being merged. 
  Africa Division I and II, Cultural Affairs Division I and 
II, 
Overseas Residents Division I and II, and Passport Division I 
and II are all being merged into single divisions. 
  The reduction, the officials noted, will change the past 
practice where nearly every employee served as division chief, a 
necessity before promotion to director-general. 
  Now there will be employees who bypass the division chief 
position, the officials said. 
  While shedding six divisions, the Ministry adds a new 
division on disarmament and atomic energy. 
  The new division falls under the supervision of the United 
Nations Bureau, which succeeds the current International 
Organizations Bureau. 
  The present Asian Affairs Bureau is being renamed the Asia- 
Pacific Affairs Bureau, while the Middle East and African 
Affairs Bureau will be called the Western Asia and African 
Affairs Bureau by taking over operations in Southeast Asia. 
  U.N. Division I, U.N. Division II and International 
Organization Division will be known as U.N. Policy Division, 
Human Rights Division and U.N. Economic Affairs Division. 
  Moving to strengthen its environment policy, the Ministry 
has 
separated the environment into an independent division from 
technology. 
  In addition, 12 attaches from eight other ministries were 
recalled to their headquarters, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
approved military personnel changes explained Tuesday by Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae, a government official said. 
  With the president's approval, the Defense Ministry is 
scheduled to announce its regular personnel changes at the end 
of this week or early next week. 
  The government plans to remove private organizations in the 
military through the personnel changes this month, but no 
details were available. 
  A senior government official said, "Defense Minister Yi 
briefed President Kim on the changes, but I have no information 
on personnel management concerning the generals and field grade 
officers who were members of 'Hana-hoe.'" 
  Hana-hoe was a private Army organization that counted former 
Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u among its members. 
  Another senior official said, "The overall feeling in the 
Army is that the personnel changes involving the Hana-hoe 
generals have not gone far enough. Most Army officers hope that 
all the Hana-hoe generals will be discharged or relieved of 
important posts."

  [Text] At the video rental in the basement store of the 
public service center of the National Defense Ministry, 
Yongsan-ku, Seoul, the most popular videotape lately is "A Few 
Good Men." The title of the tape, they say, was derived from the 
advertising tagline to recruit Marines in the United States. 
Though three copies of the tape were imported last August, it is 
so popular among the soldiers serving at the National Defense 
Ministry that no one can borrow it without making a reservation. 
The significance of the tape is that young officers attack the 
faults committed by a commander stubbornly loyal to his 
fatherland. It may perhaps be natural that such a story 
interests the officers of this country. 
  Since the new government, the Korean military is realizing 
more changes and reforms than any other group. The military 
which endures the intense criticism of the people due to the 
dishonorable work done by some of their predecessors under 
presidents of the military cliques over the last thirty years, 
bears a burden to change into a military which will receive the 
people's love and confidence. In these days of reform, what 
position is the military taking? In the nine months of Kim 
Yong-sam government, how much reform of the military has been 
carried out and which way is it going? Is it really succeeding? 
  It is no exaggeration to say that the aim of the military 
reform by the new goverment is to remove the Hanahoe. Last 8 
March, President Kim Yong-sam suddenly dismissed Kim Chin-yong, 
the Army Chief of the General Staff, and So Won-su, the Defense 
Security Commander. Last 18 October, he conducted the promotions 
of army corps and division commanders and of rear admiral and 
major general classes of the Navy and Air Force, as well as 
personnel changes of key positions in the National Defense 
Ministry. With this, his military reshuffle was finished. 
  In addition, President Kim carried out a second military 
reshuffle including the dismissal of Kim To-yun, the Defense 
Security Commander, and about 30 executive officers of brigadier 
general, colonel and lieutenant colonel classes, thus 
establishing a royal governing structure both in name and 
reality. With this, the military clique, which had lasted for 
thirteen years from the beginning of the 1980 Fifth Republic 
through the Sixth Republic, collapsed and a new military clique 
was formed. 
  Of the three- and four-star generals of the entire army, 
only 
five including General Kim Chae-chang (18th term graduate of the 
Military Academy; only the number of the term will be written 
hereinafter), Deputy Commander of the Combined Forces and 
Vice-Admiral Yim Chung-rin (16th term graduate of the Naval 
Academy) the Marine Corps Commandant, etc., were promoted by the 
former President No Tae-u at the end of last year. The rest of 
the generals were all promoted by President Kim with the regular 
personnel changes this fall. But all generals of Hanahoe, except 
for one, could not be promoted. 
  According to the Army authority, Hanahoe's members number 
about 120 and are 20th- to 36th-term graduates of the Military 
Academy. The only general still in active service and who is 
prior to the 20th term graduates is Kim Chae-chang. 
  From a list of generals published confidentially by the 
National Defense Ministry at the beginning of every year, the 
following members of Hanahoe were expunged for various reasons 
and registered on the list of veterans: Kim Chin-yong (Military 
Academy), Cho Nam-pung (18th term), Ku Chang-hoe (ex-Third Army 
Commander), So Wan-su (19th term, ex-Defense Security 
Commander), An Byong-ho (20th term, ex-Army Capital Garrison 
Commander), Yi Chung-sok (21st term, ex-Operation Department 
Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), So Chung-il (23d term, 
ex-21st Division Commander), etc. 
  Keeping Hanahoe at a distance was already somewhat expected 
when major class officers were promoted last August. At that 
time, twelve members of the Aljahoe who are 41st term graduates 
of the Military Academy were not even registered on the list of 
those eligible for promotion. So when lieutenant colonel and 
colonel class officers were promoted, 37th-term graduates of 
Aljahoe and 32d-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded. Even 
when 43 officers were promoted to brigadier general, eight 
27th-term and three 26th-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded. 
  These are not all of Hanahoe's problems. Immediately after 
that, though four lieutenant generals (corps commanders) and 16 
major generals (11 division commanders and 5 others) were 
promoted, none from Hanahoe could be promoted. In the personnel 
changes of generals, members of Hanahoe had to leave even their 
leisurely posts, not to mention the important posts. Nine 
lieutenants and major generals of Hanahoe were ordered to leave 
their posts and await discharge or were not assigned to any 
posts. 
  Three generals, Lieutenant General Kim Chung-hon (18th term) 
director of the Military Academy, Major General An Kwang-yol 
(20th term) director of the Installation Bureau of the National 
Defense Ministry, and Major General Choe Ki-hong (22d term) 
policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry were 
ordered to leave their posts and wait for further action at the 
Headquarters of the Army. Lieutenant General Yi Taek-hyong (19th 
term) Strategy Planning Department chief of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff and Kim Sang-chun, Operation Department chief of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff have also informally decided to leave their 
posts and wait for further action at the Headquarters of the 
Army. Lieutenant General Kim Chung-bae (20th term) Third Corps 
commander, Song Tok-son, 11th Corps commander, Major General 
Choe Seung-woo (21st term) chief of staff of the Education 
Headquarters, and Major General Yo Myong-hyon (21st term) chief 
of staff of the Second Army, four in all, were appointed to 
Policy Committees of the Army Headquarters. The posts of Policy 
Committees are leisurely ones that are given to officers 
expected to be discharged. Members of Hanahoe who took charge of 
main army divisions near the capital, including Major General 
Chong Chong-taek (23d term) Capital Mechanized Division 
commander, Son Su-tae, 30th Division commander, and Pak Yong-il, 
Third Division commander, were also transferred to less 
important posts of vice-corps commander seven months before the 
end of their two-year terms. 
  Now no one of Hanahoe has an important post in the Army. The 
chief secretary of the Army Chief of Staff, 30th and 33d Brigade 
commanders of the Capital Garrison Command, the Personnel Staff 
of the Army Headquarters, the key posts of the ranger-commando 
force and the Defense Security Command are filled with officers 
other than members of Hanahoe or graduates of the Military 
Academy. 
  Last 3 November for the first time after President Kim took 
office, Kim Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff, had 
an exclusive talk with the president where it is said that he 
was given directions to "from next year, select and assign 
members of Hanahoe." But many people say that members of Hanahoe 
have suffered such unfavorable treatment that they could not 
make a comeback. 
  Various kinds of reactions came out from people inside and 
outside of the Army on the perfect purge of Hanahoe. 
  General A: "Hanahoe was a curse on our Army. For the unity 
and harmony of the Army, even its roots must be eradicated. You 
must bear in mind that members of Hanahoe survived the the Yun 
Pil-yong event carried out in the 12 December coup and the 17 
May Kwangju event." 
  Colonel B: "I recognize the abuse of Hanahoe. But it is also 
wrong that even colonels and lieutenant colonels of the club are 
excluded in promotions, solely on the basis of being registered 
on the membership list of Hanahoe. After the 13 April 1987 
Constitution protection measure, as instructed by Ko Myong-sung, 
the then Defense Security commander, many majors and lieutenant 
colonels became members of Hanahoe to protect the regime, 
regardless of their own will, didn't they?" 
  Lieutentant C: "I will, as a member of Hanahoe, willingly 
submit to such unfavorable treatment. It is, though, too 
unreasonable that only because seniors, juniors, and companions 
of mine are on good terms with Hanahoe members, they are looked 
upon coldly and treated unfavorably." 
  Reserve General D: "If the goverment wants to purge Hanahoe 
members, it should discharge them all at once from service or 
leave them alone. If it transfers them to leisurely posts a few 
months after it had assigned them to key posts, it will merely 
cause the Army to agitate. If the current of the times is like 
this, it should treat all members by the same standard and free 
them from dissatisfaction and uneasiness." 
  Who will be the new influential group to take over the posts 
of Hanahoe? Although the influential group to replace Hanahoe, 
which held the Army for ten years, hasn't formed yet, it is 
clear that one is rapidly forming. 
  In the process of forming a new military clique under the 
new 
government, another significant factor is the rapid collapse of 
the TK [Taegu North Kyongsang Province] group. Although five 
member of the TK group were promoted to brigadier generals this 
year as last year, not one of the group was included in the 
promotion of 16 major generals including 11 division commanders. 
The four generals promoted to corps commanders were all non-TK 
group -- three from Seoul and one from South Kyongsang Province. 
  After the new government began, the TK group collapsed. 
Instead officers from Pusan and South Kyongsang Province (PK), 
the areas producing the most members of the influential group, 
rose remarkably to the surface. Of the promoted brigadier 
generals, 14 are from PK -- 12 from South Kyongsang Province and 
two from Pusan -- four more than last year. Of the promoted 
lieutenant generals, Yi Yu-so (20th term) 7th Corps commander is 
from Kyongnam High School of Pusan. Of the promoted major 
generals, Kim Pan-kyu (24th term) 55th Division Commander and 
Cho Yong-rae (177th-term graduate of the military officer 
training center) Third Division commander, are from South 
Kyongsang Province. Kim Hui-sang (24th term) newly appointed 
Capital Mechanized Division commander is from Kojang, South 
Kyongsang Province, the same place as Chong Chung-wuk, Secretary 
of Diplomacy and Security of the Blue House. Rear Admiral Chun 
To-bong (35th-term graduate of the Naval Officer Training 
Center) deputy chief of Personnel Staff of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff and Admiral Kim Mu-Ung (21st-term graduate of the Naval 
Academy) are also from PK. Because Major General Kim Pan-kyu and 
Brigadier General Sin Hye-kwon are from Koje Island, the native 
place of President Kim, they attract more public attention. 
Moreover, it is believed that because Major General Kim was 
President Kim's junior in Kyongnam High School and Brigadier 
General Sin was the Operations Staff of Corps exercising the 
jurisdiction over Koje Island, this would have favorably 
affected their promotions. 
  The fact that PK has not only risen significantly in numbers 
but also holds important posts has attracted public attention. 
Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun (3d-term ROTC graduate, the 
promotion to a major general is expected next 1 January), 
unexpectedly appointed to the post of Defense Security Command 
last 21 October, is from Hamyang, South Kyongsang Province, and 
ex-Sixth Division Commander Han Sung-ui (22d term) recently 
appointed to the post of policy planning officer of the National 
Defense Ministry, who graduated from Pusan High School, is from 
Sanjong, South Kyongsang Province. 
  Another distinctive feature of the last personnel changes is 
that large numbers of graduates of Kyongbok High School of Seoul 
are taking posts in the Army and the new government. 
  As the graduates of the Kyongbok High School including Kim 
Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff went up into 
higher classes, the Blue House and those close to the President 
might have exercised their influence over the promotions. 
Persons well informed of the military believe Mr. K., a younger 
person graduated from Kyongbok High School, who is known to 
serve near the president and has an important effect upon the 
personnel changes in the government, and Minister K, etc., would 
have exercised directly or indirectly their influence over the 
last military personnel changes. 
  Of the Kyongbok High School graduates, there are Kim 
Hoe-sang, ex-national defense secretary of the Blue House and 
Hong Sun-ho (4th-term ROTC graduate, ex-chief of planning 
security of the Army Headquarters) Fifth-Division commander and 
President Kim's junior in the philosophy department of Seoul 
University. Chang Chong-kil (21st-term graduate of the Naval 
Academy) ex-Fifth Battle Corps commander of the Navy, and Choe 
Yong-hwan (15th-term graduate of the Air Force Academy) Tenth 
Battle Flying Corps commander of the Air Force are also 
graduates of the same school. 
  It is said that Minister K, an influential person in the 
government, widely associates with all sorts and classes of 
people and also has a wide acquaintance in the military from 
which to collect information. It is said that he put forth his 
opinion on the military personnel changes to President Kim. 
Considering these facts, the current influential persons in 
Korea's new military world are mainly from Pusan and South 
Kyongsang Province regions and graduates of Kyongbok High School. 
  A remarkable point is that not as many graduates of Kyongnam 
High School, President Kim's old school, have been appointed to 
important posts as other school graduates. It is known that of 
the Kyongnam High School graduates, there is actually no general 
higher than three stars in active service. Although General Ku 
Chang-hoe, the Third Army Commander, was in active service up 
until the beginning of this year, he was discharged from service 
last April. Brigadier General Yi Hyang-su (21st term, 
Intelligence School Director) and Brigadier General Kim Sang-yol 
(discharge expected next January) are in active service, but 
both were excluded in the promotion to major generals. Besides 
Major General Chon Sang-bae (22d term, chief of Intelligence 
Staff of the Army Headquarters), Major General An Song-yong (23d 
term, 17th Division commander), Major General Kim Pan-kyu (24th 
term) who was appointed to the post of division commander 
recently, Brigadier General Pak No-sok (24th term) chief 
secretary of the Army Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier 
General Pak Man-taek (26th term) are all graduates of Kyongnam 
High School. None of the Kyongnam High School graduates of the 
25th through 27th terms of the Military Academy are in active 
service. In the Marine Corps, there is Rear Admiral Chon To-bong. 
  A field grade officer, a graduate of Kyongnam High School, 
said, "This is the case because Kyongnam High School graduates 
mainly entered the medical and business worlds, while many Pusan 
High School graduates launched into the bureaucratic world. Even 
if Kyongnam High School graduates did join the military world, 
they could not keep company with President Kim because of his 
long time association with the opposition party." 
  On the other hand, Pusan and Kyongbuk High Schools produced 
large numbers of influential persons during the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics. They include General Un Yong-nam, Third Army 
commander, Major General Han Sung-ui (22d term) newly appointed 
policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry, and 
Major General Yi Ui-se (22d term) national defense secretary of 
the National Security Planning Agency in the important posts. 
Since the new government was established, the power of Kyongbuk 
High School graduates is diminishing. So Wan-su, defense 
security commander, was already ruined. Major General Choe 
Ki-hong (22d term) was ordered to leave his post and wait for 
further action at Army Headquarters. Major Sin Chong (20th term) 
is in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Major General Ku Tae-to (21st 
term) and Brigadier General Choe Tong-Chin (25th term, aide of 
the Minister) are in the National Defense Ministry. Brigadier 
General Chong Su-song (202d-term graduate of the Military 
Officer Training Center) is in the personnel staff of the Army 
Headquarters. These are all low-profile posts. 
  The Seoul High School graduates who once built up a large 
area of influence in the military also seem to have decreased in 
numbers as compared with the past. Lieutenant General Kim Chok 
(21st term) chief of the Operations Department of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, who was appointed to the First Corps Commander 
this time, and Lieutenant General Kim Sang-chun (19th term) are 
both graduates of Seoul High School. Besides them, Yi Yon-rin, 
Chief of Planning and Management Office, and Yi Chung-hyong, 
first assistant minister, who hold the important posts in the 
National Defense Ministry as reserve officers, are also Seoul 
High School graduates. 
  On the other hand, graduates of Kyonggi High School are 
advancing by leaps and bounds. Among them are: To Il-kyu, Army 
Capital garrison commander, Yi Ho-sung, chief of planning staff 
of the Army Headquarters, Pak Yong-ok (21st term) expected 
military attache to the Korean Embassy in the United States, and 
Yi Sang-hui (26th term) who was promoted to a brigadier general 
this time and is serving in the Defense Secretary's office of 
the Blue House. And there are many graduates of Songdong High 
School of Seoul who hold important posts. They are Yi Chong-nam 
(21st term) defense secretary of the Blue House, and Yi Sok-bok 
(21st term) deputy chief of staff of the Combined Forces, and 
Lieutenant General Yi Kyu-hwan who was appointed to the post of 
Third Corps commander. Of the graduates of Chaeil High School of 
Kwangju, there are Lieutenant General Kim Tong-sin, Captial 
Corps commander, Major General An Taek-sun in the Air Force, and 
Yi So-yong (20th term graduate of the Naval Academy) the First 
Fleet commander. Colonels Kim Chang-su and Kwon An-to were 
promoted to brigadier generals most recently, attracting public 
attention. 
  In the past, the influential military men held important 
posts in three commands: the Capital Garrison Command, the 
Defense Security Command, and Ranger Command. But after the 
civil government began, posts affecting politics tend to be 
regarded with great importance. With the conception of important 
posts changing, the military men being trusted by the ministers 
or the Blue House are holding such posts. The chief of the 
personnel staff of the Army Headquarters who in the past 
exercised his enormous influence over personnel changes is also 
now less popular, military men estimate. Some say that receiving 
enormous bribes in connection with military construction while 
in office as Seventh Division Commander, Yim Chong-sop's (22d 
term, chief of personnel staff) actions contributed to the 
decline in the post's popularity. Accordingly, the important 
posts in the military are said to be the Policy Office chief and 
policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministy, the 
national defense secretary of the Blue House and minister aides, 
etc. 
  In less than one year after being transferred to the post of 
First Corps commander after serving as policy planning officer, 
General Cho Song-tae (20th term) returned to the post of Policy 
Office Chief of the National Defense Ministry. Graduated from 
Taejon Middle School and the high school attached to the 
Education College of Seoul, he had been selected by Yi Chong-ku, 
national defense minister to be policy planning officer. He is 
said to have carried out his duties so well as to please the 
then Vice-Minister Kwon Yong-hae. 
  As Major General Choe Ki-hong had been dismissed from the 
post of policy planning officer by reason of his membership in 
Hanahoe, his classmate Han Sung-ui, Sixth Division commander, 
was appointed to the post. Han Sung-ui who is from Sanchong, 
South Kyongsang Province, and graduated from Pusan High School, 
served as a professor of English at the Military Academy and had 
been with the Combined Forces Command. 
  It is the selection of Yi Chong-nam, the national defense 
secretary of the Blue House, that attracted the public eye more 
than any other personnel changes at this time. As an artillery 
man, Major General Yi Chong-nam did not distinguish himself and 
was passed up twice for promotion to brigadier general. After he 
served as an evaluation and management officer and operations 
coordination officer of the National Defense Ministry, he was 
promoted to a major general last year and was appointed to the 
post of the national defense secretary of the Blue House this 
time. In the middle of the 1970's when Chong Sung-hwa, ex-Army 
chief of the General Staff, served as a Third Corps commander 
and president of the Military Academy, Major General Yi served 
as his chief secretary. 
  A person in the political circles who is known to advise the 
president about military affairs since President Kim took office 
said, "President Kim sometimes says he owes General Chong 
Sung-hwa a great debt of gratitude. It is because General Chong 
made speeches of support for him during the 1987 presidential 
election campaign. Selecting Major General Yi could be said to 
be President Kim's way of repaying General Chong for his 
kindness." 
  Besides this reason, it was also a consideration that Major 
General Yi is the most informed about the Yulgok Program which 
amounts to about 30 percent of the entire national defense 
budget. In the past, the presidential security service chief 
discharged from military service generally advised the president 
about military affairs. But as the national defense secretary 
takes charge of such duties, this position might have been 
raised from a brigadier general to a major general rank in order 
to expand his range of authority. 
  The duties of the minister's aide are to assist the minister 
from 8 AM when the minister shows up at the office to 6 or 7 PM. 
The aide, who leads about 20 staff members including 
colonel-class officers in charge of administration, protocol and 
overseas, etc., must assist in even the slightest movement by 
the national defense minister, by being in touch at all times 
with the Blue House and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. There are 
even times when he should write a letter of resignation for the 
minister and then entreat him to withdraw the resignation. The 
aide should be able to handle such difficult problems well. 
Therefore, he, more than anyone, has to be in harmony with the 
minister. 
  Choe Tong-chin (25th term, brigadier general) a newly 
appointed aide is said to have conducted these duties well while 
in the office of the chief of staff of the Army Capital Garrison 
Command. It appears that coming from the same hometown (Kyongju) 
as the minister has allowed him to enjoy his confidence. 
  Interference in the military personnel changes by the Blue 
House is no less than it has been in the past, according to 
persons well informed with the military. It is said that the 
Blue House gathers information about high-ranking generals 
through another channel, a search the Defense Security Command 
did in the past. Through the channel, which field-grade officers 
as well as generals use, various opinions on military affairs 
are transmitted to the Blue House, a source said. 
  It is said that Mr. P., an influential person of the Blue 
House, plays an important role in military affairs. Because his 
duties are to run errands for President Kim, his role could be 
said to be a natural one. But when Kim To-yun, ex-commander of 
the Defense Security, who was appointed by President Kim, was 
suddenly replaced by Yim Chae-mun, chief of staff of the Defense 
Security Command, last 21 October, Mr. P. is said to have played 
a major role. 
  Because at the time the government only said that "(Kim, 
ex-commander of the Defense Security) resigned for personal 
reasons" regarding his replacement as the commander of the 
Defense Security, the real reasons were not known until now. 
But, informed persons say, it is certain that Mr. P. interfered 
in these affairs. 
  While the Blue House prohibits any exclusive talks between 
the president and the commander of the Defense Security since 
the new government began, it has obtained information on the 
military's thoughts (especially those of Hanahoe) through the 
national defense minister and separately through the managing 
staffs of the Defense Security Command, they say. It is because 
information obtained through official channels was in many cases 
different from that obtained through unofficial lines, 
especially, of the Hanahoe's thoughts which the Blue House has 
given deep thought to, information obtained through official 
channels tend to have less value. Accordingly, Mr. P. and Mr. 
H., another influential person in the Blue House, found the 
situation to be unusual and made a recommendation to the 
president to replace the defense security commander. 
  "It is well known that since President Kim was in 
opposition, 
he surely has operated multiple information channels. This is 
for keeping `checks and balances'. Although the president 
initially trusted in the information from official channels as 
much as can be, he realized it often differed from information 
from unofficial lines. Thus he decided to change the official 
channel. Because he could not change the minister who was in 
charge of the official channel, he eventually had no choice but 
to dismiss the defense security commander who was a faithful 
staff officer to Minister Kwon," said a person well informed on 
the military and the Blue House. 
  "By changing the defense security commander, the president 
intended not only to secure the support of the government by the 
Army but to check the arbitrary actions of ministers and the 
chiefs of the general staff of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
anyone else," he added. 
  It is known to have been Mr. P. who, in compliance with the 
president's intention, looked for a successor to the post of 
defense security commander. Although Mr. P. called Major General 
K. (serving at the National Defense Ministry) and Major General 
L. (serving at the Army Headquarters), both of whom are 22d-term 
graduates of the Military Academy and classmates of Commander 
Kim, to the Blue House and asked them to take the post, they 
both reportedly declined the offer. 
  Eventually Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun, chief of the 
staff 
of the Defense Security Command, was selected. The ex-Commander 
Kim did not know he was being replaced even two days before. On 
19 October, when the ex-commander stopped in at the U.S. Army 
heliport at Yongsan on his way to the main operations meeting at 
Kyeryongdae, he was said to have been comforted by some 
colleague generals for his not being promoted to a major general 
in the previous day's promotion changes. That is, needless to 
say, because of the silence kept by the Blue House which is well 
known for President Kim's ability to guard secrets better than 
the military. 
  The next day after Yim, the newly appointed commander of the 
defense security, who is the 3d-term graduate of the ROTC and is 
keen and punctual like his nickname of `German soldier', took 
office, he visited President Kim with Mr. Pak Kwan-yong, chief 
secretary of the Blue House also attending. At that time, the 
commander was said to have been instructed by President Kim to 
keep special watch on unusual movements of Hanahoe members and 
of graduates of the Military Academy and report to the Blue 
House of any unusual occurrences. 
  This meant the system of the defense security commander's 
direct report to the president was renewed. Therefore, Yim's 
authority seems to have been expanded beyond that of 
ex-Commander Kim. The system of direct reports to the president 
even on the problems of the national defense minister who is 
second to the president on military affairs, was established, 
related persons analyzed. 
  As if he put such instructions into practice, five days 
after 
taking office, he conducted personnel changes in the command, 
relieving many Military Academy graduates of their posts. 
  Transferred to the Defense Security Command in 1967 as a 
first lieutenant, Commander Yim is a competent intelligence 
officer who has mainly served at the Second (intelligence 
section, abolished in the last March reorganization) and Third 
(anti-Communist section) Sections. Under the Fifth Republic, he 
deeply intervened in campus activities and made perfectly 
logical statements even at the countermeasure meetings of the 
related organizations. This style of his came in sight even in 
his first personnel changes. He appointed officers other than 
the Military Academy graduates to all of the important posts in 
the command -- Brigadier General Song Tae-song (17th-term 
graduate of the Air Force Academy, ex-section chief of the 
Defense Security Command) to the post of chief of staff, Colonel 
Pak Hyo-chun (military officer training center graduate, 
ex-Masan Detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security 
Command) to the post of first section chief (in charge of 
security) and Colonel Cho Chong-ho (4th-term graduate of the 
ROTC, ex-Materials and Data Management Office chief) to the post 
of the 100th Detachment commanding officer of the Defense 
Security in the National Defense Ministry. 
  On the other hand, he ordered two generals, Brigadier 
General 
Choe Chae-rim (23d-term graduate) ex-detachment commanding 
officer of the Defense Security in the National Defense Ministry 
and Brigadier General Song Hwa-yong (24th-term graduate) 
ex-detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security in the 
Army Headquarters, three colonels graduated from the Military 
Academy including No Tok-ho (31st-term graduate, ex-detachment 
deputy commanding officer of the Defense Security in the Army 
Headquarters), and four senior colonels including Kim Hyon 
(military officer training center graduate), to return to Army 
Headquarters. 
  These are not all of the structure reductions of the Defense 
Security Command. The Defense Security Command which made a 
large-scale reform from the end of last March to the beginning 
of April is undergoing a second reform under Commander Yim's 
leadership. At the beginning of November, the commander 
discharged from service or returned to their original units 
several lieutenant colonels who had served in the command or 
other detachments across the country. The same measures are 
expected to be taken soon with officers below major in rank. 
  This year the command cut 703 persons from its 
establishment, 
down from 6,047 to 5,324. The command first planned to gradually 
reduce approximately 400 more personnel by 1997, but the 
reduction was carried out far sooner than expected. After the 
new government began, the command dissolved 61 small forces of 
the defense secretary which had been secretly run and annexed 
them into their higher units. And it abolished the intelligence 
section which was denounced for illegal intervention in politics 
and inspections of civilians, and instead established a new 
Materials and Data Management Office, reorganized and reduced 
the structure from four sections and three offices to three 
sections and four offices. 
  The 1994 command's budget was cut 14.4 percent from this 
year's, from 37.5 billion to 32.1 billion won. A budget area 
especially hard hit was the reduction of 1.8 billion won for 
intelligence activities. This fact leads us to believe that the 
operation of the command is being reduced. As to the role and 
status of the Defense Security Command which had been the most 
powerful organization in the military during the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics, differences of opinions are likely. 
  After Commander Yim Chae-mun's structure began, the 
commanding officers of the command enjoyed the confidence of the 
Blue House, but the general personnel are more demoralized than 
ever. Driving out the Military Academy graduates in the command 
seems to be a primary factor contributing to rising 
complications between the Military Academy graduates and other 
officers. 
  A defense security officer graduated from the Military 
Academy spoke frankly, "Officers in the command can be promoted 
only if they serve in the headquarters, not in its subordinate 
units. But in the second reform of the command, many officers 
from the Military Academy were forced to return to their units 
or to transfer to its subordinate units. What does this mean 
except that they should be discharged from service? Although I 
was frequently misunderstood and disliked while working as a 
secret agent in the past, I have not regretted taking this job 
as much as I do these days." 
  Minister Kwon Yong-hae is leading the military reform which 
focuses on driving out Hanahoe and reducing the structure of the 
Defense Security Command. (Most military men say that the word 
`change' is more appropriate than `reform'.) Then how long will 
his power really last? What is the source of the power, and in 
what manner is it being exercised? 
  It is a firm opinion that his leadership of the military is 
derived from the confidence of President Kim. First, the 
President's confidence of Minister Kwon is known to be immense. 
This seems to be a result of Minister Kwon's loyalty combined 
with President Kim's tendency to believe in trustworthy men to 
the end. 
  According to some in the Blue House, recently President 
Kim's 
view of Minister Kwon is beginning to change. Of course, his 
confidence in Minister Kwon has not yet diminished. But until a 
little while ago, the president's philosophy was to rely mainly 
on the minister for military control, but this is said to be 
gradually changing. 
  This is exemplified by events such as the sudden dismissal 
of 
Kim To-yun, ex-defense security commander, the new commander's 
direct report to the Blue House, and an exclusive talk with Kim 
Tong-chin, the Army Chief of the General Staff (3 November). As 
stated before, the president, through changing the defense 
security commander, is going to check the expanding power of 
Minister Kwon and will enjoy more of the minister's loyalty and 
the military brains. 
  But, some analyze, the change of defense security commander 
may cause Minister Kwon to remain long in office. It is said to 
be because the president has become confident of his control of 
the military and has no man equal to Minister Kwon. In other 
words, the president is said to have a plan to check Hanahoe and 
the Military Academy graduates through the defense security 
commander, one who has not graduated from the Military Academy, 
and to carry forward the second reform of the military -- the 
reasonable execution of the national defense budget and the 
establishment of the future military system through Minister 
Kwon's loyal work. 
  But Minister Kwon will know his duty well as a National 
Defense Minister. It is just that he should take care of the 
Army and help them perform their duties faithfully, as President 
Kim promised, in observance of Armed Forces Day held in the 
drill ground field at Kyeryongdae last 1 October, that he 
trusted firmly in his Army and would take the lead in enhancing 
their honor and dignity. 
  The military's discontentment with Minister Kwon up to this 
point seems to stem from the minister's inability to adequately 
protect them from outside influences such as the Blue House and 
the political world. A colonel serving in the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff said, "Everybody will recognize that although the minister 
is only an ex-major general, he conducts business better and 
thinks more rationally than an ex-general. But I think the 
minister is an official man who has many problems to settle 
politically rather than administratively. The minister did not 
handle with a firmly subjective view the Hanahoe, the persons 
involved in the 12 December incident, the absurd personnel 
changes, and the absurdity of the Yulgok Program. The minister's 
personal problems such as his brother Kwon Yong-ho's accepting 
bribes from a military goods supplier and the bad rumors related 
to the Yulgok Program during his tenure as vice-minister should 
no longer be targets of criticism. It is urgent to prevent 
unrest in the military and to stabilize them. I think this 
should be the most important consideration in evaluating the 
minister." 
  The chiefs of the general staff of the three armed services 
have also changed significantly from the past. In short, they 
are trying to read the minds of the minister and members of the 
Blue House. They report to the minister all the military affairs 
which in the past they could settle on their own. They leave 
Kyeryongdae and stay in Seoul about two days a week. 
  Amid the circumstances, the fact that President Kim had an 
exclusive talk with the Army Chief of the General Staff Kim for 
the first time last 3 November is a big change. Similar talks 
are expected to occur with the heads of the Navy and Air Force. 
Minister Kwon may be sorry to see this happen. But, many people 
think these talks are desirable because it will allow for "the 
checks and balances" of the military power. 
  Minister Kwon is known as a man with many strengths such as 
a 
glib tongue, perfectly logical thinking power, and a profound 
knowledge. On the other hand, he has some weak points. The most 
obvious is that he does not have many reliable people around 
him. According to people well acquainted with him, he had no 
opportunities to make many friends around him, overpowered by 
the Hanahoe's influence in the past. So he readily hired persons 
with whom he had worked once or twice and in many cases, they 
failed. 
  A typical case is Yim Chong-sop, the chief of the personnel 
staff of the Army Headquarters, who was relieved of his post on 
a charge of accepting a bribe in connection with a military 
construction project last 8 November. Major General Yim had won 
Minister Kwon's confidence during his service as an artillery 
regimental commander under Minister Kwon, the then Sixth 
Division commander. So, Yim had been appointed to the post of 
chief of the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters to succeed 
Major General Choe Sung-u (21st-term graduate) who was relieved 
of this post last April by reason of his membership in the 
Hanahoe. 
  Last 2 October, citing the special statement of Minister 
Kwon, the National Defense Ministry vowed that "The Army shall 
be reborn, as one which will enjoy the people's love and 
confidence and carry out its original duty faithfully." "At one 
time, the Army strayed from its mission of serving public 
interest and justice because some groups gave priority to 
regionalism, kinship, or other interests." It reflected on 
itself. "The Army itself also committed bad acts by expecting or 
fostering in secret uncommon human relations." 
  Within a month after the promotions and personnel changes of 
the Army generals were completed and the wrong-doings of 
suspected key post generals were exposed, some soldiers said, 
"Another special statement by the minister should be made." 
  According to many soldiers, they do not see any changes in 
the military from the past -- the military feels uneasy and even 
the right of command, which is the most important factor in the 
Army, seems unsettled. This is caused mainly by the frequent 
personnel changes made without any firm standard. 
  Even this year, due to three or four sudden personnel 
changes, in addition to the periodical one, soldiers say they 
feel uneasy and discontented with the changes, and that sudden 
changes are dangerous and has caused the military to be 
discouraged. Some say, "Even if they are discharged from 
service, it should be with honor and justice" or "Soldiers 
discharged from the service with grudges against the military 
could possibly be uneasy for the military." 
  With the frequent personnel changes by the new government, 
the commanders of the Defense Security, the Army Education and 
the Capital Corps have all changed three or four times this 
year. They ask how stable can commands of units be under such 
circumstances. Officers point this out because the reforms of 
the military have been made impromptu, without any program. Most 
officers do not want the military to be the subject of 
politicians' experimentation. 
  According to Professor Hong Tu-sung (Sociology) of Seoul 
University, last September, "the influence of the military on 
our politics" is 4.85 percent, sharply down from 12.6 percent in 
June 1990 and 32.3 percent in 1988. In the year 2000, less than 
1.5 percent, the lowest of the power elite groups, is expected. 
  The competitive rate of next year's applicant for entrance 
to 
the Military Academy is a bit more than 4 to 1, less than that 
of the average year, the lowest since the academy opened. Those 
of the Naval and Air Force Academies are also, though a little 
higher than the Military Academy, unprecedentedly low. The 
factors which will give a sense of crisis to the military group 
are drawing near more remarkably than ever. 
  Under such circumstances, next year's national defense 
budget 
is 10,490 billion won, a 9.6 percent increase over the previous 
year, and will be more than 10 trillion won for the first time 
in history. In the budget, operational and maintenance expenses 
are 7,035.7 billion won, an 11.7 percent increase, but the 
build-up expenses of new war potential show a decrease of 79 
percent over the previous year. 
  Some people fear the day will come when such an enormous 
budget will be entrusted to deteriorated career soldiers. 
Military experts say that from now on, the government should 
reduce the operational and maintenance expenses and divert these 
funds to the modernization and specialization of the military 
and the maintenance of superior manpower, and that in order to 
reduce the operational and maintenance expenses, the government 
should first largely unify duplicate structures in the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force, and liquidate nonurgent units. Mr. Chi 
Man-won (51), a commentator on the military, said, "If the 
government gets rid of nonessential units and structures in the 
military, it could save more than 100,000 military personnel. As 
a result the government could save much in the national defense 
budget. If it commits these soldiers to the industrial areas, it 
could get an increase of more than three trillion won of gross 
national product a year." 
  Many soldiers say that only if President Kim lets the 
ordinary soldiers serve in the military peacefully with honor 
and high morale after driving out political soldiers, will his 
reform of the military succeed. If done so, nobody will object 
to the notion that "the military could secure the freedom and 
rights of the people and be the wheel of the cart that is loaded 
with the happiness and prosperity of the people," as President 
Kim said in observance of Armed Forces Day.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Friday 
in Marrakech, Morocco, where they are attending a ministerial 
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
government sources said Tuesday. Hata and Kantor will meet for 
about two hours over breakfast to seek a breakthrough in 
resuming the failed trade "framework" talks and also discuss 
multilateral issues, the sources said. 
  Relations between Tokyo and Washington have soured over 
trade 
following the collapse of the trade negotiations in February 
when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton met. 
  Hata's trip to Marrakech will formally be decided in a 
buck-slip cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, they said. 
  The foreign minister is to leave Japan on Wednesday noon for 
Morocco and return to Japan on Sunday, according to the sources. 
Hata was originally scheduled to leave Tuesday but was delayed 
due to the political turmoil following Hosokawa's sudden 
announcement last Friday that he will resign . 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, is tipped as a strong 
candidate as the successor to Hosokawa. 
  On Monday, the Japanese Government sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the 
government representative for external economic affairs, to 
Marrakech in case Hata cannot attend the four-day GATT session 
that wraps up Friday. 
  Also in Marrakech, Hata will meet Australian Trade Minister 
Bob Mcmullan and Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade 
commissioner, separately Thursday, the sources said. 
  Hata may also meet U.S. Vice President Al Gore if possible, 
the sources said.

  [Text] Washington, April 11 KYODO -- Japan's Ambassador to 
the United States Takakazu Kuriyama assured Washington Monday 
that the new government in Tokyo will press on with political 
and economic reform initiated by outgoing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. Japanese diplomatic sources said Kuriyama 
gave his assurance in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor. 
  Kuriyama originally asked for the meeting to set the 
groundwork for crucial trade talks that had been scheduled for 
Friday in Morocco between Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  The surprise announcement last Friday that Hosokawa was 
stepping down from office is likely to scuttle Hata's planned 
trip to Morocco, however, as well as prospects for a quick 
resumption of stalled trade talks between Tokyo and Washington. 
  Japanese diplomatic sources said Kantor and Kuriyama agreed 
that the two countries should act prudently on the "framework" 
trade talks. "Both sides realized that the framework should not 
be allowed to fail once again," a Japanese source said. 
  Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the talks, which broke 
down at a summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and 
Hosokawa on Feb. 11. 
  The Clinton administration made it clear after Hosokawa's 
resignation announcement last Friday that Washington wants to 
settle trade disputes with Japan under the terms of the basic 
framework trade accord reached with Tokyo last summer.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher reportedly let out a war-reeking blast 
threatening the DPRK over the fictitious "nuclear issue". 
  In an interview with NBC April 10, Christopher, setting a 
deadline for the DPRK, told that "the diplomatic pressure on 
North Korea will give way to a more severe approach, with even a 
preemptive military strike not ruled out", unless the DPRK 
positively reacts to their one-sided and unjustifiable demand 
until that time. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, too, in an 
interview 
with NBC April 3 openly blared that "a preemptive military 
strike at North Korea will not be ruled out" and they were ready 
to risk a war. 
  Such war blasts ringing out continuously from among the U.S. 
high-ranking officials clearly show that the very one who seeks 
to provoke a war on the Korean peninsula is none other than the 
United States.

<F P=106> ["Calculated Dangerous Military Moves" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ASAHI 
SHIMBUN reported that some latest attack helicopters Apache of 
the United States were deployed in a South Korean base on April 
10 for a "reinforcement of the combat power" of the U.S. Forces 
stationed in South Korea. 
  And the first batch of Patriot missile batteries which has 
left Texas will arrive in South Korea, timing to coincide with 
the Seoul trip of U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry in a few 
days, said the newspaper. 
  These are premeditated dangerous military moves to further 
destabilize the military situation on the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, to unleash another war. 
  As is known, the South Korean puppet clique have massively 
shipped in sophisticated weapons from the United States and 
"decided" to extend for an indefinite period the order to 
strengthen "the military posture of readiness" issued to the 
entire units of the puppet Army, which would cover the period 
from November last year to March this year. All the units of 
the three services of the puppet Army now are intensifying their 
"watch" to attack the North. 
  Such provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the 
South 
Korean trigger-happy elements for Northward invasion are based 
on their scrupulously worked out operational plans. 
  Already in September last year the Kim Yong-sam group 
completed a "New Operation Plan No. 5027" for northward invasion 
with the U.S. military officials and have staged war exercises 
against the North with the U.S. imperialists almost every day. 
  Facts vividly show that the ever more undisguised new war 
provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppet clique these days are an extension of their premeditated 
and intentional war moves stepped up from long ago. 
  Yet, the South Korean puppet clique are making quite a noise 
as if others were to blame for the tense situation on the Korean 
peninsula, raising a hue and cry over the fictitious 
"provocations" by the North. This is nothing but a despicable 
humbug for justifying their new war provocation moves. 
  The South Korean puppets are seeking to overpower the DPRK 
by 
"strength" in league with the U.S. imperialists and, 
furthermore, to gratify their wild ambition for "unification 
through Northward invasion" by force of arms, but it is a 
foolish daydream. 
  It is the unshakable will and policy of the DPRK to answer 
strength with strength, and dialogue with dialogue. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian" warmaniacs must 
ponder over things and stop acting rashly, looking squarely at 
the resolute will and determination of the Korean people who are 
fully prepared to cope with any event.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- "The Government of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses the belief that 
the governments, parliaments, political parties and public 
organizations of all the anti-nuke and non-nuclear states and 
international organizations and peaceloving people all over the 
world will heighten vigilance against the dangerous moves of the 
Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and check and 
frustrate them, thereby actively contributing to peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world," says a white paper 
of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released on Monday regarding 
Japan's nuclear armament that has reached a danger line now. 
  It further says: 
  In defiance of the bitter international denunciation and 
apprehensions, Monju, the first fast breeder reactor of Japan, 
was put into normal operation on April 5. This is a dangerous 
step in Japan's moves for nuclear armament. 
  "Japan's nuclear armament being promoted on the danger line 
today is an open challenge to the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and the human desire to build a nuclear-free world. 
This is a question of which the international community must 
take a serious view." 
  The white paper roundly exposes the fact that Japan, 
opposing 
and distorting the "peace constitution," has manoeuvred overtly 
and covertly ever since the 1950s to adopt nuclear armament as 
its policy and legalize it under the veil of "three non-nuclear 
principles". 
  Citing data, it reveals that Japan has, in fact, completely 
laid material and technological foundations for the production 
of nuclear weapons. 
  Pointing out that though Japan is practically promoting 
nuclear armament on the danger line, the United States and other 
Western countries are turning blind eyes to this, while engaging 
themselves in a hysteric pressure campaign over the fictitious 
"suspicion of nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the white 
paper says: "This double standard policy virtually encourages 
Japan's nuclear armament."

<F P=106> ["Japan's Nuclear Armament has Reached Danger Line -- White </F>
Paper of DPRK Foreign Ministry" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea published a white 
paper on Monday [11 April] exposing Japan's nuclear armament 
which has reached the danger line. 
  "The `Monju', the first fast breeder reactor of Japan, was 
put into normal operation on April 5 in defiance of the bitter 
denunciation and concern worldwide. This means a dangerous step 
in Japan's nuclear armament", the white paper says. 
  "Japan's nuclear armament which is being promoted on the 
danger line," it notes, "is an open challenge to the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the desire of 
mankind to build a nuclear- free world. This is a question of 
which the international community must take a serious view." 
  Follows a summary of the white paper: 
  1. Japan has sought its nuclear armament from long ago. 
  Its ambition for nuclear armament has been fully revealed in 
remarks of successive Japanese authorities and official 
documents. 
  Article 9 of the "Constitution of the State of Japan" (Peace 
Constitution) which was adopted in November 1946 under the 
strong internal and external demand and pressure says: "The 
Japanese people, sincerely aspiring after international peace 
based on justice and order, shall abandon for good and all war, 
armed threat and armed action through the invocation of state 
power as a means of resolving international disputes. To this 
end, they shall not possess the Army, the Navy, the Airforce and 
other war potential and not recognize the right of belligerency 
of the state." 
  The successive Japanese authorities, however, urged by the 
desire to turn the country into a military power, a nuclear 
power, have tried by hook or by crook to justify their nuclear 
armament scheme from the 1950s, totally denying or arbitrarily 
interpreting the Constitution itself. 
  On May 7, 1957, the prime minister of Japan, Nobusuke Kishi, 
said at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors: "If 
anyone simply mention the nuclear weapon, all people say it 
contravenes the Constitution. But such interpretation of the 
Constitution is wrong. ... [ellipses as received] Without 
looking into the future development, we cannot say uniformly 
that it is wrong to mention any kind of nuclear weapon". 
(Japanese book "Japan's Nuclear Arming Which Has Reached This 
Stage", 1975) 
  The Japanese authorities' wild design for nuclear armament 
was dealt a hard blow by the movement for the ban on atomic and 
hydrogen bombs which had gained strength within and without 
Japan from the 1950s. This compelled the Japanese Prime 
Minister Eisaku Sato, quite upset, to announce at the Diet in 
1968 the "three non-nuclear principles" -- not to manufacture, 
possess and introduce any nuclear weapon. 
  For this announcement, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  On June 2, 1969, however, he said at a plenary session of 
the 
House of Representatives that "the `three non-nuclear 
principles' can be altered any time when the policy is changed 
or the cabinet is replaced by another" (the above-mentioned 
book), making it plain that these principles advocated by him 
were a rhetoric to deceive public opinion at home and abroad. 
  On March 2, 1978, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Sunao 
Sonoda, stated at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of 
Representatives that "it is not that Japan cannot possess 
nuclear weapons, restricted by the provision of the Constitution 
itself" (the JIJI press, March 2, 1978). And, at the Budget 
Committee of the House of Councillors on March 15, 1984, the 
Japanese Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, answering an 
interpellation by a Komei Dietman, said that "Japan may possess 
atomic power, if it is for defence." (Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN, 
March 16, 1984). 
  Entering the 1990s, the Japanese authorities, vociferating 
about the changed international situation, have openly revealed 
their scheme to step up their nuclear armament at the final 
stage. 
  Notably, Japan intends to work out within this year "General 
Principles of the Defence Programme Reflecting the End of the 
Cold War and Domestic Situation," holding forth upon the need to 
build up "defence capabilities to promptly and accurately cope 
with the possible dangerous events" in neighbouring countries 
such as "nuclear suspicion" and "missile development" by the 
DPRK. 
  Japan openly manifested its design to arm itself with 
nuclear 
weapons even on UN rostrums. 
  Till the first half of the 1960s, the Japanese Government, 
though reluctantly, voted for resolutions on the prohibition of 
the use of nuclear weapons and ban on nuclear weapons at the UN 
General Assembly. From the latter half of the decade, however, 
it voted against or abstained from voting on such resolutions, 
thus disclosing its intention to become a military power, a 
nuclear power, at any cost by making haste with nuclear 
development in full scale and producing and stockpiling nuclear 
weapons. Explaining the reason why they voted against or 
abstained from voting on the resolutions, they said "total ban 
on the use of nuclear weapons is incompatible with nuclear 
deterrent" and it "might destroy the nuclear equilibrium". But, 
in actuality, this was an open and undisguised revelation on the 
UN rostrums of Japan's ulterior intention to produce and possess 
nuclear weapons and pave the way for overseas aggression so that 
they could use them in case of emergency. 
  Thus Japan has overtly and covertly manoeuvred ever since 
the 
1950s to adopt its nuclear armament as a policy and legalize it 
under the veil of "three non-nuclear principles," opposing and 
distorting the "Peace Constitution." 
  2. Japan's nuclear armament has reached the danger line. 
  The nuclear policy of Japan is being promoted in two 
directions, that is, solving the problem of power by nuclear 
energy and, at the same time, securing a large quantity of 
plutonium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons by itself to 
proceed with nuclear armament any moment. 
  In July 1966, the first nuclear power station went into 
operation in Japan. Since then the Japanese Government has 
considered the construction of nuclear power stations as an 
important state policy for solving the problem of energy. 
  According to the director of the high centre of Social 
Sciences of France, in 1976, the United States made such special 
concessions to Japan as approving its civilian nuclear 
development and promising it a continued supply of 
highly-enriched uranium under a far looser inspection system 
than other allies in reward for its ratification of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. As a result, Japan has been able to 
freely reprocess nuclear materials and develop advanced 
technologies for its rearmament. (Radio France Culture, 
November 5, 1993). 
  Japan has already installed sufficient nuclear facilities 
for 
its nuclear arming. 
  At the beginning, the United States, with a view to 
controlling the nuclear development by Japan, sold to it only 
light water reactors feeding on U.S.-made enriched uranium and 
prohibited it from developing atomic reactors of other types. 
Under this condition, Japan developed a new-type converter 
mainly feeding on Canadian natural uranium with an investment of 
404 million dollars. Situated in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, this 
reactor has been in a full-scale operation since 1979. 
(Japanese book "Imidas" 1992). In this way, Japan has gained 
relative independence in nuclear development, freeing itself 
from the control of the United States. 
  According to the "White Paper on Nuclear Energy" published 
by 
the Japanese Government in 1993, Japan has 16 nuclear power 
stations with 46 reactors in operation, which are capable of 
producing 37.36 million kw. This means that Japan ranks third 
in the world after the United States and France in the total 
designed capacity of nuclear facilities. 
  1993 alone witnessed the commissioning of 12 new reactors, 
and 9 units of facilities with a total capacity of 8.9 million 
kw are under construction. In all this, Japan annually uses 
some 3,000 tons of nuclear materials. 
  Japan may become a dangerous nuclear power with its capacity 
of nuclear weapon production largely expanded when 10 nuclear 
power stations, one fast breeder reactor, one uranium enriching 
plant, one radioactive waste storage (low standard) which are 
now under construction and four nuclear power stations including 
one new-type converter, one reprocessing plant and one 
radioactive waste storage (high standard) now projected are put 
into operation (Japanese book "Imidas", 1992). 
  Japan has secured enough nuclear materials to arm itself 
with 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japan set itself a long-range goal of depending upon fast 
breeder reactors feeding on plutonium in the 1950s when it 
started the development of atomic energy and it has produced and 
stockpiled a large quantity of nuclear materials by operating 
reprocessing plants from the middle of the 1970s. 
  Japan has stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium which far 
surpasses 
the quantity needed for the peaceful purpose. It is enough to 
manufacture more than 3,000 atomic bombs of Nagasaki type. 
(Japanese magazine "BUNGEI SHUNJU," June 1992). 
  Japan buckled down to the implementation of its "great 
programme for the use of plutonium" at the beginning of 1992. 
  In the period from 1975 to 1992, it brought in one ton of 
plutonium from Britain in top secrecy and reportedly shipped in 
1.5 tons of plutonium from France in 1993. 
  What offers particular problem is that Japan plans to secure 
about 100 tons of plutonium by the year 2010, though the amount 
of plutonium actually needed by Japan is estimated at 85 tons. 
(KYODO News Service, October 5, 1992). This means that, by 
2010, Japan will store 15 more tons of plutonium than needed for 
the peaceful purpose, which is enough to manufacture some 2,000 
nuclear bombs. Therefore, Japan's claim that it has stockpiled 
"an appropriate amount of plutonium for economic development" 
can never be justified. 
  A latest report on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
materials 
including plutonium, which an influential advisory agency worked 
out, entrusted by the U.S. Defence Department, expressed deep 
concern over Japan's nuclear armament and said Japan should be 
urged to fundamentally reexamine its nuclear policy, demanding a 
stop to the project of the demonstration reactor for a fast 
breeder reactor. 
  Urging Japan to reduce the scale of the construction of 
nuclear power stations with 12 reactors feeding on plutonium 
planned to be completed by the year 2005 (to two) and stop the 
construction of a new-type demonstration reactor following the 
"Monju" and the construction of the reprocessing plant no. 2 in 
Rokashomura, Aomori Prefecture, the report said potential fear 
of Japan's nuclear arming is sprouting within the U.S. 
Government. (Japanese MAINICHI SHIMBUN, November 10, 1993). 
  Voice of America on April 6,1994 said that the commissioning 
of a fast breeder reactor in Japan is arousing serious 
apprehensions and uneasiness in the European countries and the 
United States, to say nothing of its neighbouring nations, and 
it is foreseen that it would give a greater shock to the acute 
nuclear issue. This indicates that Japan might become one of 
the largest nuclear state in the near future, the radio added. 
  Japan is possessed of modern means of nuclear delivery. 
  The socalled "Self-Reliant Defence Programme" worked out by 
the Japanese Defence Agency in 1969 makes it plain that Japan 
would continue to develop and possess domestic nuclear weapons 
and ballistic missiles for their delivery. (Japanese ASAHI 
EVENING NEWS, June 27, 1969). 
  Japan's system of launching nuclear warheads was established 
already during the "Third Program of Readjustment of the Defence 
Capacities" (1967-1971). The Japanese Defence Agency completed 
the "domestic production" of cruise missiles in 1985 in 
cooperation with the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and other 
companies. This cruise missile is a sophisticated guided missile 
which is available for the delivery of nuclear warheads and 
conventional warheads. 
  The Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" successfully carried out 
a 
test launching of a Japanese ground-to-warship missile (SSM-1) 
at the Pacific Missile Centre of the U.S. Navy in California in 
the summer of 1987. (the Japanese magazine "SEKAI SEIJI." 
First semimonthly number of January 1990). 
  As of December 1991, Japan was possessed of 393 155-mm 
howitzers and 132 203.2-mm howitzers which can fire nuclear 
warheads. The number of its nuclear-capable planes is on the 
steady increase. 
  It had secured 145 new-type fighter-bombers "F-15" with an 
action radius of 1,052 km by 1991. It plans to increase its 
number to 180-200 by the end of 1994. 
  It developed a new fighter-bomber "FSX" by remodeling the 
"F-16" in 1993 and plans to introduce 130 of it by the year 2000. 
  On February 4, 1994, Japan successfully launched a new 
"H2"-type rocket no. 1 developed entirely by its independent 
technology at the cosmodrome in Tanegashima, Kagoshima 
Prefecture. This rocket is tantamount to 50 metres in length and 
260 tons in weight and can be converted easily for a military 
purpose. 
  The former director of the Atomic Energy Research Centre of 
Rikkyo University, Japan, stated that Japan has been able to 
make substantial material and technological preparations for 
manufacturing high-performance nuclear weapons in one month or 
so. More than 150 companies and over 3,300 factories are 
involved in the manufacture of nuclear warheads in Japan. In 
recent years, investments in this domain have sharply increased 
to jump from 1.73 million dollars in 1954 to 360 million dollars 
in 1991. (The Indian paper WORUM, March 11, 1994). 
  In actuality, Japan has built perfect material and 
technological foundations for the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons. Concern over Japan's nuclear armament is expressed by 
government authorities of Western countries including the United 
States. 
  If Japan is armed with nuclear weapons, it will pose the 
most 
serious and grave threat to the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, it will harass peace and security of Asia and the 
rest of the world. 
  With Japan's nuclear armament reaching the danger line, the 
danger of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula being 
made meaningless is increasing. 
  Though Japan is promoting its nuclear armament on the danger 
line, the United States and other Western countries are turning 
blind eyes to this and carrying on a hysteric pressure campaign 
over the fictitious "suspected nuclear development" by the DPRK. 
This policy of double standard, in fact, eggs Japan on to 
nuclear armament. 
  The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
expresses the belief that the governments, parliaments, 
political parties and organisations of all the anti-nuke and 
non-nuclear states and international organisations and 
peaceloving people of the world will heighten vigilance against 
the dangerous moves of the Japanese authorities for nuclear 
armament and make positive contributions to the peace and 
security of Asia and the world by checking and frustrating them.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki met Wu Xueqian, 
visiting vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, Tuesday to discuss the North Korean 
nuclear matter. 
  Rep. Yi expressed concern that if the problem is not 
resolved, there will be louder calls for the South to go nuclear 
as well, prompting Japan to do the same and leading to unbridled 
nuclear competition. 
  "This is what both Korea and China do not want," he said, 
tactfully urging Beijing to be more aggressive in persuading 
Pyongyang to halt its suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Wu, former deputy premier and foreign minister, explained 
that China wishes to see peace and security maintained on the 
Korean peninsula. "Although China's role is limited, we will 
continue our efforts to persuade North Korea," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, visiting 
vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, said Tuesday he believed that North Korea could not 
develop nuclear weapons even if it wanted to because of Chinese 
people's opposition. 
  The senior Chinese official said there would be no nuclear 
war nor armaments on the Korean peninsula at a lunch meeting 
with National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop. 
  "China is strongly opposed to it (North Korea's nuclear 
weapons development)," he was quoted as saying. He stressed a 
peaceful solution to the problem while acknowledging the 
difficulties ahead. 
  Speaker Yi, saying China's growing economy would be affected 
if war erupted on the Korean peninsula, reiterated Seoul's call 
for Beijing to play a greater role in persuading Pyongyang to 
give up its nuclear program. 
  Wu was invited to a dinner banquet later by ruling 
Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil to meet 
more DLP members.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 10 KYODO -- Cambodian Government 
forces were able to seize the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin 
in late March because of an arms supply by North Korea, the 
SANKEI SHIMBUN said Sunday [10 April]. 
  Pyongyang provided Cambodian Government forces with six 
armored personnel carriers and tons of weapons, including shells 
for howitzers, ammunition, mortars and small weapons as a grant. 
The vehicles and weaponry were flown to Cambodia from 
mid-February, the daily said, quoting a military source close to 
the forces. 
  With North Korea's military assistance, the government 
forces 
started in mid-March to intensify attacks on the guerrilla 
group's biggest stronghold in western Cambodia near the Thai 
border and brought it under their control on March 21, the 
SANKEI said. 
  Pyongyang also pledged to offer additional tons of 
ammunition 
by early April, it said. 
  The source was quoted as saying that the government forces 
could not have subdued Pailin without the supply of ammunition 
and the forces will not be able to maintain their control 
without additional military help. 
  Cambodia maintains friendly relations with North Korea, 
largely owing to North Korean leader Kim Il-song's long-standing 
support for King Norodom Sihanouk.

<F P=106> [Report by the Regional Desk: "Battle lines drawn in </F>
Marrakech"] 
  [Text] Asean states are gearing up for an 11th hour 
showdown with the United States and Europe over Western efforts 
to introduce a "social clause" into the Gatt trading pact which 
will be signed in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakech next 
Friday. 
  Alarm over the clause, which would link trade and labour 
standards, reflects deep suspicions by nearly all developing 
countries that the West is seeking to levy additional duties on 
the exports of countries which enjoy cheap labour advantages 
when the new World Trading Organization (WTO) takes over from 
Gatt to police global commerce. 
  Many Asean officials fear that such a link would turn out to 
be a disguised form of protection against imports from economies 
with lower labour costs. Asia-Pacific nations, whose economic 
growth has been powered by their low-cost exports, are 
particularly concerned and have vowed to fight the link. 
  At last week's 50th annual session of the Economic and 
Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), executive secretary 
general Rafiuddin Ahmad led a chorus of denunciations about 
attempts by "countries which might impose neo-protectionism." 
  In a national speech on March 21, Indonesia's President 
Suharto criticized unspecified world powers which sought to 
impose their own views of human and labour rights as a condition 
for economic cooperation. 
  He said that industrial nations were pushing developing 
countries on such issues as raising the minimum wage because of 
their troubled economies and declining competitiveness. 
  "No country has the right to dictate their own concepts or 
views to another country... Let alone to force their will as a 
condition for international economic cooperation," he said. 
  Speaking at last week's Pacific Economic Cooperation Council 
(PECC) conference, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak acknowledged that the US efforts to include a 
social clause in a global trade treaty were not new and go back 
to 1987. But he cautioned that "The proposal could lead to 
market impediments for goods from less-developed countries." 
  At the same forum Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed 
charged that the West was trying to weaken developing nations by 
imposing minimum wages. 
  Manila also declared it would resist attempts by the United 
States to insert a social clause in any trade agreement, 
particularly on issues affecting workers' rights. 
  Antonio Buencamino, director of the Philippine Bureau of 
International Trade Relations, said "the Philippines opposes any 
attempt to include social clauses or workers rights in trade 
talks." 
  "Our labour is cheap, but that does not mean it is 
exploited," Buencamino said, noting that workers in the export 
industry often earned much more than the mandated minimum wage. 
  Despite the uproar in Asia, chief US trade negotiator John 
Schmidt, declared before leaving for Morocco that Washington 
would not accept the Marrakech declaration or documents related 
to the WTO preparatory committee "without some language" on 
labour rights. 
  In a bid to quell the row before it erupts into a damaging 
North-South split, Gatt chief Peter Sutherland called a meeting 
of trade envoys yesterday to seek a compromise. 
  Observers said much would depend on how hard the United 
States presses the issue. 
  The United States wants a ministerial declaration in 
Marrakech to accept that the WTO would deal with the link 
between trade and labour. Developing countries have refused to 
consider any reference to the issue in the declaration. 
  Washington, is expected to get its strongest backing from 
France which has been pressing the European Union to enact 
regulations against "social dumping" -- selling goods produced 
with cheap labour under poor working conditions. 
  US and French officials argue that the WTO, which will be a 
more powerful watchdog than Gatt, should enforce a connection 
between trade and labour conditions. 
  France wants the body to apply standards that will prevent 
countries from exploiting children, prisoners and bonded workers 
as a way of gaining trade advantages. 
  Gatt officials are further worried that the introduction of 
the controversial social dimension would divert attention from 
work that needs to be done to ensure that measures to liberalize 
world trade contained in the Uruguay accords are sealed and 
actually applied. 
  Washington, however, argues that it accepts the existence of 
a "natural comparative advantage", including wage rate 
differentials, linked to a country's degree of development. 
  The United States submitted at the beginning of the Uruguay 
Round in 1987 a paper listing a set of five internationally 
recognized standards it saw as trade-related. 
  The five points were freedom of association for workers, 
freedom to organize and bargain collectively, freedom from 
forced or compulsory labour, a minimum age for employment of 
children, and "minimum standard" for working conditions, 
including occupational health and safety hazards. 
  Many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and 
Development (OECD), including Switzerland and the Nordic 
countries, concede that these problems will, sooner or later, 
have to be faced. 
  But most feel it would be more timely to raise such issues 
when the WTO preparatory committee gets down to work. Any 
member would then be free to take up any topic. 
  Officials said the European Union was proposing a wording 
stressing that the committee was free to tackle "new issues", 
without any specific reference to labour rights. 
  More than 120 countries are to gather in Marrakech for the 
signing of the new pact, which will encompass for the first time 
services, intellectual property, agriculture and textiles. 
  The scale of the agreement, which once fully operative, will 
bring an estimated additional worldwide growth of between $230 
billion and $270 billion over a decade, helped build a momentum 
that brought together Gatt members after seven years of marathon 
negotiations. 
  This same pressure makes most observers confident an 
agreement will be signed. Gatt officials, quoted in Marrakech, 
said that while they were worried that the row triggered by the 
United States might "spoil the atmosphere" of the meeting, they 
were confident it would not sink the Uruguay Round.

  [Text] Officials who met to discuss an economic growth plan 
for the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth 
Area (BIMP-EAGA), have agreed to establish an air service system 
that will promote, develop, and enhance trade and investments in 
the area. 
  As a step closer toward the realization of a common air 
service system within the area, the officials have agreed that 
Brunei will become the focal point of air linkages in the region. 
  "Because of Brunei's strategic location (it is practically 
smack at the middle of the growth area), it will be positioning 
as the focal gateway to the EAGA (East ASEAN Growth Area, now 
known as BIMP-EAGA)," Department of Tourism (DoT) Undersecretary 
Ramona Lopez-Ty said. 
  Ms. Ty, who was with the Philippine delegation when the 
ministers of the BIMP-EAGA met in Davao last Saturday, said: 
"Royal Brunei has offered to take the initiative to add to the 
frequencies. With their wealth and economic resources, it will 
not be too difficult for them to expand their (air service) 
capacities." 
  She reported that Brunei's national carrier, Royal Brunei, 
had already bought two 50-seater Fokker planes primarily for the 
purpose of servicing the area. 
  Apart from the existing bilateral air agreements between the 
BIMP-EAGA member countries, officials are still working for more 
air linkages, Ms. Ty said. 
<H5>  Increased Access </H5>
  She, however, qualified: "We're not talking of open skies 
here. There are certain rights that our national carriers have 
that you just don't give away. We're talking of increased 
accessibility." 
  Ms. Ty reports that the idea of establishing a regional 
airline jointly owned by the four countries has been shelved. 
Instead, they are more inclined toward establishing "common 
operations and increasing air links and capacity."

  [Text] Malaysia remains cool to the idea of creating a 
multinational naval force involving ASEAN countries and the 
United States to maintain security in the region. 
  Nor is it keen to expand military cooperation beyond the 
Five 
Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), which obliges the United 
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia to 
"consult" each other in the event of an external threat. 
  This was apparent from the remarks of Malaysia's Chief of 
Navy, Vice-Admiral Datuk Mohamed Shariff Ishak, when he spoke at 
a maritime security forum in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. 
  "We welcome multilateral cooperation," he said in response 
to 
a question at the forum organised by the Malaysian Institute of 
Maritime Authority. "The only snag preventing the Royal 
Malaysian Navy from expanding cooperation with neighbouring 
countries is the lack of assets. 
  "We've confined cooperation to ASEAN and the FPDA. Others 
would like to play games with us, but we lack the assets to do 
this." 
  To defence planners who are proposing closer military 
cooperation between ASEAN and its allies and the creation of a 
multinational naval force to police the region, Datuk Shariff 
was being polite. 
  While Malaysia may not have the military hardware to engage 
in large-scale naval exercises, this is hardly the main reason 
for its lack of enthusiasm to expand existing regional security 
alliances. 
  Datuk Shariff's response could be a reflection of the 
residual mistrust and rivalries in the region, despite the 
willingness among ASEAN states to discuss mutual security 
concerns in recent years. 
  Many of the problems which inhibit wider military 
cooperation 
are rooted in ideological outlook or history, if they do not 
stem from disputes over territory. 
  Indonesia, for example, is unhappy that Malaysia is 
fortifying its rival claim on Sipadan island, off the Sabah 
coast, by developing it as a tourist resort despite Jakarta's 
strenuous objections. 
  Both the Philippines and Malaysia have claims in the 
potentially mineral-rich Spratlys, and there is the dormant 
Philippine claim over Sabah. 
  Recently, some Malaysian defence officials criticised 
Thailand's naval build-up particularly its acquisition of a 
helicopter carrier, as a move to bolster its offensive 
capabilities. 
  While these bilateral problems per se will not lead to armed 
confrontation between ASEAN states, they inhibit military 
cooperation on a wider scale. Thus defence planners who 
envisage ASEAN as the nucleus of a regional naval force allied 
to the US to keep peace and security in South-east Asia are 
ahead of the times. 
  So, too, is the idea of expanding the FPDA to include 
Indonesia and the US to keep the vital Malacca Straits open. In 
a paper on small navies in the Asia-Pacific, American defence 
analyst Joseph Morgan suggested that Malaysia, Singapore and 
Indonesia could use their small navies to patrol the straits in 
conjunction with the US Seventh Fleet. 
  On paper, such an arrangement certainly looks reasonable in 
terms of bolstering the region's security. It also fits well 
with the US, which may be forced to draw down drastically its 
forces in the Pacific if its budget deficit worsens. 
  However, the American concept of cooperative engagement with 
its ASEAN allies can only remain on the drawing board, for now 
at least, given Malaysia's stand. 
  And in the absence of an immediate threat to rally the ASEAN 
countries, there is no urgency to create such a multinational 
naval force. 
  For Malaysia, pursuing the ideal of a Zone of Peace, Freedom 
and Neutrality (Zopfan) means essentially keeping the big powers 
out of the region. 
  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed has said there is no need 
for 
the US Seventh Fleet to patrol the region. 
  "We don't believe in security set-ups ... The era of 
colonisation is over," he told reporters last month. 
  "The presence of American military might in the US is 
sufficient to persuade people not to be aggressive, just like we 
want the military of China to remain in China and the Japanese 
military to remain in Japan." 
  Given this attitude and the different perceptions on 
security 
threats, it is sensible for the ASEAN Regional Forum to avoid 
discussion on contentious issues in its first substantive 
meeting in Bangkok in July. 
  It is critical that the fledging 18-member forum, created by 
ASEAN last year to discuss regional security issues with its key 
dialogue partners, starts off on a right footing to build up 
mutual confidence. 
  It could begin with more consultations among forum members 
to 
ensure transparency and coordinated moves to deal with piracy in 
Southeast Asian waters. 
  By making haste slowly, the Bangkok conference could be the 
first step on the long road to a new regional security alliance.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Haruo Shimada, professor of economics, Keio </F>
University: "A Difficult Choice for Japan"; from "My Viewpoint" 
column] 
  [Text] The United States has demanded the unification of 
labor standards, bringing up the topic as a new issue in 
post-Uruguay Round trade talks. We may say this is natural for 
Western nations. This implies that these nations seek to limit 
exports by developing countries and secure employment at home. 
Wages are low in developing countries. On top of this, these 
countries are proceeding to destroy price standards on a global 
economic scale by keeping the exchange rate of their currencies 
lower than their actual values. In this way, these countries 
are definitely taking away jobs from workers in the major 
industrialized nations. 
  It can be well expected that sooner or later, Japan, too, 
will tread the same path as the Western nations because, among 
other reasons, it has proceeded with technological transplants, 
and its domestic industries have been hollowing out. 
Consequently, Japan should go along with the United States, but 
that would antagonize Asian countries. Therefore, Japan cannot 
choose this option. In that case, the only alternative is for 
Japan to thoroughly open its markets to foreign access and, as a 
result, help create more jobs. Unless Japan promotes industrial 
restructuring and clenches its teeth to strive toward high net 
productivity, it will not be able to open its markets to 
developing countries' products, nor will the Japanese economy 
continue to thrive in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Akira Naide, Industrial News Department, third </F>
in the series: "Field Report on Market Opening"; this one 
entitled: "Semiconductors: U.S. Offensive Hits the Vulnerable 
Part"] 
  [Text] "Expansion of market access is making steady 
progress in ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)." 
Norman Chanoskiy [name as published], president of the Japan 
subsidiary of a U.S. semiconductor maker, LSI Logic (located in 
Minato Ward, Tokyo), is very confident about this. The ASIC 
business inherently requires a certain extent of "design in," or 
participation in product development from the design stage. LSI 
Logic expects to increase income by more than 20 percent in 1994 
alone. The business expansion of this company, mainly in ASIC, 
is a barometer of the openness of the Japanese semiconductor 
market. 
<H5>  Sega Procured 26 Percent Foreign Semiconductors </H5>
  According to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, 
the number of "design-in" projects by foreign semiconductor 
makers and Japanese users increased from around 500 in 1986 to 
more than 3,300 in 1993. "As far as U.S. companies are 
concerned, there are no ill feelings with regard to market 
access." Behind the confidence expressed in such a statement by 
the Association of Foreign Semiconductor Users (chairman, 
Hidehiko Yoshida) is its positive record in expanding market 
access. 
  Yet, the United States came up with a new controversial 
issue 
at the regular Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks in March. It 
designated automobiles, telecommunications, and electronic games 
as the three priority areas for expanding purchase of foreign 
semiconductors. 
  The section on semiconductors in the U.S. Trade 
Representative's (USTR) "Foreign Trade Barriers Report" 
[National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers] again 
raised this issue. 
  These three sectors, accused of "inadequate efforts in 
purchasing foreign semiconductors," are quite at a loss as to 
"why they are singled out." 
  At the end of 1993, Sega Enterprises, a major manufacturer 
of 
electronic games, had actually procured 26 percent foreign 
semiconductors. This represents a significant increase of more 
than 16 percentage points compared with 1992. The lion's share 
of Sega's semiconductor procurement consists of mask ROM's 
(read-only memory). In 1993, foreign share in its mask ROM 
purchase was 25 percent, but this is expected to increase to 50 
percent in 1994. 
  Furthermore, Sega buys almost all of the CPU's (central 
processing units) used in its 16-bit electronic game systems, 
its top product line, from Motorola. Sega and Motorola formally 
started doing business in 1991. Eikichi Utsugi, deputy chief of 
the First Purchasing Department of the Materials Division, 
recalls that, "In the beginning, we set a very tough price 
level. Motorola made admirable efforts to meet our demands." 
  Sega was given a "Good User" award by Motorola in 1992. A 
Sega home electronic game system, "Genesis" is displayed at 
Motorola's plant in Austin, Texas. This is a symbol of the 
"honeymoon" between the two companies. 
  On the other hand, Sega also makes strict demands on 
European 
and U.S. semiconductor makers. The 1 megabit (1 mega = 1 
million) DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) used in Sega's 
16-bit game systems has 16 input/output ports. At present, only 
Toshiba is able to supply this product. Utsugi points out, "If 
they want us to buy more, they should be able to make products 
we need." 
<H5>  The Whole Picture Remains Unclear </H5>
  An even wider gap exists between the views of Japan and the 
United States regarding semiconductor procurement for 
automobiles and telecommunications. The U.S. Semiconductor 
Industry Association (SIA) expresses quite straightforwardly its 
discontent with the fact that "the major Japanese carmakers' 
procurement rate of foreign semiconductors is less than 10 
percent." However, Mitsubishi Motors managing director Shigeru 
Nakagawa refutes this claim, saying, "We believe the foreign 
share exceeded 20 percent three years ago." There is a glaring 
gap between the two figures. 
  Texas Instruments Japan expects Toyota Motors and Honda 
Motors to use quite a number of its digital data processing IC's 
[integrated circuit] in their new models to be introduced around 
1995. Motorola Japan has a team of marketing personnel devoted 
exclusively to the Toyota Group in Nagoya. It has been actively 
engaged in IC "design-in" for a few years. Both sides are 
moving steadily in their efforts. 
  However, automobile makers mostly procure their 
semiconductors through parts makers. Since the whole picture of 
the Toyota Group remains unclear, it is difficult to refute U.S. 
charges effectively. 
  Lack of Concrete Counterarguments 
  In telecommunications, while SIA officials complain that 
"foreign semiconductor makers' participation in IC design-in for 
large equipment is still inadequate," the international 
procurement office of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation] claims that "NTT is not a party to the 
semiconductor agreement." NTT says that it announces 
specifications for equipment it intends to purchase, and the 
suppliers are determined by bidding. It has no say in the 
semiconductors used in this equipment, since they are left to 
the discretion of the suppliers. 
  What makes the position of the automobile makers and NTT 
difficult is the fact that unlike Sega, they do not have actual 
data to refute U.S. charges. Of course, they can insist that 
"the issue of semiconductor procurement concerns the parts and 
equipment suppliers." However, if they want to convince the 
United States of the openness of the market, they may have to 
involve the suppliers in a major effort to compute the 
procurement rate of foreign semiconductors and to evaluate the 
progress in design-in. These two industries are now faced with 
the tough decision of whether to fight the battle in an arena 
prepared by the United States. 
  At present, after the 20-percent share of foreign 
semiconductors has been achieved, the United States is now 
focusing on opening up specific sectors. Automobiles and NTT 
are both considered sectors where the Japanese Government's 
demand will easily be met, and where it is easy to apply 
pressure to expand imports. U.S. companies, which learned how 
to pry open a closed market during the 1980's, are indeed 
hitting Japan's most vulnerable parts quite deftly. 
  Business leaders in the semiconductor industry are truly 
distressed about the fact that "after we have been able to 
achieve certain results in the market as a whole, they now come 
up with new disputes."

<F P=106> [Article by the Industrial News Department's Hidoshi Takeda; </F>
fourth in the series "Field Report on Market Opening"; this 
installment entitled "Government Procurement (Medical Equipment 
and Telecommunications Gear) -- U.S. Distrusts Japan's Business 
Practices"] 
  [Text] A senior employee with a medium-sized medical 
equipment manufacturer in Tokyo has disclosed, "There is a 
tacitly condoned rule under which medical equipment is supplied 
by wholesalers who are doing business near university 
hospitals." The Japanese medical equipment market is dominated 
by a unique business practice, and even Japanese medical 
equipment makers are hard-pressed to gain access to the market. 
The only way for foreign medical equipment manufacturers to 
climb over the invisible barriers is to forge business tie-ups 
with Japanese businessmen who are well versed in the sales 
know-how of medical instruments. 
<H5>  Human Relationship Holds the Key </H5>
  A staffer in charge of sales at a foreign-affiliated visual 
diagnostic equipment company has expressed his discontent, 
saying, "We cannot compete against Japanese medical equipment 
companies that have a close relationship with doctors even if 
our medical instruments' performance is a little better than 
theirs." On many occasions, he has been unable to meet doctors 
to brief them on newly developed medical instruments because he 
lacks a personal relationship with them. 
  Medical equipment has only recently surfaced as a trade 
friction between Japan and the United States. The United States 
raised medical equipment as a bilateral trade issue for the 
first time at the Tokyo summit last July, and the issue was 
later taken up for discussion at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. 
  Unlike automobiles, Japan registers no huge surplus in the 
medical instruments trade with the United States. According to 
a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan exported 
100 billion yen worth of medical appliances to the United States 
in 1992 while it imported 234.1 billion yen worth of medical 
equipment from that country. In this way, in the field of 
medical equipment, Japan bought 134.1 billion yen more than it 
sold to the United States in that year. 
  Unlike plate glass products, the share of foreign medical 
equipment in the Japanese market is high. A U.S. Government 
estimate shows that U.S. medical equipment manufacturers hold a 
20-percent share of the Japanese market, but the U.S. Government 
has maintained that this market share is still low compared to 
their 40-percent share on European markets. In response, the 
Second North American Division of the Foreign Ministry comments, 
"The figure presented by the U.S. Government does not include 
the share held by U.S.-invested medical equipment companies 
operating in Japan and the fact that there is instead only a 
small difference between the U.S. shares in the Japanese and 
European markets." 
  Hiroichi Kimura, president of the Association of Medical 
Equipment Manufacturers, has said, "I wonder if the United 
States fully understands the actual state of the Japan-U.S. 
medical equipment trade." 
  It is quite natural that both Japan and the United States 
have been unable to find areas of agreement at the end of their 
discussions. What the United States has made an issue of 
concerning medical equipment is not a trade imbalance but rather 
Japan's business practices. The United States has focused its 
attack on the procurement of medical instruments by national 
hospitals as a symbol of the closed medical equipment market in 
Japan. 
  Japan has asserted that the tender system adopted by 
national 
hospitals is open, but an official with a medical instrument 
manufacturer has pointed out, "Wholesalers, who are well aware 
of the collusive practices, have sometimes asked doctors in 
advance to set conditions for tenders that can be met only by 
the medical instruments that they deal in." The collusive ties 
between doctors and suppliers have become a hotbed of 
corruption, thus deepening European and American businessmen's 
distrust in Japan's business practices. 
<H5>  Strong Discontent With Administration </H5>
  There is a great deal of discontent with Japan's 
administration. A staffer with a medical appliance manufacturer 
has said, "There are no official procedures, but administrative 
guidance is rampant. Even Japanese manufacturers face 
difficulties." For foreign firms, each type of administrative 
authority held by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry 
of Education is troublesome. 
  It seems that the United States has cited medical equipment 
as one of the goods to which the Japanese market is closed with 
the aim of establishing its hegemony in a high-technology field 
in which it holds the upper hand. 
  Morimichi Fukuda, professor at Sapporo Medical College, is 
eager to introduce advanced medical technology from the United 
States and European countries. The professor says, "Japanese 
medical equipment companies lag their U.S. counterparts in the 
field of visual-processing technology." Japan lags far behind 
the United States in the visual-processing software used to 
diagnose patients. 
  Hospitals link to computers such state-of-the art digital 
diagnostic equipment as PAC's [visual management system], MRI's 
[magnetic resonance imaging] and CT's (cable transfer). Doctors 
have free access to databases containing information on patients. 
  One university hospital is expected to purchase advanced 
medical equipment worth billions of yen, and U.S. medical 
equipment companies are looking to Japan for sales of their 
products. The medical communications system linking hospitals 
with homes will be put into operation in the future, and U.S. 
firms are certainly laying the groundwork for participating in 
building the system. 
<H5>  Japan Is Under Pressure To Change Market Structure </H5>
  The United States has pressed Japan to open the government's 
procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications gear, 
the procurement of which is expected to grow in the future. 
There is a model for defusing the medical equipment frictions 
between the two countries--telecommunications gear. The issue 
of NTT's procurement of telecommunications equipment has been 
raised incessantly even after it was privatized. The United 
States is now stepping up pressure on Japan to set numerical 
targets for NTT's procurement of U.S.-built telecommunications 
equipment. 
  NTT's international procurement office has reacted to the 
pressure by saying, "We are sharply increasing our budget for 
the procurement of foreign telecommunications equipment in 
accordance with an agreement concluded between Japan and the 
United States." NTT has steadily been increasing the amount of 
its procurement from the United States by purchasing digital 
switchboards from Nozan Telecom [name as published] and digital 
transmission equipment from AT&amp;T. 
  While NEC Corporation, Fujitsu, Ltd., and other Japanese 
firms have increased their sales in the U.S. telecommunications 
market, foreign firms in Japan still have difficulty gaining 
access to the Japanese telecommunications market, especially 
NTT, because the market gives priority to Japanese firms at the 
stage of developing products. 
  B. Farrell, managing director of the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce 
and Industry in Japan, has stated, "U.S. manufacturers know that 
if their businesses are to be successful in Japan, it is 
important for them to offer their products on the Japanese 
market at reasonable prices and to provide after-sales service." 
  He also has asked Japanese firms to work to open the 
Japanese 
market, saying, "I hope that such major firms as NTT, NEC, and 
Mitsubishi will buy more foreign goods." It will take time 
before Japan changes its market structure. Nevertheless, the 
United States is likely to continue its offensive targeting 
procurement by the government and major firms of U.S.-made 
telecommunications equipment for the time being.

  [Text] Japan-U.S. relations are at a standstill with the 
rupture of the bilateral economic framework talks at the 
February summit talks. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called 
the bilateral relations a "mature relationship." However, 
according to the results of a public opinion poll conducted by 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN, together with a survey on the economic 
situation and the employment issue, about 30 percent of 
respondents, who are top corporate executives, thought the 
current Japan-U.S. relations are in a "serious" situation. The 
other 70 percent also expressed their anxieties, saying "they 
are rather concerned about the situation." 
  Moves for preventing trade frictions, such as the settlement 
of the mobile phone issue, and the automakers' voluntary plans 
to expand procurement of foreign-made auto parts, have been made 
one after another. The cabinet also approved in late March the 
"outline of external economic policy reforms" as measures to 
promote deregulation and market opening. Yet, only one 
executive answered "Japan-U.S. relationship will improve" 
through this outline, while 90 percent expressed disappointment, 
saying: "It will not change." Three respondents even said "it 
will worsen." 
  In answer to a question on measures Japan should take 
(multiple-choice answer), about 90 percent of those polled cited 
the implementation of "large-scale relaxation and abolition of 
regulations." About 70 percent pointed out the need for 
"extensive market opening." With regard to expanding domestic 
demand, 50 percent sought "large-scale tax reduction," and 30 
percent, "further increase in public investment." While the 
majority tended to rely on the government to take some measures, 
about 20 percent pointed out the need for "cooperation at the 
private-sector level." Only one respondent answered there was 
no other choice but "to accept the numerical targets" which 
caused the rupture of the economic framework talks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Be Afraid of Dialogue on Japan-U.S. </F>
Security"] 
  [Text] A supposedly nightmarish scenario is being talked 
about by Diet members and government officials. The scenario is 
that trade frictions between Japan and the United States go from 
bad to worse and that the two countries square off not only on 
trade but also in other fields as well. The opinion gains 
ground in the United States that Japan has been getting a free 
ride on defense from the United States and that there is no need 
to protect such a country. Animosity becomes mutual. 
Nationalistic sentiment gains the upper hand in Japan as well. 
The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is discussed simply on an 
emotional plane, resulting in dire consequences, the scenario 
goes. 
  The Japanese Government thinks that strains between the two 
countries should by all means be confined to trade alone. It is 
so worried as to be very jittery about their spreading to 
security issues. 
  Inasmuch as the cold war has ended and the U.S. security 
strategy toward Japan based on the perceived threat from the 
Soviet Union has changed, however, a fresh study should be 
conducted as to whether the security arrangements between Japan 
and the United States ought to remain as they are, regardless of 
the direction that trade problems take. 
  In a recent book, George Kennan, a former U.S. diplomat who 
has closely watched the world for the 50 years since World War 
II, writes about Japan-U.S. relations that, with the end of the 
cold war, the initial raison d'etre for the present defense 
agreements has been lost. (It should not be forgotten, though, 
that some remain as long as the problem of North Korea's effort 
to develop nuclear weapons is not solved.) Kennan says that, 
being a layman, he does not know whether the Japanese Government 
wants to retain these military agreements unchanged. If it does 
not, there is no clear reason for keeping them in the present 
form, he says. The United States should willingly accept their 
abrogation or revision, Kennan says. 
  The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its ancillary agreements 
are products of a bipolar world centered on the United States 
and the former Soviet Union. Consequently, although problems 
may remain on the Korean peninsula, the end of the cold war made 
the original reasons for their existence irrelevant, as Kennan 
says. In discussing the security arrangements, both the 
proponents and the opponents of the maintenance of those 
arrangements should start by facing up to that fact. 
  When the reason for the existence of something disappears or 
changes, normally a fresh look is taken at its continuation. 
  That ought to be true of our security treaty as well. 
Because the biggest country targeted militarily by that treaty 
has collapsed, the first question that must be asked is what is 
the target of the treaty. The question is whether the target is 
still the former Soviet Union or new threats from some other 
countries, and how far Japan and the United States should go in 
taking joint action against that threat. 
  As far as is known from the United States' new international 
strategy, U.S. military interest has shifted from the former 
Soviet Union to various regional conflicts. In particular, the 
new focal points are the Middle East (especially Iraq) and Asia 
(notably North Korea). 
  The role played by the U.S. troops in Japan has also 
changed. 
Greater importance is being attached to their role of military 
logistical support for dealing with regional conflicts, rather 
than as the forward base closest to the Soviet Union and the 
defense of Japan in case of possible contingencies in this 
country. In fact, the U.S. Forces in Japan played a major part 
in the Persian Gulf war. 
  The center of gravity of our security treaty has shifted. It 
seems that security in the countries of Asia and the Middle East 
has assumed greater importance, taking up the slack in the 
security needs of Japan. Also, the regions that have newly 
assumed importance include some areas to which the security 
treaty did not give any consideration at all when it was signed. 
  The Japanese and U.S. Governments should grope for a new 
framework for security in Asia after making clear how the 
picture has changed. Otherwise, the theory of "Japan getting a 
free ride" that is now held by some Americans will gain momentum 
and could lead to a depth of irreparable misunderstanding before 
we are aware of it.

  [Text] A symposium on "U.S. military bases on Okinawa and 
the lawsuit against noise caused by U.S. military aircraft" 
(under the auspices of the Committee on Creation of Peace on 
Okinawa) was held at the Yashioso Hotel in Matsuo, Naha City, on 
the afternoon of 9 April, to look at the present state of U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa and to discuss ways to resolve 
problems arising from them. At the symposium, a lawyer, a 
resident, a scholar, and other participants reported on the 
damage caused by U.S. military bases from their respective 
positions, and nearly 50 participants discussed ways to handle 
the lawsuit against noise. The symposium unanimously adopted a 
"statement protesting against a series of aircraft crashes on 
U.S. military bases." 
  Speaking at the symposium, Yasuhide Oshiri, secretary 
general 
of the committee, said: "The special forces of four U.S. 
services are stationed on Okinawa and the importance of these 
military bases in U.S. global strategy remains unchanged. The 
number of facilities used by NBC (nuclear, biological, and 
chemical) units has increased from 15 in 1988 to 27." He also 
stressed that peace will not return to Okinawa as long as the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is not repealed. 
  Explaining the ruling on a lawsuit against noise caused by 
U.S. military planes on Kadena Air Base, attorney Noho Ikemiyagi 
said: "The ruling dashed all the hopes expressed by plaintiffs 
for calm sleep. Nonetheless, for the first time, we succeeded 
in having the court hand down a judgment that residents are in 
an illegal situation and the task before us is how to use the 
judgment in the future." 
  Explaining the residents' position, Tsuguyasu Tokeshi from 
Chatan town said emphatically: "Crashes involving U.S. military 
aircraft have actually occurred. Residents have always been 
concerned about a recurrence of those crashes." He also 
stressed the only way of keeping U.S. military airplanes from 
causing noise is to remove U.S. military bases from Okinawa. 
  Reporting on the health problems of residents at the 
symposium, Kazuhiko Taira, a professor at Ryukyu University, 
said: "The aircraft-caused noise has become a cause of stress. 
It has caused hearing problems and adversely affects hormone 
secretion and the nervous system. It has also caused major 
problems in the educational climate, making it difficult for 
children to concentrate." 
  During a question-and-answer session, a participant said: 
"The judge who wrote the ruling in the lawsuit against 
noise--before quitting his office--stated: A group of lawyers 
from Osaka city was in charge of defending the case and they 
might have been unable to present solid evidence to back up 
their claims because they did not have a full understanding of 
circumstances surrounding the noise case. I had no choice but to 
write the ruling that way. I could not understand why all the 
lawyers came from Osaka city and why Okinawans from all walks of 
life were not rallied."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What We Want the VIP Ambassador To See"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale is here in 
Okinawa. Governor Masahide Ota has asked him to help resolve 
issues related to U.S. military bases. 
  Mondale has come at a time when people all over Okinawa are 
fiercely protesting the crash of an F-15 Eagle fighter on Kadena 
Air Base (on 4 April), and a CH-46 helicopter crash on Futenma 
Air Station (on 6 April). The prefectural assembly convened an 
emergency session on 8 April, and adopted a protest resolution 
on the two accidents and a statement asking for a thorough 
investigation into the accidents; publication of the findings; 
and suspension of military training until the causes of the 
accidents are determined, after the concerned local governments 
had done the same. This process has been repeated over and over 
again. 
  Regarding the base issues, both former Governor Junji 
Nishime 
and Governor Ota decided not to just sit and wait for the 
Japanese Government to negotiate. They have visited the United 
States several times to petition directly. 
  Ambassador Mondale claims he "can understand the Okinawans' 
feelings." We hope he takes this opportunity to visit the 
relevant sites and see for himself. 
  We hope he will see how expansive military bases occupy a 
good portion of the small islands of Okinawa, how the 
residential areas are threatened by the possibility of damage 
from accidents, how artillery fire has punched holes into some 
of our few remaining green mountains, how noise interferes with 
daily life, and how Okinawans are exasperated by all of this. 
  The specific demands of the prefectural government at this 
point consist of: The return of Naha Military Port, 
discontinuation of parachuting exercises at the Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield and the return of the airfield, an end to the 
live shelling exercises across Prefectural Highway 104, plus the 
prevention of accidents relating to military training. 
  As Governor Ota stated, next year marks the 50th anniversary 
of the end of the war. We want to see tangible solutions to the 
base issues. Prevention of accidents is a particularly urgent 
matter. 
  There is one more thing we want Ambassador Mondale--a VIP 
politician who was vice president during the Carter 
administration and once a presidential candidate--to know. 
  We want him to know the significance of the fact that 
Governor Ota--who upholds peace as the key policy of his 
administration--defeated the previous Governor Nishime, who had 
made significant achievements in developing the Okinawan economy 
during his 12 years in power. 
  Following the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] policy of 
"working for the effective and steady implementation of the 
Japan-U.S. Security Pact, while improving the livelihood and 
welfare in Okinawa," Nishime also worked positively for the 
solution of the base issues in Okinawa. 
  During the election of November 1990, amid the Gulf crisis, 
the immediate reason for Nishime's crushing defeat was that he 
at first favored the "UN Peace Cooperation Bill" submitted by 
the LDP administration to the Diet (although he later opposed 
the dispatch of Self-Defense Forces). Most supporters of Ota, 
who won the election, oppose the Japan-U.S. security setup. 
  The military bases on Okinawa formed the key links in the 
security system safeguarding Japan and the United States under 
the premise of the Soviet threat when the structure of East-West 
confrontation still existed. Even since this framework has 
changed, they assume the important function of a rear support 
base for a world strategy covering the Middle East and other 
areas of conflict in faraway lands. This indefinite strategic 
role is unacceptable to the Okinawan people. 
  At present, there is the issue of the DPRK (North Korea). 
Okinawa may be important as a base from which to apply pressure 
on North Korea. Even so, other people feel the DPRK should not 
be forced into desperation. Our indignation at the accidents 
does not only concern our daily life at present. This may 
become an opportunity for an outpouring of opinion questioning 
the ability of the present security system to safeguard world 
peace.

  [Text] Naha City Assembly 
  The Naha City Assembly (chaired by Kansaki Asato) convened 
an 
extraordinary session on the morning of 12 April to sternly 
protest with "strong anger" a series of crashes involving U.S. 
Military aircraft and to unanimously adopt a resolution and a 
statement demanding a thorough investigation into the cause of 
the crashes and prevention of a recurrence of those crashes. 
  The resolution will be sent to the American ambassador in 
Japan and two other U.S. officials, whereas the statement will 
be sent to the prime minister, the foreign minister, speaker of 
the House of Representatives, president of the House of 
Councilors, and three other Japanese officials. 
  The resolution and statement strongly demand the immediate 
removal of dangerous defective helicopters from Okinawa that 
threaten the property and lives of Okinawans and the immediate 
return of Futenma Air Station. 
<H5>  Urasoe City Assembly </H5>
  The Urasoe City Assembly (chaired by Ichiro Akamine) held an 
extraordinary session on 10 April to unanimously adopt a 
statement calling for the prevention of a recurrence of the 
crash involving U.S. military helicopters and a resolution 
protesting the crash. 
  The statement said: "Urasoe's airspace is used by U.S. 
military aircraft as their route and we feel a cold chill when 
we think of a crash in our city." The statement also demanded 
the prevention of a recurrence of such a crash and the early 
return of Futenma Air Station. 
<H5>  Nago City Assembly </H5>
  The Nago City Assembly (chaired by Susumu Asato) held an 
extraordinary session on the morning of 12 April to unanimously 
adopt a resolution protesting the crash of an F-15 Eagle fighter 
that occurred at Kadena Air Base and the crash of a large 
helicopter at Futenma Air Station, and a statement. 
  The resolution protesting the series of crashes involving 
U.S. Military aircraft expressed a sense of crisis, saying: 
"The latest crashes show us that we cannot view them with 
indifference and the crashes are heightening apprehensions among 
citizens." The resolution also demanded: 1) a speedy 
investigation into the cause of the crashes and the disclosure 
of their cause to the Okinawans, and 2) a halt to training 
flights by U.S. military planes until the cause of the crashes 
is determined.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff members Keiji Kobayashi and </F>
Shunji Taoka: "Does North Korea Really Intend Going to War?"] 
  [Text] The situation is becoming unstable due to 
suspicions about the nuclear development policy of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). 
  At a news conference on 23 March at the North Korean Embassy 
in Beijing concerning the resumption of the U.S.-South Korea 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercise and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said 
that "unless they are halted, there will be no recourse but to 
go to war. The entire responsibility rests with the two 
countries (the United States and South Korea)." In the embassy, 
photographs from the Korean crisis period were displayed. 
  Prior to this, at a 19 March working level meeting in 
Panmunjom held to discuss the exchange of special envoys between 
the North and the South, North Korean representative Pak Yong-su 
suggested the possibility of war by declaring that "Seoul is not 
far from here (Panmunjom). In case of war, Seoul will be 
engulfed in fire." He even added that "in that event, it will 
also be difficult for you, Mr. Son (the South Korean 
representative), to survive." 
  It had to be without doubt a comment which he was instructed 
to make by the highest authorities, since an official at a mere 
outpost could not use an expression such as "war" at his own 
discretion. It is said that representative Pak made that 
comment while looking at a memo which he had prepared 
beforehand, and that a North Korean propaganda broadcast at the 
DMZ [demilitarized zone] kept repeating "[we will] start the 
offensive in early April." 
  The United States and South Korea, on the other hand, have 
decided to "resume Team Spirit," and to deploy Patriot missiles 
in South Korea. The South Korean Defense Ministry on 24 March 
made public that they had already completed a plan for a 
five-stage "absorbing and unifying operation 5027," which 
includes immediate retaliation, occupation of Pyongyang, and so 
on, to be implemented in the event North Korea invades the South. 
  This is the first time the tension between the North and 
South has become so high since the 1983 terrorist bombing 
incident in Rangoon. 
<H5>  Building a Sense of Crisis in Hopes of Gaining Advantage in </H5>
Negotiations 
  Why has North Korea used such excessively provocative 
expressions? 
  Specialists on North Korea in Seoul believe that their 
intentions include the following: 1) It is the final raising of 
the ante prior to playing the "nuclear card;" 2) By generating 
fear of war, they will heighten the sense of crisis for doves in 
South Korea and the United States, and gain an advantage in 
future negotiations; and 3) It is intended to strengthen the 
unity of the nation. 
  For North Korea, the "nuclear card," with which they make 
others suspect that they have developed or are developing 
nuclear arms, is their last trump card for solving their present 
international isolation and economic difficulties. In fact, by 
using this card, they have succeeded in bringing the United 
States, which wants extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT), to the negotiating table, and they have gained 
concessions such as halting military exercises and the start of 
U.S.-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations. The 
specialists suspect that this [use of threatening expressions] 
may be their way of testing the water to determine if they can 
make one more push. 
  Setting aside the national unity policy, so far their 
strategy to gain concessions through a hardened posture has not 
met with success. In Seoul, it has hardly affected the price of 
stocks and there is no move toward hoarding: the people have 
accepted this development calmly. It is said that in South 
Korea public opinion in support of the flexible line followed by 
the Kim Yong-sam Government toward the North has been strong, 
but because of the recent comments the hawks' voices have 
rapidly become stronger, and it is getting harder for the 
government to compromise. 
  The United States plans to bring this issue to the United 
Nations Security Council. It plans first to pass a resolution 
criticizing North Korea, and if no result is obtained, it wants 
to move on to economic sanctions. The responses of Japan, South 
Korea, and the United States, which until now were subtly 
different in approach, has become a unified response. And the 
emergence of such an international situation makes it difficult 
for even China, which North Korea relies on, to use the veto. 
  Far Eastern Issues Research Institution Director Kang In-tok 
[as published] observes that "the North has made an incorrect 
reading of the international situation because of their cold war 
mind set and dogma. I wonder if it [North Korea] has given the 
impression to the world that it is not a party with which one 
can negotiate in a normal manner." 
  Of course this is not to say that there is absolutely no 
risk that the heightened tension might trigger an accidental 
explosion and lead to war. But most observers believe that in 
the near future North Korea has no choice but to resume 
negotiations with the United States. North Korea has in the 
past suddenly changed important policies, such as the resumption 
of Japan-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations, and 
joining the United Nations. In such a case, how China behaves 
will be the key factor. 
<H5>  Bullish Comment is Reverse Side of Fear -- The "Inferno" </H5>
Will Be Pyongyang 
  For the offensive side the value of a surprise attack is 
extremely great. 
  It was Sunday morning, 25 June 1950, when North Korean 
forces 
broke through the 38th parallel. It was also Sunday when the 
Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn of 7 December 1941 
(local time). 
  The fact that the North Korean side says "we will make Seoul 
an inferno" and "there is no recourse but to go to war," is to 
abandon the effect of a surprise attack if it really intends to 
attack. 
  It is a common practice to keep a low rhetorical posture 
when 
one starts a war, because it is convenient to declare internally 
and externally, after the war starts, "we had no choice but to 
retaliate because the other side launched an attack." In this 
sense, it would be appropriate to interpret the offensive 
utterances by North Korea as a bluff derived from its fear of 
war. 
  There are reasons that North Korea fears war. Although it is 
said they possess 730 fighter aircraft, most of them are old 
Chinese-made MiG-17's and 19's. The only modern planes are some 
10 to 20 MiG-29's and 30's, some Sukhoy-25 ground assault 
planes, and 40 or so MiG-23's, totaling a little under 100 
aircraft. Even if 120 MiG-21's can be utilized, this comes to 
only 200 odd aircraft. 
  On the other hand, South Korea's F-16's, F-4's, and F-5's, 
which total about 340 planes, can all be used at the front. 
Moreover, 72 U.S. Air Force F-16's are stationed in Korea, 160 
U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps Air Wing aircraft are stationed 
in Japan, and 60 fighter and assault planes from U.S. aircraft 
carriers bring the total to some 630 aircraft. The performance 
capabilities of the aircraft are different. In particular, the 
gaps are great in electronic technology such as radar, 
computers, and electronic countermeasures, and in information 
gathering ability by airborne early warning aircraft and 
reconnaissance satellites. 
  Also, North Korea has a fuel shortage, and per pilot flight 
training per year is said to be four to six hours. This is the 
same as a "paper driver" [that is, someone who is qualified on 
paper, but has no practical experience]. When all these 
elements are taken together, the United States-South Korean side 
has absolute aerial superiority. 
<H5>  Lightweight "Nuclear Weapon" Not Completed? </H5>
  Even if the North Korean forces make an offensive move, 
because they will be hit from the air and their supply trucks 
will be destroyed it is likely that they will be driven back 
without passing through the South's defensive positions. 
  The only strategies left for the North would be to have its 
60,000 special forces invade alongside the mountains, to fire 
Scud missiles, of which it is said to possess over 300, or for 
fighter airplanes, prepared to make only a one way attack, to 
invade with bombs at low altitudes. 
  The reason the U.S. forces are positioning "Patriot" antiair 
missiles in South Korea is not to defend Seoul from the Scuds. 
The Patriot is almost useless against ballistic missiles. It 
is to protect the U.S. bases from aerial attacks. 
  There is a suspicion that North Korea has made a "nuclear 
detonation device," but it is fairly certain that it has not 
made any lightweight "nuclear weapon" deliverable by missile. 
  But chemical weapons are of World War I technology, so 
information that the North is making them is most likely true. 
If chemical warhead-armed Scuds were to be shot into Seoul, 
since South Korea has not made preparations with gas masks, 
protective clothing, and antidotes for the civilian population 
as Israel has, it would trigger great chaos. 
  If the population of 20 million from Seoul and its 
surrounding areas attempted an exodus, the U.S.-South Korean 
counteroffensive operation could be stalled in the waves of 
refuges. As for Japanese, there are about 3,000 who live in 
Seoul, and about 10,000 tourists are expected to be in the city. 
Their rescue would be difficult. 
  On the other hand, the U.S.-South Korean naval and air 
forces 
would gain command of the air, would severely bomb Pyongyang and 
Wonsan on the east coast, and would also attack with "Tomahawk" 
cruise missiles from surface vessels and submarines. Against 
the American electronics interference technology and the stealth 
fighter airplanes which would not show up on radar, there is 
nothing the North's antiair missiles can do. North Korea must 
know that it is Pyongyang which would become an inferno. 
  But as long as the combined 600,000-700,000 troops are 
facing 
each other along the 240-km front line, the South Korean side 
has entered into alert status, and has come to feel nervous 
about the North Korean comments on war, there is a slim chance 
that small clashes at the border could expand into full-scale 
battles. 
  Along the demilitarized zone, there also have been frequent 
incidents in the past of shootings between patrols from both 
sides. 
  Thus, when tension becomes heightened, an unexpected 
situation could easily occur.

  [Text] The government will provide full-scale official 
development assistance (ODA) to Mozambique in the form of 
bilateral assistance, in parallel with the participation of the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in the UN peacekeeping operations 
[PKO] in the country. This was disclosed by a source at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 6 April. The government 
plans to display Japan's attitude in making international 
contribution by providing its utmost "assistance for 
reconstruction work" to the African nation. This will be the 
second full-fledged ODA to a country, in which the SDF is 
engaged in PKO activities, after Cambodia. Japan plans to 
provide tens of millions of dollars to Mozambique, though the 
amount is less than a total of $300 million given to Cambodia 
for its reconstruction work. While a MOFA survey team has 
already arrived in Mozambique, together with survey teams from 
European countries and the United States, the government intends 
to promote the plan in a concrete manner to lead other nations. 
Moreover, the government plans to positively help Mozambique 
smoothly conduct its general elections scheduled for October, 
and it has begun studying a plan to send an election-monitoring 
team based on the PKO Cooperation Law. 
  Since Japan regards the southern Africa region as an area to 
which great emphasis in its ODA programs should be attached, it 
has decided to provide aid to Mozambique. From now on, the 
government intends to extend ODA to the peripheral region, 
including South Africa, which will be newly born following a 
constituent assembly election. 
  SDF members have been dispatched in rotation to Mozambique 
since last May, and 53 members are currently engaged in duties 
there. Moreover, Japan provided Mozambique with approximately 
$200 million through bilateral assistance centering on food 
supply and acceptance of trainees (between 1988 and 1992). 
However, because the government army and the antigovernment 
army have been smoothly conducting disarmament under the 
monitoring of the UN peacekeeping operations in Mozambique 
(ONUMOZ), a focal point of construction work has now shifted to 
improvement of infrastructure in the country. For this reason, 
Mozambique is now waiting for assistance from foreign nations. 
  Under these circumstances, the government has sent to the 
country a survey team headed by Mitsugu Saito, chief of the 
Development Cooperation Division under MOFA's Economic 
Cooperation Bureau, saying: "More positive ODA will be 
necessary from now on. If soldiers, who will lose their job, 
have no place to go after disarmament is completed, all efforts 
will come to nothing," (according to a MOFA source). The 
government intends to hold the final consultations on working 
out possible cooperation, including improvement of social 
infrastructure and technical assistance after the survey team's 
return home set for 15 April. Among possible projects are: road 
repairs; the improvement of water supply and drainage; and 
assistance for the electric power industry. While Japan 
provided aid to Cambodia as a partner in the Asian region, ODA 
to Mozambique is believed to "have an epoch-making significance 
as Japan's visible assistance for reconstruction in Africa, 
which is far from Japan" (as stated by a government source).

<F P=106> [Article by Naoki Okabe, editorial staff member: "Hosokawa's </F>
`Economic Reform' Policy Lacked Principles--Lack of Appropriate 
Measures Due to Reliance on Bureaucracy; Political Leadership 
Put to Test"] 
  [Text] In a way, the collapse of the administration of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is the result of its failing to 
implement sound economic measures. The administration has 
faltered with tax system reform. The budget issue has been 
postponed, and deregulation plans have been impeded. As a 
result, Japan's economic relations with the United States 
remains strained. 
  The administration was not headed in the wrong direction. It 
felt fresh to the people's ears when the administration called 
out for "economic reform." Its calls began to sound empty 
because the administration lacked political leadership and 
policy principles. Leadership in tackling impending issues to 
help bring about true economic reform is sought in the next 
administration, which is yet to be seen. 
<H5>  The Issue of Tax System Reform Was the Underlying Cause of </H5>
the Crisis 
  Initially, the world's financial capital markets reacted 
calmly to the news of "Hosokawa's resignation." However, 
U.S.-initiated adjustments are currently going on in these 
markets. Due to a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, long-term 
interest rates have risen in various countries, and stocks have 
fallen. For unstable markets which are sensitive to new 
information, political disturbances can become decisive factors. 
  The market in Tokyo is most affected by tension in the 
Korean 
peninsula. Although there are strong concerns in Japan about yen 
appreciation, what is really frightening is the fall in the 
values of yen, stocks, and securities when this is combined with 
mounting international tension and bogging down of the political 
situation. 
  The economy finally seems to be moving toward recovery. 
There should be no concern that this trend might be drastically 
affected by the recent change in the political situation. 
Should the turmoil be prolonged, however, psychological effects 
cannot be ignored. 
  In the end, what has the Hosokawa administration 
accomplished 
regarding economic affairs? What is ironic is that Hosokawa's 
"final task" was his getting advice on tax system reform from 
the government Tax Commission. What could have gone through the 
prime minister's mind when he read the Tax Commission's report? 
What troubled him the most must have been the tax system. 
This, then, was the underlying cause of the collapse of the 
administration. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa found himself in a predicament as 
the 
ruling coalition parties remained divided over the issue of a 
consumption tax hike, while Finance Ministry bureaucrats 
insisted on balancing revenue shortfalls with tax hikes. Since 
priority was placed on political reform, budget compilation, 
which normally is routine work, has been postponed. As a 
result, the administration came to an abrupt halt, failing to 
even see the beginning of Diet deliberations on the draft budget 
bill. The public lost its confidence in the prime minister when 
he was forced to take back to the drawing board his proposal for 
a national welfare tax, which was based only on "rough 
estimates." What replaced this was a plan to "cut taxes for one 
year only"--a major factor that caused the breakdown in 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  The Hosokawa administration gained wide acclaim from the 
world's economists by saying "no" to the setting of numerical 
targets during trade negotiations. However, it failed to come 
up with counterproposals, causing the U.S. administration to be 
further dissatisfied. Hosokawa used the laudable phrase "mature 
relations" to ease the impact of the breakdown in the framework 
trade talks. Since Japan-U.S. relations have relied heavily on 
the personal relationship between Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, the prime minister's resignation, all the more, 
could lead to a delay in the restoration of bilateral ties. 
<H5>  An Inclination to Introversion </H5>
  What is more serious is that under the Hosokawa 
administration, Japan unknowingly became introverted. Even 
though Japan is the greatest benefactor under GATT, it played 
the role of a victim in the Uruguay Round talks. 
  It is said that it will be unlikely for Japanese ministers 
to 
attend a GATT ministerial meeting to be held in Morocco this 
week. What does it signify for Japan to be absent at a time when 
the world seeks to set up new frameworks of negotiations 
regarding employment and trade, environment and trade, and other 
issues under the new World Trade Organization (WTO)? An 
immeasurable negative impact can be expected if the nation with 
the largest current account surplus in the world remains silent. 
  Regardless of who takes over the reins of the government, 
it is clear which direction the Japanese economy should move. 
Needless to say, priority must be placed on enacting the draft 
budget bill. Only then can the new administration tackle 
unfinished tasks regarding "economic reform." 
  Concerning tax system reform, tax cuts should be continued 
in 
such a manner that the progressive structure of income taxes may 
be relaxed. The consumption tax should be raised in the future 
after improving the consumption tax system by abolishing taxes 
on profits and through other means. 
  Regarding deregulation, policy principles should be made 
clear as to "what purpose deregulation is intended for." 
Nothing would have been accomplished should deregulation be 
implemented equally among all government ministries and 
agencies, just as in the manner the budget is allocated among 
them. That would be tantamount to playing into the hands of 
bureaucrats. Rather, what would be more effective is to 
concentrate on deregulating those sectors which would help boost 
domestic demand. 
  Economic reform in Japan should serve as a model case for 
post-cold war market economies. Only after it has implemented 
economic reform can Japan finally qualify as a proponent for an 
international economic system in the next era. 
<H5>  A Necessary Responsibility </H5>
  Although the Japanese economy should move in such a 
direction 
regardless of who takes over the reins of the government, this 
cannot necessarily be accomplished by just any administration. 
Economic reform can only be implemented by an administration 
which does not let bureaucrats take over policies and can 
exercise political leadership and comprehensive coordinating 
capabilities. The problem with the current political structure 
is that there are only a few politicians who have better 
knowledge of economics than the bureaucrats, even though they 
may be very interested in power struggles. 
  When Tanzan Ishibashi was finance minister, he stayed up all 
night to write a financial policy speech regarding the fiscal 
year 1946 national budget, all by himself. Since the final 
draft of his speech, which included a well-known passage, "man 
lives for hope in the future rather than the present," was not 
ready for a cabinet meeting, Ishibashi made verbal explanations 
and managed to answer to Diet interpellations. Japan made a 
miraculous recovery because here was a politician with a sense 
of responsibility in times of great tension. Such politicians 
are rare nowadays. This is what is causing a waste of time in 
Japanese politics. 
  Only by adjusting the political structure gradually can 
economic reform be brought about. However, should the Japanese 
economy fail to emerge from the turmoil because too much time 
has been spent on adjusting the political structure, it will be 
mercilessly exposed to heavy selling in the world's markets. 
Japanese politics is being put to a test in a time of historic 
upheaval in the world economy.

  [Text] The government convened the second meeting of the 
Administrative Reform Headquarters' (headed by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa) "Working Panel on Import Promotion, 
Improvement of Market Access, and Distribution" at the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence on the morning of 11 April. At 
the meeting, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister, said: "Deregulation is a very 
important issue, since its implementation is beneficial from the 
standpoint of people's livelihood. For example, it will help 
reduce the gap of commodity prices at home and abroad. Despite 
the current political situation, it is desired that further 
efforts will be made toward this end."

  [Text] On the afternoon of 11 April, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa severely criticized a meeting of top leaders 
of three parties -- the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] 
-- and a floor group held earlier in the day. 
  At the Prime Minister's Office, Hosokawa told reporters: "I 
think the meeting is wrong. Since coalition parties have agreed 
to pick (the next prime minister) at the party representatives 
meeting [attended by party secretaries general], the meeting of 
party heads should be held after that. The coalition will not 
be able to reach an accord if the top-level meeting comes first."

  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, which 
have been considering plans for a recombination of parties in 
the coalition alliance on the condition of fielding the Liberal 
Democratic Party's [LDP] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime 
minister and former foreign minister, for the prime 
ministership, are now being pressed to reconsider their 
strategies. Watanabe has shown a willingness to join hands with 
Shinseito and Komeito, but in such a case, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] are certain to 
withdraw from the coalition alliance. Even if Watanabe were to 
bolt from the LDP, it would not be easy to fill the hole that 
would be left in the coalition alliance should the SDPJ and 
other groups leave the alliance. Shinseito and Komeito would 
then find themselves barred from carrying out their crucial task 
of forming a majority group. Apparently, the two parties have 
thus taken a "two-pronged approach": considering plans to 
maintain the framework of the current alliance with the SDPJ and 
other groups while flashing the "Watanabe negotiating card." 
  Initially, Shinseito planned to join "Reform" [Kaikaku], a 
new lower house parliamentary group formed by the Japan New 
Party [JNP] together with Komeito; the "Kaikaku-no-Kai" 
[parliamentary group formed by Takeo Nishioka and others who 
recently broke away from the LDP], and a group of lower house 
members from the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan [DSP] who 
are close to DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa. Shinseito 
then planned to form a grand parliamentary alliance of 170-180 
members, making it the largest ruling coalition parliamentary 
bloc. It then planned to use this as a backdrop in a strategy 
to join hands with Watanabe and his supporters. 
  However, plans to form a majority group among the ruling 
coalition parties have not been proceeding as well as expected 
because, among other reasons, the formation of the "Kaikaku" has 
triggered a split in Hosokawa's own front yard, the JNP. On top 
of this, the assumption that "the SDPJ would never form an 
alliance with the LDP" (as stated by a senior Komeito official) 
turned out to be incorrect. With the emergence of a possible 
alliance between Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the LDP, from which 
Watanabe is expected to have defected, there has emerged the 
possibility that the Shinseito-led group may fall back into a 
minority. 
  On the afternoon of 10 April, rumors of an 
"LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance caused mixed reactions among 
Shinseito members. Some senior party officials suggested that 
the party place priority on maintaining the current coalition 
alliance and attend a party leadership meeting proposed by SDPJ 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in order to ease resistance against 
the so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" formed by Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa. Ozawa, however, rejected the leadership meeting, in 
insisting on launching a frontal assault. As for the meeting 
between Murayama and three other party leaders, Ozawa openly 
demonstrated his displeasure, saying: "Only half (of the ruling 
coalition party leaders) will be there. It will be nothing more 
than a private gathering." Another senior party official feels 
that should the "LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance plan proceed 
further, "there eventually will be a split in both the LDP and 
the SDPJ." A group of Shinseito members close to Ozawa has been 
contacting Watanabe behind the scenes, while a group of junior 
party members has been contacting the LDP's 
proelectoral-reformists who are close to former Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu. 
  While such maneuverings are going on, Shinseito is also 
considering plans to maintain the framework of the current 
coalition alliance and to successfully field "Tsutomu Hata as 
the new prime minister." The party considers this as the "last 
point of compromise." In this case, however, it is certain that 
the SDPJ and other groups will demand that there be no more 
instances of "Ichi- Ichi line"-initiated steering of the 
government. A top DSP official has even insisted, "Ozawa and 
Ichikawa should be placed on their good behavior." In case 
agreement cannot be reached among the ruling coalition parties 
to choose Hata as Hosokawa's successor, there also remains the 
possibility that Murayama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura may be fielded for the prime minister's post. Thus, 
Shinseito is on the verge of having to choose between going 
ahead with its plan to form a majority group or succumbing to a 
"compromise."

  [Text] On 11 April, MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide 
survey of 250 eligible voters on who should succeed outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and found that one-third of 
the respondents want Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, to be the next prime minister. 
  The survey was conducted in major cities, such as Tokyo, 
Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, by conducting personal interviews or 
interviews over the phone. In answering "who should be the next 
prime minister?" 78 people (31.2 percent of the respondents) 
supported Hata, 35 (14 percent) Masayoshi Takemura, and 30 (12 
percent) Michio Watanabe as the next prime minister. Lower 
house member Makiko Tanaka and Hokkaido Governor Takahiro 
Yokomichi were also favored as the next prime minister. 
Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi, however, is not eligible to become 
prime minister because he is not a Diet member. 
  As the reason for supporting Hata, a 28-year-old man in 
Tochigi Prefecture said: "He has made a contribution to the 
Hosokawa government. Also, he has been known as Japan's foreign 
minister in other countries. He seems to be an able man." A 
25-year-old woman in Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "Because he has 
strong backing, he will be able to exercise leadership." 
  Takemura ranked second to Hata as a favorite figure to be 
the 
next prime minister. He was popular mainly in the Kansai area 
where he is from. A 47-year-old woman in Osaka said: "He has a 
relatively clean image." A 27-year-old man in Hokkaido also 
said: "He will inherit Mr. Hosokawa's good points." 
  Watanabe was popular among elderly people. Because of his 
career as foreign minister and finance minister, many hoped that 
"Watanabe should carry out Japan's diplomatic policy saying what 
it has to say to the United States, as well as the work to 
reconstruct the economy." 
  Takako Doi and Masaharu Gotoda were also popular because of 
their "clean" image. A 45-year-old woman in Tokyo put her 
expectations on Doi, saying: "I hope that the Diet will take 
the plunge and name Doi as the first female prime minister."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Sovereign People Should Not Be Forgotten </F>
in the Process of Creating New Administration"] 
  [Text] If you look at it as a slapstick comedy, it may be 
quite interesting. But this becomes unbearable when you realize 
that this is the process of creating the next administration. 
While the factional struggle seen in the election of the party 
president, hence, the prime minister, during the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] era was indeed repulsive, the people are 
certainly amazed at the present turmoil among the ruling 
coalition parties, particularly because this came after the 
Hosokawa administration, which upheld "new politics." 
  The ruling parties have not even been able to decide the 
venue for discussions to select the next prime minister. 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New 
Party [JNP] insist that the issue should be discussed at the 
"representatives meeting" composed of secretary general-level 
party representatives. On the other hand, leaders of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] assert that this should be 
decided at a "party leaders meeting." Both sides refuse to 
compromise. 
  The leaders of Shinseito, Komeito, and the JNP did not 
attend 
the party leaders meeting initiated by SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama on 11 April. The basic reason is: While Shinseito and 
Komeito want to make the new Diet grouping "Kaikaku" [Reform] 
the center of activities to realign political parties, the SDPJ 
and Sakigake are strongly critical of the idea. 
  Behind the SDPJ and Sakigake's opposition is their antipathy 
to the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary 
general said to be the strong man in the ruling parties. The 
present pattern of balance of forces is exactly the same as that 
during the upheaval relating to the cabinet reshuffle--said to 
be aimed at "getting rid of [Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi] 
Takemura"--last February. Shinseito and its allies are working 
hard to attract former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe to 
their camp to cut off the SDPJ, Sakigake, and their allies, and 
cooperate with a section of the LDP to maintain their hold on 
the administration. 
  On the other hand, the opposition LDP is aiming at 
recapturing political power by working with the SDPJ and 
Sakigake. Maneuvers to form cross alliances transcending the 
existing political framework of LDP versus non-LDP forces are 
being attempted beneath the surface. Despite the oft-repeated 
claim that "agreement in policy will be the basis of forming a 
government," in reality, top priority is being given to the 
question of how to maneuver to become the ruling party. 
  The Hosokawa administration quickly lost its sense of unity 
after the passage of the political reform bills. Thus, the 
collapse of the government was merely a matter of time all 
along. Yet, the ruling coalition parties simply focused their 
energy on emotional bickering, without preparing fully for the 
creation of a new administration. 
  The same is true for the opposition LDP. It is quite at a 
loss at the sudden collapse of the administration. One cannot 
even feel the LDP's ardor in putting up its president, Yohei 
Kono, as a candidate to recapture the political regime. 
  There are numerous urgent issues facing Japan, such as 
economic stimulation, tax reform, Japan-U.S. relations, and the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. For one thing, the draft 
1994 budget has not even passed deliberations by the lower house 
Budget Committee. Yet, we see no sense of urgency in efforts to 
form a new government. 
  The people will be totally disgusted if the next 
administration is formed solely by the logic of numbers. The 
people should be able to see what the basis of the new 
administration will be, and the process of who makes the 
decision, and where this decision is made. 
  When the Hosokawa administration was inaugurated, the people 
were in the dark as to why it was Hosokawa, and who made the 
decision. The formation of a government is a most vital 
political decision. True political reform precisely consists of 
making this process open for all to see as much as possible.

<F P=106> [First installment of unattributed article: "Outlook: </F>
Personnel Appointments in Kasumigaseki"] 
  [Text] The season of personnel appointments has come to the 
central government offices in Kasumigaseki. Although each 
ministry tries to build a new setup before the Diet session ends 
in late June, the arrangements may not be completed until July 
due to the confusion in politics. While many ministries are 
said to be concentrating on strengthening their organizations by 
seniority promotions this year amid the increasing criticism of 
bureaucrats, the personnel changes of some ministries are to be 
watched, such as the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI], which was in an uproar over the issue of MITI's 
Industrial Policy Bureau Chief Masahisa Naito's resignation; the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF], which carries the major task of tax 
reform; and the Ministry of Construction [MOC], which is being 
criticized for general contractors scandals. This year's 
personnel appointments are likely to draw more attention than 
usual. 
<H5>  MITI </H5>
  The dispute in which Naito was dismissed as Industrial 
Policy 
Bureau chief by MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai late last year for 
giving a preferential promotion to the son of Yuji Tanahashi, 
former MITI vice minister, still casts a blight over the 
ministry, and its personnel appointments for June is quite 
uncertain. At this point, the chances are that Administrative 
Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano (entered the ministry in 1960; 
hereafter, the numbers in parenthesis indicates the year the 
person became a bureaucrat) will remain in office and work to 
settle the confusion. 
  In this case, Kumano's contemporary, Sozaburo Okamatsu, 
deputy vice minister; Tomio Tsutsumi (1962), who succeeded Naito 
as Industrial Policy Bureau chief; and Yoshihiro Sakamoto 
(1962), chief of the International Trade Policy Bureau, are all 
expected to stay in their posts. 
  On the other hand, in and outside the ministry, there is a 
view that Kumano will resign to take responsibility for the 
situation. In this case, the personnel changes will be fluid, 
but, a plan to shift Okamatsu to the vice minister's post is 
most likely. Nevertheless, there is another view that Tsutsumi, 
who heads the Industrial Policy Bureau, will be promoted to 
administrative vice minister, a normal practice since a deputy 
vice minister becoming an administrative vice minister has no 
precedent. 
  In either scenario, Hideki Osada (1963), director general of 
the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, and Wataru Aso (1963), 
director general of the Patent Office, who are in MITI's 
extra-ministerial bureaus, are likely to retire voluntarily. 
There is a possibility that Tetsuo Nakata (1964), chief of the 
Defense Agency's Equipment Bureau, will be appointed director 
general of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency; and Hisashi 
Hosokawa (1964), chief of MITI's Basic Industries Bureau, will 
be appointed director general of the Patent Office. In this 
case, Tadashi Ezaki (1965), director general for MITI Minister's 
Policy Coordination Secretariat is the candidate to succeed 
Hosokawa as Basic Industries Bureau chief. The post of Akira 
Takashima (1963), chief of the Industrial Location and 
Environmental Protection Bureau, is also expected to be 
replaced. 
  Tsutomu Makino (1963), director of the MITI Secretariat, is 
likely to stay in his post, but in case of his replacement, the 
promotion of Osamu Watanabe (1964), chief of the Machinery and 
Information Industries Bureau, to Makino's post is most likely. 
Then, Watanabe will be succeeded by Katsuhiro Nakagawa (1965), 
chief of the International Trade Administration Bureau, and 
Nakagawa's post will be taken over by Hisamitsu Arai (1966), 
deputy chief of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau. 
<H5>  MOC </H5>
  To continue to reorganize the construction administration, 
which has been criticized even more due to the recent bribery 
scandals involving general contractors, Shigeo Mochizuki (1959), 
administrative vice minister of construction, is very likely to 
remain in office. The [MOC] has a custom of appointing 
officials specializing in technology and those in administration 
to the post of administrative vice minister by turns. So if 
Mochizuki, who is an administrative specialist, does not retire, 
the next vice minister candidate, Haruho Fujii (1962), vice 
minister of engineering affairs, who is technological 
specialist; and the next candidate but one, MOC Secretariat 
Director Noboru Ban (1963), who is from the administrative side, 
will stay in their posts. In that case, the personnel changes 
will mainly concern bureau chief level officials, and be 
relatively minor. 
  However, a possibility still exists for a major personnel 
change if voices to hold MOC executives responsible for the 
scandals increase. 
<H5>  National Land Agency </H5>
  Ichiro Ichikawa (1961), administrative vice minister of 
national land, will retire voluntarily after the current Diet 
session ends, and Secretariat Director Kazuhito Fujiwara (1962) 
will be promoted to the vice minister's position. In principle, 
the vice minister's post is held by officials from the MOC and 
the MOF alternately. MOC Housing Bureau chief Yasuhisa Mitsui 
(1963) will succeed Fujiwara, who was from the MOF, as director 
of the Secretariat, and prepare for next year's appointment to 
the vice minister's seat. 
  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
  Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai (1959) is going 
to retire voluntarily. Telecommunications Bureau Chief Haruki 
Matsuno (1960), who has been taking the lead in creating an 
environment for the multimedia age, is certain to become 
Shirai's successor. Communications Policy Bureau chief Mitsuo 
Igarashi (1963) will probably be appointed Telecommunications 
Bureau chief, which is the position for a vice-minister-to-be 
official. 
  Postal Savings Bureau chief Akemi Yamaguchi (1963) and 
General Councilor Masahito Tani (1964), who was responsible for 
the talks over cellular phones (automobile and hand-held phones) 
between Japan and the United States, are among the list for the 
post of Communication Policy Bureau chief. International 
Affairs Department chief Yoshio Utsumi (1966) will be the next 
general councilor. Postal Bureau chief Tadaaki Arai (1965) and 
Secretariat Director Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966) are likely to stay 
in their posts. 
<H5>  Ministry of Foreign Affairs </H5>
  Kunihiko Saito (1958), who took the office of administrative 
vice minister last August, is likely to remain in his post. 
While there are voices hoping for Treaties Bureau chief Minoru 
Tanba (1962) to remain in his post because of the DPRK's nuclear 
development issue, he will be transferred overseas as ambassador 
around summer because his service at home has been long. Masaki 
Orita (1965), consul general to Hong Kong, is likely to succeed 
Tanba. 
<H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>
  Upon completion of the Uruguay Round, executives, such as 
the 
administrative vice minister and Food Agency director general, 
were already replaced. Although the retirement of Deputy Vice 
Minister Jiro Shiwaku (1959), who was responsible for the 
[Uruguay Round] negotiations, is postponed to the end of May, 
Economic Affairs Bureau chief Takeki Manabe (1963) has been 
informally appointed to Shiwaku's post. Livestock Industry 
Bureau chief Hisao Azuma (1964) is expected to be the next 
Economic Affairs Bureau chief. 
<H5>  Science and Technology Agency </H5>
  Administrative Vice Minister Takuya Hirano (1959), who has 
been in office for two years this June, will retire voluntarily, 
and he will be succeeded by Kenichi Murakami (1960), deputy vice 
minister of scientific councilors, who will be the third 
administrative vice minister in a row from within the Science 
and Technology Agency. Katsuhisa Ida (1962), director of the 
Secretariat, and Fujio Sakauchi (1962), director of the National 
Institute of Science and Technology Policy, are candidates for 
deputy vice minister of scientific councilors.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
will press ahead with the expansion of the optical fiber cable 
communications network across the country from 1994. The MOPT 
plans to raise the current ceiling of low-interest loans by the 
Japan Development Bank to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT) and other telephone companies by about 3.3 
times after obtaining an agreement on raising the current 
ceiling from the Finance Ministry late last week. The U.S. 
Government has announced plans to build an information highway 
network, and in response, the MOPT has concluded that the 
government's aggressive assistance to the promotion of upgrading 
the existing communications infrastructure is indispensable. 
  The telephone companies that will benefit from the 
government's assistance are NTT, DDI [Daini Denden Company], 
Japan Telecom, and Japan Highspeed Communications. The MOPT 
Intends to set the raised ceiling of low-interest loans at a 
total of 52.5 billion yen after examining their business 
programs. The MOPT wants to lower interest rates on the 
low-interest loans to three-fourths the current annual interest 
rate of 4.4 percent applied to loans for financial investment, 
with a grace period maximum of 15 years. The current interest 
rate on the low-interest loans to telephone companies is running 
at 3.3 percent per annum. 
  Compared with the road network, the optical fiber cable 
communications network is in a situation where the construction 
of a highway network is completed, but trunk roads [kansendoro] 
have yet to be constructed. This situation has resulted from the 
hesitance of telephone companies to expand their telephone 
service in areas where they cannot expect profits. The MOPT 
hopes that the financial assistance will inspire telephone 
companies to accelerate the expansion of their telephone service 
in those areas. 
  The Japan Development Bank has thus far used proceeds from 
sales of government-held NTT stocks as financial resources to 
extend low-interest loans for the project of building the 
optical fiber cable communications network, but the network 
requires relay facilities and the low-interest loans have fallen 
short of meeting the financial requirement for construction of 
the optical fiber cable communications network.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge faction is a diminishing force that will 
disappear like other Asian insurgencies unless it joins the 
political mainstream. Evan Williams reports from Phnom Penh. 
Senator Evans says the return of normality to Cambodia is 
eroding what support that faction has left. 
  [Begin Williams recording] Ending his first visit since last 
year's UN-sponsored elections, Senator Evans was unwilling to 
say what impact he thought continuing support from some Thais 
will have on the faction's future. But he said of [word 
indistinct] a gradually shrinking force of just 8,000 armed men, 
fewer even than last year. The Khmer Rouge is a diminishing 
force, he says, with no credibility at all in a wider Cambodian 
population. With the economy picking up that now seems true, 
but observers warned supply routes into Thailand will allow the 
guerrillas to survive at a low-level harassment for many years.

  [Text] Unemployment in Australia has fallen to 10.3 
percent, prompting a government prediction that the rate would 
end at 10 percent by the end of the year. Linda Mottram reports 
the March figure is the lowest since November 1991, down from 
10.5 percent in February: 
  [Begin recording] [Mottram] Driving the continued fall is 
seven consecutive months of employment growth. Seven thousand 
more jobs were created in March, but they were part-time rather 
than full-time positions. But the government is very encouraged 
by the figures overall. Federal Employment Minister Simon Crean 
predicted the jobless rate would be below 10 percent by the end 
of this year, disputing OECD claims that the jobless rate would 
remain in double digits for two more years. 
  [Crean] The figures show that we have done better than what 
the OECD suggests. I believe we can get below that figure in 
the not-too-distant future, but it will only happen with the 
continued strong economic growth. 
  [Mottram] The federal opposition also welcomes the lower 
number of jobless, but opposition leader John Hewson maintains 
the country is locked into 10 percent-plus unemployment. 
  [Hewson] We are concerned that it seems the improvement in 
the labor market seems to be slowing and we are now left with a 
situation. We've still got over 900,000 people without paying 
jobs and over 50 percent, or about 50 percent, are those who are 
long-term unemployed. [end recording]

  [Text] The American commander in the Pacific, Admiral 
Charles Larson, has declared New Zealand a friend and ally of 
the United States, saying bilateral relations are improving. 
  Admiral Larson, who made his comments in Wellington, is the 
first senior American military official to visit New Zealand in 
almost 10 years. In that time New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear 
laws, which the Admiral said remained a barrier to military 
exercises between the two countries. But he added, the 
objective of his visit was to begin a dialogue and lay out a 
framework for common interests. 
  The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, told reporters 
that most of his discussions with Admiral Larson had centered on 
peacekeeping around the world. 
  Relations between New Zealand and the United States 
deteriorated in the mid 1980s after the adoption of the 
anti-nuclear laws. The American president at the time, Ronald 
Reagan, prohibited military contacts and all exchanges between 
senior officials, but earlier this year President Bill Clinton 
announced the restoration of high-level contacts.

  [Text] Majuro, April 12 (AFP) - President Amata Kabua 
reshuffled his cabinet Tuesday, replacing his veteran foreign 
minister, Tom Kijiner. 
  Kabua announced the changes without any comment, saying that 
Kijiner would immediately become minister of health and 
environment while the existing education minister, Phillip 
Muller, becomes the new foreign minister. Evelyn Konou leaves 
health to take over education. 
  Kijiner has been foreign minister since 1988 and presided 
over a period of tremendous diplomatic activity as the country 
moved from US control into independence. He opened missions at 
the United Nations, Fiji, China and Japan as well as consulates 
in California and Hong Kong. 
  Muller has been education minister since 1986 and has played 
a key role in revamping the ailing public school system with 8 
million US dollars from the Asian Development Bank. 
  Konou, the only woman in parliament, has been health 
minister 
since last year.

  [Text] Wellington, April 13 (AFP) -- New Zealand will 
maintain its ban on nuclear-powered and -armed ships from its 
ports, despite high-level U.S. urging for a change of policy, 
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Wednesday. 
  He told Radio N@w Zealand a change in the ban was "not an 
agenda item". 
  On Tuesday Bolger met with the commander of US Pacific 
forces, Admiral Charles Larson, the first time in nearly a 
decade that such a high-ranked military figure has been here. 
  After meeting with Bolger he urged New Zealand to re-think 
its anti-nuclear stance and consider the benefits of resuming 
full military ties. 
  New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear laws in 1985 which the U.S. 
says prevents their ships coming here and has resulted in 
Wellington being frozen out of the Anzus (Australia, New Zealand 
and U.S.) Pact. 
  President Ronald Reagan prohibited military contacts and all 
exchanges between high officials but last November Pres@dent 
Bill Clinton called for a resumption of ties on "a more normal 
basis". 
  Bolger welcomed Larson's recognition that the two countries 
had reached different views on the nuclear issue by following 
democratic processes. 
  It was a U.S. decision to withdraw high-level military 
contacts with New Zealand following introduction of the nuclear 
policy in 1986. 
  New Zealand hoped the U.S. would reflect on that decision 
and 
there would be a greater degree of cooperation in future. 
  "What we're getting now, I think, is an important opening up 
of discussion and that's what I welcome in the visit of Admiral 
Larson," he said. 
  Although a New Zealand government commissioned study had 
found nuclear propulsion was safe, the public was not willing to 
accept such ships. 
  "Clearly if New Zealand was to change its propulsion laws 
that would be quite significant in terms of U.S. attitudes, but 
at the moment the New Zealand parliament is not about to do 
that," Bolger said. 
  The political issue had changed a lot over the past decade, 
Bolger said. 
  The Cold War had ended and nuclear weapons and testing had 
been reduced. 
  He was "quite comfortable" with New Zealand's current 
policy. 
"It's exactly where the public at large want the policy to be." 
  New Zealanders had told the United States they wanted to 
work 
along their own route. 
  "That's been a little difficult for some people but that's 
where the New Zealand public is. And as I say it's not an agenda 
item in New Zealand at the present time," he said. 
  "What I think is an agenda item is how we can co-operate and 
work through with others." 
  New Zealand had a close defence relationship with Australia 
and had worked in a peacekeeping role with the U.S. in theatres 
of conflict like the Gulf War and Bosnia. New Zealand defence 
forces were becoming increasingly involved with peacekeeping of 
a higher risk than in the past. 
  "I think New Zealanders would accept that and say that's the 
defence responsibility New Zealand can and should take up," he 
said.

  [Text] Wellington, April 12 (AFP) -- New Zealand appears to 
have engaged in some form of spying on India, a cryptic entry in 
a the diary of an army officer lost here reveals, the EVENING 
POST reported here Tuesday. 
  The bulky, black-leather Filofax, owned by Major Scott 
Turner 
who is assistant director of electronic warfare in the Ministry 
of Defence, was leaked to various media outlets after it was 
found in long grass last week. 
  The POST said the man who found the Filofax, identified only 
as Mike, had decided to release the diary after he saw what it 
contained. 
  "This is public information. It is important this be 
released because we spend millions of dollars on the 
organisation this guy works for and it suggests we spy on people 
we consider our allies like India," "Mike" said. One Filofax 
entry, under the heading RNZN (apparently a reference to the 
Royal New Zealand Navy), says: "Indian photos [word indistinct] 
DSD get them." The POST suggested that this entry disclosed 
some espionage operation against India. It interpreted DSD to 
mean the Australian Defence Signals Directorate. 
  The Filofax includes a diary, work plans for 1994, duties' 
lists, notes of meetings with others in the New Zealand 
intelligence community, four used train tickets, two business 
cards and details of the officer's recent purchase of a house. 
  Contents of the Filofax show Turner was coordinating with 
the 
secret Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), which 
runs two large electronic listening bases linked into Australia, 
Britain and the US. 
  There are also references such as "Tropic Twilight -- Cook 
Islands Aug-Sep, Intercept range upgrade 2MHz - GHz" as well as 
some action regarding tensions between Papua New Guinea [PNG] 
and the Solomons over Bougainville, a PNG province affected by 
civil war. 
  Defence spokesman John Seward said Tuesday the owner was 
getting legal advice "and will seek police assistance to get it 
back". 
  Seward said electronic warfare was not spying and the 
Filofax 
was "not in itself a classified document. 
  "Electronic warfare is a long-established legitimate and 
widely known part of military operations." 
  Seward said the Filofax was the personal diary of a staff 
officer although he said he believed it was unusual for a staff 
officer to record classified acronyms in a personal book.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Khmer Rouge (KR)guerrillas last 
night managed to retake Pailin from Phnom Penh troops after a 
heavy battle with government forces. 
  Military sources at the border said the Khmer Rouge forces 
had seized Highway Nos. 10 and 5 which were the main supply 
lines for the government troops to Pailin from Battambang and 
Banteay Meanchey before moving into Pailin yesterday evening. 
  Details of the fighting remained sketchy last night. But the 
sources claimed the Phnom Penh force suffered heavy casualties 
and damage from the assault by the guerrillas. 
  Several government tanks were seized by the guerrillas as 
ground troops were sent in "disarray" by the attacks, the 
sources claimed. 
  Thai military officers claimed last night at least 15 Phnom 
Penh soldiers fled across the border into Ban Phakkat of 
Chanthaburi's Pong Namron district last night. 
  [Bangkok THE NATION in English on 13 April carries a report 
on page 1 that adds: "Sixteen Cambodian government soldiers 
were among a group of Cambodian border residents driven into the 
Thai soil after fighting in Pailin yesterday, prompting rumours 
that the gem- rich town in western Cambodia might have been 
recaptured by the Khmer Rouge. 
  ["The Thai military could not immediately confirm border 
sources' reports that most of the soldiers, who crossed into 
Thailand's Chanthaburi province, were senior officers. 
  ["The sources reported heavy fighting around Pailin over the 
past week. 
  ["`The fact that senior Phnom Penh army officers fled to 
Thailand indicates that the Khmer Rouge have made significant 
advance or even have recaptured the town,' the communist 
faction's biggest headquarters, one source said. 
  ["Army sources said they could not immediately confirm the 
border reports, but noted that Phnom Penh forces in Pailin had 
faced serious logistic problems because food supplies could be 
sent only by airborne methods."]

  [Excerpt] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia is opposing industrial 
countries' efforts to link trade with labor conditions in the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that will be 
signed in Morocco next week. 
  "Indonesia, like other developing countries, is concerned 
over efforts to link trade and labor, which will be 
counter-productive," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters 
here yesterday. 
  The United States and France have agreed to push for clauses 
on labor conditions to be included in the planned trade 
agreement, which will be finalized at a formal meeting of GATT 
ambassadors at their April 12-15 meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. 
  "The efforts are not productive because they are forced 
while 
the Marrakesh meeting is expected to merely endorse what has 
thus far been achieved," Alatas said. 
  He said the meeting should only clean up the text of the 
December agreement, instead of introducing additional clauses. 
[Passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Finance Mar'ie Mohmmad 
gave assurances yesterday that the government will not devalue 
the rupiah or take other radical steps to offset the deficit 
caused by the fall in oil prices, which is likely to continue to 
be a problem this fiscal year. 
  "There will be no drastic measure to stabilize the monetary 
system," the minister told newsmen following a meeting with 
President Suharto at Bina Graha [Presidential office]. 
  He acknowledged that faltering oil prices will affect the 
state budget, but he said that the government is prepared to 
handle shortfalls in revenue from the oil and gas sectors. 
  The government's budget expects Rp [rupiah] 12.85 trillion 
(US$6.11 billion from oil and gas, which is to account for 18.5 
percent of estimated total state revenue of Rp 69.74 trillion 
($33.2 billion). 
  The estimate on the receipts from oil and gas is based on an 
average oil price of $16 per barrel, far higher than the actual 
price which is currently fluctuating between $13 and $14 a 
barrel. 
  Oil experts see no end to the glut in sight, with some 
predicting that oil will drop as far as $10 per barrel. 
  Mar'ie said that a devaluation had been discussed with the 
Budgetary Commission of the House of Representatives (DPR), but 
firmly rejected it as an option. 
  Mar'ie's statement on the government's resolve to stay the 
course has been repeated several times to reassure those left 
gun shy by the actions of former finance minister J.B. Sumarlin. 
  These included the 45-percent rupiah devaluation in 
September 
1986, in order to handle falls in state revenues from oil and 
gas, and the withdrawal of Rp 10 trillion (US$5 billion) from 
the accounts of state-owned companies in 1990 to push down 
inflation. 
  Mar'ie said yesterday that the government will reduce 
spending or draw from its reserves if a deficit is run again. 
  The government has set aside around Rp 3.5 trillion ($1.6 
trillion) in budgetary reserves for emergency purposes. Part of 
this will be used to offset last year's Rp 1.8 trillion deficit. 
  "We could use the reserves again if the state revenues in 
the 
current fiscal year do not meet the current projection," the 
minister said. 
  Meanwhile Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance 
Saleh 
Afiff said yesterday that the government will not change its 
policy on commercial offshore loans. 
  "There will be no change in the government's monetary 
policies, including that on the control of the inflow of 
commercial offshore borrowing," he told newsmen following a 
ministerial meeting on the economy at his office. 
  Affif said the strict control of commenercial loans is 
essential to maintain the balance of payment at a safe level. 
  The government-set annual ceiling on offshore commercial 
loans of about $5.6 billion to $6.5 billion applies until the 
next fiscal year. 
  The ceilings on foreign loans to the central bank, state 
banks and private banks are set at $500 million, $1 billion and 
$500 million a year respectively. 
  Private companies under the existing ceilings are allowed to 
borrow up to $2.8 billion from foreign creditors in this fiscal 
year and up to $2.9 billion in 1995-96, while state companies 
may borrow up to $1.4 billion in 1994-1995 and up to 1.6 billion 
in 1995-96.

  [Text] Leading Malaysian journalist has criticized what he 
called the highhandedness of his country's enforcement agencies 
dealing with immigrants. Kadir Jasin, editor of Malaysia's 
influential NEW STRAITS TIMES, was referring in its Sunday 
weekly column to the roundup by Malaysian police on Palm Sunday 
of more than 1,000 Filipino maids in front of a Catholic church 
in Kuala Lumpur. In his column, Kadir said he did not think 
many Malaysians were pleased by the highhandedness by 
enforcement agencies in the operations against foreigners. 
  In the operations, 711 Filipino maids were detained. All but 
33 of them were later released after their employers produced 
their work permits. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin 
Mohamed directed authorities, including the police, to exercise 
greater care when carrying raids of suspected illegal workers in 
places of worship. As this developed, Prime Minister Mahathir 
is reported sending to Manila a personal emissary to meet with 
President Ramos on the Palm Sunday arrest. 
  Meantime, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto 
Romulo 
says the Philippine Government has reached what he called a 
meeting of the minds with Malaysia on how to cool down the 
dispute. Romulo said he and the Malaysian Foreign Minister 
Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi have agreed to discuss the matter 
in a joint commission set up last year. That commission carries 
the task of improving bilateral relations chilled by a 
30-year-old Philippine claim of Malaysia's Sabah State. 
  Speaking of Sabah, President Ramos has evaded making a 
direct 
response to a proposal raised in Congress for the revival of the 
country's claim to Sabah. Speaking to reporters in Cebu in the 
Visayas, the president said Malacanang [presidential office] 
will issue a statement today on its position on the proposal. 
Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo presented a proposal the other 
day asking President Ramos to again assert the Philippines' 
territorial claim of Sabah. Arroyo made the proposal shortly 
after Senator Ernesto Herrera suggested that the Philippine 
Government withdraws its invitation to Malaysia's ceremonial 
king to visit Manila beginning this Thursday to Saturday.

be able to hold peace talks in Jakarta, Indonesia next week. 
The talks were originally scheduled for May, but the two sides 
are hoping to hold them earlier than scheduled. 
  However, the Indonesian Government informed Philippine panel 
member Eduardo Ermita that it cannot adequately handle the talks 
because Indonesia will be hosting a number of international 
meetings this month.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday urged Phnom Penh to settle any misunderstandings along 
the border with Thailand through diplomatic channels, not the 
media as this might worsen the situation. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also warned that Thais' 
patience with the Cambodian accusations was wearing thin. 
  "We've been patient over the allegations for some time. The 
Cambodians should know that. I have no problem maintaining my 
patience but the people may not be able to do so," said Sqn Ldr 
Prasong. 
  The army commander said allegations by senior Phnom Penh 
officials should be backed with substantiated evidence. 
  "Anyone who condemns us should have evidence to back their 
claims," he said. 
  Gen Wimol said diplomatic channels should be used to settle 
disputes, not the Press as it sometimes distorts the facts and 
helps deteriorate the situation. 
  Phnom Penh Co-Premier Prince Norodom Rannaridh has accused 
the Thai military of assisting Khmer Rouge forces during recent 
fighting in Pailin. The military denies the allegation. 
  The army commander said if Phnom Penh had evidence to 
substantiate its claim, it should be handed over through 
government representatives so the problem could be solved. 
  He said the military had said on several occasions that it 
was not involved in the internal conflict in Cambodia between 
the Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh forces. 
  He also said international press agencies sometimes have 
ulterior motives against the army and "intended to destroy our 
credibility". 
  Gen Wimon said it was in the interests of Thailand, as a 
neighbour to Cambodia, to see permanent peace restored. 
  He asked that the public not be misled by international 
press 
reports. 
  The Thai military has closely observed UN resolutions and 
played a key role in establishing peace in that country. 
  Gen Wimon's comments follow a re cent United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees' protest over the Thai military's 
repatriation of Khmer refugees following the fall of the Khmer 
Rouge stronghold at Pailin earlier this month. He said the UNHCR 
had always tried to dictate what Thailand should do. 
  "But I'd like to ask the person who represents the UNHCR if 
his country is willing to accept the Cambodian refugees if his 
country is asked to do so," he said. 
  Thailand has always cooperated wi1h the UN and assigned 
troops as part of UN peace-keeping forces in Cambodia, he said. 
  Gen Wimon said the Thai military was bitter when it was told 
by the UN it had no money to pay for Thai soldiers. This meant 
the cost had to be borne by the Thai Government. 
  Thai soldiers have never created problems for Cambodia. They 
wanted to see the people there live in peace and prosper like 
other nations, he said. 
  The Army chief said the military would take tough action 
against border violations by "uniformed" Cambodian bandits who 
cross into Thailand to steal from villagers.

  [Text] The Thai-Cambodia border at Aranyaprathet district 
in Sa Kaeo province has been closed indefinitely in order to 
protect the safety of Thai citizens, National Security Council 
[NSC] secretary-general Charan Kunlawanit said yesterday. 
  Gen Charan said the action was taken because of a spate of 
recent incidents that included the torching of a border market, 
stray shells landing on the Thai side of the border and armed 
robberies staged against Thai villagers by Khmer bandits. 
  "These are dangerous incidents and to prevent such threats 
to 
our people we have closed the border for an indefinite period of 
time," Gen Charan said. 
  He did not say when the border, closed since April 5, would 
be reopened. 
  Commenting on why the Thai authorities are taking action 
only 
when such incidents frequently recur, Gen Charan said: "The 
truth is that the fighting in Cambodia has caused damage and 
hardship to Thai people. Their livestock have also been killed 
or wounded by stray Khmer artillery shells. 
  "But we have not complained and the world community does not 
know how we suffer. And when the Khmer people are in hardship, 
they run over to take refuge here. We helped them without 
asking for assistance. Those that are criticising us should 
look at themselves to see if they are doing the right thing." 
  Gen Charan said that closing the border was an attempt to 
save Thai lives and reorganise regulations so that officials can 
better look after the border area and reduce the danger faced by 
Thai villagers. 
  Commenting on the Cambodian complaint that the border 
closure 
was harming them economically, Gen Charan said: "We have been 
helping Cambodia since 1975. That's 20 years already and we 
have never asked for anything back. It's normal that the 
closure of the border would have some effect. Those who used to 
have it good will start to realise what the situation really is. 
  "We insist that the closure of the border is necessary so 
that we can reorganise law and order in the area to ensure 
safety." 
  Commenting on the intentions of Cambodian government leaders 
who repeatedly accuse Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge, Gen 
Charan said that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had talked to the 
Cambodian leaders, including the Khmer foreign minister, about 
discussing problems through existing proper channels. 
  "However, the Cambodian Government has never contacted the 
Thai Government through these channels when problems arise. 
Given the good relations between the two countries the 
Cambodians should not be saying anything to Thailand through a 
third party -- the international wire agencies." 
  Gen Charan, however, said he did not believe agency reports 
quoting Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh during 
his trip to Malaysia that Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge escape 
government attacks on Pailin. 
  During the interview the prince also called on Malaysia to 
help persuade Thailand to allegedly give up supporting the 
genocidal Khmer Rouge. 
  "I am sure the Cambodian leader did not say that and would 
have kept the promise he made to our prime minister when he 
officially visited Cambodia on January 12," Gen Charan said. 
  He added: "If the prince really criticised us in Malaysia, 
our friend would have told us. But this is just news and we 
honour the Cambodian leader as a gentleman and an intelligent 
person." 
  Gen Charan said because Thailand had never complained about 
stray Khmer shells falling in Thailand, the world community 
appears ready to believe allegations of Thai support for the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  "Why should Thailand be so stupid as to support the Khmer 
Rouge since we have always wanted to see peace in Cambodia for 
the past 20 years? Those saying this are not using their brains 
before speaking out." 
  He said that when Thailand enquires about reported comments 
made by the Cambodian Government, Phnom Penh "never says 
anything". 
  Asked if Cambodia was making Khmer Rouge allegations against 
Thailand to get international attention and win further aid 
development, Gen Charan said that he did not want to answer this 
question. 
  "I think the world community is more interested in peace 
rather than seeing them kill each other," Gen Charan said. He 
said the issue of Cambodia's allegations against Thailand may be 
discussed at the next meeting of the National Security Council.

<F P=106> [By Richard Valladares] </F>
  [Text] The yen for a quick buck is driving South Asian 
job-seekers to Bangkok and then on to a Japan awash with cash 
despite the recession worldwide. 
  Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans are all 
flocking into the City of Angels to buy their way to the land of 
the rising sun, a South Asian diplomat said. 
  Bangkok is a popular transit point for the would-be 
immigrants to gather the know-how, material and connections 
required to bluff their way through Japan's ever-tightening 
screening procedures and immigration laws. 
  Hundreds of these South Asians leave here armed with fake or 
tampered passports, forged immigration papers and dreams of 
wealth. 
  Rackets are run by organized gangs who charge the eager job- 
seekers fees amounting to a couple of thousand dollars. 
  With opportunities drying up and salaries not what they used 
to be in the Gulf, Japan is now emerging as the new mecca for 
the illegal immigrants. 
  The scam involves forging passports, Japanese visas and work 
permits and even crash courses in Japanese, according to some 
reports. 
  Of course, the rates rise considerably for each 'extra' 
service. 
  Some clients opt to fly to a third country and then enter 
Japan in the hope of avoiding the extra scrutiny by Japanese 
immigration officials reserved for residents of some countries. 
  Clients are put up in Bangkok hotels and houses owned by the 
agents and are looked after till all arrangements are completed 
for their departure. 
  "Once in Japan, finding work is easy. Construction sites and 
small factories are our best bet. 
  "The hitch is that for the duration of our stay there we 
have 
to remain on the site. No contact with people outside is 
possible," said a Tamilian who refused to say if he was Indian 
or Sri Lankan. 
  "I have set myself a target and hope to achieve it within a 
year. We have to make a lot of sacrifices, but it's worth it," 
he said. 
  Then, how do these people get out once they've achieved 
their 
goal? "It's really simple. We just come out into the open and 
within a week were are arrested as illegal immigrants. The good 
thing with the Japanese is that they deport us as soon as they 
can, avoiding lengthy jail terms," said another first-timer. 
  "Most first-timers go the way we are going. It's only after 
a person has made some money that they come back and use the 
agents to get them fresh documents since they've been 
blacklisted in Japan," said Mohan [as published]. 
  The Thai police arrested a number of potential immigrants 
from India and Sri Lanka as the group waited at a Bangkok 
residence prior to boarding a flight for a third country. 
  Most of the arrested Indians were from Punjab. 
  Recently, six Sri Lankans believed to be part of a gang 
counterfeiting passports after illegally entering Thailand were 
arrested in their hotel rooms in Bangkok, the Tourist Police 
said. 
  Two Singaporean, five Dutch and six Sri Lankan fake 
passports 
were found. Police said the Dutch and Singaporean passports 
sold for US$8,000 while the Sri Lankan documents fetched up to 
US$4,000. 
  The clients were mainly Sri Lankan's wishing to travel to 
the 
United States, France or Japan, according to news reports. 
  Another sophisticated method employed by the agents is 
through the substitution of the original photographs on genuine 
Indian passports carrying proper Japanese visas with mug-shots 
of the clients. 
  The original passports fetch between US$1,200 and US$4,000 
depending on the expiry date, the amount the original owner has 
travelled and a number of other factors which help in 
authenticating the new owner. 
  Sources in the business claim that an average of 200 Indian 
passports are lost each month. 
  The migrants who sell their passports then reportedly 
approach the Indian mission in Bangkok for a replacement, 
claiming that they have lost them. 
  Passports for sale are "prepared" for a wide range of age 
groups and are carefully selected and scrutinized to match the 
needs of the clients. 
  A few years ago, the Thai police with the help of Interpol 
officials from India raided several of these fake passport 
outlets in Bangkok's Phahurat district. 
  At that time the agents were sending clients to what used to 
be West Germany on specially chartered flights through the 
former East Germany. 
  The immigrants disembarking in East Berlin would make their 
way to West Berlin using their fake papers to get away as "legal 
immigrants". Following the reunification of Germany, Poland, 
Hungary and Russia became the new European transit points. 
  But, now with the stringent screening measures adopted for 
asylum seekers to Germany and the strict vigil on all her 
borders, this operation has become extremely risky and unviable. 
  Besides, immigrants from developing nations all over Asia 
are 
discovering that Japan offers much better returns, dollarwise, 
for the same investment in agents and the risk of getting caught 
and deported. 
  Japan currently has an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants 
from the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. 
  However, South Asians, along with illegals from Iran, 
Afghanistan and other Third World nations are now joining the 
immigration queues at Japanese airports in their quest for quick 
money.

  [Text] Yokosuka, Kanagawa Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The 
reactors of two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines may have 
had repair work done in Japan in January in spite of a bilateral 
agreement ruling out such activities, an anti-U.S. base citizens 
group said Monday [11 April]. 
  The Holland, a 10,500-ton U.S. tender for nuclear-powered 
submarines, called at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, 
Kanagawa Prefecture, for about a month from January 11, 
according to the citizens group, the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) coalition of Japan. 
  During the period, two U.S. nuclear-powered attack 
submarines 
-- the Tunny and the New York City -- also stopped at the base, 
group members said. 
  The group said base employees witnessed in mid-January 
several repair engineers from the Holland enter into reactor and 
weapons zones within the submarines. The zones are off-limits 
to Japanese. 
  The group members said the tender and the submarines stopped 
at the base at the same time apparently because the war ships' 
reactors needed repairs. The Holland was designed to provide 
repair and supply services for submarines. 
  A memorandum between Japan and the U.S. stipulates that 
power 
equipment of U.S. submarines will not be repaired in Japan. 
  A U.S. Navy commander in Japan said that the Holland 
conducted "a routine port visit in conjunction with her current 
deployment to the western Pacific." 
  Yokosuka city officials said that based on the Japan-U.S. 
memorandum it does not believe nuclear-related repair work was 
done. 
  Shoji Shimizu, leader of the NEPA coalition, said the port 
call by the Holland may indicate future plans to have U.S. 
submarines repaired in Yokosuka.

  [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- The head of the UN 
nuclear monitoring agency, Hans Blix, on Wednesday urged the 
early completion of nuclear safeguards inspections in North 
Korea that a team of inspectors was prevented from concluding 
last month. 
  Blix, director general of the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stressed that it is necessary to 
check a radio chemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear power 
complex about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang and a 
5,000-kilowatt experimental reactor to complete the inspections. 
  Blix is in Hiroshima for the annual meeting of the Japan 
Atomic Industrial Forum, which this year is focusing on the 
theme of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide and promoting the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
  IAEA inspectors were allowed in North Korea last month for 
their first look at North Korean nuclear facilities in more than 
a year in an effort to determine if radioactive materials had 
been diverted to military purposes. 
  Blix told reporters Wednesday that a check of the radio 
chemical laboratory was necessary to determine if it had been 
used since February 1993. 
  Blix also said that North Korea is nearing completion on 
construction of a second plutonium production line, which could 
double the North Korean output of the material needed in 
building an atomic bomb.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa urged the ruling coalition partners on Wednesday to 
reconcile their differences on four key policy fields, including 
Japan's policy toward the suspected North Korean nuclear arms 
program. 
  Ozawa told a news conference that the coalition parties, in 
launching a new administration, need to narrow their difference 
over the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's tax system reform, 
basic defense and foreign policies, as well as administrative 
reform combined with deregulation. 
  Ozawa made the remarks a day after Shinseito head and 
Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata emerged as the most probable successor to 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation 
last Friday. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is regarded 
as the de facto top leader of the party. 
  Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is 
tipped to become chief cabinet secretary under Hata. 
  Ozawa has been advocating a tougher stand over North Korea's 
refusal to let international monitors fully inspect its nuclear 
facilities. 
  The SDP, the biggest party in the ruling coalition, has 
called for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through 
dialogue, rather than slapping economic sanctions on Pyongyang. 
  The SDP has maintained friendly ties with North Korea and 
has 
sent goodwill delegations of its legislators there in the past.

  [Text] Singapore, April 9 KYODO -- Japan on Saturday [9 
April] acceded to Singapore's request to retain until the year 
2000 a tax privilege that Japan grants to developing countries, 
although the island republic is now Southeast Asia's most 
developed economy. 
  Under a taxation agreement signed by officials from the two 
countries here on Saturday, most Japanese companies operating in 
the island republic will continue to be exempted from taxation 
on their profits both in Singapore and Japan. 
  Currently, most Japanese companies here are exempted from 
paying corporate tax because Singapore has offered tax 
concessions to attract foreign companies to set up businesses in 
the country. 
  These companies also do not pay tax in Japan because 
Japanese 
tax authorities view them as having paid tax in Singapore -- a 
privilege Japan normally grants only to developing countries to 
help them lure much-needed foreign investments to build up their 
economies. 
  Japan and Singapore first signed the agreement in January 
1971 when Singapore was struggling to reverse its 
poverty-afflicted status after independence from the British in 
1965. 
  With the island republic now enjoying a per capita income of 
more than 21,271 Singapore dollars (13,548 U.S. dollars), 
sources said Japan asked to revise the agreement in the hope of 
ending the tax privilege earlier. But Japan gave in to 
Singapore's request to keep the agreement during the 
negotiations. 
  The revised agreement -- which prevents double taxation and 
fiscal evasion -- was signed by Japan's Ambassador to Singapore 
Tomoya Kawamura and Koh Yong Guan, Singapore's commissioner of 
inland revenue. 
  In a statement issued Saturday, Singapore's inland revenue 
authority did not elaborate on the tax privilege, referring to 
it only as "continuation of the existing tax sparing provision 
for income" until the year 2000. 
  It also said the new agreement will "further facilitate the 
cross flow of trade, investment, financial activity and 
technical know-how between Singapore and Japan."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Denmark's Foreign Minister 
Niels Petersen on Friday [8 April] indirectly expressed support 
for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United 
Nations Security Council, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Petersen agreed with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in a 
dinner meeting on the need to reorganize the Security Council, 
the officials said. 
  Petersen, who arrived in Japan Thursday on a four-day visit, 
was quoted as saying it is necessary to reorganize the council 
to "reflect reality." 
  In talks which covered a wide range of topics, Hata told 
Petersen Japan is very concerned about North Korea's alleged 
development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  Hata and Petersen agreed it is necessary to seek a solution 
to the problem through dialogue instead of placing pressure on 
North Korea, they said. 
  On trade, Petersen said European nations are concerned that 
Japan and the United States might reach a bilateral agreement 
from which other nations might not benefit. 
  He called on Japan to keep other nations informed of the 
results of negotiations with the U.S., they said. 
  Petersen is to leave Japan on Sunday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba 
Corp. have pulled out of the European microwave oven market due 
to sluggish demand and will focus on the audiovisual equipment 
market there, spokesmen for the companies said Tuesday [12 
April]. 
  A spokesman for Hitachi said the company's British 
subsidiary 
stopped production of microwave ovens last fall and has wiped 
out inventories by late March. 
  Hitachi Consumer Products UK Ltd. began production of 
microwave ovens in 1987 for sale in Britain and its output 
peaked in 1988 at 100,000 units but fell to 10,000 in 1993, the 
spokesman said. 
  The subsidiary's main products are television sets and 
videocassette recorders and it will concentrate on these, he 
said. 
  Sales of microwave ovens account for less than 10 percent of 
total sales of the British subsidiary, the spokesman said. 
  A spokesman for Toshiba said the company in February sold 
its 
equity stake of some 33 percent in a microwave oven joint 
venture in France to its joint venture partners, AEG Hausgerate 
AG of Germany and TEM Electromenager of Italy. 
  The spokesman cited sluggish sales of microwave ovens and a 
company strategy in Europe of focusing on the audiovisual 
equipment market as factors behind the move. 
  The French joint venture, Compagnie Europeenne Pour La 
Fabrication D'Enceintes a Micro-Onde (CEFEM), was established in 
January 1986 under equal equity partnership by Toshiba and the 
two other companies. 
  CEFEM's production peaked in 1988 at some 220,000 units, but 
had plunged to some 100,000 by 1993 due to increased 
competition, the spokesman said.

  [Text] New York, April 8 KYODO -- Japan's deputy 
ambassador to the United Nations said Friday [8 April] that the 
UN should abolish the "enemy clause" in its charter, which 
alludes to such countries as Japan and Germany as enemy states. 
  Shunji Maruyama, addressing a working-group meeting to 
reform 
the UN Security Council, said the clause shows part of the 
chapter is outdated. 
  In Article 53 and Article 107, the charter states that 
enforcement action can be taken against any "enemy state" 
without the authorization of the Security Council. 
  "Enemy" states refer to countries that lost World War II -- 
Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan and Romania. 
  Japan has strongly urged scrapping the clause. Germany has 
made no such a demand, saying it is already a de facto dead 
clause.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
decided Friday [8 April] to send 15 election observers to El 
Salvador again as part of a UN peacekeeping mission, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said. 
  The decision came after no candidate was able to win the 
necessary majority of votes to fill the offices of president and 
vice president in the March 20 elections, resulting in another 
election set for April 24 to pick the nation's two top leaders, 
the chief government spokesman told reporters. 
  Japan sent a 15-member team to monitor the last polls in the 
central American country. The Japanese observers returned home 
on March 25. 
  Tokyo will again dispatch 15 election monitors to El 
Salvador 
for about a 10-day stay, a government official said. 
  Most of the participants will be picked from those taking 
part in the last mission, the official said. 
  El Salvador is the third country to which Japan has sent 
election observers in accordance with the UN Peacekeeping 
Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.

  [Text] Yokosuka, Yokosuka Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The 
Maritime Safety Agency asked prosecutors Monday [11 April] to 
file charges against three Japanese fishing companies for 
allegedly poaching 2,000 tons of bonito and tuna worth more than 
1.5 billion yen in the southern Pacific Ocean, agency officials 
said. 
  It is the most serious case of illegal fishing yet exposed 
by 
the agency. 
  Longline fishing fleets of Sasashima Gyogyo of Nakaminato, 
Ibaraki Prefecture, and the two other companies are suspected of 
having caught the fish without proper permits off Ecuador and 
Colombia between 1991 and 1993. 
  The agency said the companies had violated Japan's fisheries 
law. 
  The five suspects involved in the case include the owner of 
Sasashima Gyogyo, Toshimasa Sasashima, 51. 
  From Central America, the tuna and bonito hauls were 
allegedly shipped to Japan by freighter and sold for a total of 
1.56 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Japanese local 
governments' international contributions are mainly oriented to 
Asian countries in such fields as technical assistance and 
trainee programs, a Home Affairs Ministry survey revealed 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  The survey was conducted last fall on Japan's 47 prefectures 
and the 12 ordinance-designated cities. 
  Of the 59 local governments surveyed, nine said they are 
"very active" and another 40 said they are "active" in 
contributing abroad, ministry officials said. 
  Among types of contribution under consideration, 51 local 
governments said acceptance of trainees takes priority and 44 
respondents said dispatch of experts has precedence, the 
officials said. 
  Financial assistance and material aid had only low 
priorities, they said. 
  Allowing for plural answers, a total of 85 local governments 
cited Asia as the region they want to help, they said. Of 
these, 40 respondents would make contributions to their sister 
cities, 26 to regions needing technical know-how, 20 to areas 
where there are many residents of Japanese origin and 28 to 
China, they said. 
  About fields where local governments can make contributions, 
46 said agricultural techniques, 41 said industrial techniques 
and 37 said health and welfare, they said. Other responses 
included fishery techniques, forestry techniques and prevention 
of pollution. 
  Nineteen local governments said they have some knowledge of 
what foreign countries need but 39 respondents said they have 
insufficient knowledge. 
  Thirty-one said the purpose of such contributions is to 
activate the prefecture or the city, 25 to contribute to world 
peace and 12 to educate staff, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of 
the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), 
said Monday [11 April] he hopes another reformist government 
will take over from outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "It is desirable that a government which will get the budget 
through the Diet and carry on political, economic and 
administrative reforms will be installed," he told a news 
conference. 
  He warned that Japan will not be able to discharge its 
duties 
in the international arena unless the government carries out 
reforms. 
  Hiraiwa said it is extremely difficult to single out 
Hosokawa's successor at this stage but the selection must be 
made within a few days. 
  Hosokawa announced in a nationally televised news conference 
Friday he will resign as prime minister to take responsibility 
for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal finances. 
  The standstill has held up the enactment of the national 
budget for fiscal 1994 which began April 1. 
  Hiraiwa said he has given high marks to the Hosokawa 
government's efforts for political reform.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the most likely 
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as the 
ruling coalition reached a last-minute compromise late Tuesday 
[12 April] to avert a collapse, coalition sources said. 
  Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to 
meet Wednesday to confirm their unity and hammer out policies 
for a new government. 
  The coalition may agree to nominate Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of its biggest group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
as new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as chief spokesman 
and chief of staff for the prime minister, the sources said. 
  Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new prime 
minister early next week after Hata returns home from an 
international trade meeting in Morocco, they said. 
  Hata, who is the head of Shinseito, widely regarded as the 
coalition's driving force, is tentatively scheduled to leave 
Tokyo on Wednesday and return home Sunday. 
  The heads of three of the seven parties in the 
eight-month-old coalition -- the SDP, new party Sakigake and the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- met late Tuesday to discuss 
the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, who announced his 
resignation last Friday. 
  During the meeting, SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama told DSP 
chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that 
a plan has emerged to pick Hata as prime minister and Kubo as 
chief cabinet secretary, coalition sources said. 
  Hata told a news conference Tuesday night that he places 
importance on maintaining the framework of the coalition. 
  "During the past eight months, each of us was in a hard 
position but could settle difficult problems," Hata said. 
  The coalition's compromise followed several rounds of secret 
talks between Murayama and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, a key coalition strategist, political sources said. 
  Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of leaving 
the main opposition party and running for the premiership, LDP 
sources said. 
  His decision followed the coalition agreement to maintain 
unity. 
  Watanabe has failed to garner a sufficient number of 
supporters from among LDP members, the sources said. 
  After attending Tuesday's meeting of representatives of 
coalition components, SDP Secretary General Kubo said, "I'm 
pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and develop 
our coalition government." 
  Shinseito's Ozawa told reporters, "everything is going in 
the 
right direction." 
  The coalition had been on the brink of collapse, as 
divisions 
among the parties deepened after Hosokawa abruptly announced his 
resignation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- New party Sakigake, led by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, will remain in the 
ruling coalition, a senior party official said Wednesday [13 
April]. 
  There may remain "an unpleasant feeling" between Sakigake 
and 
Shinseito, however, said the official, who spoke to reporters on 
condition of anonymity. Shinseito is regarded as the most 
influential force in the seven-party coalition. 
  Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister 
and 
foreign minister, has emerged as the most likely successor to 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, coalition sources 
said. 
  During the course of the power struggle following Hosokawa's 
announcement of his resignation last Friday, Sakigake has sided 
with the coalition's biggest group, the Social Democratic Party, 
to oppose Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's influence 
over the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, political sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Executives of the 
governing coalition parties agreed on Wednesday [13 April] to 
continue efforts to synchronize their basic policies and install 
a new government as quickly as possible. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
told a news conference that the coalition executives will seek 
approval of their accord from their party leaders and resume 
negotiations on Wednesday afternoon. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent, 
also 
revealed that the executives agreed the coalition party leaders 
have the final word on the choice of a successor to exiting 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the lineup of a new cabinet. 
  The eight-month-old coalition, an alliance of seven parties 
spanning a wide political spectrum, moved to avert split on 
Tuesday after days of wrangling over procedures to select a 
successor to Hosokawa, who announced Friday he was resigning. 
  The governing parties on late Tuesday moved toward 
maintaining their unity and staying in power together. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has 
emerged as the favorite for the premiership, political sources 
said. 
  "Mr. Hata is the most likely candidate as new premier," 
Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, who is also the leader 
of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters Wednesday 
morning. 
  The coalition may also agree to nominate kubo of the SDP as 
new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the top government 
spokesman and chief of staff for the premier, the sources said. 
  Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new 
premier 
early next week after Hata returns home from an international 
trade meeting in Morocco, they said. 
  Hata, who heads Shinseito, a major component in the 
coalition, left Tokyo on Wednesday and will return home on 
Sunday. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new 
party Sakigake, however, said Wednesday the coalition leaders 
must first discuss the shape of a new coalition government 
before talking about the choice of a new premier. 
  Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of 
defecting from the main opposition party and running for the 
premiership, according to LDP sources. 
  Watanabe, who has signaled his readiness for such a move, 
failed to muster a sufficient number of followers from among LDP 
members, the sources said. 
  He is scheduled to meet LDP President Yohei Kono later 
Wednesday to compare notes on the selection of an LDP candidate 
for the premiership, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- A former publisher of an 
economic magazine said Wednesday [13 April] Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa lied about investment of his funds in his 
resignation announcement last Friday. Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said 
in a press conference that "Hosokawa's office made me out to be 
like a criminal, using me as a tool to make Premier Hosokawa 
look clean." 
  From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds 
and gained profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen, 
according to Kuwahata. 
  Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds, in 
spite of Hosokawa's citing "new suspicions" over the legality of 
his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation. 
  He said he did not invest the funds on the black market. 
  Some newspapers have reported that a former secretary of the 
late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka introduced him to 
Hosokawa's financial secretary. Kuwahata, however, said an 
"ordinary person" who has since died introduced him to Hosokawa 
around 1980 when Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member of 
the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  In investing Hosokawa's funds, Kuwahata promised him an 
annual interest rate of 12 percent, he said. 
  "I did not care if I made a loss, because I thought of it as 
a political donation," Kuwahata said. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference Friday, "from 1981 and for 
several years, my office let a certain person use the funds, and 
he gained personal profit from them. That person is an old 
personal friend of mine." 
  The premier declined, however, to elaborate on the specifics 
of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political 
office was still under way.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The business community 
welcomed Wednesday [13 April] a virtual end to political 
confusion that followed the abrupt resignation announcement of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the likeliest 
choice to succeed Hosokawa as head of the governing coalition, 
political sources said. 
  Business leaders hope a new administration led by Hata will 
normalize stalled Diet proceedings, paving the way for early 
passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and favorably affecting the 
domestic economy. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), expressed hope that the new 
government will continue to pursue a policy of political and 
economic reform. 
  Officials of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives 
(Keizai Doyukai) said the new government will never be allowed 
to abandon the reform policy in light of domestic and 
international situations. 
  Some business executives, however, said the political 
situation remains shaky as a new round of political 
reorganizations seems to be inevitable.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's surprise decision to resign and the succession 
struggle in the ruling coalition may disrupt Tokyo's diplomatic 
schedule, government sources indicated Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito expressed concern that 
the political turmoil in Tokyo could affect efforts to resume 
stalled trade talks with Washington. "We are not sure if it will 
be possible to come to an agreement on reopening negotiations," 
Saito said at a seminar in Chiba. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor, who are both attending ceremonies to finalize the 
agreements of the Uruguay Round world trade talks in Marrakech, 
Morocco, were expected to discuss the issue. "With Japan's 
political situation having come that far, it probably won't be 
easy to make a decision," Saito said. 
  Earlier the same day Egypt's President Husni Mubarak, 
scheduled to visit Japan from April 18 to 21, postponed his trip 
apparently because of the anticipated government change. 
  While Thai Government officials indicated that given the 
uncertainty about when a new Japanese prime minister will be 
sworn in, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit from April 22 to 
27 might be difficult to realize. 
  However, Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said the next 
prime minister and foreign minister should stick to the already 
arranged travel schedules "for the sake of diplomatic 
continuity." 
  Hosokawa was scheduled to make a three-nation visit to 
Europe 
starting May 3, while Hata was scheduled to pay a visit to the 
Middle East, including Egypt and Israel, from April 29. Other 
meetings that could be affected by the anticipated government 
change include Defense Chief Kazuo Aichi's talks with U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Perry in the middle of next week and 
with South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae around April 25, 
according to the Foreign Ministry sources.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The leader of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), one of the seven parties in 
the ruling coalition, said Wednesday [13 April] that Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata is the most probable successor to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, minister of health and welfare, 
hinted, however, at his disapproval of behind-the-scene deals 
among coalition parties over cabinet posts. "The new prime 
minister should select new cabinet ministers," he told reporters. 
  Work on allocation of cabinet posts "must begin after 
procedures are worked out and a new prime minister is picked," 
Ouchi said. 
  Ouchi's comment alluded to news reports that Social 
Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is tipped to 
become new chief cabinet secretary under Hata, who is the head 
of Shinseito, the most influential force in the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- New party Sakigake leader 
Masayoshi Takemura on Wednesday [13 April] expressed 
disaffection with burgeoning intra-coalition moves to put 
forward Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as next prime minister. 
Takemura told a news conference at Sakigake's headquarters in 
Tokyo that coalition parties should conclude discussion on a 
possible recombination of political parties that will comprise a 
new coalition government before picking their prime ministerial 
candidate. 
  Coalition parties "have not initiated discussion on what 
framework a new government should have," Takemura said. 
  Takemura called on other chiefs of coalition parties to band 
together to reconcile their difference over key policy 
objectives before initiating full-fledged talks on picking a new 
prime minister. 
  "The responsible leaders of coalition parties should 
assemble, analyze the situation and then start debate on what 
prospects (a new government) should have," he said. 
  "If they could reconcile their differences, we could go 
ahead 
with the current framework. However, if we failed to strike 
such accord, we should consider forming a new recombination of 
parties," he said. 
  Earlier in the day, a senior Sakigake official said the 
party 
will remain in the ruling coalition. 
  There may remain "an unpleasant feeling" between Sakigake 
and 
Shinseito, however, said the official, who spoke to reporters on 
condition of anonymity. Shinseito is regarded as the most 
influential force in the seven-party coalition. 
  During the course of the power struggle following Hosokawa's 
announcement of his resignation last Friday, Sakigake has sided 
with the coalition's biggest group, the Social Democratic Party, 
to oppose Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's influence 
over the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, political sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Ruling coalition parties 
failed Wednesday [13 April] to come closer to naming a successor 
to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Quarrels over how 
to choose a replacement for Hosokawa, who suddenly offered to 
resign on Friday, resumed one day after executives of the ruling 
parties agreed to avert a split in the coalition and form a new 
government under the current framework. 
  With the decision Tuesday to maintain unity, Foreign 
Minister 
and concurrently Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's chances of 
being named the next premier was almost certain. 
  Wrangling between the groups resumed Wednesday morning, 
however, when Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head 
of the new party Sakigake (Harbinger), aired his grievances over 
the selection process. Takemura told reporters that leaders of 
the coalition parties must first exchange views on the shape of 
a new coalition government before finding a successor to 
Hosokawa. 
  This was in contrast with an agreement among the secretary 
general-level coalition representatives that their caucus, not a 
forum of coalition chiefs, would have the authority to take 
charge of selecting the next premier. 
  Sakigake decided later to boycott a meeting of ruling party 
executives until a forum of coalition chiefs was given the 
authority to select Hosokawa's replacement. The move could 
result in a split in the eight-month-old coalition. 
  The party insists that coalition heads should meet first to 
discuss the mandate of the coalition representatives' caucus -- 
the highest decision-making body under the Hosokawa 
administration -- and the selection of a new premier candidate. 
  It also points to the need for the coalition partners to 
synchronize their basic policies, decide on the framework of a 
new coalition government and select a candidate for the 
premiership. 
  "It runs counter to the founding principles of our party to 
approve a decision on a new premier through backroom talks," a 
senior Sakigake official said. "We cannot help but become an 
opposition party." 
  In the absence of a Sakigake figure, the executives of the 
other ruling parties agreed in their Wednesday evening meeting 
to continue discussing the matter on Thursday morning, coalition 
officials said. 
  Social Democratic Socialist Party (SDP) Secretary General 
Wataru Kubo told a news conference that SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama will ask his coalition counterparts to meet all 
together so as not to isolate Sakigake and cause the ruling 
union to collapse. 
  "The SDP chairman says he wishes to do his best to realize a 
meeting of coalition chiefs, which will allow Sakigake to come 
back and hammer out an accord on how to solve this difficult 
problem," Kubo said. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent, 
added he will report to Thursday's gathering of coalition 
representatives on the outcome of Murayama's efforts to bring 
together all the heads of the ruling parties. 
  Murayama had twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition 
chiefs -- once Monday and again Tuesday -- to break a stalemate 
over the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa and avert a 
collapse of the coalition. 
  Sakigake, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP 
favored the selection of a new premier at a forum of the 
coalition party leaders. But leaders of four coalition partners 
-- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, Hosokawa's Japan 
New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party -- 
rejected the bid and boycotted the two sessions. 
  The row over the procedures to pick a candidate to replace 
Hosokawa stems from the deep gulf between the 
moderate-to-leftist Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more 
conservative Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies 
and some key national policies. 
  Bickering between Sakigake's Takemura and Shinseito's Ichiro 
Ozawa, the main coalition strategist, over political management 
is also regarded as a source of trouble within the coalition. 
  Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday reaffirmed his 
desire to run for the highest government office, even by 
defecting from the primary opposition party with fellow LDP 
members. 
  Some LDP sources said late Tuesday night Watanabe gave up 
the 
idea of defecting from the once-dominant party due to the 
unlikelihood of his garnering a sufficient number of supporters 
from among LDP members to succeed. 
  The Shinseito-Komeito camp has also explored the possibility 
of fielding Watanabe, a close friend of Ozawa, as a candidate to 
succeed Hosokawa, should he bolt from the LDP along with a large 
number of his followers and join the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe, a primary force in the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), on Wednesday [13 April] stepped up his 
campaign to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
At a meeting Wednesday [13 April], Watanabe's faction agreed to 
lobby LDP members to endorse him as the successor to Hosokawa, 
who announced last Friday he would resign, faction sources said. 
  Watanabe also rejected a request for face-to-face talks with 
LDP President Yohei Kono, who vowed Tuesday to seek the 
premiership to maintain party unity, the sources said. 
  Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime candidate for 
the premiership after a feud within the ruling coalition 
threatened to split the government, weakening the chances of 
front-runner Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named to 
succeed Hosokawa. But on Tuesday, the ruling coalition, which 
was on the verge of collapse, moved to maintain the current 
framework of the government, once again strengthening Hata's 
hand. 
  A senior member of Watanabe's faction said, however, there 
is 
still a glimmer of hope for Watanabe being named prime minister 
because the ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds 
within the shaky alliance and band together to support Hata. 
  On Wednesday, new party Sakigake [Harbinger], a component of 
the coalition, voiced its opposition with the process of 
selecting a new premier and boycotted a crucial meeting, giving 
impetus once again to Watanabe's ambitions to lead a new 
government. 
  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, 
told a news conference that coalition parties should conclude 
discussion on possible realignment of political forces before 
choosing the next prime minister. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the coalition's 
two core forces that are at odds with Sakigake, have expressed 
interest in Watanabe as the next leader of a new coalition 
government due to his political savvy and influence, political 
sources said. 
  They said Watanabe may form a new party if he rallies enough 
support from within the LDP. 
  A senior LDP official said, "It is good if Watanabe runs in 
the election (as the LDP's unified candidate) and the LDP is 
able to regain power, but if he is a candidate within the party, 
it means Kono should resign as party president."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) on Friday [8 April] ordered the Yamanashi Prefectural 
Construction Industry Association to stop unfair practices, FTC 
officials said. 
  The FTC ruled that for 10 years member firms of the 
construction cartel repeatedly engaged in "dango" price fixing 
activities on public works projects. 
  The trade watchdog, however, held off on seeking a criminal 
indictment since it could not find one case of price-fixing to 
prosecute. 
  This follows a similar decision not to seek a criminal 
indictment against a contractor cartel in Saitama Prefecture, 
which had been linked to former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura, who was indicted last Friday on charges of receiving 
10 million yen from major contractor Kajima Corp. in bribes. 
  According to the FTC investigation, the eight branches of 
the 
association beginning around 1983 took orders for public works 
projects and decided which firms would be awarded the contracts 
as well as the price of the project. 
  The "dango" activities continued until last May when the FTC 
initiated its investigation into the association. 
  Suspicions concerning the association surfaced with 
disgraced 
kingpin Shin Kanemaru's tax evasion case when prosecutors 
questioned contracting firms over their huge cash political 
donations to Kanemaru. 
  Kanemaru, who had been elected from Yamanashi Prefecture, is 
facing tax evasion charges.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The farm ministry has 
incorporated gains of 211.7 billion yen accruing from emergency 
rice imports in the fiscal 1994 budget, ministry sources said 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries started 
rice imports on an emergency basis last November to make up for 
a supply shortage resulting from a poor rice harvest in Japan 
last year. 
  The sources said the ministry estimates total rice imports 
at 
2.29 million tons. 
  They said the ministry set the ceiling of rice imports at 
2.65 million tons and if the imports hit the upper limit, the 
ministry's earnings amount to about 250 billion yen. 
  The ministry makes profits by selling foreign rice to 
wholesalers at prices higher than import prices. The yen's 
appreciation also boosted the ministry's gains. 
  The sources said the ministry's gains from rice imports 
average about 92,000 yen per ton. 
  The sources said the ministry will use the gains for 
payments 
of mutual aid insurance to rice growers who suffered from the 
poor harvest. 
  They said insurance payments have hit a record high of 440 
billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, detained on a bribery charge, again 
asked Tuesday [12 April] to be freed on bail so he can take part 
in a Diet vote to pick the next prime minister, his lawyers said. 
  Nakamura, 44, has been detained since mid-March after 
prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of taking a bribe from 
leading contractor Kajima Corp. 
  On April 5, a judge at the Tokyo District Court rejected 
Nakamura's bail application, saying he might destroy evidence. 
  In a fresh petition to the same court, defense lawyers 
argued 
that Nakamura, as a member of the House of Representatives, 
needs to perform his duty and take part in the vote for a new 
prime minister. The vote is very important in that it will 
decide the future of Japanese politics, they said. 
  No date has yet been set for the two houses of the Diet to 
hold the vote on a successor to Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced 
his resignation last Friday. 
  Under Japan's code of criminal procedure, a suspect under 
arrest is automatically detained for two months upon indictment 
but can apply for release on bail. The detention order has to 
be renewed every two months. 
  Nakamura is charged with taking the 10 million yen bribe 
January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice president of 
Kajima Corp. Nakamura was at that time acting head of the then 
governing Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly 
policies. 
  Prosecutors opposed Nakamura's previous petition for bail, 
saying he may destroy evidence because he has stayed completely 
silent when questioned about the case. 
  Nakamura quit the LDP just before his arrest and is 
currently 
an independent member of the lower house. 
  He served as construction minister from December 1992 to 
August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- A Tokyo district court 
judge rejected again Wednesday [13 April] a request for bail 
from former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura to allow him 
to vote for a new prime minister. 
  Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday 
on the grounds he might destroy evidence. 
  Nakamura asked Tuesday to be freed on bail so he can take 
part in a Diet vote to pick a successor to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation last 
Friday over financial dealings. 
  No date has been set for the Diet vote yet. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A senior postal ministry 
official indicated Monday [11 April] that the ministry is 
considering punitive action against several television stations 
because of their inaccurate reporting of election results. 
  Akimasa Egawa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications 
Ministry's Broadcasting Bureau, said Japan Broadcasting Corp. 
(NHK) and commercial television stations will be subject to 
punishment. 
  Some unsuccessful candidates were reported to be assured of 
election in the early stage of vote counting in the House of 
Representatives election in July last year, he said. 
  Egawa said the existing law bars television stations from 
offering biased reports to viewers. 
  In the general election, NHK and five commercial key 
stations 
provided erroneous reports in 19 cases, according to the 
ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A seven-member panel began 
work Monday [11 April] to delimit 300 new single-seat districts 
in general elections for the House of Representatives, 
government officials said. 
  The panel, headed by Tadao Ichikawa, former president of 
Keio 
University, will file a report on its work in six months, they 
said. 
  The government will submit a bill based on the panel's 
report 
and the Diet is expected to enact the bill in an extraordinary 
session this fall, the officials said. 
  The launching of the council followed the enactment earlier 
this year of a package of political reform bills which introduce 
single- seat constituencies for lower house general elections. 
  Under the package, 300 of the 500 lower house members will 
be 
elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through 
proportional representation. 
  The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected 
last July from constituencies with the number of seats ranging 
from two to six each.

  [Text] Kyoto, April 10 KYODO -- Incumbent Teiichi Aramaki 
easily won Sunday's [10 April] Kyoto gubernatorial election for 
a third consecutive four-year term, backed by the main 
opposition party and seven ruling coalition parties, prefectural 
election commission officials said. 
  Aramaki, 62, who ran as an independent, defeated independent 
contender Mampei Kimura, 70, by a wide margin. 
  Aramaki was supported by the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party and all seven ruling parties -- the Social Democratic 
Party, foreign minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), Komeito, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New 
Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura's new party Sakigake and the United Social 
Democratic Party. 
  Kimura was supported by the Japanese Communist Party, 
another 
opposition party. 
  Aramaki won 421,583 votes, while Kimura garnered 225,688 
with 
78 percent of ballots counted as of 8:30 P.M. 
  Voter turnout stood at a record low of 43.02 percent, down 
0.72 percentage point from 43.74 percent four years ago. 
  The governorship race, which came on the heels of Hosokawa's 
resignation announcement Friday, did not receive much attention 
from voters because it was virtually a replay of the previous 
election, fought between the same two people.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The government's tax 
commission generally favors shifting Japan's tax burden from 
income to consumption taxes, panel chief Kan Kato said [12 
April]. 
  Although some members are cautious about shifting the burden 
toward direct taxation and want further discussion, no 
opposition emerged at a panel meeting, Kato told a news 
conference afterward. 
  Kato, an emeritus professor at Keio University, said the 
advisory panel to the prime minister must pick up the pace of 
its deliberations to meet a June deadline for its final report, 
which the government is to use to craft its tax policy. 
  The commission, which will meet again Friday, also agreed to 
form a working group of scholars, excluding bureaucrats and 
interest- group representatives, to examine the possibility of a 
regional consumption tax, Kato said. 
  The tax options that the commission is to lay out in its 
report will likely not be numerical, he said. Kato has said he 
agrees with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the net tax 
burden must be raised to meet the needs of Japan's aging society. 
  The commission ended its previous meeting in confusion just 
as Hosokawa announced last Friday that he will quit as premier. 
  But Kato said the members agreed Tuesday to press on with 
their work, noting Japan's international promise to spell out by 
the end of June its pledge for tax reform, including permanent 
income tax cuts, to be enacted by year's end. 
  "Whoever becomes the next prime minister, the road is 
narrowing" as the tax debate proceeds and time runs out, Kato 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Japan will present details 
of a full tax reform in June, as originally promised in a 
market- opening package in March, a top Finance Ministry 
official said Monday [11 April]. 
  Both ruling and opposition parties have "indicated clearly" 
the direction the full tax reform should take, Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting, brushing aside 
the notion that the current political uncertainty could retard 
the process. 
  He was referring to a provision attached by legislators from 
the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party when enacting a single-year tax cut bill in March. It 
calls for inclusion of a permanent tax cut in a reform to be 
enacted by the end of the year. 
  Saito also said he "hopes for some conclusion on funding" in 
reference to deficit-covering bonds to be issued to offset the 
income tax cut, limited to fiscal 1994. 
  The Finance Ministry has been calling for a consumption tax 
hike to offset tax cuts. 
  Concerning the impact of political uncertainty on the 
economy, Saito said the stock and currency exchange markets 
"held relatively steady despite my earlier concerns." 
  Saying he would watch developments, Saito repeated his wish 
for Diet passage "as soon as possible" of the fiscal 1994 
budget, and said Japanese officials are working "through 
diplomatic channels" to seek a breakthrough in the stalled 
Japan-U.S. framework trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The government gave a 
warning Monday [11 April] to medium-sized Japanese oil refiner 
Kashima Oil Co. for incurring huge unrealized losses from its 
failed forward foreign exchange deals, officials said. 
  The Agency of Energy and Natural Resources of the Ministry 
of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) summoned Kashima 
President Hachiro Obata to deliver the warning over the 
company's 152.5 billion yen worth of loss, agency officials said. 
  The agency told Obata to prevent a similar recurrence and 
devise company restructuring plans soon, the officials said. 
  Wild fluctuations in yen-dollar rates since the mid-1980s 
have made forward exchange trading often risky and many oil 
firms, including Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., have reported huge 
losses from such deals. 
  Showa Shell's loss, disclosed in February 1993, prompted a 
MITI hearing on other oil distributors and refiners, but Kashima 
failed to report its losses at that time.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
will decontrol commercial paper issues by life and nonlife 
insurance firms to raise short-term funds, ministry officials 
said Monday [11 April]. 
  The officials said a formal decision will be made by the end 
of this week. 
  They said the decision is in line with a recommendation in 
June 1992 by the Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the 
finance minister. 
  The officials said insurance companies are expected to issue 
their first commercial paper in May at the earliest. 
  Insurance firms have hitherto raised necessary funds through 
sales of securities holdings to cover the extraordinary 
expenditure caused by natural disasters. 
  They will be able to issue commercial paper to refund 
debentures issued by them in the past. 
  The ministry conditionally lifted controls on commercial 
paper issues by leasing and consumer credit companies in June 
last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Despite the yen's rise since 
early last year, prices of many domestic products have not seen 
much of a decline, in contrast with a fall in yen-based import 
prices of comparable products, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) 
said Friday [8 April]. 
  The commission conducted a survey on the effects of the 
yen's 
appreciation on prices of products from the angle of market 
structure, comparing wholesale prices of 45 items last December 
with year-earlier levels. 
  The 45 items surveyed were limited to those covered by both 
the import price index and domestic wholesale price index. 
  A considerable fall was noted in prices, in yen terms, of 
imported cigarettes, pig iron, motors and farm tractors, but 
wholesale prices of comparable domestic products rose, the 
survey said. 
  Wholesale prices of 19 items in which foreign access to the 
markets is limited -- such as beer, whisky, brandy and cheese -- 
posted almost no decline, compared with an appreciable fall in 
yen- based import prices of comparable foreign products, it said. 
  The survey said that in the case of 15 of the 23 items, the 
Japanese market is in an oligopolistic state with the combined 
market share of the top three makers reaching 60 percent or 
above. 
  Like monopoly, oligopoly tends to stem a fall in market 
prices. 
  The more imported raw and semifinished materials are used, 
the more the prices of products using those materials will fall 
if there are no factors limiting competition, the survey said. 
  It said the more oligopolistic the market is, the less 
tendency there will be for lower prices.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have agreed to 
maintain the 1.1 percentage point difference between rates on 
ordinary postal savings deposits and ordinary banking deposits, 
officials said Friday [8 April]. 
  The difference will remain effective even after ordinary 
deposit rates are liberalized, which could possibly start in 
June. 
  But the ministries will further scrutinize some exceptional 
cases such as when rates of ordinary bank deposits become 
sharply lower than market rates, the officials said. 
  The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry have been seeking 
to set the rate on its ordinary deposits in accordance with 
market rates but the Finance Ministry was insisting on leaving 
the difference, while narrowing the gap.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- A joint statement 
denouncing the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and its 
followers was published on March 30 by the Canadian regional 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), the Council for the Promotion of 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the Korean Women's 
Society for the Country's Reunification in Canada and the 
Canadian regional headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth 
and Students for the Country's Reunification (Homchonghakryon), 
Tokyo-based Korean News Service reported. 
  The statement expressed indignation at the United States who 
is bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink 
of war, kicking up a nuclear row against the DPRK, and urged the 
United States to cancel at once the planned resumption of the 
"Team Spirit" and deployment of Patriot missiles and make 
sincere preparations for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The statement also urged that Japan, too, should stop making 
mischief between the South and the North, and bury the hatchet 
for peace, deeply mindful of the lessons of the past history. 
  It denounced, in the name of the nation, the towering crimes 
of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, who as a servant of the 
United States, has been conspiring to do harm to the fellow 
countrymen, crying for "cooperation in taking sanctions".

<F P=106> ["Double Standard Must Not Be Allowed in Nuclear Issue" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Nuclear physicists of 
South Africa reportedly threatened recently that they would 
expose data related to nuclear arms development if the 
government did not pay them retirement allowances, and disclosed 
that research facilities had been provided by France and Britain. 
  The nuclear arms development of Israel which has close 
relations with South Africa in this respect has been assisted by 
the United States. The U.S. is also cooperating in South Korea's 
nuclear arms development. 
  NODONG SINMUN today views these facts as an eloquent proof 
of 
the United States, France and Britain being the masterminds of 
international proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It is noteworthy that these countries and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are applying a double standard in 
nuclear inspection. 
  While turning an unseeing eye to South Africa, Japan and 
South Korea dangerously playing with nuclear material under the 
patronage of the United States, the IAEA is unreasonably taking 
issue with the DPRK in its peaceful nuclear activities. 
  The recent publication of a "statement of the president" of 
the U.N. Security Council unreasonably urging the DPRK to accept 
additional inspections by the IAEA is a graphic expression of 
the double standard policy in the nuclear issue. This shows the 
U.N. Security Council is playing into the hands of the United 
States in the execution of its hostile policy of stifling the 
DPRK. 
  Lack of impartiality and random application of a double 
standard in the nuclear issue are attributable to the 
arbitrariness of the United States, France and Britain, 
masterminds of the international proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, in the U.N. Security Council. It is abnormal that the 
countries that deserve sanctions are left alone and pressure is 
put on an innocent country. 
  If the U.N. Security Council really has the intention to 
discharge its mission, it must take issue with the United 
States, which is obstructing the settlement of the nuclear issue 
and gravely threatening peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula with huge nuclear weapons, and the South Korean 
authorities, its servant. 
  If the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA serve as tools for 
military and political purposes of a nuclear power, applying a 
double standard, the non-nuclear states and the Third World 
countries will no longer trust these international organisations. 
  The double standard must no longer be allowed in the nuclear 
issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
committed a criminal act by bringing 20 odd warplanes of various 
types to South Korea from their overseas bases, according to 
military sources. 
  On the 11th of April Japan-based formations of assault 
planes 
and pursuit-assault planes flew to the U.S. Airforce bases in 
South Korea. Earlier, on the 10th, F-15s, F-4s, FA-18s, AV-8s, 
EA-6s and other types of warplanes based in Japan and the 
Pacific were deployed in South Korea. 
  In another development, on April 10 and 11, C-5 
supercolossal 
strategic transport planes and C-130 and C-141 transport planes 
loaded with a large number of troops and combat equipment landed 
in a U.S. Airforce base in South Korea from the U.S. mainland 
and Pacific bases and the airlifted troops and equipment were 
deployed in operational theatres.

vigilance the war preparations of the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets. They will mete out a stern punishment to 
the enemy, if he ventures aggression.

<F P=106> ["Japan Cannot Shake Off `Enemy State' Brand" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Shunji Maruyama, 
deputy permanent representative of Japan to the United Nations, 
reportedly told a recent meeting of a working group that the 
provision of the U.N. charter specifying Japan as an "enemy 
state" was outdated and it must be deleted. 
  His unreasonable assertion is an insult to the U.N. Charter 
and a mockery of unbiased public opinion critical of the past 
crimes of Japan. 
  However angrily Japan may grumble, pointing its finger at 
the 
United Nations as now, in an attempt to cleanse itself of the 
disgraceful brand of "enemy state" specified in the U.N. 
charter, it is no wise way of solving the problem. 
  If the problem is to be solved, Japan must liquidate its 
shameful past, first of all. Japan's past is spoiled with 
never-to-be-condoned crimes; it is a war criminal state in World 
War II and imposed all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings on 
the Korean and other Asian peoples. 
  It is the height of effrontery for Japan to attempt to 
delete 
the brand of "enemy state" while keeping mum about its criminal 
past. 
  Striking out the brand of "enemy state" is out of question 
today when Japan, forgetful of the lesson on the past, is 
hastening its nuclear armament and its conversion into a 
military power in real earnest to realise its old dream of "the 
greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and thus hindering the 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the establishment 
of a nuclear weapon-free world and posing a great threat to the 
Korean and other Asian peoples.

<F P=106> [`White paper' published by DPRK Foreign Ministry on 11 </F>
April in Pyongyang] 
  [Text] The Monju, the first fast breeder reactor of Japan, 
was put into normal operation on 5 April, in defiance of bitter 
denunciation and concern worldwide. This means a dangerous step 
in Japan's nuclear armament. 
  Japan's nuclear armament has reached the danger point today. 
This is an open challenge to the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and desire of mankind to build a nuclear-free world, 
and is a question of which the international community must take 
a serious view. 
  Recognizing that it is necessary to inform governments, 
parliaments, political parties, and public organizations in many 
nations, international organizations, and peace-loving people of 
the world, of the dangerous nature of Japan's nuclear armament, 
and to urgently block it, the DPRK Foreign Ministry publishes 
this white paper. 
  1. Japan has been seeking its nuclear armament a long time. 
  Japan's ambition for nuclear armament has been fully 
revealed 
by remarks of successive Japanese authorities and official 
documents. 
  Article 9 of the Constitution of the State of Japan (Peace 
Constitution), which was adopted in November 1946 under strong 
internal and external demand and pressure, stipulates that the 
Japanese people, sincerely aspiring international peace based on 
justice and order, shall abandon forever all war, armed threat, 
and armed action through the invocation of state power as a 
means of resolving international disputes. To this end, they 
shall not have an Army, Navy, Air Force and other war potential 
and will not recognize the right of belligerency of the state. 
  The successive Japanese authorities, however, urged by the 
desire to turn the country into a military power, a nuclear 
power, have tried by hook or by crook to justify their nuclear 
armament scheme since the 1950's, totally denying or arbitrarily 
interpreting the Constitution itself. 
  On 7 May 1957, then prime minister of Japan, Kishi, said at 
the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that if anyone 
simply mentions nuclear weapon, all people say it contravenes 
the Constitution. Such an interpretation of the Constitution, 
however, is wrong. Without looking into future development, we 
cannot say uniformly that it is wrong to mention any kind of 
nuclear weapon. (Japanese book "Japan's Nuclear Arming Which Has 
Reached This Stage," 1975) 
  The document entitled "The Military Outline of the Second 
Defense Capabilities Adjustment Plan" prepared by the 
secretariat of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Japan Self-Defense 
Forces in 1959 stipulates that from the military point of view, 
Japan should have the capability to use tactical nuclear weapons 
for defensive purposes, not to mention its capabilities to cope 
with a nuclear war. (The above-mentioned book) 
  On 10 February 1968, Takatsuki, minister of Legislation of 
the Japanese Cabinet, said at the Budget Committee of the House 
of Councillors that the Constitution does not stipulate that we 
should not possess nuclear weapons and we may possess 
conventional weapons. Although the Constitution rules that we 
cannot possess war potential, the Self-Defense Forces exist 
based on the Self-Defense Forces Law. 
  The interpretation that the Self-Defense Forces are approved 
[yongin] in accordance with the Constitution is the very 
interpretation of weapons. In other words, nuclear weapons and 
other weapons are not discriminated against in the Constitution. 
(The above-mentioned book) 
  On 7 February 1968, Kurai, then Japanese minister of 
Agriculture, said in a news conference that the Peace 
Constitution should be revised for the young generations and 
Japan should have atomic bombs, as well as 300,000 troops in its 
Armed Forces. (The above-mentioned book) 
  The Japanese authorities' wild design for nuclear armament 
was dealt a hard blow by the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen 
bombs, which has gained strength within and without Japan since 
the 1950's. This compelled then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku 
Sato, quite upset, to announce at the Diet in 1968 the three 
non-nuclear principles--not to manufacture, possess, and 
introduce any nuclear weapons. 
  For this announcement, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  On 2 June 1969, however, Sato said at a plenary session of 
the House of Representatives that the three nonnuclear 
principles can be altered any time when the policy is changed or 
the cabinet is replaced by another (the above-mentioned book), 
making it plain that these principles advocated by him were 
rhetoric to deceive public opinion at home and abroad. 
  A document entitled "Independent National Defense Plan," 
prepared by the Japan Defense Agency in 1969, revealed Japan's 
intent to develop and possess its own nuclear weapons and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry them. (Japanese 
paper ASAHI EVENING NEWS, 27 June 1969) 
  The Japan Defense Agency's 1970 defense white paper noted: 
According to the law governing the application of laws, it is 
possible to possess the minimum quantity of small nuclear 
weapons needed for self-defense if they do not pose any threat 
of aggression to other countries. (Japanese book "Japan's Black 
Star," 1972) 
  In 1971, when Japan's nuclear energy development was 
stepping 
up in a full scale, while announcing the fourth plan for 
rounding off the national defense capabilities, the director 
general of the Japan Defense Agency, Nakasone, said that the 
Japanese law did not forbid defensive nuclear weapons. (JIJI 
press, 8 July 1971) 
  On 2 March 1978, Japanese Foreign Minister Sonoda said at 
the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives that 
he did not mean to say that Japan could not possess nuclear 
weapons because it was restricted by the provision of the 
Constitution itself. (JIJI press, 2 March 1978) 
  On 8 March 1978, Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda, said at the 
Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that it was 
possible to adopt a decision on equipping the nation's armed 
forces with nuclear weapons. (TASS news agency, 26 March 1978) 
  While expressing the government's coordinated view on 
relations between the possession of nuclear weapons and Article 
9 of the Constitution at the Budget Committee of the House of 
Councilors on 9 March 1978, the Japanese Government said: 
Retaining combat strength within the minimum scope needed for 
self-defense is not forbidden by Article 9, Clause 2 of the 
Constitution. The government interprets that possessing nuclear 
weapons or ordinary weapons within that scope is not forbidden 
by this clause, either. (JIJI press, 9 March 1978) 
  At the Budget Committee of the House of Councilors on 15 
March 1984, Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, answering an 
interpellation by a Komei Dietman, said: Japan may possess 
atomic power if it is for national defense. (Japanese ASAHI 
SHIMBUN, 16 March 1984) 
  On 4 June 1984, Nakasone rejected the opposition party's 
demand that one more principle on prohibiting the use of nuclear 
weapons be added to the three principles on denuclearization, 
saying that this issue can cause an international law problem 
because Japan's adoption of the principle on prohibiting the use 
of nuclear weapons may infringe upon the sovereignty of nuclear 
states. (KYODO press, 5 June 1984) 
  Entering the nineties, the Japanese authorities, mentioning 
the changed international situation, have openly revealed their 
scheme to step up their nuclear armament at the final stage. 
  In an interview with commentator (Tawara Shoiziro) before 
his 
assumption of office, Japanese Prime Minister Miyazawa, said: In 
my opinion, the most economic way of military preparations for a 
country like Japan is nuclear armament, which is technologically 
possible, and for which we have no financial difficulty. 
(Japanese magazine CHUO KORON, September 1991) 
  The Japanese Government has created deliberate obstacles 
[inwuijogin nangwanul chosonghae odaga] to the progress of 
DPRK-Japan Government-level talks on normalizing diplomatic 
relations by raising the so-called nuclear suspicion issue of 
the DPRK as a precondition, and it finally broke the talks in 
November 1992. 
  When the DPRK and the United States began to hold dialogue 
to 
resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through 
negotiations, the Japanese authorities expressed more clearly 
their intent to step up their own nuclear armament under the 
pretext of our nuclear issue. 
  In a news conference held in Singapore in July 1993, 
Japanese 
Foreign Minister Muto said: If North Korea develops nuclear 
weapons and this posed a threat, we can depend upon the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella. It is important, however, that we have the 
will to manufacture nuclear weapons if North Korea develops them 
in a full scale. (AP news agency, 11 September 1993) 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Muto said it is important that we 
have the will to manufacture nuclear weapons. In a ceremony 
marking the anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry, the foreign minister said that although Japan was 
placed under the U.S. nuclear umbrella over the past years, it 
needs a self-defensive capability under the present situation in 
which Moscow and Washington are cooperating with each other. 
(KYODO News Agency, 21 July 1993). 
  Yosihuni, Japanese Foreign Ministry authority in charge of 
nuclear affairs, said on 9 July 1993: If North Korea possesses 
nuclear weapons, there will be a number of opinions among the 
public regarding the means to deal with such situations. 
However, this will weaken our commitment to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. (U.S. paper WASHINGTON POST, 22 
November 1993) 
  Referring to the need to build up defensive capabilities to 
promptly and accurately cope with the possible dangerous events 
in neighboring countries, such as nuclear suspicion and missile 
development by the DPRK, in particular, Japan has recently 
attempted to formulate within this year new general principles 
of the defense program reflecting the end of the Cold War and 
domestic situation. 
  Japan has openly manifested its plan to arm itself with 
nuclear weapons even on UN forums. Until the first half of the 
sixties, the Japanese Government, though reluctantly, voted for 
resolutions on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and 
bar on nuclear weapons at the UN General Assembly. From the 
second half of the sixties, however, it voted against or 
abstained from voting on such resolutions, thus disclosing its 
intention to become a military power, a nuclear power, at any 
cost by making haste with nuclear development at full scale and 
producing and stockpiling nuclear weapons. 
  At the 22d session of the UN General Assembly in 1967, the 
27th session of the UN General Assembly in 1972, the 31st 
session of the UN General Assembly in 1976, the 32d session of 
the UN General Assembly in 1977, the 33th session of the UN 
General Assembly in 1978, the 34th session of the UN General 
Assembly in 1979, and the 35th session of the UN General 
Assembly in 1980, the Japanese Government abstained from voting 
on the resolutions on reviewing the treaty to ban nuclear 
weapons; on the permanent ban of nuclear weapons; on 
guaranteeing the security of the non-nuclear possessing 
countries; and on prohibiting all nuclear weapons from being 
tested or exploded. Also, it has voted against the resolution 
on prohibiting nuclear weapon deployment and on prohibiting the 
use of nuclear weapons. (Japan's magazine CHUO KORON, March 
1982) 
  At the 37th session of the UN General Assembly in 1982, the 
40th session of the UN General Assembly in 1985, the 41th 
session of the UN General Assembly in 1986, the 42d session of 
the UN General Assembly in 1987, the 43th session of the UN 
General Assembly in 1988, the 44th session of the UN General 
Assembly in 1989, the 45th session of the UN General Assembly in 
1990, and the 47th session of the UN General Assembly in 1992, 
the Japanese Government also voted against or abstained from 
voting on resolutions on the banning the use of nuclear weapons; 
on banning nuclear weapons; on the prevention of nuclear war; 
on banning nuclear weapon deployment into the territory of the 
nonnuclear possessing countries; on the strengthening of the 
security of nonnuclear possessing countries to cope with the use 
of nuclear weapons by the nuclear possessing countries or their 
threat to use them; on the freezing of nuclear weapons; on the 
prevention of nuclear war; on South Africa's nuclear 
capability; and on Israel's nuclear armaments. (UN General 
Assembly Resolutions written in English, 1993) 
  Explaining the reason why the Japanese Government voted 
against or abstained from voting on those resolutions, it said: 
A total ban on the use of nuclear weapons is incompatible with 
nuclear deterrent and it might destroy the nuclear equilibrium. 
However, in reality, this was an open and undisguised 
revelation on the UN arena of Japan's ulterior intention to 
produce and possess nuclear weapons and pave the way for 
overseas aggression so that it could use them in case of 
emergency. 
  Thus, since the fifties to date, Japan has plotted to adopt 
its nuclear armaments as a policy and to legalize it under the 
veil of three nonnuclear principles, opposing and distorting the 
Peace Constitution. 
  2. Japan's nuclear armament has reached the danger line. 
Japan's nuclear policy is being promoted in two directions, that 
is, solving the problem of power by nuclear energy and, at the 
same time, securing a large quantity of plutonium for the 
manufacture of nuclear weapons by itself to proceed with nuclear 
armament at any moment. 
  In 1956, the Japanese Government established, under the 
Science and Technology Agency, a division that controls and 
commands the atomic energy sector in a unified manner. It also 
established, under the division, such permanent offices as an 
atomic energy committee, an atomic energy institute, an atomic 
energy business association, and an atomic energy corporation. 
Since then, the Japanese Government has positively pursued 
atomic energy development. 
  The first nuclear power station was built and went into 
operation in Japan in July 1966. Since then, the Japanese 
Government has considered the construction of nuclear power 
stations to be an important state policy to solve the energy 
problem. 
  The Japanese Government mapped out a 10-year plan to take 
comprehensive measures concerning energy in an effort to 
overcome the worldwide oil crisis of 1973 and accelerated 
nuclear development in earnest. 
  All of these were in fact a means for Japan to arm itself 
with nuclear weapons. 
  According to the director of the High Center of Social 
Sciences of France, in 1976, the United States made such special 
concessions to Japan as approving its civilian [minsuyong] 
nuclear development and promising it a continued supply of 
highly enriched uranium under a far looser inspection system 
than other allies in reward for Japan's ratification of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  As a result, Japan has been able to freely reprocess nuclear 
materials and develop advanced technologies for its rearmament. 
(Radio France Culture, 5 November, 1993). 
  Japan has already installed enough nuclear facilities to arm 
itself with nuclear weapons. 
  At the beginning, the United States, with a view to control 
Japan's nuclear development, sold to it only light-water 
reactors feeding on U.S.-made enriched uranium and prohibited it 
from developing other types of atomic reactors. 
  Under this condition, Japan developed a new-type converter 
[jonhwanno] mainly feeding on Canadian natural uranium with an 
investment of $404 million. This converter was built in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, and has been in full operation since 
1979. (Japanese book "Imidas" 1992) 
  In this way, Japan has gained relative independence in 
nuclear development, freeing itself from U.S. control. 
  According to the white paper on nuclear energy published by 
the Japanese Government in 1993, Japan has 16 nuclear power 
stations with 46 reactors in operation, which are capable of 
producing 37,360,000 kw of energy. This means that Japan ranks 
third in the world after the United States and France in the 
total designed capacity of nuclear facilities [haeksolbiui 
chongsolgye nungnyok]. 
  The year 1993 alone witnessed the commissioning of 12 new 
reactors [panungno], and nine units of facilities with a total 
capacity of 8.9 million kw are under construction. In all this, 
Japan annually uses some 3,000 tonnes of nuclear materials of 
various sorts. 
  Japan may become a dangerous nuclear power with its capacity 
of nuclear weapon production largely expanded when 10 nuclear 
power stations, one fast breeder reactor, one uranium enrichment 
plant, and one low-intensity radioactive waste storage, all of 
which are now under construction, and four nuclear power 
stations, including one new-type converter, one reprocessing 
plant, and one high-intensity radioactive waste storage, all of 
which are now projected, are put into operation. (Japanese book 
"Imidas," 1992). 
  Japan started the construction of the world's largest 
nuclear 
fuel reprocessing plant, the first such plant in Japan, in April 
1993 in Rokashomura, Aomori Prefecture. The plant is scheduled 
to be in operation in the year 2000. The plant will have an 
annual capacity to reprocess 800 tonnes of nuclear waste, 60 
percent of the total amount of nuclear waste in Japan and can 
extract five tonnes a year of plutonium known to be the most 
toxic. (KYODO news service 28 April 1993) 
  Japan has secured enough nuclear materials to arm itself 
with 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japan set itself a long-range goal of depending upon fast 
breeder reactors feeding on plutonium in the fifties when it 
started the development of atomic energy and has produced and 
stockpiled a large quantity of nuclear materials by operating 
reprocessing plants since the mid seventies. 
  Japan has stockpiled 26 tonnes of plutonium which surpasses 
by far the quantity needed for peaceful purposes. It is enough 
to manufacture more than 3,000 atomic bombs of the Nagasaki 
type. (Japanese magazine BUNGEI SHUNJU, June 1992). 
  Japan buckled down to the implementation of its great 
program 
for the use of plutonium at the beginning of 1992. In the 
period from 1975 to 1992, it brought in one tonne of plutonium 
from Britain in top secrecy and reportedly shipped in 1.5 tonnes 
of plutonium from France in 1993. Japan mapped out a plan to 
fully operate the Monju, a fast breeder reactor, from the year 
2000 and to secure about 400 tonnes of plutonium by 2010. 
(Russian paper, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, 13 February 1992) 
  Considering the fact that 120 atomic bombs of Nagasaki type 
can be made with one tonne of plutonium, 48,000 atomic bombs 
could be manufactured with 400 tonnes of plutonium This is a 
colossal amount enough to blow off numerous planets, such as the 
earth, in an instant. What offers particular problem is that 
Japan plans to secure about 100 tonnes of plutonium by the year 
2010, though the amount of plutonium actually needed by Japan is 
estimated at 85 tonnes. (KYODO news service, 5 October 1992). 
  This means that, by 2010, Japan will store 15 more tonnes of 
plutonium than the needed for peaceful purposes, enough to 
manufacture some 2,000 nuclear bombs. Therefore, Japan's claim 
that it has stockpiled an appropriate amount of plutonium for 
economic development can never be justified. 
  A latest report on the nonproliferation of nuclear materials 
including plutonium, which an influential advisory agency worked 
out, entrusted by the U.S. Defense Department, expressed deep 
concern over Japan's nuclear armament and said Japan should be 
urged to fundamentally reexamine its nuclear policy, demanding a 
stop to the project of the demonstration reactor for a fast 
breeder reactor. 
  Urging Japan to reduce the scale of the construction of 
nuclear power stations with 12 reactors feeding on plutonium 
planned to be completed by the year 2005 and stop the 
construction of a new-type demonstration reactor following the 
Monju and the construction of the reprocessing plant No. 2 in 
Rokashomura, Aomori Prefecture, the report said potential fear 
of Japan's nuclear arming is sprouting within the U.S. 
Government. (Japanese paper MAINICHI SHIMBUN, 19 November 1993). 
  Voice of America on 6 April 1994 said that the commissioning 
of a fast breeder reactor in Japan is arousing serious 
apprehensions and uneasiness in European countries and the 
United States, to say nothing of its neighboring nations, and it 
is foreseen that it would give a greater shock to the acute 
nuclear issue. This indicates that Japan might become one of 
the largest nuclear states in the near future, the radio added. 
  Japan possesses modern means of nuclear delivery. 
  The so-called Self-Reliant Defense Program worked out by the 
Japanese Defense Agency in 1969 makes it plain that Japan would 
continue to develop and possess domestic nuclear weapons and 
ballistic missiles for their delivery. (Japanese paper ASAHI 
EVENING NEWS, 27 June 1969). 
  Japan's system of launching nuclear warheads was already 
established during the Third Program of Readjustment of the 
Defense Capacities from 1967 to 1971. The Japanese Defense 
Agency completed the domestic production of cruise missiles in 
1985 in cooperation with the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 
other companies. 
  This cruise missile is a sophisticated guided missile which 
is available for the delivery of nuclear warheads and 
conventional warheads. 
  The Japanese Self-Defense Forces successfully carried out a 
test launching of a Japanese ground-to-warship missile SSM-1 at 
the Pacific Missile Center of the U.S. Navy in California in 
the summer of 1987. (Japanese magazine, SEKAI SEIJI, first 
semimonthly issue of January 1990). 
  As of December 1991, Japan possessed 393 155-mm howitzers 
and 
132 203.2-mm howitzers which can fire nuclear warheads. The 
number of its nuclear-capable planes is on the steady increase. 
  Japan had secured 145 F-15's, new-type fighter-bombers 
with an action radius of 1,052 km by 1991. It plans to increase 
its number to 180-200 by the end of 1994. 
  It developed a new fighter-bomber FSX by remodeling the F-16 
in 1993 and plans to introduce 130 of the model by the year 2000. 
  On 4 February 1994, Japan successfully launched a new 
H2-type 
rocket No. 1, developed entirely by its independent technology, 
at a space center in Tanegashima, Kagoshima Prefecture. This 
rocket is capable of launching a two-tonne stationery satellite, 
almost four times heavier the satellite most rockets of the past 
were capable of launching. As a result of the successful launch 
of rocket No. 1, Japan's rocket development technology could 
equal that of the United States and European countries. 
(Japan's NHK Broadcasting Station, 4 February 1994) 
  This H2-type rocket is 50 meters in length and 260 tonnes in 
weight and can be converted easily into a military use. 
  The former director of the Atomic Energy Research Center of 
Rikkyo University, Japan, stated that Japan has been able to 
make substantial material and technological preparations for 
manufacturing high-performance nuclear weapons in one month or 
so. More than 150 companies and over 3,300 factories are 
involved in the manufacture of nuclear warheads in Japan. In 
recent years, Japan's investments in this domain have sharply 
increased from $1.73 million in 1954 to approximately $360 
million in 1991. (The Indian paper WORUM, 11 March 1994). 
  In actuality, Japan has built perfect material and 
technological foundations for the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons. And, government authorities of Western countries, 
including the United States, expressed concern over Japan's 
nuclear armament. 
  Speaking at the Senate Arms Service Committee on 2 February 
1994, in the capacity of defense secretary before being 
nominated as defense secretary [as heard], U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry testified that there is the strong possibility 
that Japan will pursue possessing nuclear weapons. (Japan's 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN, 8 February 1994) And, Sam Nunn, chairman of 
the U.S. Senate Armed Services, said that Japan's antinuclear 
policy is temporary and can change quickly. (Voice of America, 
31 January 1994) 
  Former Under Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said that, 
depending on circumstances, Japan will certainly join the 
nuclear club because it is fully capable of developing nuclear 
weapons in terms of technology and money. (Japan's YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN, 8 February 1994) 
  The Voice of America reported on 4 February 1994 that the 
successful launch of the H2-type rock proves that Japan's space 
technology could become a major competitor to that of the United 
States, powerful western European countries, and, in Asia in 
particular, to China. It also reported that the United States 
is greatly concerned, despite Japan's outward policy of 
denuclearization, of Japan's capability to instantaneously 
[sunsikkane], or at the latest, in a few weeks, develop a very 
large number of the most powerful nuclear shells [haektan], in 
the event that such a threat was to be raised in the future. 
  In its report to its government, the British Defense 
Ministry 
said that Japan is capable of arming itself with nuclear weapons 
very quickly and may have already manufactured atomic shells 
because it has plutonium, electronic devices, and other key 
bomb-manufacturing elements and technology. (The British 
newspaper THE SUNDAY TIMES, 30 January 1994) 
  French Foreign Minister Juppe held talks with Aichi, 
director 
general of the Japanese Defense Agency, on 1 April 1994. When 
Aichi mentioned that the French National Defense White Paper 
indicated the possibility of Japan possessing nuclear weapons, 
Juppe said that the National Defense White Paper, pointed out 
that Japan is technologically capable of developing nuclear 
weapons after considering the possibilities. He also expressed 
concern over Japan's nuclear armament. (Japan's NHK 
Broadcasting Station, 1 April 1994 and the Swedish paper SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET, 31 January 1994) 
  Japan has everything needed to manufacture instantly 
nuclear weapons and has already developed nuclear warheads that 
are ready to load the necessary amount of plutonium. (Swedish 
newspaper SVENSKA DAGBLADET, 31 January 1993) 
  Japan has everything necessary for the development of 
nuclear 
weapons. (Swiss paper (LE NOUVEAU QUOTIDIEN), 31 January 1994) 
  Japan is not only able to easily manufacture nuclear 
warheads, but is also prepared to turn into a hegemonic state 
with nuclear weapons, if it makes up its mind to do so. (South 
Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON, November 1991) 
  Japan's efforts for a nuclear buildup can only be described 
as the new generation's efforts to hold supremacy over the 
world. If things remain this way, it will not be long before 
Japan becomes a nuclear super power and exercises its power by 
regulating the supply of nuclear materials to other countries. 
(South Korean newspaper CHUNGANG ILBO, 21 July 1992) 
  Worldwide media has expressed great concern over Japan's 
nuclear armament by reporting that Japan's nuclear armament is a 
major stumbling block to the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and the rest of the world, and has called for checking 
and frustrating its attempt. 
  Paul Leventhal, director of the U.S. Nuclear Control 
Institute, in a hearing before the Diplomatic Committee 
[committee name as heard] of the U.S. Senate on 15 January 1992, 
disclosed that a major stumbling block to the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula is Japan's plan to secure plutonium, and 
called on the U.S. Government to frustrate its plan. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency should inspect 
plutonium stockpiled by Japan instead of North Korea's military 
facilities. The United Nations should call the world's attention 
to Japan's facilities, not North Korea's. Without rectifying 
the double standard policy applied by the United States and the 
United Nations, the world's nuclear issue will never be resolved 
and the world's peace and security will not be guaranteed. 
(South Korea's MUNHWA BROADCASTING COOPERATION, 16 January 1992 
and the Nepalese weekly (TRISTI) 13 May 1994) 
  Reporting that Japan's nuclear potential threatens not only 
the Korean people, but also the peoples of Asia and the rest of 
the world, people who value world peace and security should 
heighten their vigilance against Japan's nuclear armament and 
join in the international effort to hinder Japan's nuclear 
threat. (Indian newspaper (SAMACHAR POST), 19 February 1992) 
  Impeding Japan's attempt to become a militant country and 
develop its nuclear potential is a desperate demand to protect 
peace and security of Asia and the rest of the world. (Russian 
newspaper PATRIOT, 9 July 1992) 
  If Japan is armed with nuclear weapons, it will pose the 
most 
serious and grave threat to the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, it will harass peace and security of Asia and the 
rest of the world. 
  With Japan's nuclear armament reaching the dangerous level, 
the danger of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula being 
made meaningless is increasing. 
  Though Japan is promoting its nuclear armament to the danger 
point, the United States and other Western countries are turning 
blind eyes to this and carrying on a hysteric pressure campaign 
over our fictitious suspected nuclear development. This double 
standard, in fact, encourages Japan's nuclear armament. 
  The DPRK Government expresses the belief that the 
governments, parliaments, political parties, and organizations 
of all antinuclear and nonnuclear states and international 
organizations, and peace-loving people of the world will 
heighten vigilance against the dangerous moves of the Japanese 
authorities for nuclear armament and make positive contributions 
to the peace and security of Asia and the world by checking and 
frustrating them.

  [Text] New York, April 12 KYODO -- The issue of an exchange 
of special envoys between North and South Korea should be 
separated from the nuclear issue in North Korea's talks with the 
United States, a Pyongyang official said Tuesday. 
  North Korea is "strongly opposed" to making the exchange of 
envoys a topic in talks with the U.S., he said. 
  The question of separation of the two issues of inspections 
of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities and the exchange of envoys is 
likely to be a main topic during visits to South Korea, China 
and Japan by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political and 
Military Affairs Robert Gallucci from Tuesday. 
  The official described as "incorrect" reports that North 
Korea notified the U.S. at the end of March that it would permit 
further inspections of its nuclear facilities if the issue of 
the special envoys is treated separately. 
  He denied that separating the issues is enough to guarantee 
that North Korea will permit continued inspections. 
  The official said Gallucci's three-nation visit is an 
attempt 
to involve Japan and South Korea in what should be a matter for 
negotiation only between North Korea and the U.S. 
  The U.S. and South Korea have set the exchange of envoys 
aimed at laying the basis for a North-South summit, and the 
international inspections, as preconditions for North Korea-U.S. 
high level talks. 
  But North Korea maintains that the U.S. insisted on the 
conditions under pressure from South Korea. 
  Washington has spearheaded an international campaign to 
persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that its 
nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic 
weapons arsenal. 
  Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking to build an 
atomic bomb, but it refused to permit IAEA inspectors in March 
to carry out certain tests at a radio chemical laboratory. 
  Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for the inspections 
that were held last month. 
  The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the 
inspections and referred the matter to the UN Security Council, 
which issued a presidential statement on March 31 urging 
Pyongyang to permit completion of the checks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Our side had demanded 
that the South Korean side accept through Panmunjom the letter 
to the South Korean authorities, political parties, 
organisations and individual figures and overseas compatriots 
which was adopted at a joint meeting of the government, 
political parties and public organisations of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea on April 11. But, the letter had to 
be sent through radio today, since it could not be conveyed to 
the addressees due to the untenable act of the South side. 
  The letter carries a proposal to convene a national 
conference in Pyongyang or Seoul around the August 15 National 
Liberation Day. 
  If anyone denies the great unity of the nation, pushing into 
the foreground the differences in ideology, idea and political 
system even today when the danger of a war, a nuclear war, is 
hanging over the head of the nation, it would be a heinous crime 
against the nation in seeking confrontation, war and division, 
the letter says, and continues: 
  Out of the desire to carry into practice at an early date 
"10- point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country," a common guideline and 
charter of the nation which would bring unity, peace and 
reunification to our nation, we courteously propose the 
convocation of a national conference in Pyongyang or Seoul 
around August 15, one year before the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation of the country. 
  Representatives of the authorities, political parties and 
organisations and individual figures of the North and the South 
and representatives of overseas compatriots, who can represent 
the will of the whole nation, may participate in the conference 
with equal qualification, irrespective of differences in 
political view, religious belief, political affiliation and 
status, in conformity with its character and purport. 
  An open-hearted discussion on the questions of peace and 
reunification of the country, including practical measures for 
promoting the great unity of the whole nation, may take place at 
the conference. 
  If the national conference is convened, people of all strata 
and figures of various circles of the North and the South would 
open their hearts to each other and confirm that they are 
compatriots of the same blood and seek a short cut to 
reunification in the 90s by promoting great unity and pooling 
the will and wisdom of the nation, transcending differences in 
ideology, idea, political view and religious belief. 
  We think it necessary to form a preparatory committee of the 
national conference with five delegates each from the North, the 
South and overseas, in order to ensure the success of the 
national conference. 
  The preparatory committee may have its first meeting in 
Pyongyang or Seoul in May and decide on the date and place of 
the national conference and its mode and discuss other practical 
matters arising in the convocation and steering of the 
conference. 
  We think it desirable to have bilateral or multilateral 
contacts between compatriots of the North, the South and 
overseas for coordinating each other's opinions before the 
convocation of the historical national conference. 
  We express the hope that the compatriots in South Korea and 
overseas will actively respond to our proposal for the 
convocation of a national conference proceeding from a noble 
patriotic stand.

<F P=106> ["Letter" to South Korean authorities, political parties, </F>
individual figures, and overseas compatriots adopted at a joint 
meeting of DPRK Government, political parties, social 
organizations held in Pyongyang on 11 April] 
  [Text] The letter to South Korean authorities, political 
parties, individual figures, and overseas compatriots reads: 
  Compatriots at home and abroad: 
  Today, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the 
publication of the 10-point program of the great unity of the 
whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland presented 
by respected and beloved Comrade President Kim Il-song, we held 
a joint meeting of the republic's government, political parties, 
and social organizations to seriously discuss [chinjihage toui] 
measures for promoting the fatherland's independent and peaceful 
reunification by thoroughly implementing the 10-point program of 
the great unity of the whole nation. 
  We participants in the joint meeting send this letter to 
South Korean authorities, political parties, individual figures, 
and overseas compatriots from a sheer desire to jointly open the 
nation's way [chillo] with the strength of the united 70 million 
compatriots under the grave situation in which the nation's 
well-being [annyong] and the country's reunification cause are 
faced with a severe threat [omjunghi wihyop tanghago innun]. 
  It is the 70 million compatriots' firm will and a solemn 
request by the national history to realize reunification in the 
nineties by achieving the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Today, when the 49th annual layer is being added to the 
history of national division, what is coming closer to our 
people is not the reunification of the country, but the danger 
of war, nuclear war. 
  War would only bring a disaster to both the North and the 
South, giving no advantage to either side. It is too late to 
regard war, which is coming closer to the people, as just a 
danger, and we have no time to only worry about the situation 
without doing nothing. 
  Today's grave situation was derived by the nuclear commotion 
by outside forces and the bellicose forces following them, and 
has reached a more dangerous phase because of their worthless 
maneuver of stepping it up gradually [mumohan kyedansik hwaktae 
chaektong]. 
  We presented the 10-point program of the great unity of the 
whole nation, a milestone of reconciliation and unity, in April 
1993 to prevent the creation of this situation and have made all 
sincere efforts to realize the program. 
  The danger of war, which will make outside forces gain the 
third party's profit and will result in the ruin of the whole 
nation, would not have come to our country if the South Korean 
authorities had responded to [houng] our program of the great 
national unity and held our hands, their fellow countrymen. 
  All compatriots cannot forget the bitter historic lesson 
from 
illustrious officials of our country who brought the ruin of the 
country by betraying fellow countrymen to collude with outside 
forces in the past. The South Korean authorities, however, are 
going to revive [chaehyon] the history. This is intolerable. 
  We must prevent war, a national disaster, in any way. The 
way to prevent it can be seen only in achieving the great unity 
of the whole nation. The great unity of the whole nation is 
indeed the best way [kajang hullyunghan chillo] of the nation, 
which enables us to break through today's difficult situation, 
to maintain peace of the country, and to open the road to the 
fatherland's reunification. 
  The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country 
for national reunification put forward by the respected 
President Kim Il-song shows such an excellent solution for our 
fellow countrymen. 
  With its great tractive force and just and fair nature, the 
10-point program of great unity of the whole country is enjoying 
more active support and sympathy from all Korean compatriots 
with each passing day. 
  There is no reason that one cannot support the program 
today, 
which is being supported by all Korean compatriots in the North, 
the South, and overseas, even if one ignored it in the past. 
  The position toward the 10-point program of great unity of 
the whole country will be a touchstone distinguishing between 
unity and confrontation in our country, between peace and war, 
and between reunification and division. 
  Today when the danger of war--the nuclear war--is near at 
hand before the nation, if one denies the great unity of the 
country by presenting differences in ideologies, ideals, and 
systems, it will be a grave antinational crime of seeking 
confrontation, war, and division. 
  The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country is 
a 
common national guideline and chapter which gives unity, peace, 
and reunification to our people. Proceeding from the desire to 
achieve this program, we earnestly propose that a national 
conference be held in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of the 
15 August national liberation anniversary this year, one year 
before its 50th anniversary. 
  Representatives of the authorities, political parties, and 
public organizations, as well as individual figures, in the 
North and the South, who can reflect the will of the whole 
country in conformity with the nature and purpose of the 
conference, as well as representatives of overseas compatriots, 
can participate in the national meeting with equal standings, 
irrespective of differences in their political views, religion, 
affiliated organizations, and positions. 
  The national conference can frankly discuss various issues 
for the nation's peace and reunification, including practical 
measures to promote great unity of the whole country. 
  If the national conference is convened, the people and 
figures from all walks of life in the North and the South, 
opening up their hearts, can confirm that they are the same 
people who share the same blood, and can promote great unity. 
Thus, they can seek a shortcut for expeditiously achieving 
reunification in the nineties by uniting the nation's wisdom and 
will and by transcending differences in ideologies, ideals, 
political views, and religion. 
  With a view to successfully ensuring the national 
conference, 
we recognize that formation of a preparatory committee for the 
national conference, made up of five representatives 
respectively from the North, the South and overseas, is 
necessary. 
  The preparatory committee for the national conference can 
hold its first meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul in May; can decide 
on the date and place of the national meeting, as well as the 
method of the meeting; and can discuss other working-level 
matters concerning convocation and operation of the conference. 
  We also believe it is good to have bilateral and 
multilateral 
contacts between compatriots in the North, the South, and 
overseas in order to adjust their opinions before convocation of 
the historic national conference. 
  We express the hope that the compatriots in the South and 
overseas will actively respond to our proposal for convening the 
national conference, which proceeded from a position of lofty 
patriotism. 
  [Signed] The joint conference of the government, political 
parties, and public organizations in the DPRK for expediting the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the nation by 
thoroughly accomplishing the 10-point program of great unity of 
the whole country for national reunification. 
  [Date] 11 April 1994, Pyongyang

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Political, public and 
academic figures of different countries took the floor at the 
international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and 
friendship held in New Delhi over April 8-10. 
  President of the Bangladesh People's League Garib Newaz in 
his speech titled "Respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song is a 
great thinker and theoretician who has made an immortal 
contribution to the development of human thoughts and theories 
by founding the chuche idea" said the immortal contribution 
made by respected President Kim Il-song to the development of 
human thoughts and theories by founding the chuche idea is that 
he was the first in history to establish the man-centred outlook 
on the world showing a scientific way of shaping the destiny of 
man. 
  Noting Korea's socialism, an anthropocentric socialism, 
which 
was built by the great President Kim Il-song and is guided by 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is now making a long drive, smashing 
the previously unknown manoeuvrings of the imperialists and 
reactionaries, he said: "Its secret lies in that the driving 
force of revolution, an integral whole of the leader, the party 
and the masses, has been firmly built up and its role enhanced 
immensely." 
  Pak Yong-kon, director of the board of the International 
Institute of the Chuche Idea and chairman of the Association of 
Korean Social Scientists in Japan, in a speech on the subject 
"Changes in current international relations and significance of 
the chuche idea" said the chuche idea helps successfully tide 
over the confusion, disorder and unrest that have surfaced with 
changes in international relations after the end of the cold war 
and establish a new international order based on independence, 
peace and friendship. 
  Manik Lal Shrestha, director of the board of the Asian 
Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea and chief of the Nepal 
Institute for Chuche Studies, in a speech on the subject "It is 
a lawful demand for building an independent new society to push 
ahead with nature-remaking and social transformation together 
while giving precedence to human remoulding" said the theory of 
keeping human remoulding ahead of nature-remaking and social 
transformation as expounded by the chuche idea is the guideline 
in building a new society whose validity has been verified by 
the rich experience and practice of the Korean people and whose 
vitality is being displayed. 
  Vishwanath, secretary general of the council of 
"International Kim Il-song Prize" and secretary general of the 
Chuche Idea Study Society of India, in his speech titled "Great 
contribution of respected President Kim Il-song to the human 
cause of independence" said it is a distinguished contribution 
made by the great President Kim Il-song for the human cause of

long drive, unshaken by the anti- socialist manoeuvrings of the 
imperialists.

spoke on the subject "Inevitability of the downfall of 
capitalism and victory of socialism." He said the chuche idea of 
the great his excellency President Kim Il-song will be immortal.

destined to ruin and socialism emerges victorious," he stressed.

De 
Henares University of Spain, in his speech titled "President Kim 
Il-song's idea of believing in the people as in heaven" said

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Feelings of reverence 
for the great leader President Kim Il-song are growing deeper 
among the South Korean people on the occasion of his birthday. 
  A professor surnamed Choe at Seoul National University told 
his colleagues that his feelings of attachment to President Kim 
Il-song grow more intense whenever the significant April 15 
comes. 
  He said: 
  "Reverence for President Kim Il-song is a cherished 
unanimous 
feeling not only of our intellectuals but of other strata of 
people. 
  "He is a peerless patriot and the benevolent sun of our 
nation who has heralded the epoch of our nation's cause of 
independence and takes a warm care of our people. 
  "It is an obligation of our nation, therefore, to celebrate 
the 15th of April as the greatest auspicious holiday of the 
nation and deeply respect him." 
  An old man residing in Seoul said to his family: 
  "The birth of General Kim Il-song marked the beginning of 
the rebirth of the lost three thousand-ri homeland and our 
nation has since come to shed bright rays in the east with 
eternal vitality as a dignified nation. 
  "His birth was not only a great auspicious event for our 
nation but an honour of mankind." 
  A designer surnamed Kim in Chongro district, Seoul, told his 
colleagues:

anti-Japanese war and the benefactor of the national rebirth who 
saved our country from the national ruin. 
  "Since we have the general, our country will surely be 
reunified, and the day will surely come when our people will 
live under his administration."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Now, South Korean 
people deem it a greatest honour and national pride to have the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the National 
Defence Commission [NDC] of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  A worker Choe residing in Kwanak district, Seoul, upon 
hearing the news that Comrade Kim Chong-il was elected chairman 
of the DPRK Defence National Commission, said: "We workers 
regard his election as chairman of the National Defence 
Commission as our supreme honour and extend our sincere 
congratulations to him. 
  "It is only too natural that Marshal Kim Chong-il, supreme 
commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), who has 
strengthened the KPA founded by President Kim Il-song, a great 
military genius, into an invincible revolutionary Army, was 
elected chairman of the National Defence Commission." 
  Pak Il-chon, a company clerk residing in Yongdungpho 
District, Seoul, said: 
  "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is a great military genius 
with 
rare wisdom and grit. 
  "His election as NDC chairman of the DPRK is an expression 
of unquestioned trust and respect of the people in the North for 
him. 
  "Now that he has been elected NDC chairman the North will in 
the future exalt its might further to the world militarily as 
well as in political and economic aspects. This is, indeed, a 
happy event for us people in South Korea who look up to the 
North as a beacon of hope." 
  A student Yi Kwang-un at Pusan National University said: 
  "As it is guided by the dear leader Kim Chong-il, a great 
statesman and outstanding brilliant commander, the North could 
demonstrate its might in bold confrontation with the United 
States which has become the 'only superpower'. 
  "It is natural that the dear leader, such an outstanding 
strategist and famous general, was elected chairman of the 
National Defence Commission. 
  "I feel reassured when I think that he is protecting the 
life 
and destiny not only of the people in the North but of our 
entire fellow countrymen." 
  A professor surnamed Kim at Seoul National University said: 
  "General Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a famous general and 
distinguished statesman endowed with both literary and military 
accomplishments to shoulder the future of the nation. 
  "His election as chairman of the DPRK National Defence 
Commission is a reflection of the will of the people in the 
North, an event worthy of special record in the nation's 
history, a great auspicious event and the highest honour of our 
nation."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and the chief of the U.N. nuclear watchdog 
agreed on the need for further inspections in North Korea at 
their talks Tuesday. Han stopped off in Tokyo on his way to 
Moscow to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
Director-general Hans Blix, who is in the Japanese capital to 
attend a conference. 
  During the one-hour meeting, the foreign minister reminded 
Blix of the March 31 U.N. Security Council presidential 
statement urging all involved nations to engage in dialogue with 
North Korea, and suggested that the IAEA make the first offer to 
negotiate with Pyongyang, officials at the South Korean Embassy 
said. 
  He proposed that if North Korea still refuses inspections 
early next month, the IAEA should report Pyongyang's 
non-compliance based on technical information, the officials 
said. 
  IAEA inspectors went to North Korea last month but were 
denied access to critical areas necessary in determining whether 
Pyongyang diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses.

  [Text] On 12 April, North Korea claimed that the remarks 
made by Pak Yong-su, the North Korean delegate to the 
North-South working-level contact, regarding Seoul becoming a 
sea of fire during the eighth North-South working contact on 19 
March, did not mean that North Korea will start a war, and that 
the South side created an atmosphere of war by disseminating his 
remarks after distorting the meaning. 
  Appearing on a roundtable talk on a Pyongyang broadcasting 
[Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang in Korean to South Korea] program, 
Choe Song-ik, director of a department in the Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in 
North Korea, said that Pak Yong-su's remarks meant that if South 
Korea advances along the road of sanctions and war, all of the 
Korean peninsula will become a sea of fire and in this event, 
Song Yong- tae, the South side delegate, could not survive. 
Thus, Seoul cannot but be reduced to a sea of fire. He 
stressed that Pak Yong-su's remarks did not mean that North 
Korea threatened that Seoul will be a sea of fire by starting a 
war. 
  A relevant official of the National Unification Board 
stressed that as the scene was recorded on video through closed 
circuit cameras, distortion of the remarks regarding Seoul 
becoming a sea of fire is impossible, and that North Korea's 
claim is intended to shift the responsibility for the strained 
situation onto the South. 
  This official pointed out that the North Korean attempt to 
evade the responsibility for the remarks was prompted by its 
realistic judgment that the remarks on Seoul becoming a sea of 
fire, made as part of high-level psychological warfare, failed 
to disturb our society and only heightened the hard-line 
international atmosphere. He interpreted that it is highly 
likely that North Korea, in the wake of resumption of contact 
with the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, showed such a change in its position as an advance step 
for the contact. 
  Meanwhile, some people observed that the appearance of Choe 
Song- ik, the deputy delegate, on the roundtable talk instead of 
Pak Yong- su himself to explain the content of his remarks, 
supports the recent rumor that Pak Yong-su was relegated.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The vice president of 
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), 
William Taylor, and some leading figures of U.S. media arrived 
in Pyongyang Tuesday at the invitation of the Reunification 
Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, North Korea's 
central broadcasting station reported Wednesday. 
  Other invitees include CNN Vice President Eason Jordan, 
WASHINGTON TIMES Managing Editor Josette Shiner and the 
secretary- general of the Second World Peace Conference 
sponsored by the Unification Church, Antonio Betancourt. 
  The Americans were met at the airport by Reunification Panel 
Chairman Kim Yong-sun, Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong and 
the vice chairman of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations 
with Foreign Countries, O Mun-han. 
  Kim told the Americans that the Korean peninsula should be 
reunified in a peaceful manner best serving the interests of the 
Korean people. 
  Taylor previously visited Pyongyang in June 1992 and met 
with 
senior North Korean leaders, including Kim Yong-sun. 
  The Americans are among the guests marking North Korean 
President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday on April 15. 
  Meanwhile, a CSIS spokesman told a YONHAP correspondent in 
Washington that Taylor will visit Seoul from April 20-23 via 
Beijing. 
  A source well-versed on the CSIS said Taylor is carrying a 
message from the U.S. Government to North Korea in connection 
with the current nuclear stalemate.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The suggestion on 
helping North Korean escapees from Siberian gulags settle in 
South Korea is a matter officials here increasingly feel was 
better left unsaid. Seoul estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 North 
Koreans are virtually trapped in logging camps across Siberia, 
120 to 170 of whom have escaped and are now seeking asylum in 
South Korea. 
  Officials here are reluctant to even use the word "asylum" 
since North Koreans, under South Korea's Constitution, are its 
people. "Repatriation is probably a more appropriate word," says 
one Foreign Ministry official. 
  Russia is said to make about 300 million U.S. dollars from 
the wood logged at the camps. It gives 100 million dollars 
worth of wood to North Korea to pay for labor. 
  Escapees interviewed anonymously described how they and 
others had been deprived of food, beaten mercilessly and killed 
when caught trying to break out. A picture showing the chains 
binding these loggers set off widespread shudders. 
  Both Seoul and Moscow are aware of rampant human rights 
violations inside the heavily guarded camps, but they have been 
unable to find an acceptable solution. 
  Russia tried to press North Korea to improve conditions at 
the camps, threatening to cancel the logging contract that was 
to expire at the end of last year. The failure of negotiations, 
however, forced Moscow to extend the contract for another six 
months. 
  Seoul had quietly tried to help the camp escapees, asking 
Moscow to issue residential permits and let them settle inside 
Russia, or look the other way for illegal stayers. But after 
stories began appearing in the media, North Korea went on guard 
and warned against any meddling by either Seoul or Moscow. In 
its latest statement, Pyongyang said it will hold Seoul 
responsible for "kidnapping" all loggers found missing in the 
future. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, apparently conscious of 
Northern sensitivities, said last week he does not intend to 
allow repatriation of North Korean loggers at this point. "The 
escapees were quietly resettled, some in South Korea. But by 
bringing them to the public's attention, we ended up making 
North Korea nervous and forcing it to react," said the Foreign 
Ministry official. 
  Even if Seoul boldly decided to accept the loggers, the 
problem would not go away but actually worsen. More North 
Koreans would try to settle in South Korea, worsening 
inter-Korean relations already strained by the nuclear row. 
Pyongyang could well accuse Seoul of attempting to absorb North 
Korea under the guise of human rights by taking in all of its 
people. Then there is the reality that Seoul would have to pay 
for the living expenses of the escapees if they were brought 
here. All of the 120 to 170 escapees would have to be properly 
housed, trained and employed on government money. Officials say 
it takes at least 10 years for a North Korean to fully adapt to 
South Korea. 
  Some North Korean loggers are known criminal offenders, and 
accepting them would cause social problems, the officials say. 
Then there is a question of fairness. Seoul knows of an equal 
number of North Koreans in China hoping to settle in South 
Korea. Seoul cannot accept the loggers from Siberia while 
refusing North Koreans from China.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
ordered a full study Wednesday on Seoul's alternatives in 
dealing with North Korean loggers fleeing from work camps in 
Siberia. 
  Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Kim instructed 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to consult with Russian officials 
on the issue during his visit to Moscow this week. 
  Over 100 North Koreans have reportedly escaped from logging 
camps, run by Pyongyang in exchange for labor fees paid in wood, 
and are seeking resettlement in South Korea. 
  Spokesman Chu said President Kim previously shelved the 
issue 
of North Korean loggers for the time being in an effort to help 
foster an atmosphere for North Korea's return to the 
inter-Korean dialogue and their acceptance of nuclear inspection 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  "As North Korea keeps rejecting them, the president gave the 
instructions to review the issue based on the principle of 
humanitarianism," Chu said. 
  On the presidential instructions, the government will 
examine 
several ways to extend a helping hand to the North Korean 
loggers stranded in Russia. 
  The measures will include granting them asylum in South 
Korea, allowing only those loggers classified as "non-criminals" 
to resettle in the South, and having Moscow legally allow them 
to stay in Russia, a government source said. 
  "Earlier we refrained from raising the issue of the loggers 
so as not to offend North Korea. We now believe our restraint 
has no meaning at this stage when North Korea persists in their 
intransigence," he said. 
  Chu said it was from the same approach that the South 
earlier 
shelved the deployment of Patriot missiles but now promote their 
introduction because North Korea continues to reject additional 
nuclear inspection and boycott the South-North dialogue. 
  "We will decide on whether to resume the Team Spirit 
military 
exercise from the same angle," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- An intra-governmental 
meeting is scheduled for Friday to discuss Seoul's options in 
handling North Korean loggers in Siberia. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to lead the meeting 
that will most likely confirm the general principle of helping 
escaped loggers settle either in Russia or in South Korea. 
  Over 100 North Koreans at the logging camps want to come to 
South Korea but the Seoul government has been extremely careful 
not to agitate Pyongyang. 
  Officials said the initial goal will be to safely settle 
them 
in Russia by having them recognized as refugees by the U.N. High 
Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR). 
  Friday's meeting will discuss these measures along with 
action necessary in settling some of the North Korean loggers in 
South Korea, such as job training, the officials said.

  [Text] According to Japan's KYODO on 12 April, North Korea 
has turned its attention to Southeast Asia and the Middle East 
and is making efforts to explore new markets in these areas. 
  Citing the Workers' Party of Korea's organ NODONG SINMUN 
dated 7 April, KYODO reported: In his report delivered at the 
seventh session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of North 
Korea held on 6 April, Yi Song-tae, chairman of the External 
Economic Committee, said, "We should concentrate efforts on 
exploring markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, which 
are close to our country, and whose trade conditions are 
favorable to us, to firmly turn these regions into major markets 
for our country's trade." 
  KYODO explained: Chairman Yi stressed the need to strengthen 
relations with these two regions before mentioning trade 
relations with China, Russia, and former East European 
countries. This shows that North Korea has made a decision to 
expand its trade with Southeast Asia and the Middle East as an 
important strategy after adopting the new "trade-first" economic 
policy.

  [Text] Washington, April 12 (YONHAP) -- North Korean 
President Kim Il-song has asked Indonesian President Haji 
Mohamed Suharto to mediate in the dispute between the United 
States and its Asian allies and North Korea over international 
inspection of the latter's nuclear sites, the U.S. weekly 
magazine DEFENSE NEWS reported in a recent edition. Quoting 
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, the magazine said a North 
Korean diplomat in Jakarta had delivered a letter to Suharto 
from Kim, hinting Pyongyang would allow further nuclear checks. 
  The magazine said South Korean Minister of Defense Yi 
Pyong-tae will visit Washington and Tokyo in late April to 
discuss the North Korean issue. U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry is arranging a visit to Tokyo on April 22 for 
consultations on the nuclear row, the magazine quoted Shigeru 
Hatakeyama, Japan's administrative vice defense minister, as 
saying.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The vice chairman of 
China's Political Consultative Conference, Wu Xueqian, said 
Wednesday that Beijing respects Pyongyang's independence and has 
limited influence over its neighbor. 
  Meeting the press at the Shilla Hotel to wind up his visit 
here, Wu said the perception that the North Koreans do what the 
Chinese tell them to "is not true." 
  "We discuss matters of common interest with the North 
Koreans 
as this is of help to both of us, but it is entirely up to each 
side to take action on the basis of such talks," he added. 
  Asked about the need for U.N. sanctions against North Korea 
if it failed to change its policy in spite of the Security 
Council president's statement on the nuclear dispute, China's 
one-time foreign minister simply stressed the importance of 
dialogue. "Nobody can tell how the dispute will develop," he 
said. 
  Touching on North Korea's nuclear capability, he said he 
could not make any judgements because he had no information on 
its nuclear program. 
  China and North Korea have maintained a long relationship, 
and bilateral economic links have developed rapidly despite 
diplomatic normalization between Beijing and Seoul. Wu said, 
"We'll keep our relationship with North Korea on the five 
principles of peaceful co- existence, equality, reciprocity and 
others." 
  Asked to comment on the issue of revising Chinese school 
textbooks describing the Korean war as an invasion by the South, 
he said, "I don't know much about it because it's not my area of 
responsibility. When I return home I'll check into it with the 
Education Ministry and if the need for revision is justified, 
I'll see to it that the textbooks are revised." 
  He refrained from commenting on the Northward invasion 
theory, however. 
  No pressure or sanctions should be used against Pyongyang to 
maintain stability and peace on the Korean peninsula, because 
such action would only worsen the problem, he said. 
  "President Kim Yong-sam also shares this view," he added. "I 
hope for increased economic cooperation between China and South 
Korea as the two economies are mutually complementary." 
  Asked about North Korean defectors in northeast China, he 
said, "There may be such North Koreans but I don't think there 
are many of them in China. As far as I know, they have no 
influence on Beijing- Pyongyang relations."

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South 
Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su met with 
U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor in the Moroccan 
city of Marrakesh Wednesday to discuss such bilateral issues as 
opening Korea's motor vehicle market and future use of the 
feared super 301 provision. 
  They are among ministers and officials from more than 120 
countries here to sign the landmark Uruguay Round accord giving 
birth to the World Trade Organization [WTO], a more powerful 
multilateral trade system than the current General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Kim explained Seoul's position on opening its motor vehicle 
market and the two men agreed to discuss the matter further at 
the working level. 
  Kantor cited examples of Korea's unfair trade practices, 
taken from the USTR's National Trade Estimate (NTE) released 
last month, and called for elimination of tax discrimination 
against foreign cars and psychological prejudice created by 
labeling them an extravagance. 
  Kim admitted Kantor had a point, considering that foreign 
cars account for a meager 0.2 percent of the domestic market, 
but said more time and intra-governmental coordination are 
needed to resolve the problem. Noting that discussions were 
under way on acquisition and special excise tax cuts, he said 
nothing has been decided yet. 
  He pointed out that reauthorization of Super 301 ran counter 
to multilateral rules with the WTO's birth and advised prudence 
on its application. 
  The trade minister also detailed Seoul's efforts on 
intellectual property rights and asked Washington to move Korea 
to the watch list from its current spot on the priority watch 
list at this month's screening. 
  Kantor went further to ask that the tax on dyes and 
petroleum 
resin be cut to 6.5 percent from the current 13 percent, while 
Kim sought a correction in random anti-dumping action on Korean 
color televisions and oil pipelines. 
  Earlier in the day, Kim had a breakfast meeting with his 
Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) counterparts and 
discussed the date, place and agenda of a trade ministers' 
meeting slated for this fall. Kantor proposed that the meeting 
take place in Los Angeles.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
will settle the issue of repayment of loans to the former Soviet 
Union before President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Moscow in early 
June. 
  A ranking government official said Wednesday that the 
government would seek to solve the problem by accepting the 
Paris Club payment terms for part of the loans and receiving 
payment in kind for the remainder. Of the 1.47 billion U.S. 
dollars in loans extended to the former Soviet Union, the funds 
that had matured at the end of 1993 and overdue interest now 
total 380 million dollars. 
  At a working-level meeting held in Seoul late last month, 
Russia offered to assume responsibility for repaying the loans 
if South Korea agreed to reschedule them according to the 
agreement reached with the Paris Club of Western creditor 
nations. 
  South Korea countered that Russia pay part of the loans in 
kind, such as in aluminum and other industrial materials, 
opposing repayment of all of the loans under the Paris Club 
terms. The Paris Club terms stipulate installment repayment over 
five years after a two-year grace period.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and Russian 
fishermen have fixed the price of pollack caught in Russian 
waters, agreeing on a rate 18.5 percent lower than the 
international price, the fisheries administration announced 
Wednesday. 
  The agreement on this year's catch sets a rate of 420 U.S. 
dollars per ton for egg-bearing pollack and 247 dollars for 
eggless pollack. 
  Russia had asked for a minimum 515 dollars for egg-carrying 
pollack to match the international price, but South Korea had 
the upper hand in the bargaining because it voluntarily 
refrained from pollack fishing over the past year in the Okhotsk 
Sea at Moscow's request. 
  Russia declared a unilateral moratorium on Okhotsk fishing 
last year even though the area lies in international waters, 
citing depletion of resources. 
  South Korea and other countries protested but later agreed 
to 
voluntarily hold off on fishing there. 
  The two countries had already agreed on this year's quota of 
77,000 tons at last November's government-level talks but left 
the pricing to the fishermen. 
  Representatives previously held two price negotiations but 
left empty-handed after Russia demanded 520 to 550 dollars per 
ton.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Hong 
Kong opened three days of talks on an investment guarantee pact 
in Seoul Wednesday. 
  The two sides agreed the pact was necessary based on the 
growing volume of cross-investments, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. South Korea had invested 112 million U.S. dollars in the 
British colony as of the end of last June while Hong Kong poured 
283 million dollars into Korea. 
  The negotiations have been approved by both China and

returned to China in July 1997, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Malaysia 
have agreed to look into establishing a construction 
consultative body for government officials to strengthen 
bilateral cooperation in the construction field, officials here 
said Tuesday. 
  South Korean Construction Minister Kim U-sok, who is 
visiting 
Malaysia, held talks with Malaysian Public Works Minister Leo 
Moggi and asked him to take action that would allow South Korean 
builders to participate in various development projects. 
  Malaysia is pushing ahead with its "Vision 2020 Program" to 
raise per capita gross national product (GNP) to 10,000 U.S. 
dollars by 2020 and has embarked on various development projects. 
  Minister Kim proposed that Korean and Malaysian construction 
firms advance jointly into third countries including China and 
Vietnam. 
  Kim promised the Malaysian minister that South Korea will 
draft a plan for its construction businesses to transfer 
technology and provide technical education to Malaysian workers. 
  Meanwhile, South Korean builders have received 4.1 billion 
dollars in orders from Malaysia and are carrying out 1.75 
billion dollars worth of construction in 23 cases.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Major business groups 
here are trying to entice Korean scientists working abroad, 
industry sources said Tuesday. 
  Yukong Ltd., an affiliate of the Sunkyong Group, recently 
ran 
an advertisement in a bulletin published by the Association of 
Korean Scientists and Technicians in the United States. Yukong 
expressed its intention to invite specialists in chemical 
engineering, bio- medicine and the environment. 
  Kumho Co. ran a similar ad in the same bulletin, saying it 
hoped to attract scientists with doctorate degrees in mechanical 
engineering, computer engineering and polymer science. 
  Kolon Co. is also seeking several polymer science and 
chemical engineering experts while Kia Motors Corp. wants 
experts on the environment and safety devices of automobiles. 
  In an edition of the same bulletin late last year, SKC Co. 
sought to attract experts in chemical engineering and material 
science while Cheil Foods and Chemicals Co. wanted researchers 
in molecular biology and microbiology. 
  "It was unusual for Korean companies to have direct contacts 
with Korean scientists abroad in the past, but now they want to 
have direct contacts only after recognizing their names on lists 
of scientists' association," an official of the Korean 
Federation of Science and Technology Society said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae, the 
presidential office, Wednesday handed down to all government 
offices a set of measures to better produce or secure 
specialized personnel with a view to building up the nation's 
overall international competitiveness. 
  Yi Eui-kon, senior presidential secretary for government 
affairs, said the steps had been prepared after confusion 
surfaced in key government programs such as Uruguay Round 
negotiations and dealing with the North Korean nuclear question. 
  "All government offices are expected to work out detailed 
programs based on the steps to secure specialized manpower on 
their own," Yi said. 
  The measures given by Chongwadae include the idea of 
restructuring public officials training programs in a way that 
gives more emphasis on the training of specialized personnel, 
and sending more public officials to international organizations 
for temporary duties there. 
  Another measure calls for the rotation of officials among 
externally related offices like the Economic Planning Board, 
Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Foreign Ministry. 
  Also under one of the measures, special allowances are to be 
given to qualified recruits to reduce wage gap between public 
officials and private industry people.

  [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The floor leaders of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party and main opposition Democratic 
Party on Wednesday agreed to investigate for 20 days alleged 
irregularities in the Defense Ministry's Sangmudae project where 
military facilities in Kwangju were moved to the city's 
outskirts in 1990. 
  The project was undertaken in August 1990 and completed in 
November 1992 by Hyundai Construction Co. and Chongwoo 
Construction Co. 
  In the process, Chongwoo President Cho Ki-hyon embezzled 
part 
of the payment, prompting the main opposition Democratic Party 
(DP) to charge that some of the embezzled money may have flowed 
into the political sector. 
  The DP has formed its own investigative team, led by Rep. 
Chong Tae-chol who first "exposed" the irregularities. It found 
that Cho embezzled 22.7 billion won out of the total payment of 
65.8 billion won. 
  The DP claims that part of the 22.7 billion won may have 
been 
used as political funds by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
  The problem would be simpler if it ended there. But 
suspicions began to snowball when Cho told the prosecution that 
he had donated 8 billion won out of the embezzled money to 
Tonghwa Temple in Taegu and another 4.5 billion won in the form 
of various contributions to the Chogye Buddhist order. 
  Although the opposition party could not substantiate its 
claim that part of Cho's donations had seeped into the political 
sector, it wants to invoke parliament's right to probe the uses 
of the slush fund. 
  Rep. Chong claimed that out of the 22.7 billion won, Cho had 
spent only 2 billion won on purchasing a villa. 
  There is a strong possibility, he said, that the rest of the 
money may have gone to "officials of the present administration 
as well as those from former President No Tae-u's government." 
  The DP is pointing the finger at one ruling party official, 
a 
former Army chief of staff, a former director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning and the chief of the Presidential 
Security Service as the men who channelled the money into 
political funds. 
  The DP has even identified the men by supplying the initials 
of their last names. 
  In addition, the opposition party claims that during the 
1992 
presidential campaign, ruling party campaigners visited major 
Buddhist temples around the country and "handed envelopes 
stuffed with millions of won" at prayer meetings of a highly 
political nature. 
  The suspicions have doubled since the Rev. Mukong, chief 
monk 
of Tonghwa Temple, said he had not received a penny from Cho, 
who told authorities he had donated 8 billion won to the temple 
to build a huge image of Buddha. 
  As a result, the DP believes that most of Cho's embezzled 
money may have gone to the political circle through officials of 
the Agency for National Security Planning or then-Army chief of 
staff Gen. Yi Chin-sam, who was reported Wednesday to have 
suddenly left the country for the United States last Friday. 
  Alternatively, the money could have been used as bribes by 
Cho, the DP said. 
  This is what the opposition party wants to find out if the 
National Assembly invokes its investigation right. It says the 
initial results of the probe by the prosecution are insufficient 
and suspicious points remain. 
  The DP also wants to determine the relationship between Cho 
and the Chogye Buddhist order, whether the order's chief 
executive, the Rev. So Ui-hyon, was involved in the possible 
scandal and how Chongwoo Construction Co., which was but a small 
builder, received a share of the project. 
  The Democratic Liberal Party, however, describes the DP's 
charge as "a vague suspicion" and says the opposition party only 
wants to use "the unsubstantiated theory" as a weapon in its 
political offensive against the ruling party. 
  Yet the DLP is not opposed to a National Assembly 
investigation into the allegation. "Let us uncover what we can 
if there is indeed anything," it says. 
  Both the presidential office and the DLP have already 
pointed 
out that the Sangmudae project was carried out by the No 
administration and that Chongwadae has received none of the 
alleged 8 billion won.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The Labor Ministry hopes 
to persuade management and labor to agree on wage hikes of 5.0 
percent to 8.7 percent this year, which was approved by the 
Korea Employers Association and the Federation of Korean Trade 
Unions on March 30. 
  The Ministry sent a guideline on this year's pay hikes to 45 
local labor offices, which are to work for increases below 5 
percent in prosperous industries such as electronics, 
shipbuilding and automobiles, because large rises in these areas 
might affect other sectors. 
  It also decided that wage negotiations should be settled 
before late May. 
  The Ministry hopes that wage hikes will be meted out not 
under the seniority system, but according to merit that fully 
reflects the achievements of workers. 
  The Ministry will help management and labor in settling wage 
negotiations and a trade agreement at the same time.

visit to Vietnam. He was seen off by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who conveyed him greetings from Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  Speaking to Mr. Cam, Mr. Keating expressed pleasure at his 
Vietnam visit. His meetings with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
President Le Duc Anh have contributed to better mutual 
understanding and promotion of bilateral ties. He showed 
concern for the development of Vietnam in general and Hanoi, in 
particular. 
  Besides doubling its development assistance to Vietnam in 
the 
coming four years, Australia will provide Hanoi with a separate 
aid package for preservation of Hanoi's historical areas. 
  Mr. Keating highly valued Vietnam's role in the region and 
wished that Vietnam will increase its cooperation with Australia 
to promote development and peace in Asia and the Pacific.

<F P=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his 
way home after a three-nation tour of Asia. Mr. Keating's trip 
took him to Laos, Thailand, and finally Vietnam, where he 
invited the communist party leader, Do Muoi, to visit Australia. 
It's an invitation the Vietnamese leader accepted and this is 
sure to cause unhappiness among some of the Vietnamese who fled 
their country after the communist's victory in 1975 and now live 
in Australia. Christopher Kremmer reports from Hanoi that Mr. Do 
Muoi will be seen as a more provocative figure than the 
reformist prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, whose presence in 
Australia last year led to demonstrations by Australian 
Vietnamese. 
  [Begin Kremmer recording] It's the oldest rule of war -- 
both 
sides on two-fronts -- and Mr. Keating has broken it. His 
invitation to communist party chief Do Muoi proved alienating an 
important lobby group, which so far has remained relatively 
quiet about his visit to Vietnam. The invitation was issued 
during what one official described as unusually long and 
interesting talks between Mr. Keating and the 76-year-old party 
leader in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday. The VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY 
later reported that it has been accepted by Do Muoi with 
pleasure. As the party chief has in recent months been visiting 
neighboring ASEAN countries, an invitation to come to Australia 
was unexpected. Even a reformist leader like Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet attracted the wrath of a small section of the 
Vietnamese community when he visited Australia last year. But 
Do Muoi, head of the party which maintains armed [word 
indistinct] party-rule over Vietnam is an entirely different 
matter. He represents to some Australian Vietnamese a painful 
reminder of a war which did so much damage and deprecation to 
their lives. And as Vietnam [word indistinct], that it was not 
just the allies who were responsible for atrocities in the war. 
Terror was a weapon used by both sides to polarize communities 
and keep villagers on side. A communist party government is 
still accused by Asia Watch and other human right and religious 
groups of serious infringements of civil liberties and political 
rights. Above all the right of the people to choose their 
government at free election. As one commentator remarked 
recently a great deal of history stands between Vietnam and 
United States. The same could be said of Vietnam and Australia. 
The commentator went on to observe that while communism may be 
dead in Vietnam, authoritarianism is thriving. That affects the 
relatives of Australian Vietnamese still living here. Do Muoi's 
communist party is seen by some as bearing most responsibility. 
Mr. Keating has observed that the wounds of war are still deep 
in Vietnam, but the wounds are also deeply felt by Vietnamese 
who fled their homeland for Australia and many of them are 
unlikely to be impressed by the invitation. [end recording]

with the Palestinian issue at the core. 
  Vietnam supports the current peace process in the Middle

<F P=106> [Essay by Hong Thang: "The Vietnam International Trade Fair </F>
'94 and the Marketing Issue in Business"] 
  [Summary] "The Vietnam International Trade Fair '94 just 
concluded. Unlike previous trade fairs, this trade fair took 
place after the United States lifted its trade embargo against 
Vietnam, thus allowing for the participation of giant foreign 
companies and consortiums. Some countries had as many as 40 
exhibition booths each. After a period of interruption because 
of difficulties on their part, the Russian Federation and East 
European countries, which were Vietnam's former trade partners, 
have returned to the Vietnamese market. They participated in 
this fair with dozens of exhibition booths." 
  We had an encounter with Mr. Aleksandr Araganov, marketing 
director of the Voltine Volgagrade company. He told us of the 
past trade cooperation between his company and other Vietnamese 
trade partners. 
  He said: "We regard Vietnam as a big trade partner. Earlier 
our Voltine company sold many car tire products in the 
Vietnamese market even during the period when the U.S. trade 
embargo was still in place. The financial settlement between 
our company and your country had some difficulties, but both 
sides sought to tackle this problem by exporting their goods in 
the form of barter trade. Although there are many companies now 
advertising their car tire products in Vietnam, we are not 
balked at facing such competition because the tires manufactured 
by the Voltine company are destined for use by heavy-duty trucks 
and agricultural machines." 
  This was the first time for the United States to participate 
in the Vietnam International Trade Fair with large consortiums 
and companies such as Coca Cola and the Chrysler Auto 
Manufacturing Consortium. Mr. Sirigaba, a representative at the 
Chrysler Jeep truck booth, said: "The Chrysler consortium in 
particular and other American companies in general were very 
pleased to see the U.S. embargo against Vietnam being lifted. 
We are also very excited to make a comeback to do trade 
business with Vietnam. We affirm that Vietnam with over 70 
million in population is an important market." 
  He went on: "It is regrettable that we have been a little 
bit late entering the Vietnamese market when compared to other 
countries." 
  Among those participating in the fair were Japan, China, the 
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The fair, which 
was held at the Giang Vo exhibition complex in Hanoi, featured 
over 350 exhibition booths which were organized into nine 
sections. This year the volume of goods on display at the fair 
were three to four times as many as that in last year. 
  "The U.S.-owned Cola Cola company tried to reduce the price 
of its products below production cost for competitive and 
advertising purposes. But because of the poor customer-service 
attitude adopted by its personnel, the company's products were 
not welcomed by customers. Whereas, all the refreshment soft 
drinks -- a product manufactured under the joint venture between 
Vietnam's (Pecatro) company and the Russian Federation -- of the 
Minsk company's booth, were sold out thanks to its guaranteed 
qualities and hospitable attitude of its customer service 
personnel." 
  Worthy of note is that "only two hours after the opening of 
the trade fair, the booth of the VINACOMEX Import-Export 
Construction Company, was able to ink a contract to sell a 
shovelling machine worth $210,000. Thanks to the display of 
their unique indigenous products, the booths of Thai Binh and 
Hai Hung Provinces were also able to attract many some dozens of 
foreign trade delegations which came to discuss business 
affairs. With the Thai Binh booth in particular, foreign 
customers agreed to purchase relatively large quantities of 
metal products and bicycle parts." 
  Many people believed that the results obtained from this 
fair 
exceeded our expectations.

  [Text] Another massacre of Vietnamese nationals in 
Cambodia has been carried out by the Khmer Rouge. The incident 
occurred in Hamlet 8, Troeuy Sla village, S'ang District of 
Kandal Province on 9 April. This act has caused strong 
indignation within the Vietnamese Government and population. It 
is not the first massacre. The Khmer Rouge have never given up 
their intention to kill Vietnamese nationals who are now living 
in Cambodia. Hundreds of Vietnamese nationals, especially 
fishermen in Battambang and Siem Reap Provinces have been killed 
or wounded by armed attacks from the Khmer Rouge. The attacks 
were very barbarous. 
  This time, 13 people were killed and 27 others wounded; nine 
were children and one woman with a 23-day-old child. The mother 
was killed and the child wounded. 
  In its statement on Monday [11 April], the Vietnamese 
Government held that following a series of previous cruel acts 
of terrorism against Vietnamese nationals, this massacre once 
again was an open challenge to mankind's conscience and brazenly 
violated human rights recognized in international conventions. 
  The statement said that this savage act was clearly aimed at 
arousing national hatred and destroying the traditional 
friendship between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples. 
  The Vietnamese Government strongly condemns the latest mass 
killing and earnestly asks Prince Sihanouk and the Government of 
Cambodia to take urgent and effective measures to ensure safety 
of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. They have the right to a 
peaceful life as do other foreign residents in Cambodia in 
conformity with the spirit and words of the joint communique of 
4 April 1994. 
  The Vietnamese Government also called on the United Nations, 
other signatories of the Paris agreement on Cambodia, and the 
world public to voice their protest and to take resolute 
measures to prevent such terrorism against Vietnamese nationals. 
  A representative of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry had a 
meeting with the Cambodian Charge d'Affaires in Hanoi Mr. Chhong 
Toeng, telling him of the anger of the Government and people of 
Vietnam over the mass killing. The Cambodian official was asked 
to convey immediately to the Cambodian Government Vietnam's 
demand for urgent, effective measures to put a stop to the 
killing of Vietnamese nationals. 
  Earlier, the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia sent note to 
Cambodians, diplomatic corps, and international organizations in 
Cambodia denouncing this cruel act of the Khmer Rouge.

modernization as set forth by the midterm national party 
conference resolution. 
  The deputy prime minister stressed: Phu Quoc plays an 
important role in all domains, is rich in sea products, and has 
many strengths in tourism and the service industries. It is

<F P=106> [Report by Hoang Van Hau] </F>
  [Text] In early 1993, Binh Duong village in Vinh Phu 
Province and Cuong Thinh village in Yen Bai Province were chosen 
by the 2d Military Region headquarters as "pilot sites" for 
youths to perform their military service locally in militia 
units. 
  It is not that the enforcement of this policy has been 
carried out without a hitch. Questions have arisen: What is 
the growing role of the militia force as youths are now allowed 
to perform their military service locally in militia 
detachments? Will this policy have any impact on annual 
military conscription criteria? How will operating funds be 
guaranteed? These worries and questions have been gradually 
ironed out and redressed. 
  The cadre-related task must be tackled first. All the 
comrades selected must be those having a high sense of 
responsibility and good skills in management and military 
training. The contingent of instructors is reported to have 
been reinforced by district military affairs agencies with 
officers who have good training experience. 
  Thanks to satisfactory didactical propaganda, 100 percent of 
the local youths of military age have volunteered to apply for 
joining local militia units. This policy has won sympathy and 
support from the people and from the families of the youths 
concerned. After two months of training, trainees will be 
equipped with political, technical, and combat tactics-related 
knowledge equivalent to the level required from a new recruit. 
In addition to their basic training program, trainees will also 
study local economic development tasks, experiences on the 
carrying out family economies, and stock-breeding and crop 
cultivation techniques. 
  In order to ensure room and board facilities and every-day 
life during the training course, various militia units have 
successfully carried out the motto "Localities, families, and 
individuals care together." Apart from the assistance provided 
by the localities concerned, the families of the youths 
concerned and their parent militia units have devised plans to 
do economic businesses for self-sufficiency purposes such as 
accepting contracts for tree planting, forestry protection, 
stock-breeding, and farmland irrigation services. 
  After one year of implementation, although there remains a 
number of newly-arising problems to be resolved, the qualities 
of the local militia force have improved noticeably. Public 
security and social order and safety in various localities have 
been firmly maintained and social vices have been gradually 
dispelled. Trainees have familiarized themselves with the 
collective life and have been equipped with a military bearing. 
Each member of militia detachments has become a positive factor 
of their relevant localities and families in complying with 
party policies, state law, and other regulations of the 
localities concerned.

<F P=106> [From the "Topical Talk" feature] </F>
  [Summary] Dear comrades and friends: At its fourth session 
in late 1993, the Ninth National Assembly issued a resolution on 
practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption, 
and smuggling. Acting in line with this National Assembly 
resolution, all echelons and sectors have made many efforts to 
effect changes for the better in the front against wasteful 
spending, corruption, and smuggling. 
  As far as the Army is concerned, efforts were made in 1993 
to 
accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling a step 
further and carry out the campaign to practice thrift and fight 
wasteful spending. Positive results have been recorded. Since 
early 1994, the Ministry of National Defense has instructed all 
echelons, sectors, agencies, and units to implement the 
aforementioned tasks. In the framework of that campaign, an 
all-Army conference against corruption and smuggling was 
convened in late 1993 in the north and early 1994 in the south. 
The conference aimed to derive experiences and discuss measures 
to coordinate action among military units, as well as between 
military units and state agencies, in dealing with smuggling or 
attempts by Army units to help private dealers carry out illegal 
business activities. 
  The minister of national defense also signed a decision on 
the management of military vehicles and equipment. Under this 
decision, with the exception of vehicles with permits to engage 
in economic activities, all military vehicles are prohibited 
from transporting goods for private dealers or for non-military 
agencies and organizations. 
  Furthermore, the Ministry of National Defense set up a 
standing committee to oversee the campaign against corruption 
and smuggling in the armed forces. Acting in line with the 
ministry's common guidelines, all military agencies and units 
have, since the very beginning of 1994, drawn experiences from 
the movement against corruption and smuggling and consolidated 
steering committees a step further. 
  Regarding the movement for thrift and against wasteful 
spending, the Ministry of National Defense has issued a 
directive requesting all agencies to make a thorough review of 
spending and detect loopholes that could easily lead to wasteful 
spending or the misappropriation of public funds. In 
implementing this directive, many military agencies and units 
made arrangements for cadres and combatants concerned to study 
new state and Army regulations and rules and henceforth 
formulate new management systems to deal effectively with 
corruption and smuggling. The national defense agencies 
concerned also reviewed the various policies and regulations 
governing the movement for thrift and against wasteful spending. 
  Along with settling complaints and letters of denunciation, 
the national defense inspection sector also made joint 
investigations with commanding officers into many cases of 
financial or logistical mismanagement. 
  Inspection and investigation results indicate that the 
situation in which private dealers use the names of Army units 
to carry out illegal business activities remains quite common. 
In the first quarter of 1994, the ratio of corruption cases 
involving party members was 52 percent. A total of 14 party 
members were subjected to disciplinary measures. The number of 
smuggling cases involving party members decreased by 32 percent. 
A total of 27 party members were subjected to disciplinary 
measures. 
  Regarding the movement against corruption, the number of 
corruption cases has continued to decline since December 1993. 
Nonetheless, the seriousness and sophistication of cases is on 
the rise. The Military Organ of Control initiated legal 
proceedings in five cases involving 10 defendants. 
  Regarding the movement against smuggling, according to 
preliminary reports as many as 7,000 packs of foreign 
cigarettes, 46 television sets, 62 ceiling fans, 14,000 meters 
of fabrics, 100 tons of cement, and 24.4 kilos of opium were 
seized. 
  To accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling 
in the days ahead, the minister of national defense issued a 
decision on 28 March 1994 establishing a standing committee 
against corruption and smuggling. The decision reminded all 
echelons and sectors of the need to understand thoroughly the 
policy on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, 
corruption, and smuggling. Efforts must be made to cope 
effectively with the aforementioned negative phenomena and 
restore order, discipline, and lawfulness. Steps must be taken 
to enhance the efficiency of state management agencies. It is 
necessary for agencies and units under the direct management of 
the Ministry of National Defense to formulate well-defined 
programs of action and adopt practical measures to implement 
them. More efforts are needed to uphold the sense of 
responsibility of party committee echelons and commanding 
officers at all levels. Adequate educational activities must be 
organized to help cadres and combatants thoroughly understand 
and strictly abide by Army and state policies and lines 
prohibiting illegal business activities and attempts to lend a 
helping hand to smugglers and tax evaders. Continued efforts 
are needed to conduct thorough investigations into cases of 
mismanagement of public funds, housing facilities, land, and 
military means of transportation. Drastic measures must be taken 
to initiate legal proceedings against corruption and smuggling 
cases. Violators must be dealt with to the full extent of state 
law and Army discipline. 
  Dear comrades and friends, practicing thrift and fighting 
corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending constitutes an 
important task to be carried out by all Army units. If we 
implement this task satisfactorily, we will contribute to 
building a firm and powerful Army; purifying social relations; 
establishing order, discipline, and law; and enhancing the 
efficiency of state management over socioeconomic development, 
thereby continuing to advance the fatherland along the socialist 
path.

  [Text] At the recent 19th conference of the Ho Chi Minh 
City People's Committee, the City Anti-Corruption Steering 
Committee reported on its work in 1993 and the first quarter of 
1994. 
  The report said that various major corruption cases were 
investigated and concluded, including those of the Saigon Auto 
and LEGAMEX companies. The city communications and transport 
office has also concluded seven cases with losses to state worth 
90,141,000 dong and 100 cubic meter of timber. The city has 
recovered state properties worth 1.35 billion dong. 
  Regarding the investigation of other cases, the city has 
arrested several offenders involved in the illegal trade and use 
of electricity as well as irregularities at the city 
refrigerating company. 
  The City People's Court has tried many major cases of public 
interest, including those of the Luc Quoc Hotel, the COXIVINA 
Company, the Anh Hong Enterprise, and the Cai Be Tourism and 
Cultural Service Corporation. 
  In the days ahead, the committee will integrate efforts to 
investigate major corruption cases that cause serious losses to 
state properties while urging the City People's Court to 
urgently try various cases that have been sufficiently 
investigated.

structure to make full use of potentials in the development of 
industry, agriculture and tourist services. As a result, the 
output of its industry, small industries and handicrafts 
increased by more than 7 percent and export and services value 
by more than 25 percent annually.

delegation acknowledged high efforts made by the local party, 
administration and people as well as the close cooperation 
between the islanders and soldiers in the construction and 
defence of the islands. The N.A. deputies approved the Cat Ba 
project on tapping the island's economic potentials, especially 
the sea products and tourism. They reminded the population 
about the important position of the island in terms of security 
and national defence. They also pointed out the out-standing 
socio-economic security and defence issues of Bach Long Vi 
District and the Cat Ba Island and urged the local 
administrations any people to him efforts to solve. [sentence as

<F P=106> [Article by Quang Thong: "Opening the Door for National </F>
Development and Protection] 
  [Text] Our country has entered a period of door-opening. 
Advantages have never been so good as they are today. This is a 
result of our dynamic economy, stable politics, and correct 
diplomatic policy. A person or a family with few friends and 
lots of enemies would have many worries and incalculable 
misfortune. A country, if faced with the same situation, would 
be much worse. Therefore, door-opening is a great success 
arising from our party's renovative thinking. 
  Our party's great thinking is to build a 
dynamically-developed society along the socialist path with a 
prosperous population, strong nation, and an equitable and 
civilized society. But that path is being targeted for sabotage 
by hostile forces. We must realize clearly the motto of being 
open-minded toward everybody and honest with friends, and never 
belittling the political wisdom and shrewdness of a nation and 
its people. That is a lesson for everybody in the current trend 
of integration and development and is needed for the world to 
coexist peacefully amid never-ending conflict. 
  We do not exaggerate the dangers while great opportunities 
have arisen. Our people, with their incomparable and sincere 
desire for peace, are easily moved by the offer of any 
cooperative hands. They gratefully view this as an act of 
sharing our suffering. As our people are grateful, they will 
never forget the kindness given to them by the peoples of 
friendly countries during their fight against the French and the 
United States. Despite countless difficulties, these friendly 
peoples encouraged, supported, and assisted us. That sincere act 
came from the depth of their hearts. It will not be our fault 
should history ever leave any unsavory mark on anybody. 
  "Why should we be vigilant? If I come to you with 
suspicions, can I cooperate with you enthusiastically?" The 
answer is: "We do not suspect anybody when we think of 
cooperation for mutual benefit. We open our door widely to 
welcome anyone, irrespective of political affiliation, who 
arrives to cooperate with the Vietnamese people for economic 
development and cultural exchange. But we will not allow anyone 
to interfere in our internal affairs to divert us from the Uncle 
Ho-directed path already chosen by our party and people." 
  We cherish peace. We absolutely do not want war, including 
the bloody anti-aggression war and the silent war against the 
peaceful evolution strategy. As Trotsky put it: "You may not 
be concerned about strategies, but strategies do concern you." 
  Real information and activities, most of them clandestine 
and 
illegal, show that the "peaceful evolution" strategy is a prop 
for the enemy's riotous and subversive activities and is being 
undertaken to a great extent. External reactionary forces 
working hand in glove with internal reactionary and dissident 
elements have publicly declared their intention to eliminate our 
socialist regime. Door-opening, which is considered by us as one 
of the advantages of the new situation, is also a dream for 
those hostile forces which are conspiring to eliminate our 
regime. 
  The enemy has drawn on their successful lessons of 
experience, obtained from East Europe and the Soviet Union in 
using their "peaceful evolution" strategy with its sweet and 
gentle tricks, to attack Vietnam. Being a well-experienced 
party, "it" [the enemy] will not directly attack our strategic 
command. The enemy will take advantage of our shortcomings and 
negligence. They will find a way into our intermediate-level 
management echelons and into every nook and cranny of villages 
and hamlets. They will seek to buy support, sow division among 
the people, and incite bad elements to oppose us as the 
opportunities arise before they start riotous and subversive 
activities. 
  [Text] We are vigilant, but not childish to the point of 
seeing everyone as our enemy, gradually closing our door, or 
being panic-stricken. We are alert and confident. We are 
vigilant to protect the survival of our regime and especially 
our pattern of defense and development as a nation. 
  Remaining vigilant is the consciousness of the entire 
people. 
But great responsibility rests with the Armed Forces. Even in 
some countries where no gunfire has been heard for hundreds of 
years, priority efforts continue to strengthen their defense 
forces and their armies. Their soldiers are sweating and even 
bleeding in their combat drills. The history of our country is 
one stained with the blood of aggressors. We can still recall 
the story of Ms. Vo Thi Thang who, after walking out free from 
the Con Dao prison with her "victorious smile," went to Cuba for 
a visit where an elderly lady struggled with the crowd to reach 
her. Embracing her, she said to her in tears: "How beautiful 
and gentle you are. Vietnam is so loyal and appreciative. Why 
is it that the enemy continues to target your country for their 
invasion, killing, and sabotaging?" 
  The Armed Forces must first be strengthened in line with our 
national strategy. We do not like to see a country with very 
poor revenue bearing a very high defense budget. But in order 
to have a peaceful country for construction, a strong people's 
Army is of paramount importance. Safeguarding independence and 
sovereignty and achieving socio-political stability are 
important conditions for economic development and national 
construction. 
  The incident in East Europe and the Soviet Union woke up all 
revolutionary nations over the social class nature of the Armed 
Forces. At present, to heighten a sense of vigilance for the 
Army, we must first of all train it to become politically stable 
and absolutely loyal to the socialist regime, the party, and the 
people. In an attempt to overthrow our regime, the enemy is 
eager to see nothing other than a Vietnamese Army having vague 
political knowledge, waning willpower and determination, and a 
falling organizational structure. Therefore, in heightening a 
sense of vigilance, not only will the Army have to equip itself 
with high combat skills so it can be ready to smash all external 
acts of aggression but it will also have to serve as solid prop 
to maintain internal political stability. Hostile forces are 
trying by all means to exploit our negligence, weaknesses, and 
internal difficulties to create troubles here and there. We 
should maintain a high sense of vigilance to prevent bad 
phenomena from occurring. As they are undergoing their 
combat-readiness training, Army units must contribute their 
utmost effort to make the public thoroughly aware of the party's 
revolutionary lines and the enemy's sabotage schemes. The units 
must try to build a strong political structure from among the 
people. 
  In their new strategy, hostile forces are "paying particular 
attention to us." Their attacking weapons are not guns and 
ammunition, but rather sweet words to the ears and freshly 
fragrant handkerchiefs. They want us to stray off our course, 
eliminate the party, depoliticize the Army, negate all our 
socialist achievements, and eventually, direct their artillery 
attack at our history and smear our banner which has been 
reddened with the blood of our predecessors. 
  At the recent All-Army National Congress, delegates 
discussed 
and fully understood the meaning of a party Central Committee 
resolution on achievements scored, and on new opportunities and 
challenges. This is vivid evidence that the Army has upheld the 
lesson of remaining vigilant to stabilize politics, develop the 
nation, and protect the regime and the fatherland.

  [Text] The Central Ideological Agencies Bloc party 
organization opened its third mid-term party conference in Hanoi 
this morning. Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political 
Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee, attended 
and addressed the conference. 
  According to the report presented by the Central Ideological 
Agencies Bloc party organization's executive committee, for more 
than two years now, ideological, cultural, and artistic 
activities have helped to motivate everyone to step up 
production and score achievements in all fields. The report 
also pointed out a number of drawbacks that need to be overcome. 
  Based on past achievements and shortcomings, the report set 
forth the key orientations for 1994-95 as follows: It is 
necessary to satisfactorily implement the party Central 
Committee's resolutions on the need to carry out ideological, 
cultural, and artistic activities aimed at shifting the country 
to a new stage of development through the implementation of a 
national industrialization and modernization program based on 
socialist orientations. 
  The report stressed the importance of party-building 
activities. It is necessary for all party organizations to 
concentrate efforts on enhancing party militancy; overcoming the 
danger of socialist disorientation; fighting all indications of 
waste, red tape, and corruption; eliminating the danger of being 
left behind; and foiling the enemy's peaceful evolution 
strategy. It is particularly important for party chapters to 
devise practical and interesting party activities to make them 
appeal to the masses. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh pointed 
out the important role of ideological and cultural activities in 
enhancing party militancy. It is necessary to make cadres, 
party members, and the entire people clearly understand that 
given the country's new development stage, everyone must strive 
to overcome difficulties, step up production, and avoid the 
danger of being left behind. It is important for theoretical 
agencies to draw practical experiences from national and 
international developments at an early date. It is equally 
important for the mass media to step up propaganda activities 
aimed at making the people sharpen their determination and at 
encouraging businessmen to improve their skills. It is 
particularly important for the Central Ideological Agencies Bloc 
party organization to make everyone clearly understand the 
enemy's peaceful evolution strategy aimed at creating political 
unrest and at undermining our national development efforts. 
  Also at today's session, many delegates expressed their 
views, further clarifying the causes leading to problems and 
suggesting measures to carry out the tasks for the days ahead. 
  The conference is scheduled to last for two days.

  [Report by Tran Trong Chuy] 
  [Summary] The 15th Executive Committee of the Quang 
Nam-Danang Province party organization recently held its midterm 
party conference to discuss socioeconomic targets to be achieved 
during the 1994-95 period. 
  "All those who spoke unanimously agreed with a political 
report presented at the conference. They said: Over the past 
two years, particularly in 1993, Quang Nam-Danang Province 
continued to maintain its socioeconomic stability. Its 
socioeconomic situation, in certain areas, continued to develop. 
Its economic structure is shifting in a positive direction. 
The latent potential of various economic components is being 
generated. The province's gross social product increased from 
1,000 billion dong in 1991 to nearly 1,120 billion dong in 1993 
while its budget revenue rose from 190 billion dong in 1991 to 
over 500 billion in 1993. Its average industrial output value 
increased 8 percent per year. A number of economic sectors 
developed fairly well such as marine products, import-export, 
and tourism service." 
  Thanks to the growth of foreign economic relations, the 
industrial sector of Quang Nam-Danang Province is improving. 
"The construction of many industrial projects has started such 
as the Hoa Khuong cement factory and a local branch of the Hoang 
Thach cement factory. Various new industrial zones, including 
the An Don-Nuoc Man processing zone, are taking shape in Dien 
Nam and Dien Ngoc Districts, and in the southern part of Hai Van 
Pass." 
  Weaknesses discussed during the conference consisted of 
"Quang Nam-Danang having fallen behind economically when 
compared with other localities. Its economic development is 
slow because there still exist many backward areas, particularly 
those in the mountain region. Delegates from Que Son, Tien 
Phuoc, and Tra My Districts reported that 50 to 60 percent of 
their local populations are now still in a state of food 
shortage due to the absence of farmland irrigation projects and 
other grass roots facilities." 
  The conference unanimously held that "the main reasons for 
this situation were a failure on the part of the provincial 
party standing committee and people's committee to meet new 
development requirements." All participating delegates shared 
Comrade Vo Chi Cong's views expressed at the conference that 
Quang Nam-Danang does not lack talent. The problem is how to 
gather all the wisdom of this talent. 
  In the period ahead, the province needs to promptly shift 
its 
economy in the direction of industrialization; achieve an 
industrial output value increase of 45 percent by 1995; 
specialize its agricultural, forestry, and fishery production; 
create more exports; step up the program to do away with hunger 
and reduce poverty; increase the annual export value to $50 
million; and reduce the agricultural workforce to 60 or 65 
percent of the total population in order to save manpower for 
the processing industry. 
  "The midterm party conference of the Quang Nam-Danang 
Province party organization called for an annual gross domestic 
product increase from 10 percent upward." 
  The issues of party building and internal unity were also 
fervently debated. "Many delegates pointed out that party 
building and party management at various echelons have displayed 
many shortcomings. A number of party cadres and members have 
suffered a dereliction in quality. Their knowledge is not 
current and their sense of discipline is poor. Personal 
jealousy has led to prolonged disunity among a number of cadres. 
Many delegates held that far from being an ethical problem of 
party cadres and members, corruption has become a political 
problem that has caused a loss of confidence among the people. 
This has been exploited by the enemy and has, of course, 
adversely affected the party's popularity." The conference 
regarded this as a central issue to be settled immediately in 
order to ensure the unity of thoughts and actions in the entire 
party organization.

<F P=106> [Report by The Chau] </F>
  [Summary] What can be said about changes in the port city 
of Haiphong in the 1991-93 three-year period? Before 1992, 
Haiphong displayed four shortcomings, namely street litter, 
insufficient power supply, serious budget deficit, and poor 
public security and order maintenance. 
  The situation now has been improved. City streets are 
cleaner thanks to more budget allocations to public sanitation 
work. The application of resolute and uniform measures helped 
reduce waste or theft of electricity. The situation concerning 
public security and order maintenance has been markedly 
improved. The budget deficit has also been significantly 
reduced. 
  Noteworthy is the fact that Haiphong has scored fine 
external 
economic achievements. In 1991, the city had only two foreign 
investment projects. Nowadays, as many as 27 joint ventures 
valued at nearly 650 million dollars are being implemented. 
Considerable progress has also been made by the 
agro-forestry-fishery, trade, and service sectors. 
  "The concrete figures of the above-mentioned activities are 
reflected in a report presented by the 10th Executive Committee 
of the Haiphong City party organization at a recent midterm 
party conference. Generally speaking, over the past three 
years, far from lagging behind, Haiphong has made good progress 
on the economic development front. Some areas of economic 
activities have displayed fast growth rates and fulfilled or 
overfulfilled many targets for the 1991-95 period. The external 
economic sector has played an important role in overall local 
economic life." 
  Nonetheless, based on the report of the city party 
organization's executive committee as well as on the delegates' 
views, there is still room for improvement. For example, the 
value of 1993 industrial production reached only 211 billion 
dong. A number of new products has already been marketed. 
Nonetheless, the volume of products of high economic value 
remains low and the export index is even lower. The volume of 
export products in transit through Haiphong Port comes chiefly 
from the northern provinces whereas that of the port city of 
Haiphong itself only accounts for a modest percentage. 
Haiphong's sea-based economy displays great potential, but the 
actual performance ratio is very low. 
  Slow efforts have been made to effect economic restructuring 
and job development to benefit the countryside. The ratio of 
the city's participation in foreign-funded investment projects 
is also low. The performance of the import-export and tourist 
sectors is not on par with the city's advantages and potential. 
Furthermore, the city still displays shortcomings on the 
cultural and social fronts. 
  It could be said that Haiphong's most serious drawback rests 
with its failure to formulate an effective human resources 
development strategy. There is not enough cadres to meet the 
requirements of the new situation and new mechanism, especially 
to handle external economic affairs. 
  "Prompted by a positive attitude and spirit of 
self-sufficiency and self-help, the Haiphong City party 
organization set forth many major policies and solutions for the 
period from now until the year 1995 as follows: It is necessary 
to promote production, business, and service industries as well 
as bring into full play the roles of different economic sectors. 
Special efforts must be made to step up external economic 
activities, build socioeconomic infrastructure, implement social 
welfare programs, consolidate national defense and security 
capabilities, renovate and revamp party organizations, enhance 
the leadership skills of cadres and party members, and combine 
the administrative reform program with the activities of mass 
societies. Given the fact that Haiphong is an industrial center 
with a large force of manual workers, special attention must be 
paid to the role of trade-union organizations." 
  Based on past achievements and experiences, there is every 
reason to believe that Haiphong will make the above-mentioned 
goals come true. To this end, efforts must be made to define 
practical tasks and work out harmonious and effective operating 
procedures.

  [Text] Geneva, 7 Apr -- On 7 April, Minoru Endo, Japanese 
ambassador at the Japan's permanent mission to international 
organizations in Geneva, unofficially proposed that the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT next year, 
take up the following topics on its agenda: 1) legal measures 
which have a protectionist effect; 2) regionalism; and 3) the 
relationship between national security and trade. Endo made the 
proposal at a meeting of envoys from GATT member nations that 
was held the same day. By clarifying the principles of free 
trade regarding these areas, Japan hopes to lessen the negative 
impact of U.S. investigations into antidumping cases, the 
formation of trade blocs, and other factors. 
  According to a Japanese Government official, the government 
is still in the process of making internal adjustments regarding 
its final proposal. It plans to make an official announcement 
at a ministerial meeting to be held next week in Morocco for the 
signing of a global trade accord. The government plans to push 
for the inclusion of this proposal in the presidential statement 
that will close the meeting, so that the three topics may 
possibly be taken up on the WTO's agenda along with such issues 
as U.S. demands on unifying labor standards. 
  In connection with protectionist measures, the government 
official stated on the same day , "The problem is that U.S. 
antidumping laws and Article 337 of its Tariff Act have the 
effect of restricting trade as soon as investigations are 
begun." Because no discussions were held on this issue at the 
Uruguay Round talks, Japan feels it should be taken up at the 
WTO. 
  Moreover, concerning the U.S. Buy American Act, which 
requires that purchases of products related to U.S. national 
security be produced domestically, Japan feels it is necessary 
to make adjustments to this law so that it will be in line with 
multilateral trade rules. 
  Japan has brought up such issues in hoping to balance things 
out so that U.S. demands on unifying labor standards will not 
become too prominent.

  [Text] In connection with the implementation of the North 
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) last January, the Economic 
Planning Agency [EPA] has conducted a survey on the agreement's 
impact on Japanese companies' investment behavior. According to 
the survey results, Japanese companies are not yet highly 
motivated for investments in Mexico and other NAFTA nations, and 
the EPA concluded that NAFTA's impact on the companies' behavior 
has not been clearly observed so far. 
  As a trilateral agreement among the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico, NAFTA is seeking tariff cuts on a step-by-step basis 
to establish a free trade zone involving the three nations. 
Following implementation of NAFTA, the EPA surveyed 1,990 
Japanese companies which have sales or production subsidiaries 
overseas. As a result of the January survey, responses were 
obtained from 635 companies. 
  In response to a (multiple-choice answer) question asking in 
which countries or regions companies desire to expand their 
operations, 41.6 percent said they want to expand business in 
the United States; however, those who favored Mexico and Canada 
remained at 10.4 and 6.5 percent, respectively. By contrast, 
39.7 percent were interested in newly industrializing economies 
(NIE's) in Asia, 53.2 percent preferred ASEAN, and 51.3 percent 
were for China. The companies thus showed great interest in 
Asia rather than NAFTA. Commenting on this, the EPA said that 
the business sector prefers brisk and prospective markets, and 
that NAFTA is unlikely to drastically change companies' 
investment policies for the time being. 
  Yet, about 40 percent of the companies that are planning 
expansion of operations in Mexico said their plans are to "catch 
up with the regional economic merger." The EPA said that 
influence of NAFTA is observed on this point.

  [Text] This is a summary of fighting on the Pailin 
battlefield between 9 April and the morning of 11 April 1994. 
The following is the outcome of the fighting: 
  1. We have completely liberated the area from the west of 
Pailin to the border. 
  2. We have captured 350 invading troops of the communist 
Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government. Some of them 
have fled for their lives through the bamboo-covered jungle. 
  3. We completely control Sala Krau village.

come down with malaria and typhoid and are dying one after 
another -- two or three here; four or five there. Their 
supplies have been completely cut off.

  [Text] Malaysia and the Philippines should keep their 
channels of communication open and accessible at all times in 
order to manage and maintain good relations. The fundamentals 
for this to work is to ensure that there must be constant 
contacts and discussions between both sides. UMNO [United 
Malays National Organization] party youth chief Tan Sri Abdul 
Rahim Tamby Chik said this at a meeting with President Fidel 
Ramos and representatives of the Lakas [Strength of the 
Nation]-United National Christian Democrats-United Muslim 
Democratic Party youth leaders at Malacanang Palace in Manila. 
Describing his visit as another process to enhance the existing 
good relationship between the two countries, Tan Sri Rahim said 
it was important the countries make concrete efforts to get to 
know each other better all the time. He said the need to ensure 
that relations remain cordial is even more so as both Malaysia 
and the Philippines are poised to transform into a higher 
economic level. A strong relationship between the two nations 
should also inevitably contribute to a more prosperous, stable, 
and peaceful region.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
has presented to the United States a set of comments to counter 
the latest U.S. report that found Japan guilty of unfair trade 
practices in many industrial sectors, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official said Wednesday [13 April]. 
  "The (U.S.) report contains certain assertions which the 
U.S. 
has already withdrawn during the framework negotiations, 
including its claim that Japan's market has low level of 
penetration by foreign goods and services compared to the Group 
of Seven average," said the document that lists the comments, 
which was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  The comments were prepared by the Foreign Ministry and 
submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Tuesday, said the 
ministry official, who declined to be named. 
  The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) released 
the 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers at 
the end of March, a hit list that devoted 44 pages of its 
281-page report to cite what it views as Tokyo's unfair trade 
practices, covering 43 areas in seven industrial sectors. 
  The latest Japanese comments are designed to demonstrate 
that 
"Tokyo is doing what it should do" in order to further open its 
markets, another official at the Foreign Ministry said. 
  In the comments, Japan argued that "the reliability" of the 
statistics used in the USTR report for asserting Japan's market 
is closed must be examined in thorough discussions, along with 
"justification of the definition of competitiveness." 
  "Without such justification and appropriateness attached, 
this kind of U.S. approach in the report is too simplistic and 
will not be acceptable," the comments said. 
  The comments answered U.S. claims on Japan's 11 industrial 
sectors, including three priority areas covered under the 
Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks -- insurance, autos and auto 
parts, and government procurement of medical equipment and 
telecommunications. 
  In the comments, Japan dismissed Washington's perception of 
past foreign entry into Japanese markets, saying, "it should be 
also recognized that the past Japan-U.S. arrangements have met 
with `tangible results'." 
  Specifically, Tokyo termed as "faulty" statistics used by 
the 
U.S. in gauging the Japanese Government's procurement of 
foreign-made computers. 
  Because of Japan's market-opening efforts, a "steady 
increase" has been recorded in the share of foreign computers in 
government procurement, from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991 to 18.9 
percent in fiscal 1992, including that of the central government 
entities, which expanded from 4.7 percent to 11.7 percent, the 
document said. 
  On government procurement of telecommunications equipment, 
the document said the U.S. assertion that the Japanese market is 
closed in terms of the G-7 average is erroneous. 
  Excluding equipment purchases made by the private sector, 
which was what the USTR counted in the latest report, the 
foreign share is much higher at 0.6 percent in 1991 in the 
Japanese market than the 0.07 percent in the U.S., the document 
said. 
  Measures to improve Japan's government procurement 
procedures 
for the telecom sector as called for by Washington in the USTR 
report are all covered by Tokyo's market-opening package 
unveiled at the end of March, the document said. 
  The document also blasted the U.S. view of Japan's efforts 
to 
open its insurance market. The March market-opening package 
responded to the majority of the insurance issues raised by 
Washington, it said. 
  Moreover, the document described insurance regulations in 
the 
U.S. as being "by far stricter" than those in Japan. It 
explained that the U.S. system, regulated on a state-by-state 
basis, "puts heavy burdens on foreign insurance providers by 
requiring enormous time and cost for obtaining licenses." 
  In addition, U.S. branches of foreign insurance providers 
are 
discriminated against vis-a-vis domestic insurance providers by 
the imposition of financial requirements in such areas as 
trusteed assets, the document said. "Such discriminatory 
treatment does not exist in Japan," it said. 
  This year's USTR report takes on a significant meaning for 
Japan's trade ties with Washington because issues dealt with in 
the report could possibly be subjected to retaliatory tariffs 
under the recently revived U.S. trade provision known as Super 
301. 
  Under the provision, Washington will identify foreign trade 
barriers using the USTR findings. The U.S. would then have 
until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority countries it says are 
engaged in unfair trading.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- A group of Japanese 
agricultural experts will visit Washington State from Sunday to 
assess the U.S. quarantine system for prevention of fire blight 
on apples, Farm Ministry officials said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  The dispatch of the team by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries stems from a Japan-U.S. row on the 
lifting of an import ban on U.S. apples by Japan. 
  The United States has agreed to Japan's demands for biannual 
on- site inspections for disease by Japanese experts. 
  Subject to the inspections, the import ban on U.S. apples is 
expected to be lifted around October at the earliest, the 
officials said.

  [Text] With respect to the question of nuclear development 
by the DPRK, or North Korea, International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] Director General Hans Blix said the IAEA will submit a 
report on this case to the UN Security Council [UNSC] unless 
North Korea accepts nuclear inspections before the end of this 
month. He made the remark in an interview given to NHK in 
Hiroshima today. 
  [Begin recording] [Blix] We have sent a letter to the DPRK 
asking to let us be able to complete [nuclear inspections] as 
soon as possible. If this is not accepted by the DPRK, then, of 
course I have to report that to the Security Council. 
  [Unidentified NHK reporter] We would like to hear the 
deadline. When is the deadline for the procedure? 
  [Blix] That should be before the end of ... around the end 
of April. [end recording] 
  Following a failure to complete an inspection in North Korea 
last month, the IAEA brought this case to the UNSC on 22 March. 
But the UNSC just issued a presidential statement calling for 
North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections due to China's 
opposition to hardline policies against North Korea. Director 
General Blix's remarks indicate his view that, depending on 
North Korea's attitude, the issue should be brought again to the 
UNSC later this month. In that case, the UNSC will have to 
consider more compulsive measures, such as economic sanctions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our People's Army and People Who Are </F>
Upholding the Great Commander Are Ever-Victorious"] 
  [Text] Today, in an exciting [pokchan] environment in 
which our people are resolutely defending socialism and further 
glorifying it despite the vicious challenge from the 
imperialists and reactionaries, our people are meaningfully 
marking the first anniversary of the election of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's 
Army [KPA], as chairman of the DPRK National Defense Committee. 
  During the fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's 
Assembly of the DPRK President Kim Il-song in April of last year 
elected KPA Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman 
of the National Defense Committee. This was the realization of 
the unanimous desire of all officers and men of the KPA and 
people and a meaningful event of great importance in building 
our revolutionary Armed Forces and carrying out the chuche 
revolutionary cause. 
  On this felicitous anniversary of the day when the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was upheld at the top of the 
revolutionary Armed Forces, our People's Army and people are 
filled with great revolutionary pride in living and fighting 
while upholding the ever-victorious iron-willed commander. 
  Today our People's Army is a one-a-match-for-100 
revolutionary Army more strongly than ever prepared politically, 
ideologically, militarily, and technologically. It is 
excellently carrying out its honorable mission as an Army of the 
party, revolution, and people. 
  Our Army has grown and strengthened into an invincible, 
powerful Army that can defeat any powerful imperialist enemy, 
because it upholds a great iron-willed commander. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has an indomitable will, unparalleled courage, and 
outstanding resourcefulness, and an outstanding art of military 
operations. This is a guarantee for the strengthening and 
development of our revolutionary Armed Forces and their 
invincibility. 
  A working class party must have a great commander at the 
head 
of its revolutionary Armed Forces if it is to strengthen and 
develop them into invincible ranks. This is a stark truth 
proven by the history of the working class's building of 
revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who was upheld as 
supreme commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces, is a great 
politician who has literary and military accomplishments and an 
iron-willed commander who has outstanding foresights, 
unparalleled courage, outstanding resourcefulness, and a tested 
art of military operations and who leads the cause of building a 
chuche-oriented Army to victory. 
  The dear comrade leader, who had earlier led the cause of 
building a chuche-oriented Army, presented a plan to imbue the 
entire Army with the chuche idea. In this way, he provided a 
fundamental guideline that helps strengthen and develop the 
People's Army into the party's revolutionary Armed Forces 
boundlessly loyal to the chuche revolutionary cause by 
implementing the chuche- oriented military ideas and theories 
and tactics. 
  As required by the task to imbue the entire Army with the 
chuche idea, all the ranks of the Army have been made ranks of 
chuche-type revolutionary soldiers; the arms and equipment have 
been modernized; a chuche-oriented art of military operations 
has been implemented in military activities; and the 
chuche-oriented leadership system and method have been 
established thoroughly. As a result, our People's Army has 
grown into a chuche-oriented revolutionary Army that takes pride 
in the fact that it is now an invincible powerful Army. 
  The supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il strengthened 
and developed our People's Army into an invincible and 
ever-victorious revolutionary Armed Forces. The sagacity of his 
leadership lies most of all in leading the work to highly 
manifest political and ideological superiority. 
  The revolutionary Army is an army that defeats the enemy 
through political and ideological superiority. When the 
soldiers are firmly armed with the revolutionary ideology and 
have a thorough faith to safeguard the party and the leader, can 
they fight to the end and be victorious without being afraid of 
being attacked by any powerful enemy? 
  The dear comrade leader who always endowed a decisive 
significance in the political and ideological element turned 
priority attention to highly manifesting the political and 
ideological superiority in strengthening the People's Army, and 
vigorously pushed ahead with it. Therefore, the chuche-oriented 
ideological system of the whole Army was firmly established, and 
the work to maintain the People's Army into a true 
chuche-oriented military rank of the revolutionaries, endlessly 
loyal to the party and the leader, was actively carried out. 
  As a result, the political and ideological level of the 
officers and men of our People's Army was enhanced to a very 
high stage that cannot be compared with anything else. 
  Today, the soldiers of our People's Army have a thorough 
revolutionary outlook on the leader, which they know of no one 
else but the great leader and the dear comrade leader, and are 
sacrificing their lives to defend the welfare of the leader 
[suryongnim] and the comrade leader, and are unconditionally and 
thoroughly fulfilling the order of the party and the leader. 
  Heroes Kim Kwang-chol and Han Yong-chol protected and 
safeguarded the great leader's and the dear comrade leader's 
portraits and saved the lives of their comrades in our Army by 
intercepting with their bodies a hand grenade which was about to 
blow up. Such loyal fighters are being produced successfully. 
This is a direct example of how high the ideological and mental 
level the officers and men of the People's Army have reached. 
  As our Army advocated and defended with its life the 
respected and beloved General Kim Il-song by highly calling, 
"Hurrah for the great Comrade Han Pyol," during the dawn of the 
Korean revolution, truly, the lofty political and ideological 
trait which is overflowing in our Army clearly proves that we 
can always fight resolutely by shouting, "Hurrah for our supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il," in whatever violent storm. 
  The sagacity of the dear comrade leader's leadership who 
strengthened and developed our People's Army into an invincible 
and ever-victorious peerless strong Army also lies in firmly 
preparing the People's Army militarily and technically. 
Military and technical preparation is one of the important 
indexes that characterizes the Army's combat strength and might. 
  Under the condition in which the imperialists have complete 
expectations for modern weapons and up-to-date military 
technology, the revolutionary Army must be firmly prepared not 
only politically and ideologically but also militarily and 
technically. When the revolutionary Army is possessed with 
military and technical might, as well as with the political and 
ideological might, it can become a peerless strong army. 
  Our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il devoted all his 
energy and efforts to firmly prepare our revolutionary Armed 
Forces militarily and technically in accordance with the demand 
of a modern war. The comrade supreme commander frequently 
visited the military training sites of the People's Army, and 
wisely led the soldiers so that all of them can acquire 
exquisite and superb tactics by strengthening training, deeply 
discussed ways to achieve infallible marksmanship and on 
military technology and knowledge in their sectors, and also led 
them to have an iron-like physical strength. 
  Along with this, he made it so that armaments of the 
People's 
Army were endlessly modernized in accordance with the demand of 
the chuche-oriented war method and the country's concrete 
situation, further strengthened each service and branches, and 
firmly consolidated the outposts of the fatherland into an 
iron-like fortress. Thus, through such a wise leadership, the 
military and technical might of our People's Army today has been 
extraordinarily strengthened. 
  All officers and men have firmly armed themselves with the 
comrade supreme commander's unique military ideology, theories, 
and tactics. The entire Army has been modernized and turned 
into an Army of cadres, and all fortresses have been 
consolidated as impregnable ones. These are important changes 
that show the might of our Army. 
  In the course of the struggle to implement the policy of 
turning the entire Army into an army of cadres and modernizing 
it, all soldiers have become capable of fulfilling the role of 
the position one grade or more higher than each one's rank, and 
military equipment has firmly been prepared in conformity with 
the demand of modern war and with the country's specific 
realities. Thus, our People's Army has become a matchless, 
strong army capable of smashing the enemies with one blow, no 
matter where they rush in -- land, sea, or air. 
  The wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, who is 
constantly strengthening our Army's might, is also shown by the 
fact that he has consolidated the blood linkage between the Army 
and the people indomitably by embodying our party's ideology of 
unity between the Army and the people. 
  The revolutionary Army comes from the people, and it is the 
People's Army that serves the fatherland and the people. The 
source of the revolutionary Army's invincible might lies in its 
blood linkage with the people. Without the people, the People's 
Army cannot exist, nor can it fulfill its mission as the 
revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  Our party's ideology of unity between the Army and the 
people, which was established during the period of the 
anti-Japanese struggle and has been developed and enriched by 
the dear comrade leader, is a chuche-oriented military ideology, 
with which the Army and the people are defending the fatherland 
and are vigorously pushing ahead with the socialist 
construction, united as one. 
  Considering the general embodiment of the unity between the 
Army and the people an important principle in building the 
revolutionary Armed Forces, as well as an essential problem in 
greatly enhancing the socialism of our own style, the dear 
comrade leader has wisely led us to brilliantly realize it. 
  As a result, the great ideology of unity between the Army 
and 
the people has fully bloomed in our country. On the road of 
upholding the comrade supreme commander, the Army and the people 
have become an invincible, united body inseparably bound to each 
other. Our People's Army officers and men are the people's 
genuine sons and daughters who love and fight for the people by 
devoting their lives, and the people love the People's Army like 
their own family and actively support and encourage it both 
materially and morally. 
  The single-hearted unity between the Army and the people 
around the dear comrade leader is indeed the source and firm 
guarantee of the invincibility of our revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has firmly developed 
our 
People's Army into ever-victorious, revolutionary armed ranks 
which are firmly prepared politically, ideologically, 
militarily, and technologically, and which are linked with the 
people in blood. His wise leadership and immortal achievements 
are indeed the valuable result of his matchless, extraordinary 
military wisdom, peerless braveness, and excellent tactics of 
leading the Army. 
  Thanks to General Kim Chong-il, the sagacious general of 
sagacious generals [yongjang chungui yongjang], who is wisely 
leading the cause of chuche Army building with that much 
outstanding traits, our People's Army and people achieved a 
great victory in the gunfireless political and military showdown 
with the enemies [chongpotani nalliji annun choktulgwaui 
chongchi kunsajok taegyolchoneso] last year, and they are now 
firmly defending socialism while sternly smashing the 
imperialists and reactionaries' maneuvers to crush us. 
  It is the greatest honor and happiness for our People's Army 
and people to uphold General Kim Chong-il, the greatest general 
ever known, who has personified the wisdom of a sagacious 
general since youth and has opened the great golden age of 
building the revolutionary Armed Forces with his extraordinary 
and seasoned leadership, as the supreme commander of our 
revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  We will always keep this honor and pride deep in mind, unite 
ourselves as one around Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
and uphold his leadership by fulfilling our filial and loyal 
duties. By doing so, we will further strengthen our 
revolutionary Armed Forces and hasten the completion of the 
chuche revolutionary cause. 
  Our People's Army and people who uphold the great 
iron-willed, sagacious general are invincible, and victory and 
glory will always be in store for them.

radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which North Korea has been 
refusing, is urgent and that IAEA inspectors should be present 
at the experimental reactor that has an output of 5,000 kw when 
its fuel is replaced. 
  Director-general Blix, now visiting Japan, held a news 
conference on 13 April and said that as the inspection of the 
radiochemical laboratory, which is believed to be a facility for 
extraction of plutonium, was not carried out, it cannot be 
determined if this facility has been used since February 1993. 
He pointed out that it will become a very serious problem if 
this situation continues for a long time. 
  Director-general Blix revealed that the project for building 
a second production line in the radiochemical laboratory is 
presently under way, and that this project will be completed 
before long. 
  Director-general Blix stressed that North Korea claimed that 
the fuel was loaded in the experimental reactor for the first 
time and that plutonium was not extracted from the fuel used in 
this reactor. An on-the-spot investigation of the reactor by the 
inspectors is necessary to verify this claim. 
  Director-general Blix pointed out that in the event that 
North Korea continues refusing comprehensive inspection of its 
nuclear facilities, there is the possibility that the IAEA will 
demand that the UN Security Council take stronger steps and 
measures.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 12 -- The Vietnamese and US MIA 
[missing in action] specialists on April 9-11 examined a number 
of remains and personal effects believed to belong to American 
servicemen missing in action in the Vietnam war. The belongings 
were collected by the searching groups or handed over by the 
local people during recent 28th joint excavation. 
  Initial results show that 10 packs of remains and personal 
effects could be related to American MIA's. 
  On April 12, the representative of the Vietnam MIA office 
handed over the above-said 10 packs to the representative of the 
US side. This is the 47th handover since March 1973, bringing to 
603 the total of the remains of MIA's to the US side. 
  Speaking on the occasion the representative of the US side 
highly appreciated the effective cooperation of the Vietnamese 
Government and people.

Thailand: "The Future of the Japan-U.S. Alliance: Inevitable 
Risk Sharing"] 
  [Text]Lessons From the Anglo-Dutch War 
  The breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. framework talks 
should 
be taken seriously. 
  More than anything else, the international situation had an 
adverse effect on the talks. There has always been Japan-U.S. 
trade friction, but during the Cold War period, they had somehow 
been tided over through the principle that a good Japan-U.S. 
relationship is the first consideration. 
  The recent situation of the Japan-U.S. relationship is 
surprisingly similar to that of the Anglo-Dutch relationship. 
While Great Britain was fighting a life-and-death battle with 
Spain, the Netherlands accumulated wealth. And, although there 
was serious economic friction between Great Britain and the 
Netherlands concerning fishing, merchant shipping, textiles, and 
others, Great Britain's fate hinged on the maintenance of the 
alliance with the Netherlands. However, with the end of 
religious confrontation following the conclusion of the 
Westphalia Treaty in 1648, a navigational law was soon 
promulgated in 1651. And, due to the Anglo-Dutch War, which was 
fought three times since 1652, the world trade empire of the 
Netherlands was ruined. If the Netherlands had accurately 
grasped the moves of the British parliament and Britain's public 
opinion and had made the necessary concessions ahead of time, it 
could have avoided the war. Japan made an early mistake, 
although it was in the international environment where it should 
have learned the historical lessons from the Netherlands. 
  Of the three agendas of the framework talks, an agreement 
had 
already been reached on global cooperation matters. If Japan 
had fully satisfied the U.S. with economic stimulus measures 
that are of major importance, the setting of numerical targets, 
which are of minor importance, would have been postponed since 
it raised the question of propriety in the United States also. 
Because Japan had made a mistake in the management of major 
problems, it had stiffened the U.S. attitude toward minor 
problems. 
  It is of course necessary for Japan to make efforts to 
improve the situation through such measures as liberalization 
and deregulation. Due to Japan's recent mistake, however, it 
should be prepared to face the fact that U.S. demands will 
become higher once the United States clears the current hurdle. 
For the time being, however, I will leave economic issues to 
economic specialists since it is necessary to ascertain the U.S. 
Congress' future moves. I would like to think of measures to 
prevent a crack in the Japan-U.S. alliance with regard to 
political and security aspects. 
  First of all, I do not think that the recent breakdown will 
immediately shake the foundation of the Japan-U.S. alliance. At 
least, there is no such fear from the Japanese side. One may 
square one's shoulders by saying "For the first time, the word 
`no' was uttered," but no one is uttering this phrase with 
determination to confront the United States in the future. 
Rather, one is merely patching up affairs with such an 
expression, because no one has the nerve to square up to the 
mistake of having given a blow to national life by delaying the 
Japanese economy's recovery through the breakdown of the talks. 
<H5>  What Is To Be Feared Is Emotional Public Opinion </H5>
  When viewed in perspective, what is to be feared is public 
opinion in the United States. That is because a view is sure to 
surface that is emotionally appealing, although it has a leap in 
logic: "Why should we defend a country that is giving a blow to 
the U.S. employment situation without rectifying its trade 
surplus with the United States?" 
  Between Japan and the United States there exists a strong 
brake that can be applied to such a view. That is the mutual 
trust that exists between military personnel of the two 
governments, which was fostered during the Nakasone-Reagan 
period. For the last 10 years, which decided the Cold War 
issue, the two men fought through the war with the Soviet Union 
together by digging up Japan's financial resources, which were 
the only strategic reserves left in the West at that time. 
  In addition, such professionals of both countries have a 
persuasive belief in the support of a firm Japan-U.S. alliance. 
  In the near future, Asia will be in a state of flux and 
transition, if not in a critical state. The DPRK (North Korea) 
has not only the nuclear problem, which is a critical issue at 
the moment, but also the problems of succession, maintenance of 
the establishment, and unification. In addition to the 
succession problem, China has problems in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 
South China Sea, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other places. It will 
take 10 years for Russia's internal conditions to become calm. 
In such a transition period, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the key 
to stability in the Asian-Pacific region. The U.S. bases in 
Japan are the ones where the U.S. Forces can be maintained with 
the least cost and the most efficiency in the world, through 
Japan's cooperation. These bases are more indispensable for the 
U.S. role in preserving the international order after the Cold 
War than just for the preservation of Japan's security. 
  However, the United States is a country of public opinion. 
Even if there are supporters in the United States who are in a 
reliable relationship with Japan and who know Japan's strategic 
importance, it is not easy to ask them to fight against a 
powerful enemy, public opinion, unless they are supplied with 
enough weapons. 
  Japan should bear in mind that it will have to show an 
attitude that makes U.S. public opinion think that Japan is a 
truly reliable ally in the face of a situation where the true 
worth of the Japan-U.S. alliance is tried. Japan should make 
constant preparations for this purpose. In making the necessary 
preparations, we may as well set up two hypotheses. 
  One is peace-keeping operations [PKO]. The United States, 
which remains the only country in the world holding supreme 
power after the Cold War, is forced to bear the responsibility 
for maintaining the world order because no other country is 
willing to take the responsibility. However, since the United 
Nations is functioning at the moment, it is possible to maintain 
world order under the umbrella of the United Nations with the 
United States as leader. The question is to what extent can 
Japan contribute to such an endeavor. 
<H5>  PKO's Come With Sacrifices </H5>
  Japan's participation in the PKO in Cambodia was successful. 
The operations were a great success because they were 
accomplished completely within a limited time period and with a 
minimum of victims, which was an exceptional case in the history 
of UN PKO's. 
  What was most significant for Japan was the breakdown of the 
myth that the Southeast Asian nations are wary of the Japanese 
Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation -- this myth was 
originally a domestic dispute in Japan and was exported overseas 
during the eighties. Concerning SDF participation in PKO's, 
there were no criticisms in the utterances of prominent people 
or in the press comments in Southeast Asia. Rather, the only 
criticism was that the SDF units placed a dangerous task on 
other countries, always finding shelter in a safe place. 
  However, future participation in PKO's will not always be 
as successful as the one in Cambodia. First of all, there is no 
guarantee that PKO's will always be successful. There are cases 
where PKO's will have to be conducted from humanitarian and 
international viewpoints at the risk of failure. PKO's will not 
always be accomplished in a short time. Cyprus is a case in 
point. However, now we can highly evaluate the PKO in 
Palestine, although they were thought to have to go on 
indefinitely. And, at any rate, no PKO can guarantee that there 
will be no victims. Even Prime Minister Goh of Singapore, a 
country which is more wary of Japan's military role than any 
other in Southeast Asia, told Japan, "PKO's are no picnic." 
  PKO's are not wars. Therefore, there is no political risk 
that holds sway over the destiny of a country that participates 
in PKO. Concerning the safety of PKO personnel, they are no more 
placed in a dangerous situation than policemen and firemen are. 
If Japan refuses to take such a risk, it can never become a 
partner in preserving the international order. 
  Japan should immediately unfreeze the PKO forces that have 
been put in deep freeze and get rid of the excessive restraints 
that annoy countries that assume duties in company with Japan. 
And, when the international community, including the United 
States, bears the responsibility for the maintenance of the 
international order, Japan should be prepared to face failure or 
danger with the world community. 
  An important test case of the Japan-U.S. alliance is an 
emergency in the Far East. The critical situation in the Korean 
peninsula is causing the greatest concern at present. Japan is 
expected to give immediate and full cooperation in case of the 
mobilization of the U.S. Armed Forces. Probably even the 
present coalition cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party can 
give their cooperation. Otherwise, more than half of the reason 
for the Japan-U.S. alliance's existence would be lost, and that 
is evident to everyone. However, the problem will go beyond 
that, depending upon the development of scenarios. In case of 
war on the Korean peninsula, U.S. public opinion will call for 
Japan's participation. However, as far as national feeling in 
South Korea is concerned, Japan's military assistance will be 
rejected so long as U.S. and South Korean Armed Forces can cope 
with the situation. However, on the supposition that U.S. and 
South Korean Armed Forces face the danger of being driven into 
the sea as in former times, if Japan, which has 200 F-15 fighter 
planes, remains an idle spectator despite a joint U.S.-South 
Korean request for Japan's assistance, the Japan-U.S. alliance 
will never hold out. 
  Can Japan afford to destroy the Japan-U.S. alliance and lose 
the peace, stability, and prosperity of Japan by adopting a 
theory which is quite unintelligible outside Japan and which 99 
percent of the Japanese people have never heard of: Japan has 
the right of self-defense but is not allowed to have the right 
of collective-defense? I think that the Japanese are a realistic 
people and that they will cope with the situation realistically 
at such a time. 
<H5>  Seek the Middle Path </H5>
  After the end of the Cold War, everyone tried to guess what 
the future world would be like. A U.S. academic society 
proposed two options: Japan will either become a military 
superpower in the future or it will play a nonmilitary role 
globally. Comparison of the two options is unproductive work 
because they do not exist. In the foreseeable future, Japan's 
choices are extremely limited. One option: a country that 
dispatches PKO personnel but makes them hide behind the French 
Army in case of danger and remains a country that thrusts danger 
on the armies of other countries; or an ordinary country that 
shares sacrifices with other countries. Another option: a 
country that says it has the right of self-defense but not the 
right of collective-defense, and remains a country that leaves 
to fate whatever happens to its allies, the "American boys." 
  If the choice is limited to these two narrow options, all 
U.S. intellectuals will no doubt opt for Japan's becoming an 
ordinary country. 
  A militaristic country is not an ordinary country; it is a 
strange country. It is a strange country if it participates in 
PKO's but refuses to shed its blood for the operations and 
thrusts sacrifices on other countries. Japan should become an 
ordinary country and should be prepared for the time when the 
proof of the alliance is necessary. This is the only 
alternative to saving the Japan-U.S. alliance. 
  When I gave a lecture in Thailand, I was asked: "For the 
Southeast Asian countries, Japan is exactly the right country to 
balance with China. Why did Japan advance in the past believing 
in militarism and why does it shut itself up now believing in 
pacifism? Japan cannot be a helpful country to us under such 
circumstances." 
  I am fully aware that the middle-of-the-road is difficult to 
tread. Then the right thing for the Japanese to do is to seek 
the middle-of-the-road. The coalition cabinet, including the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, may be a gift from Heaven for 
that.

  [Text] Mitsui and Co. has formed a partnership with Saint 
Onge, a medium-sized marketing consulting firm of York City, 
Pennsylvania. Saint Onge is strong in the building of 
computer-based marketing systems and leads in marketing systems 
aimed at the multimedia age such as television shopping. Mitsui 
will offer Saint Onge's technology when assisting Japanese firms 
in marketing their products in the United States as well as 
introducing their technology in Japan in expanding its contract 
distribution businesses. 
  Businesses are in the process of shoring up their 
competitiveness through the reengineering process. They are 
taking such action as revising distribution methods so as to 
expedite marketing procedures by making them more responsive to 
customer needs, and reducing costs by outsourcing material 
requirements and consolidating operating units. Mitsui decided 
to form the partnership with Saint Onge because it sensed a 
renewed concern by industry for marketing systems. 
  Mitsui will offer consulting services to Japanese firms 
locating in the United States relative to factory site shipping 
systems and the location of distribution points. It will also 
provide specific services in the areas of basic facility and 
information systems design, selection of necessary equipment, 
and training of personnel. Mitsui will also provide similar 
services in Japan and is considering launching related, 
innovative business services. As an example, it is considering 
the establishment of in-house delivery services and to offer 
contract delivery services to manufacturers and retailers 
requiring frequent, small-lot deliveries. 
  Integrated trading companies are constantly seeking out new 
sources of products and materials as well as purchasers of such 
items and possess the capability to market such items. Mitsui 
aims to reinforce such functions and expand its marketing rights 
through the recent tie up. 
  Although Saint Onge is medium-sized, it is strong on a 
technical basis with about 70 percent of its 80 employees 
comprised of technicians. Recently, it has engaged in 
merchandise distribution services associated with television 
shopping networks and Mitsui believes it can use such know-how 
in the Japanese markets.

  [Text] Prologue for Multimedia Revolution--Wave of 
Japan-U.S. Rivalry 
  Sources confide that Isamu Miyazaki's Communications Policy 
Section of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' [MOPT] 
Electrical Communications Council will "present a report 
reflecting a radical plan" calling for a "primary goal of 
nurturing the competitive strength of the NTT." This signifies a 
modification of the past concept of "calling for NTT to be 
responsible for the next-generation communications 
infrastructure." 
  The Communications Policy Section is working at a rapid pace 
in concluding its work on the "Plan for a Japanese edition of 
the Information Infrastructure," a so-called Japanese 
Information Infrastructure (JII), in competition with the 
National Information Infrastructure (NII) proposed by Vice 
President Gore. The plan examines 21st century concepts such as 
who will build the optical fiber cable network and at what pace? 
  Seminars concerning multimedia are being held actively by 
coalition party Diet members such as those belonging to the 
Shinseito, Japan New Party and Sakigake. The 
Information-Communications Working Section of the government's 
Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, chaired by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, will promote JII from the standpoint of 
deregulation. It seems that we will see a rush of new policy 
launchings concerning multimedia at the sacrifice of existing 
projects. MOPT officials such as Kanichiro Aritomi, chief, 
Policy Section, Communications Policy Bureau, does not conceal 
his sense of crisis in saying, "There is a need to organize a 
major joint government-industry project to catch up with the 
United States which has established a lead in this area." 
  However, the seed for the information super highway concept 
created in the United States, in reality, originated in Japan. 
  The concept was originally born as the Visual Intelligent 
and 
Personal (VI&amp;P) Communications Services launched by NTT in 
October 1990. The service envisioned the laying of optical fiber 
cables in homes by the year 2015 and the provision of television 
shopping and remote medical treatment through television images. 
It envisioned all of the elements now addressed for the 
multimedia society. 
  Those sources engaged in the VI&amp;P plan admit, "The 
concept 
involved a degree of `pie in the sky.'" The original plan called 
for linkage of "40 percent of households" to the optical fiber 
network, but when the plan was announced it gave the impression 
that "all households" would be connected to the network. 
  That took place when Japanese industry was believed to 
occupy 
a superior position under Japan-U.S. competitive situations. 
When Senator Gore learned of Japan's plan to connect Japanese 
homes to optical cable systems, he sensed a strong feeling of 
crisis. Critical U.S. sensitivities were jolted by "Japanese 
pie-in-the-sky concepts." Both JII and VI&amp;P are scheduled for 
completion in 2015, but it was not mere coincidence that this is 
the case. 
  In January 1993, immediately prior to assuming the vice 
presidency of the United States, Gore energetically asserted in 
a speech at the University of California at Los Angeles that, 
"If the United States should command leadership in the 
information-communications area, we can increase domestic 
employment, rebuild our exporting competitiveness and once again 
export products to Japan and Latin America." Quick action was 
taken in announcing U.S. government action plans in September 
1993 and submitting NII-related legislation in January 1994. 
  Now, the ball thrown by the United States bounced back into 
the Japanese court as a "government-industry crisis." Surprised 
by the developments in the Gore plan, the MOPT announced that, 
"optical fiber cables will be linked to households by the year 
2010, five years earlier than originally scheduled." 
  Amidst a heated exchange of conceptual statements concerning 
this area which involved government prestige and the exchange of 
statements like a ping pong ball, we witnessed the rapid spread 
of enthusiasm for multimedia based on exaggerations and 
misunderstandings. Professor Hirobumi Takahashi, former NTT 
official and currently on the staff of the Integrated 
Information Faculty of Kansai University, points out, "Even the 
goal of 2015 was in doubt, but the U.S. NII concept inspired 
Japan into taking action." 
  However, there are crucial differences between the United 
States and Japan. Board member Norio Murakami of Japan DEC 
states, "The United States has three systems which it can use to 
build its next-generation infrastructure, whereas Japan has only 
one available system." 
  The three systems available in the United States are based 
on 
cable television (CATV), Internet, and the major communications 
firms. 
  CATV firms, servicing 57 million households with a market 
penetration rate of 60 percent, have launched experiments to tie 
into communication systems. The world's largest computer 
communications network, known as Internet, is in the process of 
adapting computer imaging services. The AT&amp;T long-distance 
carrier, AT&amp;T born as a result of the split up of AT&amp;T 
in 1984, 
and the seven regional telephone companies are in the process of 
devising a variety of new highly functional services under the 
pressure of competition. 
  The ultimate goal for each of these three services is the 
same. That goal is embodied in multimedia communications 
providing for the integrated transmission of alphabetical and 
numerical data along with images and voices. 
  On the other hand, in the case of Japan, urban multichannel 
CATV subscribers total just over 1 million, while personal 
computer modem connections total 2 million--incomparably fewer 
than in the United States. Comparable figures exist only in the 
area of telephone services provided by NTT. Differences between 
Japan and the United States are vast. That is why we must assume 
bold policies which will nurture the competitive strength of and 
stimulate competitiveness on the part of NTT. 
  The European Union (EU) requested the chief executive 
officers of the 19 leading European communications firms to 
prepare a European Information Infrastructure (EII). A plan 
patterned after the U.S. NII is scheduled for submission by 
June. Even Europe has started action to make up for lost time 
after seeing moves made by Japan and the United States in 
building information infrastructures. 
  International infrastructure competition is assuming a 
colorful start in connection with NII, JII, EII, and multimedia.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
has begun to move on establishment of a commercial Internet 
group. The move is viewed as an attempt to gain a leadership 
role by establishing an industry group because of the expected 
rapid growth in new information-communications businesses. 
  Services connecting with the domestic commercial Internet 
system were initiated in November of last year. Two companies 
known as AT&amp;T Japan ENS (AT&amp;T JENS) and Internet 
Initiative 
(IIJ) have already begun offering services and Fujitsu will 
initiate services in June. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) is also 
considering the idea of joining in the competition because its 
operating base will be compromised if international telephone 
calls are routed through the Internet system. Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone (NTT) is also studying the situation. 
  Internet is a worldwide computer network created in the 
United States and its subscribers are estimated to total 20 
million. It can be used for electronic mail exchanges and to 
access remote data bases through the use of computers. It is 
projected to develop into a multimedia system for the 
transmission of voice and animated images. 
  In December of last year, MOPT began seminars attended by 
companies involved with Internet. The seminars have been 
attended by a total of 14 companies, including two commercial 
services firms, NTT, KDD, personal computer Communications firm 
Nifty, and communications equipment maker Japan Cisco Systems, 
and three academics, including professor Junsuke Murai of Keio 
University. 
  As stated in the prospectus for the seminar, its goal is "to 
aid in the growth of our nation's Internet system," but the 
collective opinion of several attendees say MOPT has an ulterior 
motive. The aim of MOPT is to operate an agency called 
Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) under its initiative to 
provide for the efficient interconnection of commercial networks 
and to use the seminars as a means to set up such an 
organization. 
  The seminars were originally scheduled to end in March, but 
a 
decision has been made to extend them beyond April. The seminars 
will soon progress into a discussion on the establishment of CIX. 
  The Japanese international communications market is valued 
at 
300 billion yen. Currently, fewer than 500 firms subscribe to 
Internet. However, when the services are expanded on a 
full-scale basis, the market situation could change drastically. 
Some sources take the view that, "MOPT has embarked on a program 
to regulate the market as a means to extend aid to KDD and 
existing communications companies that will be impacted by 
changes."

  [Text] NTT has begun a quiet change in course. It has 
determined that sole reliance on intracompany managerial 
resources will not allow it to compete in the turbulent 
information technology (IT) world. President Kojima has decided 
that survival will require an aggressive tie up with overseas 
ventures. 
  NTT supposedly led the advanced world of technology in the 
areas of integrated services digital networks (ISDN) and optical 
fiber networks, but Kojima felt, "If NTT does not take 
appropriate action, it will be left on the wayside by rapidly 
advancing U.S. technology." 
  It was two years ago that President Hitoshi Kojima of NTT 
was 
struck by a sense of crisis. At that time, he was energetically 
engaged in meetings with executives of U.S. companies that were 
world leaders in the development of software, such as Chairman 
Bill Gates of Microsoft and officials of Lotus and Novell. Each 
meeting he held with these individuals impressed Kojima with the 
speed with which the IT technology revolution including 
multimedia was advancing and diversifying and that it was 
impossible to determine which area would prevail in the IT 
revolution. Kojima asked himself, "Can we compete effectively 
with such venture firms with our present resources?" 
  Originally, NTT was supposed to have led the world in the IT 
field. Even in connection with the common household, it had 
initiated experiments in ISDN with digital communications 
capabilities in 1984. In 1985, it built an infrastructure 
including a 3,400-km optical fiber cable relay net traveling the 
length of the Japanese archipelago. 
  Based on that experience, in 1990 it launched a "Visual, 
Intelligent, and Personal Plan" (VI&amp;P concept) shaping a 
multimedia communication age which called for connecting 
households with optical fiber cables by the year 2015. The plan 
called for services such as the remote transmission of 
high-vision static images and telephone connections with 
individuals carrying cellular telephones in any part of the 
country. 
  Even the information highway concept, which is now a 
substitute term for IT, proposed by Vice President Gore was 
conceived out of fear for the NTT plan and encompassed the goal 
of building a communications infrastructure which could compete 
with Japan. However, now that 10 years have passed since the 
inception of ISDN experiments, the United States leads in the IT 
field. 
  President Kojima admits, "The VI&amp;P concept was a dream 
which 
was not accompanied by technology of a practical nature." It was 
the United States that backed up this dream with rapid technical 
innovations beginning with digital techniques. 
  The University of North Carolina has commenced experiments 
involving the transmission of images taken by computer 
tomography (CT) scanners over optical fiber cables to remotely 
located supercomputers, analysis of angle and volume of 
radiological exposure for therapeutic purposes, and transmission 
of three-dimensional images to the concerned physician. 
  The question is, why is Japan, which was supposed to have 
been first in entering into the "high-level information 
society," now being left behind the United States in a cloud of 
dust? Even now, President Kojima does not feel that Japan lags 
in the hardware area in terms of communications technology. 
  In 1990, NTT led the world in developing asynchronous 
transmission mode (ATM) switching systems which represent the 
heart of next-generation communications services and leads the 
industry in the research and development of switching systems. 
It is a top-class firm in transmission technology, initiating 
high-speed transmission experiments on optical fiber circuits 
with the capacity to transmit 10 gigabytes per second or the 
equivalent of 10 years of newspaper text in one second. Current 
world networks have a maximum capacity of 2.4 gigabytes per 
second. The proposed system will have a capacity which is four 
times greater. The capability to develop such basic technology 
will enable completion of conversion to digital switching 
systems and 100 percent digitalization of communication systems 
by fiscal year 1997. 
  In 1997, conversion of U.S. communication systems to digital 
switching systems will have reached a level of only 80 percent. 
The United States is serviced by nearly 2,000 telephone 
companies, including financially strong firms such as the 
AT&amp;T 
long-distance carrier and the baby Bells which were created as a 
result of the break up of the former AT&amp;T and a number of 
small 
and medium firms. Not all of the firms have the financial 
resources to purchase the newest technology. Even in terms of 
ISDN services, which were initiated in Japan in 1988, U.S. firms 
have not been able to successfully interconnect and are unable 
to provide nationwide services. 
  On the other hand, however, in the United States, it is 
possible to use computer networks for instantaneous access to 
President Clinton's speeches or other government information. 
Vice President Gore can use personal computer networks to hold a 
dialogue with citizens and obtain a copy of the record of such 
conversations from the network. Businesses make active use of 
such networks. There's also the story about the listing of 
Chairman Bill Gate's electronic mail number in a magazine and 
the subsequent inability to cope with the daily volume of 5,000 
communications per day. 
  The lesson learned from the past 10 years concludes with the 
statement, "No IT revolution can be realized without the 
necessary software." 
  Although Japan is advanced in hardware, IT is actually being 
used in the United States. What caused this disparity? President 
Kojima lists the following four reasons: First, he mentions the 
low rate of personal computer installations, especially the 
small number of computers linked to networks. Second, he 
mentions the lack of progress in digitalizing the information 
data base beginning with visual assets. Third, he mentions lack 
of progress in cable television (CATV) installations, 
accompanied by the low rate of household coaxial-optical fiber 
cable installations. And, finally, he mentions the lack of 
progress in the use of software to make effective use of 
networking systems. 
  The lesson learned from the last 10 years leads to the 
simple 
conclusion that, "We cannot even start an IT revolution based on 
hardware initiatives. We cannot start an IT revolution even if 
we develop ATM switching systems of the highest technology, 
build networks of the highest technology and are told to use 
such systems. It is essential that such hardware be serviced by 
a network so that they can be used by any terminal." Even if we 
were to lay optical fiber cables, we cannot initiate the IT age. 
Terminal devises must play a primary role. 
  It is said that "Telescript," developed by General Magic 
Inc. 
will become a world-class standard for multimedia and can be 
installed on and used on computer terminals. However, it has not 
been developed completely from a technical standpoint. 
  One member of NTT's Technical Department states, "We are 
still at the stage where we must first study General Magic's 
technology. During the former NTT days, it was 
verboten to affiliate with third-party technology 
without becoming completely conversant with the system." 
However, we have reached an age where we must make crucial 
decisions without reaching a knowledgeable level. 
  President Kojima comments, "A research center is filled with 
a variety of ideas and concepts. However, when it comes to 
reaching a practical stage, they say wait two or three years. 
But such an approach does not allow us to keep up with the pace 
of technological innovation." We must attain developmental 
speeds reached by U.S. venture firms. 
  The same applies to the Multimedia Promotion Section, under 
the direct control of President Kojima, which is reviewing the 
developmental concepts centered on ATM systems. 
  In the past, the communications world was not so concerned 
about competing in terms of speed. Standards applicable to the 
industry are normally developed in meetings held by worldwide 
communications operators at the International Telecommunications 
Union (ITU) in Geneva which result in the submission of a 
package recommending international standards in four-year cycles. 
  However, the procedure changed with the arrival of ATM 
systems. The portion of the actual standards involving intimate 
work by the computer industry were developed by an industry 
group composed of leading firms such as Sun Microsystems, 
International Business Machines, and Hewlett-Packard and later 
endorsed by the ITU. 
  Communications formed intimate relations with the computer 
world. Advances in technology accelerated and standards 
decisions were made on the basis of market competition. The 
strong survived and de facto standards became the "world 
standards." NTT could no longer resist this trend. 
  NTT took its first step by investing in General Magic Inc. 
In 
January of this year, NTT announced "NTT's Basic Plan Directed 
at the Multimedia Age," and made clear its strategy to 
aggressively tie up with terminal and information producers. 
Concurrently, it established in February a Multimedia Promotion 
Section under the direct control of the president for the 
purpose of selecting firms with which to affiliate and to 
formulate specific strategy. 
  The IT revolution will change the very status of the 
communications industry. President Kojima states, "We are in an 
age where anyone can operate an electrical communications 
business as long as he has a router." 
  In the markets for routers which are switching systems to 
interconnect networks, U.S. venture firms such as Cisco Systems 
command a controlling share with information network systems 
which function with great agility. The small-scale switching 
system purchased by the Academic Information Center under its 
fiscal year 1993 supplemental budget was made by Four Systems 
Inc. of the United States. Just as downsizing has taken place in 
the computer arena, downsizing is about to begin in the 
communications world. 
  President Kojima admits, "We have already discarded concepts 
centering on ATM systems." He has thus parted ways with 
preference for huge networks centered around ATM switching 
systems which can handle images, sound and data in one unit. We 
are no longer in an age where size guarantees competitive 
capabilities. 
  AT&amp;T Vice President Kakes Roger [as transliterated] 
comments, 
"An important factor of the multimedia age is the adaptation of 
technology held by venture firms." Even AT&amp;T, which leads the 
world in technical development and operates the Bell 
Laboratories which discovered the transistor and gave birth to 
the basic technology for today's semiconductor, has actively 
affiliated itself with and invested in 3DO Inc., which developed 
the "REAL" multimedia player which is to be sold domestically by 
Matsushita Electric Industrial, and EO Inc., a maker of portable 
computer terminals. 
  Venture firms rich in creative talents will play a principal 
role in the IT revolution. Competing with the pace maintained by 
such firms will preclude sole reliance on in-house technology. 
Even President Kojima states, "We should bet on the winning 
horse." Unless one is willing to do so, he will not be able to 
survive in this rapidly changing world. 
<H5>  ISDN </H5>
  ISDN represents a digital network which uses a single 
telephone circuit to transmit items such as facsimiles and 
computer data. The system was developed to eliminate the 
previous inconvenience of having to use separate circuits for 
each service and to sign separate contracts. However, as 
terminals became sophisticated and as long as the necessary 
equipment was purchased, it became possible to use telephone 
circuits by themselves to transmit facsimiles and computer data 
and the significance of integration diminished for the user. 
However, there is the advantage with ISDN that information can 
be transmitted at a higher speed than with a telephone circuit. 
"INS" is the trade name for NTT's ISDN service. 
<H5>  ATM Switching Systems </H5>
  This is a switching system called broad-band integrated 
services digital network (B-ISDN) referred to as the 
next-generation digital communications infrastructure. ISDN 
which NTT launched in 1988 can process data in higher volumes 
than analogue circuits, but cannot transmit animated images for 
television. B-ISDN can transmit high-definition television 
images without affecting quality. ATM switching systems enable 
the efficient volume transmission of data in this manner and are 
manufactured and marketed in places like the United States by 
Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, and Oki Electric Industry. 
<H5>  Routers </H5>
  Switching equipment of telephone companies such as NTT have 
the capability to select circuits to reach the number being 
called and to select alternate circuits if the originally 
selected circuit malfunctions. A router serves as a switching 
system for computer networks. As an example, they are used when 
there is a need to interconnect, via relay lines, a local area 
network (LAN) installed in Tokyo headquarters with a LAN 
installed in a research center located in Yokohama. Routers 
accomplish the task of selecting circuits for the accurate 
transmission of data, just like the case with telephones, when 
transmitting data from one LAN to another LAN.

  If you remain immobilized by fear of what you will lose, you 
will be left by the wayside. 
  The impact of the information highway is not limited to 
making personal lives more pleasurable. It will have a dramatic 
effect on improving industrial productivity. Inclusive of that 
benefit, the market potential for the information highway is 
immeasurable. It would be myopic to attempt an estimate of the 
market size for each area, such as that for video on demand or 
home shopping. 
  When automotive highways were built and people and 
industries 
moved to the suburbs, the United States witnessed the 
abandonment of inner cities. The next developmental cycle will 
witness the repetition of the same process on a larger scale. On 
the one hand, small and midsized venture firms and poorly 
situated firms will benefit greatly, but large firms that fail 
to change will not be able to keep pace with the new competitive 
world created by the information highway. Failure to change will 
cause many problems. Firms which fail to build competitive 
capabilities suitable for the information highway age will 
probably be forced to effect considerable personnel cuts and 
modify business operations. 
  When advances are made in the installation of the 
information 
highway, businesses will be able to cope adequately by retaining 
only those core technologies and operating resources essential 
to its operations and by using outside resources for its 
peripheral needs. Since the exchange of information will be 
simplified significantly, the number of previous in-house 
functions to be satisfied on a contract basis can be increased. 
In fact, if a future image of the company can be clearly defined 
and attributes superior to other firms can be acquired, it would 
be preferable to assume a slimmed-down structure. 
  I would like to advise Japanese businessmen that when they 
face major changes of this magnitude, they must not fear for 
their losses. Japan possesses core technology in the information 
communications field, a world-class domestic appliance industry, 
a respectable entertainment industry--albeit not as powerful as 
that of the United States--and people with a high educational 
level. If one were to identify Japan's lagging areas, he would 
probably point to the low level of CATV installations and the 
need for further deregulation. 
  Deregulation in the United States gave birth to increased 
competition and the adverse impact of rising unemployment, but 
produced major economic benefits overall. Japan should be able 
to play a useful role in the information age, if it will proceed 
with deregulation without fear for change. 
  It is a complete error to assume the interpretation that the 
information highway concept in the United States is being 
advanced under the principal leadership of government. The 
information highway will not be built in the same manner as the 
Apollo program or the aircraft industry. Government merely 
played the role of the rooster that signaled the arrival of 
daybreak, and it would be more accurate to say that the 
realities of the new age had already manifested themselves. The 
government-prepared idea of the information highway is very 
crude, no more than a rough guideline, and has very little 
reference value. 
  There are some who associate the information highway with 
nationalism, but Japanese businesses need not be concerned. 
There is no doubt that U.S. firms consider the information 
highway as providing a large market opportunity and that it will 
play an important role in strengthening U.S. industry's 
competitiveness. However, in those areas of the system which 
relate intimately to individuals' personal lives, it is hard to 
visualize a situation where U.S. citizens will opt against 
low-priced, good-quality Japanese-made terminals. 
  The IT revolution will provide Japanese firms with major 
business opportunities and if the IT revolution takes hold in 
Japan, businesses will benefit on a worldwide basis. The reason 
is that the information highway in itself will serve, in 
reality, to tear down national boundaries of the business world.

April Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Paris -- Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata left Japan on 13 April aboard an exclusive 
government plane for Morocco via Paris, to sign a final Uruguay 
Round accord at ministerial talks. Speaking with a group of 
Japanese reporters aboard the plane about prospects for the 
political situation, Foreign Minister Hata said: "The ruling 
parties are now working on coordinating their opinions in an 
effort to keep their coalition framework intact. I think they 
will soon complete their policy coordination and choose a 
candidate to succeed Prime Minister Hosokawa." In this way, the 
foreign minister predicted that a candidate to succeed Hosokawa 
as prime minister would be chosen early next week. 
  The foreign minister has been mentioned as the most likely 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Asked by a 
reporter to comment on this, Hata stated: "I have heard about 
it, but I would like to refrain from mentioning the name of the 
person to become prime minister." Touching on talks with U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scheduled to be held on 15 
April, the foreign minister said: "I intend to tell him that a 
change of government in Japan should not set back Japan-U.S. 
relations," and he added: "It is a matter of course for me to 
call on him to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks after a new government is inaugurated in Japan."

  [Text] A feeling of relief is spreading in the central 
government offices in Kasumigaseki at the current moves of the 
ruling coalition parties to select Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's successor. This is because the basic framework of 
the ruling coalition parties will be maintained, and the 
political upheaval will probably be resolved sooner than 
expected. 
  Hata, who has served in key cabinet posts, including the 
minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, and the 
minister of finance, also has great credibility. In particular, 
being the incumbent foreign minister, he is familiar with the 
substance of the stalled negotiations between Japan and the 
United States, and has many personal connections in the United 
States. He is widely expected to effect a breakthrough in the 
negotiations. 
  The Ministries of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and International 
Trade and Industry [MITI] say that Hata "stands firm on issues 
of principle," (MITI) and that "he will speak up to the United 
States whenever necessary." (MOFA) He is admired for 
negotiating with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor for six 
and one-half hours on the bilateral economic framework talks 
immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February, 
and insisting that "numerical targets are absolutely 
unacceptable." 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] 
says that, "He has served twice as agriculture minister, and is 
the number one expert on agriculture in the coalition 
government," (according to a senior MAFF official). There is 
widespread expectation on Hata particularly because the MAFF and 
the Prime Minister's Office did not exactly see eye to eye 
during the decision process leading to the partial opening of 
the rice market last year. 
  The Ministry of Finance is elated at the fact that the 
framework of the ruling coalition parties will be basically 
maintained. It believes that not only have prospects for 
starting deliberations on the draft 1994 budget become brighter, 
"some progress can also be excepted in tax reform, although this 
is already a bit behind schedule," (according to the Tax Bureau). 
  However, while expectations are high regarding a 
reconciliation between Japan and the United States, others 
express the concern that: "He is the very person who brought 
about the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit meeting; he may 
have some problems when it comes to breaking the current 
deadlock in bilateral relations." Still others are apprehensive 
that with the discord in the ruling parties coming to the 
surface, the policymaking process will be even more arduous.

  [Text] According to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN survey, 68 
percent of lower house Diet members believe that politicians, 
rather than bureaucrats, should make decisions on policies. The 
results of the survey of all lower house Diet members regarding 
the Japanese bureaucratic system indicates that politicians are 
unhappy about the current relationship between themselves and 
bureaucrats. In a similar survey on bureaucrats which NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN conducted last November, 66 percent of 
bureaucrats said that they approved of the practice of 
bureaucrats making policy decisions. Thus, the results of the 
two surveys clearly indicate that politicians and bureaucrats 
hold different views. 
  As for the balance of power between politicians and 
bureaucrats after the inauguration of the coalition government, 
51 percent of lower house members said that "bureaucrats have 
become stronger." In last November's survey, only 22 percent of 
bureaucrats gave the same answer. This indicates that 
politicians are more conscious than bureaucrats of bureaucratic 
domination. As for why they feel bureaucrats have become 
stronger, 45 percent of lower house members said "Diet members 
from the ruling coalition parties are inexperienced," while 29 
percent said that "the coalition government has a weak 
foundation." Thus, its seems that a majority of them believe 
the problem lies in the lack of political leadership. 
  As for bureaucrats' current profile, 77 percent of lower 
house members said that they feel either "dissatisfied" or 
"slightly dissatisfied." In this regard, many politicians say 
that "changes should be made so that politicians can make policy 
decisions." 
  On the other hand, 42 percent of bureaucrats say "nothing 
can 
be done about bureaucratic initiative," and 24 percent say that 
"the current system under which bureaucrats make policy 
decisions is more effective." 
  Asked which government ministry or agency has become more 
powerful since the establishment of the coalition government, a 
significant number of politicians cited the Ministry of Finance. 
  As for a plan proposed by Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] secretary general, to designate Diet members as 
vice ministers and administrative vice ministers for each 
government ministry and agency, 62 percent of lower house 
members approved of the idea. However, while a majority of 
lower house members from Ozawa's very own Shinseito completely 
endorse this idea, many members from the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan and Komeito [Clean Government Party] are cautious about 
it. Thus, there are mixed views among the ruling coalition 
parties regarding this idea. 
  As to which government ministries or agencies were 
considered 
to be unnecessary, the Hokkaido Development Agency landed at the 
top of the list. The Okinawa Development Agency ranked second, 
followed by the National Land Agency. Fourth on the list was 
the Economic Planning Agency, which has lost face because of its 
poor showing in making economic forecasts and which has been 
criticized as being excessively influenced by the Finance 
Ministry. 
  Asked what they felt was lacking among politicians, nearly 
half of the lower house members cited "knowledge regarding 
policies and a willingness to study the subject." 
  As to what they felt was lacking among bureaucrats, many 
politicians cited "a broad perspective" and "flexibility."

  [Text] It has been learned that the Fair Trade Commission 
has issued a warning that an agreement--between the banking and 
securities industries which provided that the share allotted to 
a bank and its subsidiary will not exceed that previously 
allotted to a single firm--in managing a government bond 
underwriting syndicate among bank-affiliated securities firms 
"runs the risk of violating the Antimonopoly Law." The reason 
cited is that, in order to hold down the total shares within an 
upper limit, such agreements require participating firms to 
engage in a voluntary arrangement which in turn obstructs fair 
competition. Because of the potential increase in agreements 
among securities firms to alleviate the effects of changes under 
deregulation measures, the commission will maintain strict 
surveillance over the situation in addition to exerting efforts 
to promote free competition. 
  Bank-affiliated securities firms will begin participating in 
government bond underwriting syndicates beginning with bonds 
issued in April. The upper limit of a share to be controlled by 
one securities firm has been set at "18 percent of the issue," 
in order to avoid the situation in which one firm wins in a 
bidding for a large portion of the issue and distorts the price 
formation process. 
  The securities industry had warned that entry of 
bank-affiliated securities firms in the market place "could lead 
to similar abuses if parent banks and subsidiary securities 
firms joined and won in bidding for a large portion of issues." 
In response, coordination between the banking and securities 
industries resulted in an agreement whereby, "as a matter of 
principle, the share of parent bank and subsidiary securities 
firm will not exceed 18 percent of any given issue," and 
bank-affiliated securities firms had informed the securities 
industry that "they and their parent banking firms would not be 
in a position to win bids for large portions of an issue." 
  The commission has stated relative to the one-firm limit 
that, "The Ministry of Finance can mechanically reduce any bids 
won beyond the one-firm limit and sees no problem in this 
respect." However, relative to the combined bidding by parent 
bank and subsidiary securities firm, it decided, "There is no 
way we can mechanically combine figures and effect an 
adjustment, and there is no way we can avoid a prior agreement. 
Rates and underwriting shares should be determined on a 
competitive basis." The commission takes the position that 
excessive competition and distortions in price formation should 
be handled under other procedures such as the Securities 
Transactions Law. 
  The Fair Trade Commission recently submitted these ideas to 
the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for issuing 
government bonds. In response, the banking and securities 
industries decided to cancel such agreements and notified the 
bank-affiliated securities firms of the decision. The banking 
and securities industries now think it will be difficult to 
arrive at such agreements in the future. 
  Banks intend to actively engage in the bidding for new 
government bond issues to provide for management in investment 
accounts, even after having established securities subsidiaries. 
Bond trading departments provide for the primary source of 
revenues and profits for subsidiary securities firms and many of 
them will be actively bidding for government bonds beginning 
with the April issue. Now that the decision has been made to 
forbid combined bidding ceilings, the potential shares of 
government bond issues for banks and their securities 
subsidiaries could rise and the possibility has increased for a 
stronger role to be played by banks. 
  Not only have business operations been deregulated through 
the full-scale removal of market barriers between banks and 
securities firms but we have now entered into the final phase of 
deregulating interest rates. Some sources point to the potential 
for moves to limit competition because of aversion to 
disintegration of the existing order as a result of such 
deregulation.

<F P=106> [Article by NIKKEI KINYU economics division reporter Kenichi </F>
Kawahara] 
  [Text] Increasing numbers of financial institutions are 
cutting their dividends. The onslaught of dividend cuts which 
began with second regional banks has spread to credit unions and 
shows signs of extending to a portion of the city banks. The 
purpose of such dividend cuts is to preserve internal financial 
strength and assign priority to the disposal of bad debt. 
Currently, little adverse reaction is being voiced by 
shareholders, but allegations have been made of insufficient 
disclosure of information. 
  Akira Takai, chief of the First Business Research Department 
of the Daiwa Research Institute expresses a paradoxical view 
concerning the stock price of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank by saying, 
"The stock market has reacted favorably to actions taken by the 
bank." When the news was announced on 23 March that the bank 
would cut its dividends, its price rose 4 yen, and the ensuing 
days witnessed a gradual rise in the stock price. The moves did 
not reflect stock price action which is typical following the 
announcement of unfavorable news. 
  The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank has officially denied that "any 
decision has been made by the bank" relative to a dividend cut. 
However, there is no denying that the bank is conducting 
internal studies which consider a dividend cut and expectations 
are that in the latter part of April, it will announce "a 1 yen 
dividend cut together with a cost-reduction plan and disposal of 
bad debt." 
  Ever since announcement of earnings reports for the March 
1993 year, many second regional banks either reduced or 
eliminated dividends. They included the Hyogo Bank, Taiheiyo 
Bank, Hanwa Bank, Osaka Bank, and Fukutoku Bank, having been 
affected by adverse conditions occasioned by the bursting of the 
bubble economy. There are signs that March 1994 yearly earnings 
reports will reflect cuts in dividends by credit unions and 
associations on a nationwide basis. Many leading credit unions, 
such as Jonan and Asahi have already announced that they will 
cut dividends two points to 6 percent. 
  It can be said that changes in dividend policies, which 
began 
with the regional financial institutions, have finally spread to 
city banks. However, conditions at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are 
not as serious as they are at the second regional banks. 
  Hokkaido Takushoku Bank still holds undeclared paper profits 
of about 300 billion yen. Otherwise, if undeclared appreciation 
of land values and bad loan reserves are considered, adequate 
financial resources exist to avoid dividend cuts even if 
provision is made for write offs associated with Kabuto Decom 
Inc. stock. According to Daiwa Research Institute, investors 
have taken the view in the market place that "Banks such as 
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank have reduced dividends as the result of 
a full-scale write down of bad loans and have thus established 
the basis for a clean slate for future operations." It appears 
that Hokkaido Takushoku Bank stock price did not decline because 
of such considerations. 
  On 14 and 15 March, the Quick Research Institute conducted a 
questionnaire survey of asset managers at financial institutions 
and asked them for their reaction in the event of a theoretical 
announcement of deficit earnings reports and dividend cuts by 
selected leading banks. Only 1 percent of the managers responded 
that "the news would be interpreted in an adverse manner and 
result in unstable movement in stock markets or financial stocks 
as a whole." The largest group of 43.9 percent responded that, 
"even if such news had a temporary shock effect, such actions 
will lead to an improvement in financial strength of the firms 
involved." 
  The leading regional Ashikaga Bank, which reduced dividends 
effective with the September 1993 midyear earnings report, 
reacted to controversy over its dividend cut by saying, "The 
dividend was cut back to its former level of 5 yen because of a 
50-percent drop in earnings. Dividends should rise and fall 
along with fluctuations in earnings." 
  The Ashikaga Bank has taken action to improve the soundness 
of its operations by liquidating its nonbank subsidiary known as 
Wing Finance and effecting internal bank restructurings. The 
idea is to reduce dividends and concurrently bring an end to 
retrogressive operating methods. 
  Such policies to revise dividend policies by banks seem to 
reflect banks' tendencies concerning pride and the pursuit of 
uniformity in behavior. In the case of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank 
which is a city bank, it cannot reduce its dividend below 5 yen 
because that is the rate of payout maintained by leading 
regional banks. It can increase its retained earnings by only 
about 900 million yen annually--by reducing the dividend by one 
yen--a figure which is incomparably small relative to its bad 
debt figure and would have very little accounting impact. 
  Even in the case of the Ashikaga Bank, it was able to reduce 
its dividend by 1 yen because only a few regional banks, such as 
the Shizuoka Bank, were paying a 6 yen dividend. Ashikaga Bank 
admits, "An annual dividend payout of less than 5 yen is not 
possible." They are admitting that a stable dividend payout is 
unavoidable. 
  Chief Takai of Daiwa Research Institute takes the view that 
the move to reduce dividends among financial institutions will 
not spread to the leading city banks. The reason is that when 
the major effects of relations with shareholders and bank 
customers, recognition by society and responsibilities 
associated with management are considered, many management 
officials believe that "adequate undeclared asset values exist 
and dividend cuts would not be advisable from a 
cost-versus-effect standpoint." 
  Chief Eiji Hirano of the Financial Section, Operations 
Bureau 
of the Bank of Japan voices criticism by saying, "Banks are not 
aware that the days of uniformity in behavior are gone. They 
should become more conscious of the management control mechanism 
reflected in stock market actions." He's saying that the public 
utilities aspect of financial institutions is limited to their 
financial settlement systems and that banks should be treated 
like any other industrial firm in other respects. 
  Needless to say, dividend cuts are not the only action to be 
taken. The reason is that, as reflected in the questionnaire 
survey conducted by the Quick Research Institute, market 
reactions reflect the bold restructuring actions taken after a 
cut in dividends. 
  According to officials of the bank, the Bank of Tokyo was 
"unable to keep up with the dividend increases of other city 
banks" from fiscal years 1983 to 1990 because of the accumulated 
debtor nation problem, but implemented a personnel reduction of 
about 1,000 and, in connection with its September 1993 midyear 
earnings report, restored dividends to the lowest levels 
maintained by city banks. Shareholders, no doubt, will demand 
decisive management actions on the part of banks which effect 
dividend cuts. 
  It is also necessary to take bold action relative to public 
disclosure of information. Bank stock prices fell sharply during 
March and April 1992. The drop in prices was directly triggered 
by massive sales of bank stocks on the part of European and U.S. 
hedge funds. According to the Quick Research Institute, "No 
progress had been made on the public disclosure of bad loans, 
and the fear that banks were holding unlimited quantities of bad 
loans exacerbated the selling trend." 
  The reason why stocks of the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and 
Ashikaga Bank have assumed a firming trend is that public 
disclosure of bad loans has progressed beyond levels of prior 
times and undisclosed bad loan information has been widely 
covered by the mass media. 
  It is also said that the Ministry of Finance, which fears 
that dividend cuts and deficit earnings reports will serve as a 
cause for instability in financial systems, has recently assumed 
a flexible stance. Although premature action should not be taken 
on dividend cuts, we should take action to make public 
disclosure of operating conditions and appropriate dividend 
payout levels permanent fixtures of Japanese financial 
institutions.

  [Text] The March 1994 fiscal year (fiscal year 1993) 
earnings reports of 21 banks including city banks, long-term 
credit banks, and trust and banking companies have been released 
on a flash report basis. Although operating earnings which 
reflect earnings in their main line of business dropped only 6 
percent from the prior year, recurring earnings fell 40 percent 
leading to the fifth year of declines because of aggressive 
disposal of bad loans. "Write-offs" to include losses from the 
disposition of bad loans rose by a multiple of 2.5 to 3.6 
trillion yen and exceeded annual operating profits of 3 trillion 
yen, resulting in record losses. Disposition of bad loans will 
continue in fiscal year 1994 and bank profits are not expected 
to recover until after fiscal year 1995. Although the real 
economy shows signs of a recovery, the residual effects of the 
bubble economy will continue to affect the financial industry 
for some time to come. 
  The foremost characteristic of the March 1994 yearly 
earnings 
reports is that the banks are engaged in a "write-off race" in 
giving highest priority to the disposal of bad loans. Including 
sales to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co., the 21 banks 
disposed of about 5 trillion yen in bad loans during the 
two-year period beginning in the March 1993 fiscal year. 
Although the publicly disclosed bad loan balance of the 21 banks 
as of the end of March, including those where interest payments 
have not been made for six months or more or the issuers have 
failed, total about 14 trillion yen, leading city banks indicate 
that, "since some of the loans are secured by collateral, about 
70-80 percent of the bad loans are about to be liquidated." The 
bulk of the residual bad loans, amounting to 20-30 percent of 
the balance, are expected to be disposed of by sometime in the 
March 1995 fiscal year. Aside from the publicly disclosed bad 
loans, there are loans made to housing loan companies where 
interest payments have been reduced or pardoned, meaning that it 
will take more than two years to completely liquidate all such 
bad loans. 
  In terms of profits, operating profits, which continued to 
expand until the prior fiscal year because of widening profit 
margins created by declining interest rates, will now enter into 
a shrinking margin phase for the first time in three years. The 
majority of the banks have effected write-offs within the scope 
of operating profits, but in the fiscal year ending in March 
1994, they accounted for undeclared profits in stocks, loans and 
some real estate to create funds for use in offsetting bad 
loans. Massive write-offs produced a drop in recurring profits 
of 40 percent compared to the prior year and a drop in current 
year profits of 13 percent. 
  A look at the various operating aspects shows that, among 
city banks, Sanwa Bank ranked first in operating profits, 
recurring profits and current year profits. In the write-off of 
bad loans, the Tokai Bank led city banks by disposing of loans 
carried by nonbank affiliates in the amount of 380 billion yen. 
It was followed by Sakura Bank in the amount of 350 billion yen 
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in the amount of 330 billion yen. 
Sanwa, Fuji, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi and Asahi Banks each also 
wrote off loans totaling more than 200 billion yen, bringing the 
total write- off of bad loans for city banks to a total of 2.4 
trillion yen or twice the level of the prior year. 
  There were no changes in the profit rankings of long-term 
credit banks, but, in terms of write-offs, The Long-Term Credit 
Bank of Japan led by disposing of 300 billion yen in bad loans, 
including those associated with EIE Company-related loans and 
among trust and banking companies Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, 
Sumitomo Trust and Banking, Mitsui Trust and Banking and Yasuda 
Trust and Banking each wrote off loans in excess of 100 billion 
yen. 
  The banks took action to write off bad loans irrespective of 
profit levels because of the guidance furnished by the Ministry 
of Finance and Bank of Japan as well as consideration for the 
low assessment of Japanese banks by overseas investors based on 
declining ratings of bonds in investment portfolios. However, 
unlike U.S. banks, there were no Japanese banks which produced 
deficit earnings reports in the process of taking write-off 
actions in connection with earnings reports for the year ending 
in the March 1994. However, some sources express the view that 
"the phased disposition of bad loans as practiced by Japanese 
banks will delay the recovery in financial business circles."

  [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] and aircraft makers, such 
as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have begun considering plans to 
designate a redesigned version of the next-generation support 
fighter (FSX) as a successor to the current aircraft being used 
for high-level training since the latter is becoming outdated. 
The FSX is currently being developed with joint Japanese-U.S. 
efforts. Initial plans called for purchasing at the most about 
130 of these aircraft, which were originally intended as support 
fighters. To turn them into high-level training aircraft, 
aircraft makers would be required to increase their total 
production to a little under 200 units. The increased 
production is expected to reduce unit production costs. Another 
advantage is that it would help U.S. military industries, which 
are suffering from defense spending cuts, to make more profit. 
  The FSX is a successor to the F-1 support fighter. 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is the primary contractor for its 
production. Since the maximum number of these aircraft to be 
purchased is approximately 130--a rather low figure--unit cost 
is said to range from 7 billion to 8 billion yen. Consequently, 
reducing production costs has been a problem. 
  Meanwhile, the T-2, a domestically produced high-level 
training aircraft, has served as the basis for designing the 
F-1. A little under 100 of these aircraft were produced as of 
1988. It made its maiden flight in 1971, much earlier than the 
F-1. The aircraft has become outdated, and several of them have 
already been decommissioned. 
  The DA considers selection of a successor to the T-2 as an 
important issue in its next defense program, which starts in 
fiscal year 1996. Preparations have already begun. 
  Initially, there were plans for Japan to independently 
develop a supersonic aircraft to replace the T-2. Since, among 
other reasons, Japan would have to bear development costs, 
circumstances are such that it would have to give up on the plan 
to build a completely new aircraft. 
  Should the FSX be successfully transformed into a training 
aircraft, the DA would purchase about 200 of these aircraft. It 
is hoped that production costs would be reduced as a result of 
mass production.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 12 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In an 
interview to the "ARDYN ERH" correspondent the Ambassador of 
China to Mongolia Pei Jiayi has expressed his confidence in 
further development of goodneighbouring friendly relations 
between the two countries on the basis of efforts by both sides 
and the five principles of peaceful coexistence. He noted that 
for the development of Chinese-Mongolian relations in future of 
great significance would be the forthcoming visit by the premier 
of the State Council of the People's Republic of China (PRC) Li 
Peng to Mongolia at the invitation of the Prime Minister P. 
Jasray by the end of April in the current year. 
  Having expressed his satisfaction with the successful 
development of bilateral relations in all spheres, the 
ambassador stressed that there are not any substantial obstacles 
in this respect and as for the particular problems to be arising 
they would be solved gradually step by step. The ambassador 
said that the Chinese Government is taking strict measures for 
ill quality goods not to be penetrating into the international 
market. He also expressed a hope for gradual regulation of some 
certain problems concerning the barter trade connected in 
particular with the shortcomings of infrastructure and 
activities of the transport.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said Saturday [9 April] the new administration 
will put top priority on economic reforms and deregulation. 
  Addressing the opening session of the Trilateral Commission, 
Hosokawa contended that his government has laid down the ground 
work for deregulation since it came to power last August. 
  The commission is formed by 330 former political and 
business 
leaders from Japan, the United States and Europe to set forth 
proposals on problems of common interest. It is chaired by 
former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. 
  The current session, which opened at a Tokyo hotel on 
Saturday, is the commission's 25th general meeting. 
  Hosokawa announced Friday he will step down to take 
responsibility for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal 
problems, including a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, 
the scandal-tainted trucking group. 
  Referring to foreign criticism that Japan's markets are 
closed to imports, Hosokawa said Japan should take positive 
action to open its markets, regarding such criticism as an

promoting economic reform not only benefits the Japanese people 
but is also Japan's international obligation.

  [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- The Japan Atomic 
Industrial Forum began its annual meeting Wednesday [13 April] 
in Hiroshima, the first time it has been held in the world's 
first atomic-bombed city. 
  The three-day meeting has as its theme "toward a world free 
of nuclear weapons, the role of peaceful use." It will feature 
addresses on Wednesday by Hans Blix, director general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
author Richard Rhodes. 
  This year for the first time, at a Wednesday panel 
discussion, the meeting will deal with the problems of 
dismantling nuclear weapons. 
  On Thursday, atomic power advocates are scheduled to meet 
with citizens of Hiroshima and victims of the 1945 atomic 
bombing, including the head of an association of Korean victims 
of the nuclear holocaust, Yi Sil-gun [name as received], for an 
exchange of opinions. 
  Some 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad 
are 
expected to take part in the symposium, which has been held 
annually since 1968.

  [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- A forum on atomic 
energy started a three-day conference Wednesday [13 April] in 
this atomic-bombed city to discuss the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. 
  Takashi Mukaibo, chairman of the Japan Atomic Industrial 
Forum, urged participants to discuss the elimination of nuclear 
weapons and the peaceful uses of atomic energy as the 50th 
anniversary of A-bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is 
approaching. 
  About 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad 
are taking part in the 27th annual conference. 
  Around the conference hall in central Hiroshima, about 30 
antinuclear activists protested the meeting. 
  Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), told the meeting that the IAEA will hold a 
special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the 
Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine. 
  Chernobyl was the scene of one of the world's most serious 
nuclear accidents in 1986. Although the nuclear reactor 
involved in the accident has not been operational, two other 
reactors have since been in operation. The Ukrainian government 
decided to continue to operate the two reactors and has asked 
the IAEA to investigate safety. 
  On Thursday, atomic power advocates are scheduled to meet 
with citizens of Hiroshima and victims of the 1945 atomic 
bombing, including the head of an association of Korean victims 
of the nuclear holocaust, Yi Sil-gun [name as received], for an 
exchange of opinions.

  [Excerpt] Kyoto, April 14 KYODO -- The world's energy 
policy experts jointly called for stronger global cooperation 
for stable economic growth and energy policies at a seminar 
under sponsorship of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 
Kyoto on Thursday [14 April]. 
  The seminar, hosted by Japan to commemorate the 20th 
anniversary of the agency's establishment, gathered some 300 
participants from 26 countries around the world, including four 
nonmember nations of the agency such as Russia. The guests, 
including Bob Hawke, former Australian prime minister, and Brent 
Scowcroft, former U.S. presidential assistant, discussed 
current problems in global security policies in relation to 
energy in the post-Cold War era. 
  They stressed it is important for all countries in the world 
to strengthen cooperation through international organizations 
like the IEA to maintain stable economic growth and energy 
policies. 
  Otto Lambsdorff, former German economic minister, discussed 
the global warming problem stemming from increasing energy use. 
He suggested creation of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and 
said countries capable of introducing such a tax should do so as 
soon as possible. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Chong Hae-yong reports from Washington] </F>
  [Text] North Korea was learnt to have recently proposed to 
the United States that they resume unofficial working-level 
contacts to discuss means for a breakthrough in the nuclear 
issue. This comes at a time when the United States has beefed 
up firm actions against North Korea's unwillingness to accept 
nuclear inspections, through consecutive contacts with the ROK, 
China, and Japan. The talks, however, are unlikely to be 
realized by next week since U.S. Defense Secretary Perry and 
Robert Gallucci, the special envoy on the North Korean nuclear 
issue, will be visiting the ROK, China, and Japan. North Korea 
also does not usually make moves before or after Kim Il-song's 
birthday on 15 April. 
  A high-level U.S. source on 13 April assessed that North 
Korea proposed the contact to determine the true intentions of 
the United States since the United States and the ROK have taken 
active moves with China, Japan, and Russia aimed at 
strengthening the international cooperative system following the 
adoption of the UN Security Council President's statement 
calling on North Korea to accept inspections. North Korea 
apparently hopes to resume contacts in order to open a dialogue 
channel with the United States prior to the next phase of action 
the UN Security Council may pursue following the early May 
deadline in the Council President's statement, the source added.

  [Text] In his interview with the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN, Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], confirmed that North Korea is now 
constructing another nuclear reprocessing facility within the 
complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. 
  In an interview with the paper, Director-General Hans Blix, 
who is now staying in Japan, said that he could not know when 
the facility would be completed, but when it is built, North 
Korea's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used 
for a nuclear weapons program -- would double. 
  Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to 
inspect 
two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the 
IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal] of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
on Thursday agreed to handle the issue of North Korean loggers 
in Russia from the approach of humanitarianism and in deference 
to their personal wish. 
  The agreement was reached in a Moscow meeting between 
visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and his 
Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev. 
  The two ministers also discussed the question of President 
Kim Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said in Seoul that 
during 
the meeting, Minister Han asked Kozyrev to give positive 
assistance in case those North Korean loggers who had escaped 
Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia wish to come to South 
Korea. 
  "Minister Han also stressed that escaped North Korean 
loggers 
should not be repatriated to North Korea against their will, 
asking Russia to see to it they remain under Russia's legal 
protection," Hong said. 
  The vice minister said Minister Kozyrev made it clear that 
Russia will positively cooperate in having North Korean loggers 
lawfully go to a country or countries of their choice. 
  They also agreed on the need to obtain cooperation from the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) so as to 
buttress the fairness and objectivity of the way North Korean 
loggers will be handled. 
  On President Kim's official visit to Russia, the two 
ministers in effect confirmed the time of his visit, June this 
year, and discussed the agenda topics of a Korea-Russia summit 
meeting to be held during kim's visit, Vice Minister Hong said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
raise from now on the question of North Koreans' human rights at 
international organizations, a senior government official said 
on Thursday. 
  The policy comes on heels of the recent government decision 
to handle the question of North Korean loggers in Russia from 
the approach of humanitarianism, that is, to explore ways to 
help them. 
  "The government is studying ways to grasp the comprehensive 
picture of North Koreans' human rights conditions including 
those of North Korean loggers in Russia," the official said. 
  Based on a finding, he said, the government will raise the 
issue at relevant United Nations agencies and world human rights 
organizations like the Amnesty International. 
  The official said the government may also in due course take 
steps to seek the repatriation of those South Korean fishermen 
and airplane crew persons being held in North Korea following 
their seizure by the North Koreans. 
  He further said he understands that a protest rally is being 
prepared in Osaka, Japan in connection with the recent missing 
of two Japanese women who, along with their Korean husbands, had 
moved to North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
purchased no "April 15 gifts" for its people from other 
countries this year, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) and 
business sources said Thursday. 
  The North used to buy consumer goods from the South and 
other 
countries to give to its citizens on Kim Il-song's birthday 
until last year, KOTRA officials said. 
  Pyongyang ordered cloth for student uniforms from South 
Korean businesses late last year but then canceled the order as 
tension on the peninsula mounted because of the nuclear row, 
sources said. 
  A KOTRA official said, "we collected reports from trade 
offices in many countries and found out that even Thailand, 
Germany and china, whose trade volumes with North Korea are 
relatively large, have not sold any `April 15 gifts.'" 
  He added that North Korea has purchased few consumer 
products 
this year other than some Chinese apples. 
  "At this time of year in the past, North Korea used to buy a 
lot of canned pork, cloth and sugar." 
  An official at the National Unification Board confirmed that 
no consumer goods have been sold to the North this year. 
  The official said, "North Korea seems to have decided that 
it 
will reduce the program for Kim Il-song's birthday this year due 
to its economic difficulties." 
  South Korean businesses sold several million dollars worth 
of 
consumer goods to North Korea in 1992 when Kim Il-song 
celebrated his 80th birthday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen, saying the North Korean nuclear issue is heading in 
the right direction, asserted the problem should be resolved 
through dialogue, the TOKYO SHIMBUN reported Thursday. 
  Qian made the remark in an interview with the newspapers's 
publisher, Kato Kiichiro, at the official Chinese guest house in 
Beijing. 
  Qian also said it is understandable that Pyongyang rejected 
a 
UN Security Council presidential statement because North Korea 
opposes the council taking up the nuclear matter. The 
presidential statement, adopted unanimously by the council, 
urges North Korea to allow outside inspections of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  The North Korean nuclear impasse, nevertheless, is "moving 
in 
the right direction bit by bit," Qian was quoted as saying. 
  He said China favors talks through three channels -- between 
North Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea 
and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  Qian said China pushed the Security Council president's 
statement, which has no binding power, since it is against the 
United Nations handling the issue. 
  Asked whether North Korea had nuclear bombs, Qian said he 
could not be sure. This seemed to indicate a slight change in 
China's previous position that North Korea has neither the 
intention nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons, the TOKYO 
SHIMBUN reported.

  [Text] The Ministry of National Defense said today that a 
Chinese military attache office will be opened in the ROK on 16 
April. General (Jin Hunghen) and Colonel (Shang Kyo) will come 
to the ROK as military attache officers. 
  The Chinese military attache office will be opened in 
accordance with an agreement between the ROK and PRC Governments 
signed in September 1992 to open military attache offices in 
each capital. In December last year, the ROK opened its 
military attache office in China. 
  Regarding this, the Ministry of National Defense said that 
China's opening of its military attache office in Seoul is an 
expression of its will not to unilaterally support North Korea's 
aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, and that this 
will help ease North Korea's recent will to provoke South Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has proposed 
signing a friendship treaty with China, North Korea's staunchest 
ally, during policy planning talks in Beijing, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Thursday. 
  Yi Chang-chun, assistant minister for policy planning, 
suggested that the two countries sign a friendship pact to lay a 
firmer groundwork for bilateral relations, officials said. 
  Yi is in Beijing for the second South Korea-China Policy 
Planning Consultations. 
  Seoul had cautiously suggested a "Beijing declaration" to 
showcase their budding relations when the two sides normalized 
ties in August 1992, but the idea died out. 
  Yi and his Chinese counterpart Pei Yuan Ying discussed joint 
participation in regional security talks including the Asean 
Regional Forum (ARF), the officials said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and 
China have signed a contract to build a hotel near Mt. Paekdu on 
a joint-venture basis, the semi-official China News Service 
reported Wednesday. 
  Mt. Paekdu is located on the border between North Korea and 
China and many South Koreans, who consider it a holy site, like 
to climb the mountain on the Chinese side. 
  Samson Enterprises Co. of Korea and Yanbian Tourism Corp. of 
Jilin Province have agreed to invest 8 million U.S. dollars in 
building a hotel to accommodate 1,200 guests near Mt. Paekdu. 
  The project has been approved by the Chinese State Council. 
  Samson and the Yanbian Tourism Company have set up a 
joint-venture company to operate the hotel over the coming 50 
years and they plan to use the profits to boost farming in 
Yanbian, largely populated by ethnic Koreans.

<F P=106> [By Staff Reporter Kim Song-pok] </F>
  [Text] The tension between the rival parties over the 
suspicion that huge amounts of "political funding" were provided 
to the ruling party is developing into a queer conflict between 
the current and former governments and the opposition camp as 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] yesterday accepted the 
opposition Democratic Party [DP]'s demand for a National 
Assembly investigation of the allegation. 
  The problem starts with the donation by the Chongwoo 
Construction Co., the contractor in a lucrative project to 
relocate the "Sangmudae" military base in Kwangju, of eight 
billion won out of a total 22.7 billion won in its "secret 
chest" to Tonghwa Temple in Taegu, the native place of former 
president No Tae-u, to build a Buddhist statue in 1992. 
  The allegation is that 5.6 billion of the eight billion won 
found its way into the ruling camp as a kickback for the 
lucrative project after laundering by Buddhist circles. 
  The DLP's agreement to accept the DP demand is construed as 
a 
gesture showing the clean hands of the party and the Kim 
Yong-sam government. Conversely speaking, the incumbent 
government is pointing an accusing finger at its predecessor, 
the No administration. 
  With the ball smashed into its court, the No's camp appears 
to be on the alert and, at the same time, giving vent to hard 
feelings against the Kim administration, saying that Kim is 
attempting to pass the buck to No. 
  Under the bashing of skepticism among the people, Chongwadae 
has reportedly carried out secret in-house probes into Home 
Minister Choe Hyong-u and exchange-Rep. So Sok-chae, a confidant 
of President Kim, both suspected of being privy to the political 
funding. 
  The reported outcome is that their hands are clean. Instead, 
the finger is pointing to the No administration. 
  A DLP key post-holder who is a President Kim protege said on 
condition of anonymity, "Now that close aides to President Kim 
have proved to have nothing to do with the scandal, there is no 
reason for a cover-up." 
  He added, "Now the opposition camp will playing another 
boring game with those who were at the core of power during the 
No government over a past irregularity." 
  The DLP's agreement to the Assembly action may be aimed at 
escaping from the political quandary into which it has fallen 
and, instead, at pitting the opposition party against the No 
administration. 
  President Kim Tuesday instructed the ruling party to "face 
the matter squarely." 
  Meantime, the No camp, better known as "Yonhui-tong," the 
name of the area where No lives, is fuming against the Kim 
government, thinking the current administration is treating it 
too harshly. 
  An aide to No who wanted to remain anonymous said 
sarcastically, "We do not hope to be protected by the current 
government but this is going too far." 
  He added he worried that this may become a precedent to find 
fault with any matter in the past. 
  The aide also said confidently, "The Assembly's probe will 
find little." 
  A senior DLP lawmaker who held a ranking party post during 
the No government criticized the Kim administration, saying, 
"Did the Kim government only find out now that the Sangmudae 
relocation project was carried out during the previous 
government?" 
  He added that the attempt to divert public attention, acting 
as if there had been a deal on political funding during No's 
days does not befit with the image of the reform-oriented 
current government. 
  He also said, "The current government is ignoring the 
prosecutors' conclusions that the eight billion won was all used 
for the Buddhist project." 
  Another former ranking official who served in the No 
government maintained that Chongwadae and the opposition party 
are scheming to make the No administration a common target 
finding an odor in their own houses in connection with the 
"political funds." 
  He pointed out the fact that all the presidential candidates 
attended the dedication ceremony of the giant granite Buddha 
image built at the Tonghwa Temple. 
  He added, "If they look into the scandal, they will find 
that 
flames will fly in directions they do not expect." 
  The opposition party throws a skeptical eye at Yi Hyon-u, 
former chief of presidential security service, and former 
Sports-Youth Affairs Minister Yi Chin-sam.

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- A collective sigh of 
relief is almost audible in the presidential office at 
Chongwadae these days as politically damaging issues are being 
brought under control. One of the most serious disputes 
threatening to disrupt the normal operations of the ruling party 
and the government was an opposition charge that a huge slush 
fund, set up by a construction company, may have been channeled 
into politics during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
  The threat was defused Wednesday when the ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) and the main opposition Democratic Party 
(DP) agreed to invoke parliament's right to investigate the 
allegation on the "Sangmudae slush fund scam." Also on 
Wednesday, the Rev. So Ui-hyon announced that he would resign as 
the powerful chief administrator of the Buddhist Chogye order, 
opening the way for a peaceful resolution of the violent 
factional feud between So's followers and reformist monks. 
  These two developments apparently put President Kim Yong-sam 
at ease for the first time since he returned from a trip to 
Japan and China with the stated intention of concentrating on 
efforts to boost the nation's competitive strength. That is why 
"the atmospheric depression," as one Chongwadae official put it, 
seems to be clearing from the Chongwadae area and the chief 
presidential aides have also "brightened up." 
  President Kim has maintained that all controversial 
political 
issues must be resolved at the National Assembly and not 
"outside it," as the opposition party had been threatening to do. 
  The DP had said it would stage "outdoor" rallies and 
campaigns if the ruling party and the government ignored its 
calls for probes into the three major "suspicions" including the 
Samgmudae slush fund scam. The Democratic Party did join student 
activists and farmers at "outdoor" rallies last weekend, 
protesting against opening the rice market to imports and 
demanding renegotiation of the Uruguay Round [UR]. 
  While trying to turn public opinion against the Uruguay 
Round, the DP vowed that it would build a popular consensus to 
reject National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round 
accord. 
  Sensing that the opposition party has managed to generate 
little public support for its "outdoor" rallies, President Kim 
is said to be more confident of a breakthrough in the current 
political impasse. 
  Kim apparently felt so comfortable with the future political 
course that he even took time out to attend a professional 
baseball game in Seoul last Sunday and the Paris Bastille 
Opera's performance of "Salome" on Tuesday. 
  The ruling party's agreeing to a parliamentary investigation 
of the Sangmudae scam was also seen as an expression of the 
president's confidence, observers say. 
  President Kim instructed DLP lawmakers to "face the 
opposition squarely" and tackle the Sangmudae probe with their 
heads held high when the National Assembly convenes an 
extraordinary 20-day session for that purpose April 25. Kim 
wants to show the people that his administration has nothing to 
do with the Sangmudae scam and once again prove that the first 
democratically elected government in over 30 years stands on 
firm moral ground. The president hopes to demonstrate that all 
issues must be discussed and solved in the National Assembly -- 
the true arena for political negotiation by representatives of 
the people. 
  Various political and social woes, all of which threatened 
to 
cripple the Kim administration, have cropped up in the past 15 
days since Kim's return home, and one Chongwadae official called 
the period "a succession of nightmares for us." They included 
frequent "stalling accidents" plaguing a newly opened subway 
line and allegations of illegal electioneering by Kim's 
associates, in addition to the UR issue and the violent clashes 
at Chogye temple. But now the Kim administration is fully awake 
and in firm control, thanks to Kim's well-known political forte: 
Staging a frontal attack. 
  Ahead of the administration lie mountains of problems, none 
of which will be easy to resolve. Among them are the North 
Korean nuclear dispute, the question of what to do with escapees 
from North Korean logging camps in Russia, ratification of the 
UR accord and wage negotiations with labor unions. 
  The president and his aides at Chongwadae, brimming with 
regained confidence, are ready to tackle them one after another, 
according to Chongwadae insiders.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyong-kun] </F>
  [Text] The domestic development and commercialization of 
the CDMA (code division multiple access) digital mobile 
communication system is expected to move into high gear as 
Pohang Iron and Steel Company [Posco] (the leading stockholder 
of the second mobile communication service) and Korea Mobile 
Telecom (the existing first mobile communication service) are 
both planning to actively participate in the development of the 
CDMA system which will be used by the operator of the second 
mobile service. 
  According to the Ministry of Communications and business 
sources, on 9 March, with the selection process for the operator 
of the second mobile telephone service nearing the completion 
stage, Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, Posco's subsidiary, is planning 
to participate in the domestic development of the CDMA system 
through the transfer of technical know-how from the American 
firm Qualcomm, with which it has a technical cooperation 
agreement and which is the advocate of the CDMA system. 
  Korea Mobile Telecom, which has been taken over by Sunkyong, 
also has a plan to gradually introduce the CDMA system and has 
decided to participate in the development process from the stage 
of on-site testing of CDMA trial products, scheduled to begin 
this June, to the stage of commercialization. All this will 
accelerate an early acquisition of the technical expertise 
necessary for the domestic development and commercialization of 
the CDMA system. 
  In particular, the Electronics Telecommunications Research 
Institute [ETRI], the main promoter of the CDMA system 
development, recently signed a $5 million-dollar contract with 
Qualcomm for the three-stage joint development of low-level 
detailed designs of the CDMA system. 
  Pak Hang-ku, head of the mobile communication technology 
research group, has said: "The three-stage contract calls for 
designing and developing equipment used in cell sites and the 
base system, developing mobile terminal equipment, and on-site 
testing of trial products by this November. These stages 
constitute the core of the CDMA system development." During this 
period, he added, companies to build the network equipment will 
be chosen. 
  Concerning the CDMA system development plan, Sin Yong-sop, 
chief of the radio wave technology section of the Communications 
Ministry, said: "As soon as the operator of the second mobile 
communication service is selected, it will be made to 
participate in the CDMA development plan so that it may secure 
CDMA operating technology and promote procurement of the 
home-made CDMA system and thus achieve the commercialization of 
the system as scheduled." 
  He added that the second carrier will, as Korea Mobile 
Telecom did, share the CDMA system research and development cost 
and participate in the system development process from the stage 
of on-site testing of trial products to that of their 
commercialization. 
  The development program for the CDMA system, which will have 
a decisive impact on the second carrier's schedule to open its 
service and its business success, was launched in 1989. But it 
has been marred by some hitches, such as those in the trial 
production of equipment to be used in base and control stations, 
caused by a delay in signing technology-related contracts 
between Qualcomm and the ROK participants in the joint 
development program. 
  Despite the success in the theory on the CDMA system, no 
country in the world has ever applied it to commercial use. For 
this reason, it is undeniable that there has been skepticism 
about attempting to commercialize this frontier technology in 
our country. 
  The Ministry of Communications adopted the CDMA mode as the 
domestic standard last June ahead of any other country in the 
world. Prompted by this decision, our major communication 
equipment makers, such as Samsung, Goldstar, and Hyundai, led by 
ETRI, embarked upon the development of the CDMA system and its 
terminal equipment under a technology contract with Qualcomm. 
However, in their opinion it would be difficult to achieve the 
commercialization of the system by the end of 1995 because no 
testing of a trial product has been conducted yet. 
  A concerned source said that judging from the pace of 
development in the past, the commercialization of the CDMA 
system by the use of domestically available technology is not 
likely to be realized until 1997. He fears that the second 
carrier will have to either delay the opening of the service or 
spend hundreds of billions of yen to buy the whole system and 
terminal equipment from abroad. 
  The Ministry of Communications, however, says that with the 
development project proceeding smoothly, there will be no 
trouble in commercializing the technology used in the CDMA 
system, which has a capacity 10 to 20 times greater than the 
analog system, the only problem being the level of the service 
that will be offered. 
  The Ministry of Communications is optimistic about the tempo 
of the CDMA system development program, which the government and 
business are pushing with a total investment of 81.1 billion 
won. According to the ministry, the development of trial 
commercial products and their test runs will be completed by 
this September as scheduled; and beginning next March the 
production of the commercial system will begin, and the 
commercial service will open in the fourth quarter after going 
through an on-site testing procedure in the third and fourth 
quarter. 
  Judging from the development process until now, overall the 
local development and commercialization of the CDMA system has 
no problem, except that there are delays in some particular 
parts of the development program.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Nissan Motor Co. said 
Thursday [14 April] that one of its U.S. subsidiaries will 
start production of Nissan electric forklifts in the second half 
of 1995. 
  Nissan Forklift Corp., North America (NFC), based in 
Marengo, 
Illinois, made the decision in order to further advance 
localization as well as to help shorten delivery time and cut 
production costs, the second-largest Japanese automaker said. 
  NFC now produces internal-combustion-powered forklifts 
mainly 
for the North American market. It also makes electric forklifts 
under the Barrett brand name. 
  NFC is owned 2 percent by Nissan, 88 percent by a Nissan 
subsidiary, Nissan Industrial Equipment Co., and the remaining 
10 percent by Marubeni Corp., a giant Japanese trading house.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan condemned Thursday 
[14 April] a bus bombing the previous day in Hadera, northern 
Israel, which killed at least six people and wounded about 30. 
  The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Japanese 
Government "strongly regrets" that civilians were victims in the 
attack and offered its sympathies to their families. 
  "Japan strongly condemns this kind of terrorism by some 
extremists, which is aimed at obstructing the peace process," 
the statement said. 
  Japan also regrets that Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) have not yet agreed on the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho 
despite an historic declaration on principles on self-rule last 
September in Washington. 
  The declaration stipulated the deadline for completion of 
the 
withdrawal as April 13. 
  Japan will continue to support the peace process, the 
statement said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The head of the U.N. 
nuclear monitoring agency predicts the problem of North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons may be brought up again 
at the U.N. Security Council if there is no progress on the 
issue by early May, a top Japanese Foreign Ministry official 
said Thursday [14 April]. 
  Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), made the remark in a meeting with Vice 
Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, the official said. 
  Saito told Blix that Japan wants to seek a solution to the 
North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, he said. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined 
to 
elaborate on the meeting. 
  Blix is in Japan to attend an annual meeting in Hiroshima of 
the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. 
  He said in Hiroshima that the IAEA has sent a letter to 
North 
Korea asking that inspectors be allowed access to a 
radiochemical laboratory but that Pyongyang has not responded 
yet. 
  IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea in March for 
their first look at nuclear facilities there in more than a year. 
  But they were unable to determine if radioactive materials 
had been diverted to military purposes because North Korea 
blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory. 
  North Korea says its nuclear program is peaceful.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- World growth and job 
problems will top discussions at a series of international 
financial meetings slated later this month in Washington, a 
senior Finance Ministry official said Thursday [14 April]. 
  The meetings will "center on the issues of still high 
unemployment among Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and 
on stable world growth, particularly with European nations still 
not in good shape," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news 
meeting. 
  A spate of international gatherings of financial leaders are 
scheduled in Washington late this month, led by the semiannual 
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Interim 
Committee, the Joint Development Committee of the IMF and the 
World Bank. 
  An international financial source said finance ministers and 
central bankers from the G-7 nations are expected to meet April 
24 before the gatherings. 
  The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan and the United States. 
  Saito said he is yet not certain about a bilateral meeting 
between Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A lingering row within the 
governing coalition on Thursday [14 April] continued the 
stalemate in talks over future policies and the choice of a 
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Leaders of three of the seven coalition parties met Thursday 
evening and agreed not to endorse a package of proposals adopted 
at an earlier meeting of the coalition's decision-making caucus 
made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said. 
  The three parties are the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the 
largest coalition contingent, and its two allies -- the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger]. 
  At the gathering of the coalition executives, which Sakigake 
boycotted, they shared the view that the eight-month-old 
alliance might collapse if its components reject the agreement, 
the officials said. 
  The agreement calls on all top leaders of coalition parties 
to decide by themselves to convene a meeting to discuss the 
makeup of a new coalition government and the selection of a 
candidate to replace Hosokawa, the officials said. 
  It also included an accord to resume talks on policy matters 
toward establishment of the next administration and an appeal 
for Sakigake, a tiny component of the ruling union, to return to 
the negotiating table, they said. 
  Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 
convened a general meeting Thursday evening of all its 15 House 
of Representatives members, who unanimously agreed to reject the 
coalition accord on the reopening of policy talks, party 
officials said. 
  Sakigake has contended that top party leaders, and not the 
secretaries general-level representatives, should contemplate a 
combination of political parties that would comprise the new 
coalition government and find a successor to Hosokawa. 
  It is widely believed the party's stance is intended to 
prevent the coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and his ally, 
Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, from dominating 
policy-making on the choice of a new premier. 
  Under the Hosokawa administration, the personal rivalry 
between Ozawa and Takemura flared up many times over such key 
policy issues as political reform, the partial opening of 
Japan's rice market, and Hosokawa's abortive attempts to impose 
a new value-added tax called the "National Welfare Tax" and 
reshuffle the cabinet. 
  In a three-way meeting Thursday morning, SDP Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake's 
Takemura agreed that a forum of all coalition heads should seek 
a breakthrough in the selection process. 
  The three parties earlier called for a meeting of the 
coalition leaders, but Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan 
New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal. 
  Following rejection of the package by the three coalition 
heads and Sakigake, the deputy chiefs met twice and agreed to 
allow the SDP and the DSP to take their time to fine-tune 
opinions within the parties, coalition officials said. 
  The coalition executives will gather again on Friday 
afternoon, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) President Yohei Kono will meet Michio Watanabe, an LDP 
faction leader and former foreign minister, on Friday [15 April] 
to ask him not to run for the premiership to avoid splitting the 
largest opposition party, LDP sources said Thursday. 
  Kono will visit the faction office of Watanabe at 4 P.M. 
[0700 GMT] Friday, they said. 
  Kono vowed Tuesday to run in a prime ministerial election in 
the Diet for the successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who last Friday announced his resignation. 
  Watanabe is eager to be prime minister and had rejected 
Kono's request for face-to-face talks. 
  Executive members of his faction met Wednesday and agreed to 
lobby other LDP members by seeking their signatures endorsing 
Watanabe as the next premier, faction sources said. Nearly 100 
signatures have been collected, a senior faction executive said. 
  Watanabe faction executives affirmed their opinions that the 
LDP president must not necessarily be the party's candidate for 
prime minister, and that a government with large alliances of 
ruling and opposition camps is needed to break through the 
political turmoil following Hosokawa's announcement, they said. 
  Members of an LDP faction led by former Prime Minister 
Kiichi 
Miyazawa agreed Thursday to back Kono as the sole LDP candidate 
for the premiership, faction sources said. Kono had belonged to 
the Miyazawa faction until he became LDP president last July. 
  The Miyazawa faction decided to set up an election campaign 
office for Kono in a Tokyo hotel in case Watanabe does not give 
up his candidacy and to seek support from other parties' 
members, the sources said. 
  In three other factions -- led respectively by former 
Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Keizo Obuchi and former State Minister Toshio Komoto 
-- members generally fear a party split-up and hope Kono and 
Watanabe will peacefully resolve the candidacy issue through 
talks, faction sources said. 
  Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime ministerial 
candidate after a feud within the ruling coalition threatened to 
split the government, weakening the chances of front-runner 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named Hosokawa's successor. 
  But on Tuesday, the coalition, which was on the verge of 
collapse, moved to maintain the current framework of the 
government, once again strengthening Hata's hand. 
  However, a senior member of Watanabe's faction said there is 
still hope Watanabe will be named prime minister because the 
ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds within the 
shaky alliance and band together to support Hata.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
proposed Thursday [14 April] that top leaders of the seven 
coalition parties decide by themselves to convene a meeting to 
discuss the choice of successor to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, coalition officials said. 
  This was part of a set of proposals adopted at a Thursday 
evening session of the coalition's decision-making forum at the 
level of secretaries general. 
  The package of proposals also included agreement to launch 
talks on policy matters toward establishment of a new government 
and an appeal for new party Sakigake [Harbinger], one of the 
seven ruling parties, to come back to the forum, the officials 
said. 
  The secretaries general of the parties in the forum, which 
was boycotted by Sakigake, shared the perception that the 
eight-month alliance might be dissolved if the parties involved 
reject the accord, the officials said. 
  Leaders of three of the seven parties -- the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and 
Sakigake -- gathered to consider the set of proposals Thursday 
evening but agreed to reject it. 
  Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 
convened a general meeting of all its 15 members in the House of 
Representatives on Thursday, who agreed unanimously to reject 
the coalition agreement on the launching of policy talks, 
Sakigake officials said. 
  Sakigake has insisted that party leaders, and not the deputy 
chiefs, should work out a combination of political parties that 
would comprise the new coalition government and pick a candidate 
to succeed Hosokawa. 
  In a three-way morning meeting, SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Takemura 
agreed that a breakthrough should be sought through a meeting of 
party heads, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news 
conference. 
  The three parties earlier called for a forum of the seven 
coalition party leaders to select a candidate for new premier, 
but Shinseito [Japan New Party], Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan 
New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal. 
  Takemura said in TV interviews Wednesday night that he 
considered it important to establish a democratic system of 
decision-making within the coalition. 
  Takemura also urged the coalition partners to coordinate 
their basic policies, decide on the framework of a new coalition 
government and select a candidate for the premiership. 
  Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is 
head 
of Shinseito, was reported to have emerged as the most probable 
successor to Hosokawa. 
  Hata is in Marrakech, Morocco, for a ministerial meeting 
that 
will conclude with the signing of a treaty on the Uruguay Round 
of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Hosokawa, 56, suddenly announced his resignation last Friday 
after a string of financial scandals paralyzed Diet debate on 
the fiscal 1994 budget over Hosokawa's rejections of opposition 
demands to summon his financial aides to the Diet to have them 
testify on the case. 
  He will remain in office until a replacement is picked.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Foreign Minister and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] head Tsutomu Hata garnered the 
biggest support as Japan's next prime minister among more than 
130 House of Representatives members in a poll released Thursday 
[14 April]. 
  Nippon Broadcasting System Corp., a Tokyo radio station, 
said 
it conducted the survey on Wednesday and Thursday, covering all 
the 508 lower house members, to ask who is best as Japan's next 
leader. Of them, 132 lawmakers or 26 percent responded by fax. 
  The largest number, 61 respondents, picked Hata, followed by 
29 who supported Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 13 for Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium 
chairman of the opposition Japanese Communist Party, and 10 for 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP, they said. 
  Hata, head of Shinseito, a core component in the seven-party 
coalition, is already thought to be the most likely candidate to 
succeed Hosokawa. 
  Hata gained support from members of ruling parties including 
the Social Democratic Party, Shinseito, Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] and the Japan New Party, but Kono and Fuwa 
were backed only by members of their parties, the poll showed. 
  Those who backed Hata said he is appropriate for premiership 
because he has served in many ministerial posts, is eager for 
political reform and has a fine character, it said. 
  Supporters for Kono said he should be premier because he is 
head of the largest single party in the Diet and because he says 
Japan should keep its war-renouncing constitution. 
  Those who cited Watanabe said he has leadership skills and 
is 
knowledgeable about the economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe, an influential figure in the top opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on Thursday reaffirmed his 
strong interest in succeeding outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  "I'm watching whether (the ruling coalition parties) will be 
able to adjust their policies while sticking to the coalition 
framework," Watanabe told reporters. 
  He also said he wanted to appeal to the people to rescue the 
country from difficulties, and said party or faction ambitions 
should be put aside to this end. 
  On possible talks with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has 
vowed to run in the premiership race in the Diet as the party's 
candidate, Watanabe reacted reluctantly, saying "now is not the 
time to meet with him." 
  Watanabe's bid to become prime minister has brought the LDP 
to the verge of a major split, political sources said. 
  Watanabe's faction, which is beefing up its campaign to 
promote their leader as a successor to Hosokawa, meanwhile has 
rallied some 50 House of Representatives lawmakers of the LDP, 
including 36 of its 45 faction members, behind Watanabe, faction 
sources said. 
  The faction, the fourth largest among the LDP's five 
factions, is aiming to collect signatures from some 100 LDP 
members of the powerful lower house, supporting a call for 
faction members to back Watanabe, they said. 
  The leading opposition party holds 219 seats in the 
511-member lower chamber. 
  Shinseito and Komeito, two of the key parties in the ruling 
coalition, once deemed Watanabe as the leader of a possible new 
coalition grouping, because of his political savvy and 
influence, political sources said. 
  Although Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads Shinseito, 
has emerged as the most likely successor to Hosokawa, the seven 
ruling coalition parties remain divided over the process by 
which a new premier will be selected. 
  Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday over 
financial 
improprieties.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Thursday [14 April] 
that party members appear to support President Yohei Kono as 
candidate for the next premier, and suggested former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe give up his bid. 
  Speaking to a luncheon of business executives at a Tokyo 
hotel, Mori also said passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, which 
includes public works spending and a tax reduction to stimulate 
the economy, could be delayed until July. 
  The business community has expressed concern that squabbling 
over finding a replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
could further postpone the budget, and put a damper on an 
emerging economic recovery. 
  The opposition leader said the LDP does not want to see two 
of its members vie for the premiership, and party consensus is a 
prerequisite if the LDP is to back Watanabe instead of LDP 
President Yohei Kono. 
  Kono said Tuesday he plans to run in the Diet race, and 
there 
apparently is only minor opposition within the LDP to his 
candidacy, Mori said. 
  On Thursday, however, Watanabe collected some 50 signatures 
from LDP legislators in the House of Representatives supporting 
his bid. 
  Mori voiced strong displeasure that Watanabe may be in 
communication with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the 
buddhist-backed Komeito over forming a new conservative grouping. 
  He said the LDP could not cooperate with a Watanabe 
administration supported by such a coalition because of 
objections from religious groups that support the LDP. Mori 
suggested that Kono and Watanabe meet to agree on a single LDP 
candidate.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A key ruling coalition 
official proposed Thursday [14 April] holding a joint meeting of 
party chiefs and secretaries general to break a deadlock on the 
nomination of a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, told 
reporters 
he made the proposal at a meeting of coalition executives 
Thursday morning. 
  New party Sakigake, headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, boycotted the morning session. 
  Sakigake has insisted that party leaders, and not the party 
executives, should discuss the framework of a new coalition 
government and a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  Heads of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake agreed earlier in the day 
that a breakthrough should be sought through a meeting of party 
chiefs, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. 
  The three parties earlier called for a forum of the seven 
coalition party leaders to select a new premier but Shinseito, 
Komeito, and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) rejected the bid. 
  Kubo said he reported Sakigake's renewed call for a meeting 
of coalition heads to the other secretaries general at Thursday 
morning's gathering. He said the executives will resume talks 
on the selection of a new premier in the evening. 
  The secretaries general of the ruling parties had earlier 
agreed to avert a split in the eight-month-old coalition and 
form a new government under the present framework. 
  Following that agreement, Foreign Minister and concurrently 
Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata emerged as the most likely 
successor to Hosokawa. Hata heads Shinseito, a key party in the 
coalition. 
  Takemura, however, has expressed dissatisfaction with the 
proposed selection process. 
  He said in TV interviews Wednesday night that he considered 
it important to establish a democratic system of decision-making 
within the coalition. 
  Takemura also urged the coalition partners to synchronize 
their basic policies, decide on the framework of a new coalition 
government, and select a candidate for the premiership. 
  Differences have surfaced between Takemura and Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the 
behind-the- scenes strategist of the coalition. 
  Hata is in Marrakech, Morocco, for a ministerial meeting 
that 
will conclude with the signing of a treaty on the Uruguay round 
of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  He told reporters on his way there that the coalition is 
moving to maintain the coalition framework, and said the next 
prime minister will be selected in the Diet early next week. 
  Hosokawa, 56, suddenly announced his resignation last Friday 
after Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 budget broke down over 
allegations of financial impropriety by the premier. He will 
remain in office until a replacement is picked.

  [Text] Kanazawa, April 14 KYODO -- A business leader on 
Thursday [14 April] expressed fears that a delay in the 
selection of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
could smother the first signs of an economic recovery. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a news conference in this city 
on the Japan sea coast, "I'm concerned that a political vacuum, 
if prolonged, would further delay passage of (the fiscal 1994 
national) budget." 
  The current domestic political turmoil was caused by 
Hosokawa's abrupt announcement last Friday that he will step 
down. 
  The ruling coalition is seeking a successor to Hosokawa but 
has yet to reach agreement, although the latest indications are 
that Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
is widely viewed as the most likely successor. 
  Hayami noted that housing construction and sales of some 
consumer electrical machines, such as refrigerators and washing 
machines, are growing markedly. 
  The improved showing apparently stems from the favorable 
effects of a supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 which ended 
March 31, he said. 
  "Japanese business confidence is edging forward, reflecting 
an upturn in the U.S. and Asian economies," Hayami said. 
  The business leader expressed regret that Hosokawa is 
leaving 
his post before carrying through political reform and said he 
hopes that his successor will continue to push for such reform 
as a major task of the new administration.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- New party Sakigake 
[Harbinger Party] leader Masayoshi Takemura threatened Thursday 
[14 April] to break away from the eight-month-old ruling 
coalition. 
  Takemura, appearing on TV ASAHI's "News Station" program, 
said, "nowadays, some politicians say the coalition should expel 
Sakigake or the Social Democratic Party (SDP), so our party has 
come to be regarded as fragile." 
  "Our party does not have an unconditional desire to remain 
in 
the government," whatever humiliation it may suffer, said 
Takemura, who has exerted his influence as the chief cabinet 
secretary under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced 
last Friday he is resigning. 
  "Because we have that resolve (to splinter if necessary), we 
are now speaking our mind," said Takemura, leader of a small 
coalition component formed by 15 members of the 511-seat House 
of Representatives. 
  But Takemura hinted that if the coalition's majority group 
led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] stop trying to 
marginalize him, Sakigake is ready to continue to put its weight 
behind the coalition to keep it in power. 
  His comments came as the three-way caucus of Sakigake, the 
SDP and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) is confronting the 
Shinseito-led camp that includes Komeito [Clean Government 
Party] and Hosokawa's Japan New Party over who should be the 
next premier. 
  Takemura has reportedly been squabbling with Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the 
coalition's most influential politician, over who should take 
the role of the behind-the-scenes fixer in deciding the course 
of the coalition government. 
  "I believe neither our side nor their camp think we may 
allow 
the coalition to dissolve," Takemura said. 
  "I do not want to allow the current combination of coalition 
parties to crumble, either," he said. "I do not dislike Mr. 
Ozawa and I believe we can get along with each other." 
  "However, his repentance and readiness to restart is 
necessary," Takemura said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The leader of the 
coalition's largest party on Thursday [14 April] balked at a 
proposal by the party's No. 2 man to give the authority to 
discuss how to reconcile intraparty policy differences to the 
coalition's deputy chiefs. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of 
Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "I can 
never approve of that proposal" by SDP Secretary General Wataru 
Kubo to allow the secretaries general of the coalition to hold 
substantial discussion on narrowing an intraparty gulf over key 
policies, such as defense and diplomacy. 
  Kubo advanced the proposal as the chairman of get-togethers 
of the deputy chiefs of the coalition partners. 
  Murayama's remark came a day after key coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the core coalition party 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal party], called for bridging 
intracoalition gaps over four key policy fields, including 
Japan's stand on the suspected North Korean nuclear weapons 
program. 
  The other three fields are Japan's tax system reform, basic 
defense and foreign policies as well as administrative reform 
combined with deregulation. 
  Murayama dismissed the rumors rift with Kubo, saying the SDP 
secretary general merely "advanced the proposal as the chairman 
of meetings of the secretaries general as a tentative step." 
  "There are no differences between me and Mr. Kubo," Murayama 
said. 
  Ozawa and Kubo respectively put forward calls for 
reconciling 
the intra-alliance gaps after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
seven-party alliance went through various crises and turbulence 
due to policy differences over the past eight months.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Parliamentary vice 
ministers on Thursday [14 April] urged the rapid formation of a 
new government, under the current coalition framework, to tackle 
a host of pressing political tasks, a government spokesman said. 
  They unanimously adopted, at their regular meeting, a 
resolution calling for the early installation of a new 
administration, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama 
told a news conference. 
  The accord also calls for early Diet approval of the already 
overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which began April 1, Hatoyama 
said. 
  Parliamentary Vice Construction Minister Eisei Ito proposed 
that an agreement should be reached to end the political turmoil 
which has resulted from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
sudden decision to resign last Friday, he explained. 
  Hatoyama spoke of the need for the ruling parties to 
synchronize their basic policies, particularly on some issues of 
immediate concern, as a prerequisite for the formation of a new 
coalition government. 
  "Without such a policy consensus, the new government will 
face a crisis sooner or later," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The Tokyo District Court 
rejected Thursday [14 April] an appeal from former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura against a judge's decision Wednesday 
not to release him on bail, Nakamura's defense attorneys said. 
  The three-judge panel acted on an appeal from Nakamura who 
had asked for bail so he can take part in a Diet vote to pick a 
successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his 
resignation last Friday. But no date has been set for the Diet 
vote yet. 
  Nakamura, 45, an independent member of the House of 
Representatives, has been detained at the Tokyo detention house 
since mid-March after prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of 
taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading general contractor 
Kajima Corp. 
  Prosecutors indicted Nakamura on April 1 on charges of 
taking 
the bribe on January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice 
president of Kajima. 
  The Tokyo District Court did not state its reasons for the 
latest rejection. 
  Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday 
on the grounds he might destroy evidence. 
  Nakamura's latest appeal was a "junkoku" appeal which can be 
filed with a three-judge panel at a district court. It is a 
legal recourse available under the Code of Criminal Procedure 
when the defense claims it is dissatisfied with a decision by a 
single judge. 
  Nakamura is the sole Diet member implicated in connection 
with an influence-peddling scandal surrounding the country's 
leading construction contractors. 
  He quit the Liberal Democratic Party just before his arrest 
and is currently an independent member of the lower house. 
  If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in 
prison, according to the penal code.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Futoshi Shirai, 
administrative vice minister of posts and telecommunications, 
said Thursday [14 April] he will admonish the ministry's 
broadcasting bureau chief for inadvertent remarks on action that 
might be taken against telecasting companies which made 
erroneous forecasts of poll results in last July's general 
election. Shirai made the remark in a press conference, 
commenting on what was said by Akimasa Egawa in a press 
conference Monday. 
  The bureau chief told the press some broadcasting companies 
had reported that certain candidates were considered safe bets 
for election, but that several of them were found later to have 
been unsuccessful. 
  Egawa said some administrative action, such as admonition, 
verbal or in writing, will be given to such companies. 
  The vice minister said his ministry will decide whether or 
not to ask the companies to be more careful in making forecasts 
while giving due consideration to freedom in editing programs.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A cut in key lending rates 
by the German Bundesbank will stimulate Germany's economy and 
will be generally helpful for the world economy, a Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) source said Thursday [14 April]. 
  Japanese financial market sources expressed surprise at 
reports out of Frankfurt on the rate cut, but said the scale is 
small and unlikely to affect foreign exchanges. 
  In Frankfurt, the German central bank announced it will 
slash 
its discount rate to 5.00 percent from 5.25 percent per annum, 
and the Lombard rate to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent per 
annum, effective from Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's two top financial 
officials indicated in speeches Thursday that the domestic 
economy is poised to snap out of its three-year-old recession. 
  Addressing an annual convention of trust bankers, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno 
said a recovery is in sight on the heels of the latest stimulus 
measures. 
  "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom," Mieno 
said, 
indicating a firmer view than his latest press comments by 
dropping off the phrase "on the whole." 
  In a press conference last week, the central bank chief 
described the economy as "showing signs of hitting bottom on the 
whole" and said his assessment is "changing delicately." 
  Fujii said, "the time is steadily ripening for the economy 
to 
recover...although tough conditions are still continuing." The 
finance minister earlier said the economy is in "a delicate 
stage" and statistics to date "have not yet proved the economy 
has hit bottom." 
  Both Fujii and Mieno cited improvements, led by personal 
consumption, since early this year. 
  Mieno, stressing that conditions had improved since last 
year, also said, "various positive factors for an economic 
recovery have increased over the past year." 
  Japan's economy last year suffered unexpected downward drags 
such as the yen's sharp appreciation and unusually cool and wet 
summer, causing it to fall off after showing signs of recovery. 
  Mieno particularly cited progressing inventory adjustments 
and corporate restructuring, support from fiscal and monetary 
measures, and recent recovery in economies abroad. 
  Fujii said he is confident that the economy-oriented budget 
for fiscal 1994 and the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus 
package launched in February will "greatly contribute" to 
putting the economy on a full recovery track soon in the current 
fiscal year. 
  Meanwhile, Mieno noted some prevailing concerns, such as 
spreading labor cutbacks, a possible further rise of the yen, 
and ongoing write-offs of losses incurred by financial 
institutions and companies after the collapse of the economic 
bubble of the late 1980s. 
  Keeping in mind these possible downward pressures, Mieno 
said, "a further cautious watch is necessary" to see if the 
improvement in some areas is sustainable and can spread to 
overall business activities. He said he will carefully monitor 
monetary and economic developments. 
  Considering liquidation of bad loans, both Fujii and Mieno 
gave high marks to voluntary efforts by financial institutions, 
and called for further moves in line with market and other 
deregulatory steps taken recently by the financial authorities.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Nearly 70 percent of the 
nation's prefectural and major city governments have loosened 
controls on land prices and deregulated land transactions, the 
National Land Agency said Thursday [14 April]. 
  A total of 39 local governments -- 29 of Japan's 47 
prefectures and 10 of its 12 ordinance-designated cities -- 
eased such controls as of April 1, agency officials said. 
  Five or six local governments are expected to follow suit by 
the end of May, the officials said. 
  All prefectures, except Aomori in northeast Japan, and all 
12 
ordinance-designated cities established systems to monitor local 
land prices after they experienced skyrocketing prices in the 
booming economy in the 1980s. 
  They have obliged those who trade land of more than a 
certain 
acreage to report the transaction to the local authority. 
  Such relaxations followed an agency instruction last 
November 
that local governments deregulate land transactions to help 
stimulate the sluggish economy. 
  The local governments may have believed that drops in land 
prices indicated strict controls were no longer needed, they 
said. A government report released last month said Japan's land 
prices in 1993 dropped for the third consecutive year. 
  In most cases, only those who buy or sell 300 square meters 
or more are obliged to report the transactions to the local 
government, while the previous requirement applied to 100 square 
meters or more. 
  Gunma Prefecture northwest of Tokyo is the only prefecture 
that scrapped all prefectural areas under such control. 
  It is expected that more than 10 local governments will not 
ease controls, including Nagano Prefecture, where land prices 
may rise in line with the hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympics, 
they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's wholesale prices 
fell 0.2 percent in March from the previous month for the second 
straight monthly drop and 2.9 percent from a year before, the 
Bank of Japan reported Thursday [14 April]. 
  The overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 93.3 against the 
base of 100 for 1990. 
  In February, the WPI fell 0.5 percent on a monthly basis. 
  The wholesale price index also fell 3.2 percent in the 
business year ended March 31, 1994, for the third consecutive 
yearly decline. 
  Domestic wholesale prices in March inched down 0.2 percent 
from February and declined 2.0 percent from the year before. 
  Export prices gained 0.1 percent from February on a contract 
currency basis, falling 0.4 percent in terms of yen. 
  Import prices rose 0.6 percent from the month before on a 
contract currency basis but decreased 0.3 percent in terms of 
yen. 
  The U.S. dollar averaged 105.13 yen against the Japanese 
currency, down 1.1 yen from February and down 10.2 yen from the 
same month a year before. 
  A Bank of Japan official said lower iron and steel prices 
accounted for about a third of the monthly drop of the domestic 
WPI. Sluggish demand in the construction and auto industries and 
inventory liquidation at the fiscal year-end helped push down 
iron and steel prices, he said. 
  Lower prices for oil products amid softer crude oil value 
and 
a price drop in electric appliances also led to softening the 
domestic WPI, he said. 
  Nevertheless, the stability of domestic WPI remains 
unchanged, he said. 
  Export WPI gained on a contract currency basis on higher 
prices in machineries, but dropped in terms of yen, reflecting 
the appreciation of the yen against major currencies. 
  Import WPI gained ground on higher metal and textile prices 
on a contract currency basis despite lower crude oil values. 
  Rice prices gained 0.1 percent from February, the official 
said. 
  Domestic WPI for fiscal 1993 shed 1.8 percent, slipping for 
the second successive year. The Bank of Japan said it was due 
to lower prices of iron and steel, oil products and electric 
appliances. 
  Export WPI in terms of yen retreated 8.1 percent to mark the 
biggest drop since the 13.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a 
contract currency basis, the stronger yen and the resultant rise 
of automobile prices boosted the index by 2.9 percent. 
  In fiscal 1993, the dollar averaged at 107.85 yen, jumping 
13.6 percent from the year before. 
  Import WPI in terms of yen fell 12.4 percent, posting the 
largest decline since 37.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a 
contract currency basis, lower oil and natural gas prices 
contributed to bringing down the index by 1.0 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A consumption tax hike is 
needed to finance a possible increase in social security costs 
in the face of Japan's rapidly aging society, the chief of a key 
government advisory panel on tax affairs said. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said his panel 
will 
provide options such as a hike in the controversial consumption 
tax, an increase in social insurance premiums or no raise in 
social security costs to meet an aging society. 
  "But it will be understood naturally the best way is a raise 
in the consumption tax," Kato said in an interview with KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. 
  The issue of how to respond to the nation's aging population 
with tax measures has been in the spotlight for some time. 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed two months ago to sell 
a proposal to introduce a national welfare tax to fund more than 
welfare alone. 
  The Finance Ministry has been pushing for a hike in the 
consumption tax as a way to raise funds to meet the needs of an 
aging society. Kato is viewed as close to Finance Ministry 
bureaucrats. 
  Kato, a professor emeritus at Keio University, also points 
to 
the need to implement administrative and fiscal reforms and to 
rectify the heavy dependence on direct taxes for state revenue. 
  But Kato said no one can expect administrative and fiscal 
reforms to save government spending in the short run, and a 
sweeping reform of the so-called unfair taxation system could 
result in additional tax revenue of only 1 trillion yen. 
  As for a local consumption tax proposed by the Home Affairs 
Ministry, Kato said he would like to discuss it in the form of a 
possible retail tax instead. 
  He also said his panel will take up the issue of whether or 
when to introduce a taxpayers' numbering system. 
  "It's no good to say just 'we'll consider it.' I hope to 
draw a conclusion on the issue, including whether to introduce 
it, by setting a deadline," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's crude steel 
production fell below 100 million tons in fiscal 1993, ended 
March 31, for the second year in a row, the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation said Thursday [14 April]. 
  Japanese steelmakers turned out a total of 97.11 million 
tons 
of crude steel, a 1.9 percent fall from the previous year and 
the smallest volume since fiscal 1986, it said in a report 
reflecting the weak national economy. 
  In March alone, crude steel production fell for the sixth 
straight month of year-to-year declines, sliding 9.8 percent 
from a year earlier to 7.75 million tons, it said. 
  The March production volume represents an increase of 7.1 
percent from the month before, although March was the fifth 
consecutive month in which crude steel output fell below 8 
million tons. 
  Crude steel production is viewed as a key economic 
indicator, 
as steel products are used for a variety of industrial goods 
ranging from autos to machinery.

called a press conference in Seoul on April 12 and announced 
that the second pan-national rally against farm market opening 
will be held on April 16 jointly with opposition organizations 
including the headquarters of the pan-national movement for the

  The first pan-national rally was held on April 9. 
  Hanchongnyon declared that it will appoint ten delegates 
among the students now on a hunger strike in the Myongdong 
Cathedral and send them to Chongwadae [presidential offices] to

re-negotiation of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks 
and opposition to the signing of the final act of the Uruguay 
Round. 
  People of various strata of South Korea are waging a 
struggle 
with united force to smash the treacherous opening of the farm 
market by the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Unreasonable Act That </F>
Revealed the True Antidialogue and Antireunification Nature"] 
  [Text] As was already reported, a joint conference of the 
republic's government, political parties, and social 
organizations was held in Pyongyang on 11 April to reunify the 
fatherland through unity of the whole nation by highly upholding 
the banner of great national unity. The issue of promoting the 
country's independent and peaceful reunification by thoroughly 
fulfilling the 10-point program of great unity of the whole 
nation for the fatherland's reunification put forth by Comrade 
Kim Il-song, the great leader of our people, was discussed at 
the joint conference. 
  It was initiated at the joint conference that by putting the 
nation's interest in the forefront, all the people of the North, 
South, and overseas must most of all convene a historical 
national conference in either Pyongyang or Seoul to provide a 
measure for great national unity at around 15 August which is 
one year before the 50th anniversary of the fatherland's 
liberation, to open the doors for the country's independent and 
peaceful reunification by uniting as one. We decided to send a 
letter courteously putting forth such a proposal to the South 
Korean authorities, as well as to political parties, 
organizations, individual figures, and fellow countrymen 
overseas. 
  However, since the South side said that it could not receive 
such a letter, giving unreasonable excuses, it was necessary for 
us to broadcast the letter. Such a measure by the South Korean 
authorities is indeed an act of betrayal, throwing a wet blanket 
over the will and demand of all the Korean people's consistent 
desire for the country's reunification. 
  There is no greater responsibility and important matter of 
concern than realizing the country's reunification in the 
nineties for its 70 million people. Whether in the North, 
South, or overseas, our people today are saying that we can no 
longer live separated. They thus cry out for the country's 
reunification. 
  Amid this kind of trend of the times, conscientious 
politicians and figures from all walks of life in South Korea 
have recently begun openly expressing their will to visit 
Pyongyang for the nation's reconciliation and reunification. If 
the letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, 
organizations, individual figures, and overseas fellow 
countrymen is delivered to such parties and the joint conference 
of the republic's government, political parties, and social 
organizations, and the representatives meet at one place, it is 
clear that this itself will be a historical opportunity to 
provide a great turning point in the nation's reconciliation and 
unity. 
  However, the South Korean authorities object even to 
receiving our letter, which is filled with the patriotic will 
for reunification. Where can a greater antinational and 
antireunification act as this be found? 
  The South Korean authorities' unreasonable act leaves much 
room to prove that traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise that priority 
must be given to the nation and that he will whole-heartedly 
concentrate on the nation's reconciliation and reunification, is 
filled with falsehood and hypocrisy. 
  The new operation 5027, a plan to attack our republic, which 
has been kept a secret by the South Korean puppets, has now been 
made public, and they are showing moves to drag in much 
murderous equipment, such as Patriot missiles from the United 
States, and resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
This means that our nation must achieve great unity at this 
time more than at any other time to prevent the danger of a 
nuclear war. 
  In this kind of situation, our people must solve problems 
facing the nation under the banner of great national unity and 
from the principle of national independence. If this is to be 
achieved, the will and demands of the 70 million people must all 
focus on the great cause for the fatherland's reunification, and 
private-level dialogue must be activated so that it can spread 
to a pannational level. 
  Nevertheless, like the examples of preceding dictators, the 
South Korean Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is insisting on a single 
channel of dialogue as usual, is monopolizing reunification 
dialogue, and is preventing the broad masses from participating 
in the reunification dialogue from various aspects. Such 
antidialogue and antireunification maneuvers by the South Korean 
puppets will by no means be tolerated. 
  The South Korean puppets once again rejected our just 
proposal. This once again clearly shows that they are in reality 
the ones who have no interest in dialogue and reunification and 
that they are splittists pursuing only confrontation and war. 
Such an act betraying the nation by the South Korean 
authorities can no longer be tolerated. 
  If the South Korean authorities continue to move toward the 
road of antidialogue and antireunification while rejecting all 
the Korean people's desire and will consistently demanding the 
country's reunification, they will receive the people's severe 
judgment without fail.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
voice support for the convocation of a national conference to 
seek a way for the great unity of the whole nation on the 
occasion of the forthcoming August 15 liberation day, which was 
proposed by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political 
parties and public organisations of April 11. They praise it as 
a patriotic initiative to promote the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  In a commentary titled "Patriotic Initiative for Great 
National Unity" NODONG SINMUN declares it is an urgent matter to 
achieve great national unity through the implementation of the 
ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in 
view of the grave situation caused by outside forces and their 
zealous followers, the flunkeyist traitors. 
  The news analyst says: 
  If our nation fails to achieve harmony and unity under the 
acute and strained situation, it will unavoidably suffer the 
disaster of a nuclear war and fall a victim to outside forces. 
  When a historic national conference is convened as proposed 
by the North, the convocation itself will mean a big stride 
toward reconciliation and unity and it will be possible to 
attain national unity and find a way of achieving peace in the 
country and reunifying the country in the 1990s through 
unconventional and open- hearted exchange of views. 
  If the conference is to be convened, it is important to 
create a climate and conditions for it. The South Korean 
authorities must renounce the policy of depending on outside 
forces, take the position of national independence and stop all 
sorts of confrontation and war moves aimed at hurting and 
attacking fellow countrymen with the help of outside forces. 
They must scrap the "National Security Law" and other fascist 
laws and give up such things as "unified channel of dialogue" 
intended to monopolize dialogue. 
  What position one takes toward the national conference, 
which 
would be an epoch-making event in the history of national 
reunification, is a criterion distinguishing whether one wants 
national unity and reunification, or not. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON emphasizes that if the South 
Korean authorities want the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country, they must positively respond to 
the proposal for the convocation of a national conference.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sun, 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea and chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the 
Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, at the talks held here today between 
officials of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee and former 
heads of state and government and politicians of different 
countries, informed the guests of the situation of Korea and the 
DPRK's stand toward national reunification and the DPRK-U.S. 
relations and its foreign policy. 
  "Our singlehearted unity of the whole society is the most 
valuable wealth of ours and nothing can break it," he said. 
  Noting that a powerful independent national economy had been 
built in the DPRK, he said: 
  "Some people are now threatening to impose `economic 
blockade' on us. But it does not work with us." 
  "Powerful self-defence capacities have been built up with 
the 
chuche idea applied in the field of national defence," he said, 
and added: 
  "The nature of our-style socialism centred on the popular 
masses in which the chuche idea has been applied is peace. But, 
it is ready to cope with the situation when our sovereignty is 
violated or the supreme interests of the country encroached on. 
  "It is attributable entirely to the great ideology and the 
great leadership that everything is going well in our country. 
  "The leader devotes himself to the popular masses and the 
latter remains faithful to the former. So, it is natural that 
everything is going well. It is the steel-like faith of our 
people that they will surely win as they are guided by Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, supreme commander." 
  Kim Yong-sun continued: 
  "We constantly maintain that the question of national 
reunification should be solved independently and peacefully on 
the principle of great national unity. 
  "If the national reunification question is to be resolved, 
many issues must be solved. First of all, peace must be ensured 
on the Korean peninsula. To this end, disarmament must be 
achieved and problems solved between the DPRK and the United 
States." 
  Recalling that the United States had reversed the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. talks and the New York 
contacts and aggravated the situation in a bid to stifle the 
DPRK under the pretext of the "nuclear suspicion," he said: 
  "We want to solve the issue through negotiations with the 
United States with patience. If the United States persistently 
sought a solution with strength, however, we will be left with 
no other choice but to do our own way. 
  "It will be favourable to the United States itself that it 
look squarely at the world tending toward diversification and 
the changing situation and act with discretion. 
  "The basic idea of the foreign policy of our party and the 
DPRK Government is independence, peace and friendship. We will 
as ever consistently implement this policy." 
  The talks proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists on 10 and 11 April mobilized and deployed 20-odd 
military planes of various types in South Korea from overseas 
bases, thus committing a crime. 
  Formations of assault planes and pursuit-assault planes that 
took off from bases in Japan on 11 April flew into U.S. Air 
Force bases in South Korea. Prior to this, on 10 April, various 
types of military aircraft, including F-15, F-4, FA-18, AV-8 and 
EA-6, were mobilized and deployed to South Korea from U.S. bases 
in Japan and the Pacific area. 
  In addition, on 10 and 11 April, C-5 ultra-large strategic 
transport airplanes carrying a large number of troops and lethal 
equipment from bases on the U.S. mainland and the Pacific region 
and C-130 and C-141 transport airplanes landed in U.S. Air Force 
bases in South Korea and airlifted troops were mobilized and 
deployed to the operational zones and war equipment was supplied 
to these zones. 
  Our people and the People's Army are watching with vigilance 
the war preparation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets. If the rascals perpetrate an act of aggression, 
we will deal a resolute punishment to them.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in 
a signed article on the lapse of 8 years since the United States 
Bombed Libya says the United States cannot bring the Libyan 
people to their knees with any move. 
  The article goes on: 
  The brutal bombing raid on Libya by the United States in 
April 1986 brought to light the heinous nature of the United 
States which is committing undisguised terrorism under the 
pretext of "anti- terrorism". 
  The Libyan people are waging a brave struggle to consolidate 
the independence of the country and defend sovereignty against 
the aggression and intervention moves of the United States under 
the banner of anti-imperialist independence. Disliking this, 
the United States is taking issue with this country in a 
far-fetched way to find a pretext for new aggression and 
intervention. The U.S. vicious anti-Libya campaign is part of 
the systematic schemings to bring this country to its knees and 
turn the situation in this region in favour of the execution of 
its Africa policy. 
  Today the Libyan people are heightening vigilance against a 
possible new provocation of the United States. 
  The Korean people are extending firm solidarity for the 
Libyan people in their struggle to smash the threat and blockade 
moves of the imperialists and defend the national dignity and 
sovereignty. 
  The United States must stop its anti-Libya campaign.

achievements in carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy 
shaped by the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  Its performance vividly reflects the fruitful efforts of 
working people to successfully implement the agriculture-first, 
light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies advanced 
by the WPK. 
  The art troupe is calling on them to make this year a year 
of 
a historical turn in the revolution and construction by 
effecting a revolutionary upsurge in socialist economic 
construction in the spirit with which they crossed the river in 
flame and marched through the marsh during the rigorous war in 
the 1950s and in the spirit with which they brought about a 
great upswing of Chollima in the postwar period when everything 
had been destroyed. 
  Art propaganda troupes engaged in agitation for increased 
production were organized and are now active in all provincial 
seats. Travelling art propaganda troupes are seen in all 
counties, factories, enterprises and cooperative farms. 
  They are encouraging working people to increase production 
in 
various forms and ways on cooperative fields bustling with 
sowing, at consumer goods production bases, power stations, coal 
mines, railway stations, chemical, metal and building material 
production sites, housing and other construction sites in the 
capital and deep sea fishing grounds. 
  Stirring and appealing oral propaganda and introduction of 
achievements through on-spot broadcasting and by radio cars and 
loud voices of announcers congratulating innovators are making 
the whole country replete with revolutionary zeal and spirit. 
  Agitation troupes made up of artistes and men of the press 
of 
the capital and provinces have been dispatched to major sites to 
powerfully rouse working people in increased production and 
faster construction.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 14 (AFP) -- A spokesman for the 
radical Khmer Rouge in the Cambodian capital denied Thursday 
reports that the guerrillas had retaken their former 
headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia. 
  "Pailin has not yet fallen into our hands, but it has 
received heavy shelling from [words indistinct] artillery," the 
Khmer Rouge spokesman, who requested anonymity, told AFP. 
  "Our troops are continuously moving towards Pailin," the 
spokesman said from the radical faction's compound adjacent to 
the capital's royal palace. 
  A police general in Battambang told AFP by telephone 
Wednesday that the guerrillas were shelling Pailin, but added 
that they were only firing two or three rounds a day to try and 
"disturb our helicopters from landing." 
  The Khmer Rouge spokesman said the guerrillas rejected an 
appeal from co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen for 
a cease-fire so that both sides could enjoy the current Khmer 
New Year festivities. 
  "How can we accept a cease-fire when they [words indistinct] 
our necks and force our tongues out of our mouths and destroy 
all our belongings in Pailin?" he said. "This is not the time 
for celebrations." 
  Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh denied Khmer Rouge claims that 
guerrillas destroyed two government tanks in fighting around 
Pailin. 
  "The Khmer Rouge did not destroy two government tanks," the 
prince told reporters at a reception to welcome the new year 
late Wednesday. "We destroyed two Khmer Rouge tanks that they 
received from China a long time ago." 
  The tanks were destroyed near O'Lak, some 20 kilometers (12 
miles) north of Pailin. The prince questioned the motivation of 
those who claimed Pailin had fallen from the government's hands. 
  THE BANGKOK POST had quoted Thai army sources as saying that 
the Khmer Rouge recaptured their former "capital" late Tuesday. 
  A Western diplomat, pointing to the recent heated exchanges 
between Phnom Penh and Bangkok over Cambodia's allegations of 
Thai military support for the Khmer Rouge, speculated that Thai 
officers may have deliberately leaked the news to the press to 
try to embarrass the government here. 
  General Nhoek Bun Chhai, deputy chief of the general staff, 
said the Khmer Rouge, backed by four tanks attacked government 
border police at O'Lak on Monday. "They came from Thailand and 
they pushed our forces back one kilometer," he said. [Words 
indistinct] were not yet known as the police retreated into the 
jungle with a group of 17 fleeing into Thailand to seek refuge, 
he said. The prince said the guerrillas attacked because they 
thought O'Lak was an easy target. 
  "They knew that we thought that place was stable and they 
knew there was just police based there. So they fought us," he 
said. 
  Although the prince did not mention Thailand by name, he 
backed the general's accusation when he said Wednesday that the 
tanks attacked from somewhere "not inside Cambodian territory." 
  The prince acknowledged that the repeated accusations of 
Thai 
assistance to the Khmer Rouge were causing aggravation in 
Bangkok. "Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his 
patience was limited" the prince said, adding: "But [words 
indistinct] is also limited." 
  The prince, however, said he wanted to have good relations 
with Thailand and that fellow co-premier Hun Sen would soon 
visit Bangkok to resolve "border problems." "His Excellency Hun 
Sen, on behalf of the Royal Government will try again to let our 
Thai friends know their duty according to the peace agreement," 
the prince said, referring to the 1991 Paris peace agreement 
which brought a formal end to the Cambodian conflict and paved 
the way for UN-organised elections in May last year. 
  "The agreement mentioned [words indistinct] that Cambodia's 
three neighbouring countries must protect the sovereignty, 
integrity and security of the country," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Role of the G-15 in the International </F>
Situation"] 
  [Text] Delivering his keynote address at the opening of the 
Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries summit in New Delhi on 
28 March, President Suharto said that the developing countries 
of the South should pursue a rational and realistic strategy in 
seeking dialogue with the industrial countries of the North. He 
said that in seeking dialogue, developing countries should be 
conscious not only of the aspirations and concerns of the South 
but also of the interests of the North. The summit, which was 
officially opened by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, ended 
on 30 March. 
  According to President Suharto, the developing countries of 
the South should emphasize the spirit of promoting common 
interests and mutual benefit. This is the only way the G-15 can 
bring the international economy out of its present disarray and 
recast the inequitable international structures and practices 
that have resulted in deepening disparity and injustice in 
international economic relations. 
  The views presented to the G-15 summit by President Suharto 
could be called strategic, although that would put him in a 
difficult position. This is because the head of state was 
representing Asian member countries at the summit and was also 
speaking in his capacity as the chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement (NAM), which handles several other complex issues. 
  At the same time President Suharto was carrying out 
Indonesia's policy toward the G-15. Since the first G-15 summit 
in Kuala Lumpur in 1990, Indonesia has offered its expertise in 
three programs: Population development, agriculture and food 
production, and management to overcome foreign debt problems. 
Indonesia is ready to send its officials to provide expertise 
and advice to officials of any G-15 member country that requires 
such programs. 
  Now let us refer to the G-15's objectives, spelled out when 
it was formed in 1990 following the NAM summit in Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia. One of objectives was to provide developing 
countries with an opportunity to discuss effectively the basic 
problems facing the Third World and the relevancy of the NAM. 
The 10th NAM Summit in Jakarta managed to revitalize the group, 
thus clearing up doubts about its relevancy in the post-Cold War 
period following the reconciliation between the superpowers. 
  Another G-15 objective was to emphasize the effectiveness of 
the existing group of 77 developing countries, or Third World 
countries, known as the Group of 77 (G-77). The G-77 
represented the developing countries at various international 
fora. It was hoped that by reducing the G-77 to the G-15, the 
voices of the developing countries could be channeled more 
effectively, especially in promoting the long-stagnant 
North-South dialogue. It was also hoped that, among other 
things, the G-15 could play a more active role in the 
international arena. 
  The G-15 is believed to have the potential to become a 
consultative partner with the Group of Seven developed countries 
(G-7) for the steady development of a favorable international 
environment. The G-15 is expected to produce a working formula 
to improve South-South cooperation and conduct regular 
consultative meetings with the industrialized countries of the 
North, which are attempting to undermine multilateralism in the 
post-Cold War era. The G-15 should also establish closer 
cooperation among developing nations and focus its attention on 
the creation of a world founded on social justice, peace, 
industrialization, economic cooperation, and sustainable 
development. 
  Although the proposed dialogue between the G-15 and the G-7 
is expected to be informal, it will be advantageous to the Third 
World countries. 
  Apart from that, the G-15 should produce an effective 
formula 
on protectionism to protect the trade interests of developing 
countries following the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT 
negotiations. The G-15 must seek ways to settle the foreign debt 
burden faced by developing countries and the UN role in creating 
peace and sustainable development. It must discuss proposals 
for restructuring the membership of the United Nations Security 
Council in line with the changing international scenario. 
  As the NAM chairman, Indonesia is committed to ensuring that 
the G-15 continues to place great emphasis on cooperation among 
developing countries and on international peace, prosperity, and 
justice. In general, all nations have the confidence to solve 
global conflicts in a new democratic spirit of partnership 
through dialogue and negotiation. As a result, the G-15 forum 
on South-South cooperation and consultation should be 
intensified so that it becomes an effective instrument to 
participate in international dialogues and negotiations and 
achieve its objectives.

  [Text] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--Indonesia is prepared to extend 
temporarily its position as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement 
(NAM) if Latin America cannot decide which country is to be the 
NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Indonesia has been the NAM 
chairman since September 1992, and its three-year term will end 
in September 1995. 
  Thursday night, 10 February, at the Foreign Affairs 
Department at Pejambon, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas disclosed to 
reporters the results of the NAM Foreign Ministers Consultative 
Meeting, held at Pejambon on 9-10 February. The matter of the 
new NAM chairman is still completely uncertain, since 
Nicaragua--the only official candidate--has yet to decide its 
willingness to be the host of the 1995 NAM Summit Conference. 
  According to Alatas, Indonesia's willingness is a flexible 
position because it understands the difficulty that Latin 
America and the Caribbean are having in determining who will be 
the NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Nicaragua so far has not 
withdrawn its candidacy for hosting the NAM Summit Conference in 
September 1995. 
  Besides Nicaragua, according to reports circulating in 
Jakarta and New York, Chile and Colombia are also interested in 
being the new NAM chairman. The decision as to who will be the 
new NAM chairman may be known before the NAM minister-level 
meeting in Cairo (Egypt) this June. 
  Alatas reemphasized, however, that Indonesia feels the NAM 
chairmanship should rotate. "It is not good for one country to 
be chairman again. It would be much better for other countries 
to be given the opportunity. In that way, we can apply a 
three-year rotation," he said. 
  Alatas also stressed that Indonesia's willingness to extend 
temporarily its term of office would not be an extension of 
mandate. In fact, Indonesia does not expect that the selection 
of a new NAM chairman will be delayed until the meeting of NAM 
ministers in New York around September or October 1994. 
<H5>  Received by President </H5>
  According to Alatas, President Suharto hoped that the NAM 
Foreign Ministers Consultative Meeting would produce input, 
views, suggestions, and proposals for implementation by the 
minister-level conference in Cairo. Alatas said this after 
accompanying heads of delegations to a reception with President 
Suharto at Freedom Palace. 
  The president explained a number of resolutions and 
decisions 
from the 10th NAM Summit Conference, particularly those related 
to management of population and foreign debts. He also touched 
on NAM political issues. 
  Alatas said that although the meeting was informal, the 
president hoped it would produce suggestions for the Cairo 
meeting, especially about ways to increase NAM cooperation with 
the Group of 77 and improve South-South and North-South 
cooperation. 
  Specifically, the president hoped South-South cooperation 
can 
be conducted comprehensively in all areas of development in the 
respective countries. 
  According to Alatas, the president believes Third World 
countries actually can develop projects at low cost and for 
collective benefit if they mobilize all Third World resources, 
capabilities, and experience. "That is the next step we must 
take," he said. 
  The president feels that new NAM approaches to restimulate a 
North-South dialogue that is no longer based on a 
confrontational attitude--but on an attitude of cooperation, 
partnership, collective responsibility, and mutual 
dependence--appear to be accepted and increasingly evident, all 
of which are embodied in the word "partnership." 
  President Suharto explained to the delegations that steps to 
expand the North-South dialogue were begun at the G-7 [Group of 
Seven] summit conference in Tokyo in 1993. On that occasion, the 
president explained NAM positions and aspirations to the leaders 
of the seven industrialized countries belonging to the G-7 
(Canada, the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, and 
Japan). 
  The president emphasized that South-South cooperation 
includes helping the poorest countries and those that are 
trapped by debt problems. "In performing its duty as NAM 
chairman, however, Indonesia does not want to get any benefit or 
'butt in,'" Alatas said. Indonesia will be involved in efforts 
to find solutions. "We will fight for other countries, 
especially the 50 countries burdened with debt and the 18 
low-income countries in Africa and Asia," he asserted. 
<H5>  On Bosnia </H5>
  The president also took the occasion to touch on political 
matters like Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially with regard to the 
Bosnian request for support made to Indonesia and the NAM when 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic visited Jakarta. The plan 
for an international conference on Bosnia was also mentioned. 
  The president explained that the issue of holding an 
international conference is to be discussed immediately by the 
NAM Coordination Bureau in New York and that efforts are now 
being made to obtain acceptance and approval from the United 
Nations and the world community. 
  In reply to a question about sending volunteers to Bosnia, 
Alatas said that sending troops to Bosnia is not the way to a 
solution. He said he understands the frustration and irritation 
felt by people all over the world with regard to resolving the 
Bosnian war. "Do not let that irritation be manifested in calls 
to send troops to Bosnia, for that would not solve the problem 
but would expand the war instead," he said. 
  He said the steps that must be persisted in are approaches 
to 
the United Nations and the former Yugoslav states, urging them 
to take serious responsibility, implement UN decisions, and stop 
aggression. In addition, the slaughter should be stopped, by 
using UN military force if necessary. 
  "Thus, the way is not through an expanded war, in which each 
country would take part in warfare, but we must uphold 
international law and support the actions of the UN Security 
Council," he emphasized. 
  In reply to a question about a candidate for host of the 
11th 
Summit Conference and chairman of the NAM for the 1993-98 [as 
published] term, Alatas said the next candidate is Nicaragua. 
However, Nicaragua has yet to state its willingness and is still 
considering the matter while discussing it with other countries 
in Latin America. It is hoped that the issue will be resolved 
quickly. 
  Touching on the failure to hold a G-15 [Group of 15] summit 
conference in India last year, the minister said the postponed 
summit conference will be held in New Delhi, India, this March. 
"We hope that this time there will be no problem in obtaining a 
quorum," he said. There can be no representatives at the summit 
conference, and at least 9 or 10 chiefs of member states must be 
present.

  [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--MPR [People's 
Consultative Assembly] Deputy Speaker Prof. Dr. H.A. Amiruddin 
says that there is no need to worry about the issue of national 
leadership succession, because the mechanism for it already 
exists in laws. 
  "We do not follow a system like the one in Latin America, 
where the president may be replaced at any time. That can 
produce instability," Amiruddin said in reply to reporters' 
questions at his office on Monday, 21 March. 
  In response to a question as to the significance of 
President 
Suharto's recent repeated mention of succession, Amiruddin said 
he did not dare to judge. "Whether there is already a 
presidential candidate, or the emergence of a presidential 
candidate is expected, I do not know," he said. 
  "In fact, he says the subject of succession has many 
definitions. It can be a question of the person, the mechanism, 
on the understanding of the term itself," he added. "It is clear 
that a leader will emerge at the time he is needed," Amiruddin 
declared. 
  Amiruddin said the issue of succession should merely be left 
for each of the sociopolitical forces to think about when the 
time comes. This includes the subject of GBHN [Broad Outline of 
State Policy] materials as well as the question of the next 
candidates for president and vice president. 
  "All the sociopolitical forces have certainly considered and 
readied their candidates, who will then be submitted to their 
factions in the MPR," he added. 
  According to Amiruddin, if a single candidate emerges, the 
system should not be blamed. It should be asked, however, if 
they did not dare to nominate their "champions." "Making 
nominations is a requirement, and such political activity does 
not imply an effort to seize `power,'" he continued. 
  In reply to a question whether sociopolitical organizations 
must now prepare their "champions" for the next succession and 
publicize their names, Amiruddin said that preparing "champions" 
now is not a problem. 
  As for mentioning the names of "champions," he said he could 
not yet say. "Judging by experience and circumstances, there is 
a danger if names are mentioned too soon," he said without 
explaining what he meant by "danger." 
  Amiruddin admitted that the culture of Indonesian society 
does not yet support a situation in which the names of persons 
are mentioned. Developments in society still show variations in 
thought and opinion. There is the worry that misunderstanding 
could cause confusion. 
  "Does that mean there is not yet a democratic maturity in 
society?" a reporter asked. "It is not a question of whether 
democracy is mature or not, but a question of culture," 
Amiruddin replied.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 12 (KPL) -- Lao Labour and Social 
Welfare Minister Thongloun Sisoulit, on April 9, signed with the 
visiting Vietnamese minister for labour, war veterans and social 
welfare a memorandum of understanding on missing Vietnamese 
volunteers in Laos during the war time. 
  The memorandum refers to the minutes of the 16th meeting of 
the joint cooperation commissions of Laos and Vietnam. This 
document stipulates the return of the remains of Vietnamese 
volunteers who lost their lives in Laos during the war time, and 
the building of a 'militant solidarity' monument in Laos. 
  The two ministries agreed to closely coordinate in carrying 
out the excavation and removal of the Vietnamese volunteers' 
remains back to Vietnam this year from three cemeteries in the 
Provinces of Oudomsai, Xieng Khouang and Attopeu. On their 
bilateral cooperation on labour and social welfare matters, the 
two ministries will exchange technical documents and experience.

  [Text] Talking to NAEO NA about the disappearance of 
Russian Embassy Third Secretary Igor Makeyev, Pradap 
Phibunsongkhram, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
European Affairs Department, said that press reports on the 
issue had both positive and negative effects. Some reports had 
caused confusion. He believed however, that Mr. Igor is still 
alive. The police would have the news report if he had died. 
  Pradap said the report that Mr. Igor took with him a 
computer 
containing secret information was untrue. The diplomat's 
position is not important. He has the duty of issuing visas. 
His work has nothing to do with computers. Pradap also said 
that it was also impossible that Mr. Igor might have returned to 
Russia. As Russia is still a communist country, he can live 
comfortably here rather than in Russia. 
  "If the diplomat wants to seek a new life in a third 
country, 
the Russian Embassy would have already informed the Foreign 
Ministry. As a result, I still believe that Mr. Igor is still in 
Thailand. He may go somewhere to escape the heat. The police, 
however, have to investigate the reasons for his disappearance," 
Pradap said.

  [Text] Trang Governor David Wichaidit has discussed the 
spread of terrorism in his province and Phatthalung Province. 
He said the government's intelligence is more broad and 
detailed than the media's. For this reason, Trang Province has 
stepped up precautions and measures to deal with the possibility 
of terrorism. 
  Regarding a report that the prime minister's home might be 
the target of a bomb attack, Trang provincial officials will try 
to ensure security in all areas, although there is not enough 
manpower to cover every area around the clock. The province can 
only increase precautionary measures in likely target areas. 
The people can be confident that the province is doing its best 
to maintain security through constant coordination with the 
Fourth Army Region. 
  Asked if he reported this information to the prime minister, 
the Trang governor said the prime minister did not pay attention 
only to Trang Province, but to the entire country. The prime 
minister did not ask anything specific. The province did not 
make any specific report to the prime minister because it 
regards this as taking normal security precautions. Asked if 
the situation might worsen, the Trang governor said he could not 
comment on other provinces, but he is confident that his 
province will not be affected much by the reported possibility 
of terrorist activities. This is because his province has had 
relevant intelligence reports for some time and has been 
constantly vigilant. He said no special police unit has been 
sent to protect the prime minister's residence because such a 
measure could frighten passers by. He also does not believe 
such a measure would be the correct security method. He gave 
assurances, however, that there are both secret and overt 
security plans as well as ad hoc security center in his province 
that he would rather not reveal to the public. 
  Meanwhile, Police Colonel Phitsanu Bunyarat, deputy 
commander 
of the Railway Police, noted the security measures for trains 
operating on southern routes. He said the police department has 
made plans with the units concerned -- the military; the border 
patrol police; and the governors of Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and 
Narathiwat -- to prevent train sabotage. More railway policemen 
have been assigned to trains, particularly the Bangkok-Sungai 
Kolok train and the Sungei Kolok-Bangkok train, while they 
travel along the dangerous section between Hat Yai and Sungei 
Kolok. Four policemen have been added to these trains in 
addition to the previous four. They will be equipped with 
modern arms and communications equipment. This should be 
sufficient to protect passengers. Capable policemen have been 
chosen especially for this purpose. 
  Phitsanu said several units have been assigned 
responsibility 
for overseeing the safety of sections of railroad track. There 
is a problem with inefficient intelligence collection, however, 
caused by religious and language issues. Officials do not have 
enough experience with these issues.

  [Text] According to a correspondent's report from 
Aranyaprathet, Police Major General Tit Kim-on, the chief of 
police in Poipet, Cambodia, came to Ban Pakkat, Aranyaprathet 
District with some men at 0200 on 13 April to receive 16 
Cambodian soldiers from Colonel Ongkon Thongprasom, deputy chief 
of the Thai-Cambodian Coordination Office. These Cambodian 
soldiers fled into Thailand on 10 April to escape the Khmer 
Rouge encirclement and bombardment of Pailin. 
  Police Lieutenant Colonel Kay Kien, 40, one of the 
Cambodians 
who fled to Thailand, said he was given instructions from the 
government by Police Lt. Col. Teap Li. The instructions were to 
protect Pailin -- captured from the Khmer Rouge on 19 March -- 
by taking 150 men to defend Phum O Lak, about 3 km from the Thai 
border and 22 km northwest of Pailin. They came under heavy 
Khmer Rouge fire and received no government reinforcements. 
Thus, they had to flee into Thailand on 11 April [date as 
published]. They asked the Thai force in the area to send them 
back to Battambang. Teap Li disappeared; his fate is unknown. 
  According to the latest report, although there has been no 
confirmation of the Khmer Rouge recapturing Pailin, Cambodian 
Government soldiers say the Khmer Rouge now has the advantage 
because it is in a position to cut off supply routes and carry 
out guerrilla activities in many areas, particularly in Pailin 
itself. They expect more Cambodian Government soldiers to flee 
into Thailand. 
  Moreover, there have been occasional violent acts along the 
border. On the same morning, the inspector of the Khlong Nam 
Sai police station received a report that a Cambodian man and 
woman, about 50-60 years old, were killed and their bodies left 
near Ban Noi Si Chomphu, about 20 km from Aranyaprathet. Their 
bodies showed that they were killed by sharp instruments. They 
were reportedly killed by Cambodian or Thai robbers who took 
their four cows, which had been grazing in Thai territory. 
Efforts are being made to inform their relatives.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai-Cambodian Problem"] </F>
  [Text] It is certainly counterproductive for the Thai and 
Cambodian Governments and their senior officials to use various 
occasions to talk about problems between the two countries, 
especially if they speak to foreign or Thai correspondents. 
What results is continued misunderstanding. The fact that the 
Thai side suggested that the Cambodian Government use diplomatic 
channels to resolve misunderstandings between them, rather than 
airing their opinions through the mass media, is a good idea. 
  The Thai suggestion should not be directed only at the 
Cambodian Government, but the Thai Government itself should 
carry out this suggestion even if the Cambodians do not heed it 
and continue to accuse Thailand through foreign correspondents. 
An example of the Cambodian accusation concerns assistance of 
Thai soldiers to the Khmer Rouge during the fight for Pailin. 
The Thai Government should resort to diplomatic channels to 
deal with this issue instead of making rebuttals through the 
mass media. 
  It appears that so far, the foreign media is prejudiced 
against the Thai military on issues pertaining to Cambodia. The 
way to erase this prejudice is to be open and to permit 
inspection. For example, after using diplomatic channels the 
Thai side should inform the media of its actions. The Thai 
Government must act to remedy the wrong understanding of the 
country concerned. Once such action has been taken, the Thai 
Government should hold a major news conference to inform the 
world of its actions. 
  The Cambodian problem will occupy Thailand and create 
continual anxiety if Thailand ignores the problem. If the Thai 
Government does not correctly handle the problem, Thailand will 
continue to be on the receiving end of accusations arisen from 
either prejudice or distrust. Therefore, the solution is to be 
open, honest, and to allow inspection. The Thai Government must 
give real priority to resolving misunderstandings with the 
Cambodian Government and the media. It appears that we have not 
done so. This could be because it was felt that the problem was 
not that serious. It is an issue however, which will affect 
international trust in Thailand. 
  The history between Thailand and Cambodia appears to be 
repeating itself again. The current Cambodian Government 
distrusts Thailand and accuses it of abetting the Khmer Rouge. 
The Thai Government must make a concerted and prompt effort to 
address this distrust. It must not ignore the problem because 
peace in Cambodia will benefit Thailand, particularly the Thai 
people along the border.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 13 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
received here this afternoon a delegation of the Russian 
Federation's Sub-Commission of the Russia-Vietnam 
Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Commercial and 
Scientific, Technological Cooperation who is here for the third 
session of the commssion. 
  On this occasion, the Russian head delegate, Deputy Prime 
Minister Yuriy Yarov affirmed that the Russian Federation will 
try not to lose its position in various branches in Vietnam that 
in the past used to cooperate with, and at the same time to seek 
for new cooperation fields in order to have a fair competition 
with other foreign countries being present in Vietnam. The 
Government of the Russian Federation also encourages the 
expansion of cooperative relations between branches and 
localities of the two countries for the prosperity of each 
country and conforming to the traditional Russia-Vietnam 
relations. 
  Speaking to his guests, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed 
his profound thanks to the former Soviet Union previously and 
the Russian Federation at present for their great assistance to 
Vietnam in its national construction and defence, the best 
symbols of which, he said, are Hoa Binh hydro-electric power 
construction and Vietsovpetro. He also affirmed that the 
Vietnamese Government respects the consolidation and promotion 
of the friendly and cooperative relations with the Russian 
Federation. This is the inheritance of the traditional 
relations with a fine past between the two peoples and countries 
in many fields, scales and with great efficiency. Vietnam will 
continue that cooperation path, Mr. Kiet concluded.

  [Text] Indian Secretary of State in Charge of External 
Affairs Mr. Bhatia will visit Vietnam in the near future, 
according to an agreement between the two governments of Vietnam 
and India. Here is a review of the present relations between 
India and Vietnam. 
  The fifth session of the Vietnam-India Joint Commission on 
Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation was held in New 
Delhi a year ago. On this occasion the two sides discussed a 
number of issues concerning comprehensive bilateral cooperation 
which so far have been fruitful. In the next session, the two 
sides will review implementation on what have been adopted at 
the last session and plan to sign an agreement on avoidance of 
double taxation. 
  Traditional relationship between Vietnam and India has been 
consolidated and developed in recent years with an exchange of 
visit by leaders of the two countries. Together with the solid 
political relations, economic ties have been developed. Two-way 
trade between Vietnam and India increased from $10 million in 
1989 to $100 million. 
  Bilateral cooperation in personnel training has been very 
effective. In the last session, the two sides unanimously 
agreed to readjust the structure of their cooperation to be 
suitable with Vietnam's renovation and India's economic reform. 
  India has helped Vietnam modernize the textile industry, 
railway service, and personnel training, in water resources, 
nuclear energy, and agriculture. India has cooperated with 
Vietnam in oil exploration and exploitation. Besides bilateral 
government cooperation, the two sides also set up cooperation 
among companies and joint ventures. It is expected that the 
sixth session of the Vietnam-India Joint Commission will obtain 
more positive results in conformity with the aspiration of both 
countries.

  [Text] Radio correspondent Le Thanh reports that the Hanoi 
Capital Military Region Party Committee [HCMRPP] held a mid-term 
party conference. 
  The political report presented at the conference states that 
in the last three years, the HCMRPP has exerted many efforts to 
consolidate its force and improve its military form, thus 
creating an important foundation to work with other forces to 
maintain political stability in the capital. On that 
foundation, the awareness of function and duty in the entire 
party committee has been strengthened and deepened. Compared 
with the duty requirements, however, the Hanoi Capital Armed 
Force [HCAF] still has to improve its service quality. It must 
pay more attention to building an all-people national defense to 
match the market-oriented economy and broaden its external 
economic relation, which is still slow in its renovation 
undertaking. The political knowledge and ability of the HCAF 
are not on a par with its responsibility. 
  Attending and addressing the conference, Senior Lieutenant 
General Le Kha Phieu, member of the Political Bureau and 
director of the Political General Department, hailed the efforts 
and achievements of the HCMRPP over the past two years and more. 
The general also repeated the requirements imposed on the 
HCMRPP in the coming period. First of all, the entire party 
committee must strive to improve its capacity and knowledge to 
match all requirements for a capital military region. Together 
with the upgrading of political ability, every cadre and party 
member must have complete knowledge and capacity to accomplish 
all entrusted duties. The entire party committee must 
satisfactorily complete its duty to build a regular armed force 
and to build the military region up to the trust of the armed 
forces in the entire country.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 13 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference on the afternoon of 12 April, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake) 
commented on reports that his close relations with North Korea 
may impede the Japanese Government's policymaking on the DPRK's 
(North Korea) suspected development of nuclear arms. He denied 
such reports, saying: "It is true I am vice chairman of the 
Japan-North Korea Parliamentary Union, and I was also a member 
of (former Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Shin) 
Kanemaru's delegation which visited North Korea. However, this 
does not constitute any basis for saying I have suspicious 
relations with North Korea." Regarding reports that some U.S. 
Government officials are beginning to regard Takemura as the 
"North Korean connection" in the Japanese Government, Takemura 
said: "I have never heard of such a connection."

CSO 

<F P=106> [By Makoto Utsumi, Keio University professor and former </F>
deputy vice minister for financial affairs at the Ministry of 
Finance] 
  [Text] April is the "season for international finance." 
Several important conferences such as the provisional meeting of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are scheduled for the 
month. Among them, one that commands special attention is the 
seven-nation (G-7) meeting of financial ministers and central 
bank presidents. 
  Normally, the G-7 meetings are preceded by a G-2 meeting 
between Japan and the United States. Past practice called for 
the two nations to meet and to attend the G-7 meeting after 
arriving at a basic understanding. It has not been the case that 
a complete agreement would be reached on all issues and there 
were times when the meetings would result in unanticipated 
problem areas. However, a comparison of notes in advance enabled 
a more meaningful debate during the formal G-7 meetings. 
  But, this time around, the picture is different. A deadlock 
in the Japan-U.S. collective talks on trade has led to a 
complete suspension of a Japan-U.S. dialogue. Even the 
"Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" which once served as an 
important venue for exchanging information and discussing policy 
matter has ceased to function. 
  The coming G-7 conferences will be held under unusual 
circumstances. Moreover, issues to be laid on tabled will be of 
major proportions. Just as Japan will be asked to implement 
economic stimulus packages, the other nations face major issues. 
However, if an attempt were to be made in focusing on a single 
common issue, that topic would cover the question of whether a 
rise in long-term interest rates can be stopped. 
  Expansion in international balance of payments deficits, an 
expensive yen, and cheap dollar serve as a background for an 
incipient rise in U.S. interest rates. Germany still faces the 
need to liquidate the costs of unifying East and West Germany. 
  Japan cannot remain unconcerned as the environment continues 
to build for rising long-term interest rates in Europe and the 
United States. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that 
Japan is now a direct participant in the move towards higher 
interest rates. 
  Issuance of debt instruments in the form of government bonds 
to handle the expansion of public works projects, of debt 
instruments by regional autonomous government entities, and of 
government deficit bonds following the cut in income taxes have 
cast a dark cloud over the Japanese bond market. 
  A continuation of these trends is likely to expose the 
Japanese financial structure to the problems that struck the 
United States during President Reagan's administration. In those 
days, U.S. bond markets reacted sharply to the U.S. national 
deficit picture on a day-to-day basis. 
  The U.S. demand for Japan to employ such financial measures 
to stimulate domestic demand will cause higher Japanese interest 
rates and turmoil in bond markets. Essentially, the simplistic 
theory that financial measures should be deployed to expand 
domestic demand is no longer valid. 
  A rapid rise in long-term interest rates will ruin the world 
economy. Even as they concern the U.S. economy alone, rising 
interest rates run the risk of a "triple fall" in the form of a 
weaker dollar, lower bond prices, and a drop in stock prices. 
  Rising interest rates will also have a profound effect on 
developing nations and former communist bloc nations. There is 
the risk that high interest rates will preclude the availability 
of funds for those nations that need huge sums of capital to 
attain greater economic expansion or to move towards a market 
economy. 
  Even if sufficient funds exist on a worldwide basis, high 
interest rates will preclude those funds from being shifted to 
areas where they are needed. There is the risk that a very 
illogical situation will arise, even from the standpoint of a 
balance between savings and investment. 
  That failure to take action to counter current trends could 
result in the worldwide spread of problems is an awareness that 
should be gradually embraced by the G-7 member nations. 
  Certainly, the fact that U.S. authorities expressed 
themselves selectively on previous occasions about a persistent 
trend in a high yen-cheap dollar situation may have been a 
reflection of awareness that there was a need to give priority 
to international financial cooperative measures. Even in Europe, 
there is a strong feeling of crisis about rising long-term 
interest rates amidst an economic slowdown. The upcoming G-7 
conference should severely question just how much the various 
nations share in such awareness and just how much cooperation 
can be exercised in coping with such issues. 
  The G-7 forum is not one in which specific policy decisions 
are made. The G-7 serves as a forum in which representatives of 
the member nations engage in a frank discussion about 
international finance. 
  Policy decisions and their implementation are handled by the 
respective member nations, but discussions in the G-7 forum are 
supposed to be reflected in the financial policies of member 
nations. 
  Under rapid deregulation of international financial markets, 
bond and currency exchange markets move sharply as if to reflect 
the intentions of various international leaders. The question is 
just how much can the member nations cooperate in the cause to 
prevent a worldwide rise in interest rates? 
  One wonders if we are ready to face the consequences of 
violent market reactions, resulting from an abortive G-7 meeting 
in which everyone engages in a free-for-all exchange of 
unilateral positions and member nations are forced to resort to 
irresolute countermeasures.

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (YONHAP) -- They are 
here to sign the new multilateral trade accord, but it was first 
things first when South Korean and U.S. trade officials met 
Wednesday to work on bilateral trade issues. 
  Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and 
U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor immediately took 
up the issue of Korea's motor vehicle market. 
  Kantor presented the unbalanced picture of Koreans exporting 
over 600,000 cars a year while American exports totaled a mere 
1,300 units. 
  He called for tax cuts and elimination of Korean consumers' 
prejudice against foreign cars. 
  Kim responded that Korea's 10-percent tariff on car imports 
is the lowest after the United States and Japan, and that his 
government is trying to erase the stigma attached to foreign 
automobiles by announcing that foreign car owners need not fear 
tax investigations in February. 
  He said inter-ministerial discussions were under way on 
problems concerning car market opening and proposed bilateral 
negotiations as soon as Korea finalizes its plans. 
  Kantor demanded that the harmonized tariff rate of 13 
percent 
on dye and petroleum resin products offered in the UR [Uruguay 
Round] schedule be cut to 6.5 percent. 
  Kim said he would study the harmonization tariff offers 
again 
and offered to discuss the matter afterward. 
  Kantor showed an interest in the court battle between 
Korea's 
Tongyang Confectionery Corp. and America's Warner-Lambert Co. 
over the "clorets" chewing-gum brand name. 
  Kim advised that the two governments wait for the trial 
results as the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. 
  The row over trademark registration was determined in favor 
of the American company at the appellate trial board of the 
Korean industrial property office and now awaits a decision by 
the Supreme Court. 
  The two discussed Korea's intellectual property rights 
status 
with Washington, which is poised to newly designate watch 
countries later in the month. Korea wants to be removed from 
the priority watch list. 
  Kantor promised to acknowledge Seoul's efforts in 
intellectual property rights and other trade practices in the 
USTR National Trade Estimate (NTE).

  [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will refer to the 
UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) in screening North 
Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps to determine whether 
they are criminal offenders before settling them in South Korea, 
officials said Thursday. 
  The government will try to find homes in third countries for 
those seeking settlement outside South Korea but focus on 
blocking their repatriation to Pyongyang, also in cooperation 
with the UNHCR, the officials said. 
  An inter-ministerial meeting is planned for Friday, when the 
government is expected to confirm the principle of accepting 
North Korean loggers escaping from Siberian gulags that 
reportedly violate human rights. 
  The South Korean Embassy in Moscow said over 170 escapees 
have asked to be resettled in Seoul. 
  President Kim Yong-sam had earlier said his government would 
not accept the escapees, lest it anger North Korea and aggravate 
their already strained relations. But he changed his mind and 
Kim's spokesman announced Wednesday that he has ordered a 
thorough study on bringing the loggers to the South. 
  Friday's meeting will discuss various possibilities, 
focusing 
on how to screen the escapees to sort out those fleeing 
punishment for criminal offenses, according to the officials. 
  One option is to have Moscow perform the screening, but the 
best method is referral to the UNHCR, one official said. 
  "Moscow would have a tremendously difficult time in 
screening 
the escapees since most of them do not have any form of 
identification," he said. "For all we know, they may not even be 
from the logging camps but North Koreans who are in flight in 
China, or even spies." 
  "The best way is to have the UNHCR do the job. It would be 
the most objective, and be less tough than Moscow in screening 
procedures since it would place humanitarian concerns above 
political implications," he said. 
  If some did turn out to be criminal offenders, Seoul would 
arrange to have them serve time before they are considered for 
resettlement in South Korea, the official noted. 
  Seoul will start negotiations with the UN Commissioner soon, 
including resettlement in countries other than South Korea, he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
should hold informal talks for an early resumption of the 
stalled trade "framework" talks, a senior trade ministry 
official said Thursday. 
  The two countries are striving to break the impasse over the 
framework talks through official meetings such as planned talks 
between Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said Hideaki 
Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister. 
  "But it is also necessary for Tokyo to make efforts to 
improve the situation through informal talks," Kumano told a 
press conference. 
  "The Japanese Government is doing everything it can to pave 
the way for reopening the framework talks," Kumano said. 
  Earlier reports said the government seeks to reach a basic 
accord with the U.S. on resuming the framework talks before the 
Naples summit of the seven major industrialized countries in 
July. 
  Kumano confirmed that the ministerial meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Marrakech will take up 
wide-ranging global trade issues, including a linkage between 
trade and labor rights. 
  But he refrained from clarifying Japan's stance on labor 
issues in global trade. 
  The U.S. and France have proposed that the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), a body to replace GATT, should deal with 
forced labor, child labor, poor working conditions and other 
labor issues, a stance strongly opposed by some developing 
countries.

<F P=106> ["Arbitrariness and Partiality Cannot Work"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
resorting to arbitrariness and high-handedness under the pretext 
of "nuclear non-proliferation" and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] are 
playing into the hands of the United States. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says: 
  After agreeing to and making public four simultaneous 
actions 
with the DPRK, the United States totally reneged its promise, 
raising unreasonable preconditions, while some officials of the 
IAEA adopted a "resolution" urging the DPRK to allow it to 
complete the "unfinished" inspection and the UN Security Council 
discussed the issue of the DPRK on the basis of its "conclusion" 
and issued even a "presidential statement." 
  The high-handedness of the United States and the behavior of 
the UN Security Council and the IAEA grossly contradict the 
spirit of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and seriously 
damage the mission of the international organizations to which 
impartiality is indispensable. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when 
the 
United States massively deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea 
and began scheming a nuclear war against the DPRK. 
  The solution of the issue is possible only when the United 
States keeps the promise it made to the DPRK and withdraws from 
South Korea, taking along all the nuclear weapons. 
  The UN Security Council and the IAEA must apologize to the 
Korean people for their criminal acts and immediately revoke the 
unjustifiable "presidential statement" and "resolution." And 
they must not become a target of worldwide criticism and 
denunciation by playing into the hands of a big power but 
observe the principle of impartiality conforming to their 
intrinsic mission.

  [Text] Datuk Mohamed Noh Rajab, parliamentary secretary to 
the Ministry of Land and Cooperatives Development, opened the 
24th meeting of the Indonesia-Malaysia Joint Technical Committee 
on Demarcation and Survey in Langkawi today. 
  Following the meeting he told newsmen that the 
Indonesia-Malaysia common border problem is expected to be 
completely settled within a period of six years. He said that 
several areas along the common border, which are difficult for 
the surveyors to identify, will be completely demarcated by the 
year 2000. This is possible through close cooperation between 
the two countries. Last year, the duration for the demarcation 
and survey work along the common border was increased to seven 
months annually instead of three months as it was in the past. 
He said that efforts to settle the problem have to be 
intensified because even though the joint demarcation project 
was launched 19 years ago, only 27 percent of the East 
Kalimatan-Sabah boundary line and 35 percent of the West 
Kalimantan-Sarawak border have been surveyed and demarcated.

  [Text] Reports of illegal loggings have dropped 
dramatically following the adoption of the National Forestry 
Amendment Act 1993 by all Malaysian states. 
  The director general of the Forestry Department, Dr. Ismail 
Awang, said there is a 50-percent drop in the number of cases 
reported in Pahang, Kelantan, and Perak since the act was 
enforced in February. 
  The amended act provides for a maximum 500,000 ringgit, and 
the mandatory jail term from one to 20 years for those convicted 
of illegal logging. 
  Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Ismail said the 
department had also embarked on a five-year forest management 
plan as a guide for more practical forest management.

  [Text] Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang (DAP-Tanjong) 
[Democratic Action Party member of parliament from Tanjong] said 
the "colossal forex [foreign exchange] losses in the last two 
years had knocked out a big black hole in Bank Negara [Central 
Bank], not only making it insolvent but also destroying its 
credibility and authority as a banker and guardian of banks in 
Malaysia". 
  He said when Bank Negara's 1992 report was released last 
year, its Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein denied there was any 
hole in the bank. 
  "The report was prepared to admit that the [Malaysian 
ringgit] RM9.3 billion forex losses were mere 'paper losses' and 
that Bank Negara's loss was the nation's gain," he said when 
debating the motion of thanks on the Royal address. 
  Lim claimed that when Bank Negara's 1993 report was released 
two weeks ago, there was another exercise to cover up the fact 
the "hole in Bank Negara had become bigger, and it still denied 
that there was any hole at all". 
  Lim said there was a conspiracy of disinformation and 
misinformation to cover up the real nature, cause and magnitude 
of Bank Negara's forex losses in the past two years. 
  "It is not only the greatest financial scandal in Malaysia 
but also a world-class financial scandal." 
  Elaborating on his motion which was allowed this afternoon, 
Lim said the 1992 forex losses were not RM1O.1 billion but 
likely to be RM13.1 billion. 
  "In 1993, Bank Negara suffered RM5.7 billion in forex losses 
and RM711 million in net operating loss. Taking into account 
the RM6.1 billion loss that could be hidden by the revaluation 
of quoted investments, Bank Negara losses could range from RM6.4 
billion to RM12.5 billion." 
  Taking both years together, he said, Bank Negara could have 
suffered forex losses ranging from RM16.5 billion to RM25.6 
billion. Lim said Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim 
should not be misled by Bank Negara officials that it could 
afford up to RM25.6 billion losses in two years because its 
assets exceeded RM100 billion. 
  "It is such wrong advice that caused Anwar to come out 
openly 
to state last year that the RM10.1 billion in foreign exchange 
losses suffered by Bank Negara in 1992 were paper losses. 
  "The additional RM6.4 billion to RM12.5 billion losses 
suffered by Bank Negara in 1993 have proven Anwar to be wrong 
that the RM10.1 billion losses are not 'paper losses' but real 
losses." 
  Lim called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry to be set up to 
inquire whether the total Bank Negara forex losses since 1992 
could exceed RM30 billion. 
  He said there was an urgent need for the appointment of a 
Public Accounts Committee chairman, who should be an opposition 
Member of Parliament, to inquire into Bank Negara's forex losses.

  [Text] (1) Handling Bad Debts, Banks' Priority 
  The relationship between corporations and banks and 
securities companies is worsening. Reciprocal holding of stocks 
practiced by corporations and banks, which used to symbolize the 
close relationship between the two, has begun to fail due to the 
prolonged stagnation of the stock market, as well as low rate of 
corporate profit growth. Leading corporations are hurrying to 
separate themselves from banks. This is especially apparent in 
their overseas operations, where they are trying to find a way 
to raise funds by themselves. Will the intensified competition 
caused by banks branching out into the securities business bring 
profit to corporations? We will examine the relationship between 
corporations and banks and securities firms, which is definitely 
changing at this unstable time after the collapse of the "bubble 
economy." (Corporate Finance Reporting Team) 
  Testimony 1. "One lower rank city bank told us that they 
wanted to sell the reciprocally held stocks. We agreed and both 
of us sold a part of our holdings in the market." (Itochu Corp.) 
  Testimony 2. "Sometimes banks sound us out on selling our 
stocks. It seems some banks are selling their reciprocally held 
stocks without even asking corporations." (Hitachi Ltd.) 
  Testimony 3. "We have sold out a part of our reciprocally 
held stocks which two of the city banks had held." (Sankyo Corp.) 
  Banks are rushing to sell reciprocally held stocks of 
corporations. 
  "Now, it has become easier to sell stocks." One financial 
director of a major steel company expressed his relief this way. 
  It was evident that the March 1994 period would show a heavy 
deficit. They were preparing to sell stocks in order to balance 
accounts. They were wondering how to approach the bank whose 
stocks they were planning to sell. Just then, The Long-Term 
Credit Bank of Japan, The Nippon Credit Bank, and some trust 
banks came to them to ask about selling their reciprocally held 
stocks of the steel company. How timely! "Since banks are 
selling our stocks, we can sell theirs, too." They found a 
perfect excuse. 
  Corporations, too, have reasons to want to sell banks' 
stocks 
which they reciprocally hold. Leading corporations in steel and 
automobile industries are plagued with poor business results, 
and rushing to sell their assets. The main sale items are 
stocks, mainly bank stocks which do not produce cash flow, 
except for a little dividend. 
  According to Daiwa Research Institute's estimate, the latent 
profit of security holdings of the corporations listed on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange was 40 trillion yen. Of this, 23 trillion 
yen, which is about 60 percent of the total latent profit, was 
from bank stocks. Bank stocks are great items to sell to produce 
profits. Considering efficiency of assets, it is better to sell 
them off, rather than buy them back. 
  Nihon Paper Manufacturing Co., the largest in the paper and 
pulp industry, was established by the merger between Jujo Paper 
Mfg. Co. and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp Co. last spring. They began to 
negotiate with 20 percent of their creditor financial 
institutions with the intention to cut them off within a year. 
Naturally, they will discuss cancellation of the reciprocally 
held stocks. 
  Before the merger, Jujo had 44 creditor companies, including 
life insurance companies. Sanyo Kokusaku had 28. After the 
merger, they still had over 50 creditor companies. "When you 
have so many creditors, the business process gets complicated. 
Also, fund-raising becomes less flexible" (a director of Nihon 
Paper Mfg. Co.). This is the reason for being selective in 
deciding which financial institutions to keep. Restructuring of 
corporations (business restructuring), including mergers, is 
promoting cancellation of banks' stocks they hold reciprocally. 
  Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals has also begun to limit the number 
of 
financial institutions it transacts with. The company has 
selected about 10 city banks and regional banks to which it had 
relatively small debt out of 41 banks it dealt with. Within two 
to three years, it is planning to cut ties to the rest of the 
banks as it finishes paying off its debts. "We have had a 
long-term relationship with these banks, and we reciprocally 
hold stocks with them, also" (Tetsu Nakayama, managing 
director). However, concerning the banks it is cutting off, it 
is planning to sell their reciprocally held stocks. It is 
prepared for the time when the banks will sell its company's 
stocks. 
  The warrant bonds (a debenture with preemptive rights) are 
also affected by the stagnant stock prices, and the rights are 
not being exercised. It is ironic that we do not have to worry 
about stabilization of stock prices anymore. 
  Reciprocal holding of stocks by corporations and banks is 
closely related to loan situations. We have results of research 
done by Nissei Kiso Research Institute on major city banks and 
The Industrial Bank of Japan. 
  This study shows the relation between the lending ratio of 
major city banks and the Industrial Bank against total corporate 
borrowing, and the banks' stock holdings. When a bank holds 
stocks of a loan customer, the lending ratio is 13-17 percent. 
When they do not hold stocks, the ratio is only 3-4 percent. 
  While some companies are cutting down the number of 
correspondent banks, some companies are trying to reinforce 
their relationship with certain banks. Fuji Bank, which is the 
main bank for Unidax, an electronics parts sales company, bought 
about 100,000 more shares of Unidax stocks last fall. Fuji 
Banks' shares of Unidax stocks doubled. Unidax is also planning 
to increase its shareholdings of Fuji Bank. 
  Unidax has already had some directors transferred from Fuji 
Bank. Its loan from Fuji Bank has increased, also. It is trying 
to strengthen the relationship with the bank. Life Corporation, 
a bulk dealer of foods, is reinforcing its ties to Mitsubishi 
Corp., and at the same time it is starting business transactions 
with Mitsubishi Bank. 
  Many of the leading corporations are diversifying 
fund-raising methods, and lowering its dependence on bank loans. 
The necessity for corporations to reciprocally hold banks' 
stocks is decreasing, from the fund-raising point of view, also. 
However, corporations cannot cut off ties with all banks. 
Corporations are beginning to select banks.

  [Text] (1) Reciprocal Holding of Stocks Is Relaxing, 
and Cost Awareness Is Up 
  Reciprocal holding of stocks between corporations and 
financial institutions progressed in the late 1980's, when stock 
prices were high. Both corporations and financial institutions 
rapidly increased equity financing (fund-raising with issuance 
of new stocks) in order to raise funds with low interest. For 
smooth promotion of equity financing, it was considered 
effective to keep stock prices the same by holding stocks 
reciprocally. 
  The basis of reciprocal holding of stocks was established 
"during the post war period up to 1960" (Nissei Kiso Research 
Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during this period was 
supposed to "stabilize the management of corporations" (Nissei 
Kiso Research Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during 
period of high stock prices is different in nature, since its 
goal is to raise funds. 
  Another way to raise funds for corporations, which is more 
effective than equity financing, is to use internal reserves 
[hold internal profits by not selling stocks]. When the number 
of issued stocks increases through equity financing, the burden 
of dividend payments also becomes heavy. With internal reserves, 
there is no such problem. Even though the dividend is kept low 
in order to increase the internal reserve, there will not be 
much criticism if reciprocal holding of stocks is widely 
practiced. Reciprocal holding was thus useful in this sense, 
also. 
  There is some cost involved in internal reserves. When stock 
prices were increasing and the investment profit rate was kept 
high, the cost was not much of a burden. Not to mention that 
internal reserves were believed to generate latent profit. 
  When stock prices stopped increasing, the cost of internal 
reserves began to be reviewed again. Shosuke Ide, director of 
research at Nomura Management School, pointed out, "if you 
perceive stocks as profit bonds rather than control bonds, the 
reciprocal holding system will have to fail." 
  Nomura Research Institute conducted a study on the 
corporations listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. According to this study, the reciprocal holding rate 
of financial (institutions') stocks was 41.0 percent as of the 
end of March 1993. This was lower than a year before by 0.8 
percent, the largest drop among all the industries. The trend to 
cancel reciprocal holdings by corporations and financial 
institutions was already evident then. 
  "In the United States, maintenance of assets which do not 
generate cash flow has been avoided as much as possible, because 
it was considered to be a factor for lowering profitability. In 
Japan, cash flow has not been regarded as important" (Daiwa 
Research Institute). Corporations and banks have been accepting 
the situation where they held "assets that did not generate cash 
flow" (stocks jointly held). This type of relationship is 
becoming very difficult to keep any more (Toru Hasegawa of the 
Tokyo Securities Division.). 
<H5>  [22 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] (2) Unreliable Main Banks 
  Koyo Machine Industries, a manufacturer of construction 
machinery and listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange, requested 
the Osaka district court to apply the Stock Company 
Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act to them. "Banks were very 
nice to us in this matter. We owe them a lot." Akinori Fujitani, 
president of Koyo, stressed that they had a strong relationship 
with banks. However, contrary to what Koyo expected, the banks 
had already begun to consider stopping their support to the 
company in the beginning of fall. 
  It was about a year ago when Koyo's fund situation worsened. 
It was having difficulty recovering the large investment it made 
for golf course development. To add to this, the number of 
orders decreased due to the recession. Its main bank, The 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, supplied a loan of several 
billion yen for operational funds and gave Koyo advice on 
restructuring. 
  Last fall, when Koyo Machine Industries asked The Long-Term 
Credit Bank to send them some personnel, its request was denied. 
At that time, Koyo believed that "the bank must have considered 
this matter positively. Probably they will send us some 
personnel in spring" (manager at Koyo). Koyo was still hopeful. 
The Long-Term Credit Bank felt that "Koyo does not seem to have 
made any particular effort on its part, and there is not much 
hope for reconstruction." It avoided supporting Koyo by sending 
its personnel there. 
  The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan stopped any additional 
loan to Koyo in late December, and at the same time it sent a 
representative to Koyo in Osaka to inform it of the following. 
"If you are going to legally seek reorganization, we will 
support you as much as we can." A few days later, Koyo Machine 
Industries applied for application of the Stock Company 
Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act. According to its 
certified public accountant, its total debt was as much as 72 
billion yen. 
  One of the management people at The Long-Term Credit Bank 
confessed, saying, "I am just speaking generally. Times have 
changed. The economy does not expand anymore like it used to if 
banks worked diligently and got a shot in the arm once in a 
while. We must consider more seriously than before how much 
support to give so that our loss will not become too much." 
  It has been an important role of main banks to support and 
lead reorganization of companies that are going down. This 
function as the "lender of last resort for companies" is 
disappearing. Where do banks draw the line? They have begun to 
seriously consider the following three points. 
  First, the owner of the corporation may keep management 
information to themselves and may not provide it to the bank. 
Therefore, it has become more important to have a good 
understanding of the management situation because the breakdown 
of the "land myth" caused real estate-secured loans to become 
less practical. 
  Second, the type of industry has poor growth possibility. 
Therefore, in a mature economy, the business is not expected to 
revive by just existing. 
  Third, supporting one company indefinitely may cause banks 
to 
be criticized by society. Therefore, while efficiency of banks' 
assets is being questioned, supporting a business, which may 
take a long time to rebuild, may cause stockholders and 
depositors to distrust banks. 
  In Koyo Machine Industries' case, the problem has been 
caused 
by a combination of its excess investment during the bubble 
economy and its poor business results. The second point is true 
in this case. 
  "This would not have happened, if we had kept our ties with 
banks stronger," a sales manager of Kikko, an Osaka wholesaler 
of confectionery, is more critical of its former management than 
the banks which forsook it. 
  When it was having a difficult time raising funds, there was 
no evidence that its banks, such as Fuji Bank, aggressively 
supported them. This manager was told by the bank's branch 
manager, who was soon to be transferred, "our business is to 
loan money. If we could, we would. However, because we will not 
know where the loaned money will go, we cannot do anything about 
it." 
  After this incident this manager was informed that 
management 
"lacked sincerity in dealing with its banks." The first point 
applies here. 
  However unreasonable it may be, what if the banks continued 
to support the company? A manager at The Long-Term Credit Bank 
points out that "a lawsuit by the stockholders awaits the bank." 
This is the third point. The lawsuit filed against Mitsui Trust 
and Banking Co. by Azabu Building Co., which drew attention as a 
question of "lender's responsibility," caused banks to be 
hesitant about getting deeply involved with corporations. 
  Of course, there still are cases where a bank saves a 
corporation in crisis, and the relationship between the two is 
strengthened. Last December, when Isetan's stocks were bought up 
by a real estate company, Shuwa Corp., the Mitsubishi group 
bought back 58.8 million shares that Shuwa held. Thus Isetan's 
crisis was resolved. At the press conference, Isetan's 
president, Kazumasa Koshiba praised Mitsubishi Bank, saying that 
"it (Mitsubishi Bank) fulfilled perfectly its role as our main 
bank." 
  However, Mitsubishi did not support Isetan unconditionally. 
Isetan's former president, Kuniyasu Kosuga, was rumored to have 
had disagreements with Mitsubishi Bank. His resignation last May 
preceded the bank's decision to help Isetan. Mr. Kosuga is said 
to have tried to change the traditional way of dealing with 
banks by distancing itself from Mitsubishi and approaching Sanwa 
Bank. 
  From now on, banks will make clearer distinction between the 
corporations they will support and those they will not. 
Corporations must forsake the concept that "they have the main 
bank as their lender of last resort." They must learn to deal 
with banks without getting attached to them. "The time will come 
when corporations will choose banks and banks will choose 
corporations" (Financial Research Room manager at Sakura 
Research Institute). 
<H5>  [23 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] (3) The Third "Good-By, Banks!" 
  A manager at a long-term credit bank listens carefully every 
day to the news about issuance of bonds with a little concern. 
His main concern is Mitsubishi Corporation's plan to issue 
five-year straight bonds (SB). 
  As a result of reviewing the regulations and customary 
practice, they virtually removed the restriction on issuance of 
five-year SB's, which they had asked companies to limit because 
"their five-year SB's would compete with the five-year 
interest-bearing bonds issued by long-term credit banks." Nippon 
Steel Corp., Orix, Tokyu Land Corp., and Nissan Motor have 
already issued the five-year SB's. 
  Issuance of the five-year SB's means that the cost incurred, 
when a corporation raises five-year, long-term funds directly 
from the market, will be exposed to the public eye. Mitsubishi 
Corp. is considering issuance of more than 100 billion yen worth 
of the bonds, which is considerably above its normal amount of 
20 billion yen. If the bonds continue to be issued this way, it 
will make interest-bearing bonds less attractive" (a manager at 
a long-term credit bank). 
  In addition, if Mitsubishi Corp., which is ranked higher 
than 
long-term credit banks, continued to issue this type, it will be 
able to issue bonds at the same or lower cost. The difference in 
creditworthiness of corporations and financial institutions as 
shown by this ranking really means something. 
  If this scenario becomes true, the very purpose of long-term 
credit banks, which boasted that they were leading industrial 
finance, may be questioned. Issuance of bonds, which costs less 
than the long-term prime rate (the best loan interest), is 
already becoming a reality. Following this, some corporations 
may demand loans with interest rates lower than the long-term 
prime rate. Some say that "the long-term prime rate is based on 
the yield of interest-bearing bonds, plus 0.9 percent. This 
system may be shaky" (manager at The Industrial Bank of Japan, 
Securities Dept.). 
  "Good-bye, banks! Part Three...," one accounting manager of 
a 
major corporation explained, using words sounding like a movie 
title. 
  Part One was in the 1950's and 1960's, when there was an 
investment trust boom, mainly among individual investors. Part 
Two was in the 1970's and 1980's, when there was a shift in the 
financial trend toward direct financing by equity financing 
(funding with new issuance of stocks). Both parts ended with a 
sudden drop in stock price. Now, for the third time, a trend of 
"breaking away from banks" is beginning to take place. 
  Yuraku Real Estate Co. is increasing use of funds raised by 
the deposit in Taisei Corp., its parent company. The amount of 
deposit was 13 billion yen at the end of March 1992. It has 
grown to 20 billion yen now. According to Taisei, "for Yuraku 
Real Estate Co., our interest is better than banks, and for us, 
their deposit is always better than getting a loan from banks." 
  According to Bank of Japan statistics, the spread of banks' 
deposit and lending interest (average lending interest rate 
minus free interest term deposit interest) grew from 0.5 percent 
at the end of 1989 to over 2 percent in 1993 (month end average 
from January to November). Banks had to rush to secure a certain 
interest spread. Corporations competed with them. 
  More and more companies are opting to have new money 
products, such as MMF (money market funds), and bonds, rather 
than depositing in banks. At Nippon Kayaku Co., the balance of 
short-term securities as of November 1993 was 16.3 billion yen, 
which was a big jump from the previous year's 0.1 billion yen. 
This is a result of moving bank deposits to MMF. 
  Major corporations, such as Nissan Motor and All Nippon 
Airways, have begun to accelerate their operational funds' shift 
to bonds since the end of 1992. More and more corporations are 
preferring better yield on their operational funds than 
long-term relationship with banks. 
  The boom in warrant bonds (debentures with preemptive 
rights) 
has ended, and the ratio of loan is increasing as a funding 
method. This may seem like the trend of "breaking away from 
banks" is being stopped. However, the power relationship between 
leading corporations and banks is definitely changing. 
  "The main bank is Japan Development Bank." As of the end of 
September 1993, the long-term and short-term loan balance of 
Tokyo Gas Co. was 80 billion yen, of which 54 billion yen was 
loaned from Japan Development Bank. This was its largest loan. 
For the current term, Tokyo Gas Co. raised 70 billion yen 
externally, 54 billion yen from corporate bonds, and 16 billion 
yen from a loan from Japan Development Bank. 
  Why Japan Development Bank? Japan Development Bank' loan 
interest rates are sometimes higher than the long-term prime 
rate. However, the bank allows long-term fixed-rate loans, such 
as 15-year loans, while most other banks want to use variable 
interest rates. In the long run this may be more profitable. 
  Tokyo Electric Power Co. borrowed from regional financial 
institutions which are affiliated with the Norinchukin Bank 
[Central Bank for Agriculture and Forestry]. This was because of 
the installation of "competition system" which allowed them to 
select a financial institution to borrow money from. 
  In the "competition system", Tokyo Electric Power Co. would 
have each financial institution propose its conditions 
concerning the amount, term, and interest rate, and the company 
would take the loan which would be most beneficial. An 
individual financial institution's loan terms used to be a fixed 
condition which was decided by share distribution. From now on 
"it will be possible that loan terms will vary depending on the 
individual financial institutions" (top-level executive at Tokyo 
Electric Power Co.). 
  The corporate trend to break away from banks, which had 
apparently stopped, has been continuing. Shigeru Watanabe, chief 
of the Corporate Finance Research Room at Nomura Research 
Institute, affirms, "concerning major corporations, banks have 
no controlling power." The relationship between corporations and 
banks is becoming more and more distant, though it has not gone 
as far as it has in the United States, where corporations base 
their decision on cost. 
  The third "Good-bye, Banks!" is different from the first two 
in the sense that "banks that used to have enough power are now 
exhausted" (executive at Industrial Bank of Japan). As long as 
banks function as the place to operate the funds or the fund 
provider is weakening, large and powerful corporations have no 
choice but to be selective in choosing their correspondent 
banks. With the trend of financial deregulation, power 
relationship between banks and corporations is even more 
accelerated.

  [Text] (4) Hesitant in Providing Risk Money 
  There was a demand for 8.7302 million shares against 550,000 
shares that were offered for public subscription. A tender for 
Koekisha's public offering was held on the 21st. Koekisha is the 
first funeral company in Japan to be listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. The demand was 15.9 times more than the number of 
shares they offered. 
  It was September 1992 when Koekisha applied to be listed on 
the Stock Exchange. However, it was put on a waiting list for a 
year and a half for the reason that "excess supply of new stocks 
may cause stock prices to fall." The people at Koekisha, who had 
to wait, are feeling uneasy after seeing the popularity of their 
stocks. 
  They do have complaints and distrust about this wait. They 
seem to think that "placing the stock on the market will 
activate the stock market." However, public subscription was 
like a "hostage" and "until the company gets listed on the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange, we could not do anything to upset the 
authorities" (executive of C.I. Kosei Co., which was listed on 
the Stock Exchange at the end of last year). 
  In Koekisha's case, "fortunately the delay in offering for 
public subscription did not alter its plan of funding or 
management" (Koji Konishi, Koekisha's Management Planning Room 
chief). However, it is possible that this kind of delay may 
cause an unrecoverable loss for a corporation. 
  Yu Inaba, deputy director of the Sales Planning Department 
at 
Nikko Securities Co., points out, "Sometimes the ranking in an 
industry can be affected by even a slight difference in timing. 
A company may grow very rapidly as soon as it starts public sale 
of shares, while another company may be right behind it on the 
waiting list, but could not start its public sale of shares 
until a little later." As a matter of fact, one company in 30 
has had to give up being listed on the Stock Exchange while it 
was still on the waiting list. 
  At present, new public offerings of stocks are limited to a 
total of three companies a week in the stock exchange and 
over-the-counter markets combined. More than 120 companies have 
applied to go public based on their 1992 business results and 
are still on the waiting list. Including those that applied in 
1993, about 200 companies are crowding the waiting circle. 
  "For securities companies, whose profit comes mainly from 
sales and purchases fees, securing the sales amount by 
maintaining the market is vitally important" (president of 
Chuken Securities Co.). This way of thinking is dominant. The 
Ministry of Finance is also involved in interfering with the 
supply of "risk money" to growing corporations, for the reason 
of protecting investors. 
  "Promotion of newly established businesses is an urgent task 
in reviving the blocked-up Japanese economy. However, funding 
restrictions are a major obstacle..." The first meeting of "the 
Subcommittee on Funding Environment Improvement Concerning New 
Businesses" was held on 26 January on the 17th floor of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] building. 
This subcommittee is a part of the Industrial Structure 
Council's Industrial Finance Committee. 
  "Venture companies are lacking in collateral and credit, it 
is hard to receive loans from financial institutions." "Due to 
various regulations and customary practices, it is difficult for 
them to participate in capital markets." The subcommittee 
attacked banks and securities companies. MITI officials showed 
their frustration, saying, "Unless we let the new group of 
companies grow, there is no future for Japan." To this, the 
securities companies and MITI reacted rather coolly. 
  The Japan Securities Dealers Association, which is working 
on 
reforming the over-the-counter market, said, "there is no 
discussion of opening up the market by lowering the standard of 
criteria for public sale of stocks." On the contrary, they say 
that a series of bankruptcy of several corporations listed on 
the over-the-counter market shows that corporations must be 
examined more closely at the time of their application and 
disclosure (releasing information) should be emphasized. 
  MOF is also ignoring MITI, using the excuse of "protecting 
investors." Securities companies are also hesitant about opening 
up the market, saying, "we need to consider first the 
corporations that are already listed" (an executive of a major 
securities company). 
  Banks are not fulfilling their function as risk-money 
suppliers to small and midsized businesses, either. 
  Junichi Miyake, vice chairman of the Japan Research 
Institute, recollected, "at the last yearend party, I had an 
unpleasant encounter with the chairman of a major city bank." It 
was because Mr. Miyake expressed his own opinion that "small and 
midsized businesses are in a credit crunch." The chairman 
insisted that "there is no hesitation by banks about lending 
money." The two were not able to agree on this issue at the 
party. 
  According to The Bank of Japan's "Evaluation of Financial 
Institutions' Attitude on Loans DI (`lenient' minus `severe')," 
the figure for major corporations was -9 as of November 1992; 
and the figure became positive in August 1993, and in November 
the figure was 1. The attitude is clearly improving [banks are 
getting more lenient in financing major corporations]. During 
this time, the figure for small and midsized businesses changed 
from 0 to 5. The figure was 3 last November, and the change is 
not as drastic. 
  An executive chairman of one credit bank confided, "Since 
city banks are not responding to corporations' request for 
additional loans, they come crying to local credit banks for 
loans." Hurt by the collapse of the "bubble," banks are more 
cautious about taking risks. A top executive of a top-ranking 
bank insists, "Banks' general attitude of lending money to 
anyone with collateral is being corrected. It is not that we are 
hesitant to give loans." On the other hand, some criticize banks 
for "lacking the ability to examine companies, and take business 
as a security." 
  Venture capital (VC), which was originally for promoting the 
growth of venture enterprises, is not functioning properly. The 
investment balance of VC, as of the end of 1992, was 876.1 
billion yen (67 companies responded to Nikkei VC survey). 
Compared to the previous year, this amount was 15 billion yen 
less. This is because each company has been reorganizing its 
investments. 
  Cases are increasing where VC requests company owners to buy 
back their stocks. In their attempt to recover funds from 
their investments, this is the last resort for corporations, 
which rapidly expanded their investments, taking advantage of 
the "bubble economy" and the VC boom. 
  "They supplied us with the risk money to begin with. It is 
unreasonable for them to demand it back when our business 
doesn't do well." "Venture capital is a false sign." Venture 
enterprises are expressing their dissatisfaction. The Banking 
and securities industry is not trying to understand the needs of 
venture businesses that want to grow. The industry is not able 
to measure the potential of these businesses, or it may be that 
it is not trying to do so. The supply of risk money will 
continue to decrease, unless they start understanding each other.

  [Text] (5) Battle Between Banks and Securities 
Companies 
  It was 24 February. The phone rang at the manager's desk in 
the Corporation Department at the Yamato Securities Co. annex in 
Yaesu, Tokyo. "Concerning the SB's, which are planned to be 
issued the end of this month, we have decided to ask Yamaichi 
Securities, Nikko Securities, and IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan] 
Securities to be the managing underwriters." The caller was an 
accounting executive at Nissan Motor. At that moment, it was 
decided that IBJ Securities obtained the position as a managing 
underwriter in a Japanese company's domestic bonds issuance. 
  Until then, Nissan had always appointed the three major 
securities companies, Yamaichi, Nikko, and Daiwa, to be at the 
top of the managing underwriter syndicate. For Daiwa, "we were 
very much shocked that we were the only one removed from the 
managing underwriter position" (Masatake Makino, Daiwa executive 
manager). 
  It is not unusual for Nissan, which once brought in a 
president and a vice president from the Industrial Bank of 
Japan, to give IBJ Securities Co. the honor of being a managing 
underwriter. However, Nissan's getting too close to IBJ 
Securities may cause the balance among the other financial 
institutions to be lost. One Nissan executive confided, "we 
wanted to avoid being the first one to do this." 
  Their struggle to maintain the balance is evident. They even 
divided their issuance of SB's into three parts, 20 billion yen 
each, to let Yamaichi and Nikko be managing underwriters, also. 
The underwriting ratio of the three parts total is in the order 
of Yamaichi, Nikko, Daiwa, and IBJ Securities. 
  Nissan's urgent problem is to reduce its interest-bearing 
debts. They need to pay off the same amount of debt with funding 
from SB's. They chose relatively low-interest commercial paper. 
Normally, they should pay off bank loans which have high 
interest rates. However, being concerned about offending 
financial institutions, they wanted to avoid the change in loan 
share. 
  It was last July when IBJ Securities Co. opened for 
business. 
It joined the managing underwriter syndicate through SB's issued 
by Nissan, Nippon Steel Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Co., and 
Fujitsu. It was also able to get into the managing underwriter 
syndicate in the issuance of Cosmo Oil Co.'s convertible bonds 
(CB's) planned for mid-March. 
  "We regret that we could not maintain our position as the 
managing underwriter." The underwriting manager of New Japan 
Securities Co. visited underwriting departments of the four 
major securities companies. The purpose of his visits was to 
report that their position as the managing underwriter for a 
midsized construction company, Oki Construction Co., was taken 
by Fuji Bank's local Swiss corporation in the issuance of 
foreign currency warrant bonds which is to take place on the 
Swiss market at the end of March. 
  Underwriting of equity financing (funding with new issuance 
of stocks) is an area that existing securities companies would 
not want to give up. It makes sense that New Japan Securities 
went to apologize to other companies in the industry. 
  This is why securities companies put up strong resistance to 
banks' aggressive operation, and corporations caught in between 
did not know what to do. Last October, Aichi Tokei Denki Co. 
issued warrant bonds in Swiss francs, with a midsized Swiss bank 
as its managing underwriter. There also was a twist to this. 
  Aichi Tokei's main bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, moved 
to make its foreign subsidiary the first managing underwriter 
for this type of bond issuance. Aichi's managing underwriter, 
Nikko, noticed the move and tried to stop them. It sent its 
Nagoya Branch manager, Takao Matsui (now a managing director), 
and even Takao Nakanishi, a managing director from Tokyo, to 
Aichi Tokei. The accounting manager of Aichi Tokei, who was 
hurrying to raise funds, did not know what to do. 
  At last, Aichi decided not to appoint either of them as the 
managing underwriter, thus saving face for both Nikko and IBJ. 
Aichi's accounting executive talked, looking back, "when a 
company has some history, it is difficult to cut off past 
relationship completely." 
  When for the first time IBJ of Switzerland became the 
managing underwriter for Riken's warrant bonds in Swiss francs, 
three major securities companies except Yamaichi, which had been 
Riken's underwriter, refused to join the syndicate and caused 
trouble. Despite the fact that Shoji Saotome, managing director 
of Yamaichi, tried to persuade Riken to change its plan, Riken 
would not change its plan of the issuance. "Even if the four 
major securities companies all decided not to cooperate, Riken 
would still have gone ahead with the plan" (Mr. Saotome). This 
was how strong the tie was between Riken and the Industrial Bank 
of Japan. 
  There were, however, some companies that refused to be 
involved in the battle between banks and securities companies, 
and that have their own opinions. When Kobe Steel Ltd. issued 
Euroyen bonds last December, the four major securities companies 
did not join the syndicate, complaining that the fee standard 
that was proposed by a foreign corporation of a bank was too low. 
  Kobe Steel offered a 0.1 percent fee, and IBJ, Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank, and Sanwa Bank's London corporations accepted it. 
Securities companies suggested a fee of 0.3 percent, and that 
the adjustment be made through issuance price, saying that 
"accepting a 0.1 percent fee may cause their fee structure to 
collapse." However, negotiation was never made. 
  As a result, Kobe Steel was able to raise funds effectively. 
Concerning existing securities companies, they feel that "they 
are sticking too much to traditional practice" (an executive). 
In the application for domestic SB's issuance registration they 
submitted to MOF, Kobe Steel added IBJ Securities Co. to the 
four major securities companies in the managing underwriter 
candidates column. 
  Some are raising question about bank tactics that resemble 
dumping. In the Euromarket, foreign corporations of Japanese 
banks continue to issue bonds with interest levels lower the 
market rate. 
  Last April, Yoshida Kogyo issued SB's in Euroyen, with a 
London corporation of IBJ as its managing underwriter. The issue 
terms were about 0.3 percent below the market. This issue, which 
ignored the market, was refused by investors, and the company 
ended up with many unsold stocks. The investors accused them of 
"making SB's like loans." Some IBJ members say that they regret 
this now. 
  SB issuers may raise funds with low interest at the time, 
however, "they will eventually lose public trust" (Rei Ogino, 
managing director of Nomura Securities Co.) if they keep up this 
financing method which does not suit the market. It will take a 
long time before corporations are be able to effectively raise 
funds.

<H5>  [1 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] (6) Many Asian Corporations of Japanese 
Companies Are Getting Listed on the Local Stock Exchange 
  "Starting with next year's account settlement, we are 
preparing to consolidate the Asia region's settlement of 
accounts. Kazuhiko Yamazaki, president of Fujikura Asia (FAL), a 
Singapore corporation of Fujikura Corp., a major manufacturer of 
electric cables in Japan, began to speak. 
  FAL is the center for Fujikura's Southeast Asia operation, 
approved by the Singapore Government to be OHQ (operational 
headquarters), which is granted special tax treatment. By 
issuing corporate bonds and taking full advantage of their 
location at the financial center, they are to raise low-interest 
funds, and to play the role of supplier of funds to production 
bases in other Asian countries. Leading the consolidation of the 
settlements, they are the "Asian headquarters." 
  FAL has leased over 0.2 billion yen to Fujikura Federal 
Cable 
[FFC], a Malaysian electric cable company. FAL has financed 90 
percent of the capital to Shukai Fujikura Denso, a producer of 
wire harness in Shukai economic special district in China, in 
place of their Tokyo headquarters. FAL is funded by issuance of 
bonds in Eurodollars and loans from local banks. "Our funds are 
raised in the most effective market in Asia" (Mr. Yamazaki, 
president of FAL). FAL has established this system without any 
help from their Japanese main banks. 
  With Fuji Xerox added last year, a total of eight companies 
have been approved as OHQ. Whether designated OHQ or not, 
increasing numbers of Japanese corporations in Singapore are 
issuing convertible bonds and commercial paper. This means the 
movement to use direct financing is accelerating among Japanese 
companies that have gone into Asia. 
  FFC began full-scale production of optic fiber cable in a 
part of Pulai Industrial Park across from Penang Island, which 
is known as an international resort. They have already begun 
construction of additional facilities. Because Malaysia is 
making an effort to improve its communication infrastructure, 
the demand for the cable has skyrocketed, and FFC is in need of 
major expansion of its facility. 
  What they came up with to satisfy this high demand for funds 
was to get listed on the stock exchange. "We may be able to 
apply based on the settlement of March next year," Hideo Sano, 
president of FFC, smilingly said. 
  As of the end of 1992, more than 850 Japanese corporations 
have gone into Malaysia. Among these corporations, only a few 
companies, such as Matsushita Electric Corporation's Malaysian 
operation, are listed on the stock exchange. Under the present 
situation where the capital is provided 100 percent by Japanese 
parent companies, "there is no benefit to getting listed on the 
stock exchange" (Hiroyuki Shirafuji, president of Matsushita 
Television, Malaysia). Only 17 companies listed on the stock 
exchange have 5 percent or more of the capital provided by 
Japanese capital (survey by a local commercial bank). 
  Recently, however, the trend is changing. The Malaysian 
Government has begun to request that Japanese corporations be 
listed on the stock exchange. Localization may be to their 
advantage in receiving project orders. 
  Stock markets in Asian countries have grown rapidly, and 
their aggregate market value even exceeds that of the Second 
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They have more means of 
raising funds than before, and Japanese corporations' local 
companies are beginning to be listed on the local stock exchange. 
  Mitsuo Saito, president of Shanghai Air Conditioner, which 
is Sharp Corporation's joint venture, said, "that's the only 
way." Shanghai Air Conditioner Corp. began manufacturing air 
conditioners last December in the "Hoto Development Area" in 
Shanghai, China. 
  "The only way" is for them to be listed on the stock 
exchange. In China, due to monetary restraints, local foreign 
corporations are troubled by a shortage of gen. "Business has 
gone smoothly this year, and 65 percent of the amount payable is 
in gen." They have a big problem. 
  "We have already consulted some local Japanese companies on 
getting listed on the stock exchange," confided Yuichiro Sekine, 
Nomura Securities' Shanghai branch office manager." As of the 
end of January, 115 companies were listed on the Shanghai Stock 
Exchange. Five of them are joint corporations with foreign 
capital. "It is a matter of time for Japanese joint companies to 
be listed" (a Japanese city bank's Shanghai branch office). 
  In Hong Kong, Jusco Stores, Hong Kong, which is Jusco's 
local 
company in Hong Kong, became listed on the local stock exchange. 
In Singapore, several companies, such as Mitsubishi 
Corp.-related companies, have been listed, starting with Hitachi 
Shipbuilding Singapore in November 1992. 
  Following these movements by corporations, local companies 
of 
securities companies and Japanese banks have begun a fierce 
competition. 
  The Bank of Tokyo sent its international business 
commissioner, Mr. Ryozo Kakitsubo, as an adviser to Bumiputra 
Merchants Bankers the end of last year. Bumiputra is the 
fifth-ranked commercial bank in Malaysia, and Tokyo Bank is 
financing them. 
  Mr. Kakitsubo's mission was to obtain the position of the 
managing underwriter in the Japanese corporations' public 
issuance of stocks. Mr. Kakitsubo estimates that "about 20 
companies are considering going public." He has been busy 
meeting with local Japanese corporations. 
  Tokio Takezawa, president of Sanwa International Finance 
(SIF), Sanwa Bank's Hong Kong securities company, said, "An 
increasing number of business trips to Shanghai are being taken 
from Japanese banks' Hong Kong securities companies." Nomura 
Research Institute, Hong Kong, has employed a special analyst to 
study corporations in Shanghai this year. 
  "Nomura's enemies are not Nikko or Yamaichi. Rather, they 
are 
the European and U.S. securities companies and Japanese banks' 
local companies, such as Sanwa (a securities analyst in Hong 
Kong). SIF has had good results in competition for the position 
of the leading underwriter in issuance of stocks. This year so 
far, only Nomura International (Hong Kong), Nomura Securities' 
local company, obtain the position of the leading underwriter. 
Japanese securities companies do not seem to be doing well. 
  This year, within Japan several securities companies have 
been established as subsidiaries of city banks, and the time is 
about to end when banks could sit peacefully on titles, such as 
"main bank" and "leading underwriter". Right now, an opening 
match is taking place among banks, securities companies, and 
corporations in Asia where the wall of restriction is low, and 
the issue is how to respond to corporations' needs.

<F P=106> [By Abdul Rahman Sulaiman] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed Thursday met with Cambodia's Co-Prime Ministers Prince 
Norodom Ranaridh and Hun Sen for discussions to further enhance 
the growth of ties between the two countries. 
  The prime minister was accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Primary Industries Minister Dr. Lim Keng 
Yaik and other officials to the talks held at the Cambodian 
prime ministers' office. 
  Cambodia, which is undergoing economic rehabilitation and 
reconstruction following the restoration of peace and stability, 
is said to be keen to emulate Malaysia's economic success as 
well as that of its other ASEAN neighbours. 
  Dr. Mahathir, here for a two-day official visit at the 
invitation of the Cambodian Government, arrived Thursday morning 
together with a 23-member official delegation. 
  Also with him was his wife Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohamed Ali and 
69 
Malaysian businessmen. 
  The business delegation, led by Arab Malaysia Merchant Bank 
Berhad [Limited] executive chairman Azman Hashim, is here to 
further explore business and investment opportunities in this 
former socialist state whose potentials are still largely 
untapped. 
  Despite Thursday being the Cambodian new year and public 
holiday here, the prime minister and his entourage were given a 
rousing welcome on arrival at the Pochentong International 
Airport, near here. 
  Dr. Mahathir and Dr. Siti Hasmah were received by First 
Prime 
Minister Prince Ranariddh and his wife. 
  Later, the prime minister had an audience with King Norodom 
Sihanouk who had just returned home from medical treatment 
abroad specially to welcome the Malaysian leader.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir considers 
his visit to Cambodia a historical event because he is the first 
Malaysian leader to visit the country in 30 years. This is 
because the conflict that took place in Cambodia following the 
visit by the late Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime 
minister, made it impossible for other Malaysian leaders to 
visit Phnom Penh. Here is Shah Bahrom Datuk Shah Ya, a RTM 
[Radio Television Malaysia] correspondent reporting from 
Vientiane. [as heard] 
  [Begin Shah Bahrom recording] Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir 
said the above when addressing the state banquet hosted in his 
honor by the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Ranariddh 
and Hun Sen, at the Government House tonight. 
  He said that even though visits to Phnom Penh were 
impossible 
then, the leaders and the people of Malaysia continued to pay 
attention to Cambodia. Malaysia sympathized with the situation 
in Cambodia when it was bogged down by civil war. Now Malaysia 
is happy to see the country being restored to an everlasting 
peace with the help of friendly countries. Malaysia is also 
happy to be involved in the peace process in Cambodia, including 
participation in UNTAC [United National Transitional Authority 
in Cambodia]. As for Malaysia, it is important that peace is 
restored to Cambodia because this is also important for the 
stability and prosperity in the Southeast Asia region. 
  Malaysia's involvement in Cambodia's peace process is mainly 
due to the fact that Malaysia is a neighboring country and a 
close friend of Cambodia. It has become ASEAN's new practice to 
open up opportunities and boost cooperation among its member 
countries as well as with peaceful countries in Southeast Asia. 
This includes a peaceful Cambodia. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated that when there is unity 
in 
Southeast Asia, the countries in the region will definitely be 
much stronger to face future challenges. 
  Malaysia hopes that finally all 10 countries in Southeast 
Asia will become members of ASEAN. Laos and Vietnam have taken 
various steps and make preparations to join ASEAN. [end

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has urged Malaysian 
businessmen to seriously consider investing in Cambodia. The 
prime minister said they should particularly go into the tourism 
sector, such as hotel and resort projects as well as road 
construction, power generation, telecommunications, and resource 
exploitation. He was speaking at a news conference in Phnom 
Penh during a two-day official visit to Cambodia, accompanied by 
a 69-member delegation. 
  Yesterday, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir held talks with First 
Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun 
Sen. He described the outcome of his visit as very significant. 
His visit is the first by a Malaysian prime minister in 30 
years. The prime minister had agreed to meet Cambodia's request 
for assistance in the fields of training and technical expertise 
in oil palm and rubber cultivation.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 15 Apr (AKP) -- "The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation has learned with concern 
and indignation that acts of violence were committed in the 
evening of 9 April against ethnic Vietnamese living in Peam So, 
S'ang District, Kandal Province," declared the Ministry in a 
communique issued in Phnom Penh on 12 April. 
  "This attack left a dozen killed and some 20 others 
wounded," 
stated the communique before adding: 
  "The Royal Government severely and solemnly condemns these 
barbarous acts, which are subject to a careful and urgent 
investigation of the competent authorities. The investigation 
will consider the objectives of the criminals, one of which aims 
at weakening the friendly relations between Cambodia and Vietnam. 
  "The Royal Government would like to express to the bereaved 
families its sincere condolences and all its sympathy on the 
occasion of this painful ordeal. 
  "It forcefully affirms that its sacred duty is to ensure 
security for all residents of the country, whatever their 
nationality," concluded the communique.

  [Text] Here is an additional report from the Pailin 
battlefield on 12 and 13 April. 
  1. The areas in and around Pailin: 
  On 12 April, we attacked and seized control of the general 
command post of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed 
government at Boeng Pralit. Its commander fled back to Pailin. 
At 1400 on 12 April, we seized five enemy soldiers and two T-54 
tanks. 
  On the morning of 12 April, we fired at enemy trucks, 
damaging two of them and setting two others on fire in the 
southern part of Phnum Veng north of Route 10. 
  Also on 12 April, we set an oil tanker on fire in an area 
between Phnum Yat and O Ta Vau. 
  We still control O Rum-el and Ba Tang So. We have continued 
to attack Pailin with infantry forces and artillery fire. 
  2. On the eastern part of Pailin: 
  We set another military truck on fire, south of Phnum Srang 
hill adjacent to Phnum Veng. All troops on the truck were 
killed or wounded. 
  We continue to control Sala Krau. 
  Here is the situation on 13 April. The invading forces of 
the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government have 
begun to collapse bit by bit. They have been plunged into 
confusion. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is 
attacking them from all directions. They have run out of 
ammunition, food, and medicine. Many of those who were killed or 
wounded were left scattered about. Nobody cares about anybody 
else. Their supply routes have been cut off completely for 
several consecutive days now.

  [Text] According to a report from the Pailin battlefield, 
Ritthi, the commander and many officers and soldiers of the 
puppet 6th Division, routed in battle, have fled into Thai 
territory. 
  1. On 12 April, we attacked the enemy troops west of Pailin 
and at Boeng Pralit, thus blocking the stretches of road within 
the perimeter of Pailin to the northern, southern, and eastern 
parts. We smashed the invading forces into bits and launched 
infantry attacks and shelling on their general command post at 
Boeng Pralit, killing or wounding many of them. Many others 
fled in disarray. 
  2. These escapees are 6th Division commander Ritthi and 60 
officers and soldiers. Many of them were wounded. Having been 
constantly attacked and pressured by the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea, they fled into Thai territory. 
  On 12 April, they fled in great alarm onto Thai soil, 
carrying weapons but wearing only shorts. The local people 
crowded around this General (Ritthi), because it is strange to 
see this general in such a position in spite of the earlier 
propaganda by the Phnom Penh ringleaders and some Western 
foreigners claiming that Pailin was under Phnom Penh control.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Vickery: "Phnom Penh power plays"] </F>
  [Text] The failure of Funcinpec [National United Front for 
an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] to 
win a clear majority in last year's election forced the royalist 
party to form an uneasy coalition with their former foes, the 
Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. While hailed at the time as 
symbolic of national reconciliation, the coalition government 
has been rent by infighting and an inability to enact 
significant legislation. Much of the current stasis afflicting 
Phnom Penh has been blamed on CPP hardliners but a closer look 
at the power balance suggests that this is not the case. 
  This coalition was mooted throughout 1992, but during the 
run 
up to the election collapsed in anti-Funcinpec violence, blamed 
at the time on the Chea Sim hardliners Sar Kheng and Sin Song. 
Now that recent invitations to the United States have 
implicitly exonerated the two, international credence has been 
lent to Hun Sen who had always maintained the CPP was not 
responsible for the pre-election mayhem. 
  In preparation for the coalition the CPP made some quick 
substitutions among its 51 winners in the National Assembly. 
Thirty-three mostly old cadres resigned in favor of younger 
technocrats and intellectuals. The Chea Sim faction lost 
status, that of Hun Sen gained, and the shifts in CPP personnel 
indicate sincerity in playing the parliamentary game. 
  Eight Chea Sim followers, including Sin Song, resigned, 
leaving eight among the CPP deputies, while fifteen of the "Hun 
Sen Clan", mostly intellectuals and professionals, remained with 
eight dropped. Eleven veteran provincial governors were passed 
over, and only five, all but one young men believed close to Hun 
Sen, were included. Also excluded were most candidates with a 
military or security service background, while those included 
were generals Ke Kimyan, age 38, and Chay Sangyun, 40, sometimes 
called 'military intellectuals', and the Defence Minister, Tie 
Banh, 48. 
  When the Provisional Government was chosen in July, with 37 
of its 65 members from outside the assembly, 15 of the CPP 
members were of the 'Hun Sen Clan', while only four were Chea 
Sim men; and none was from among the old politicians or Chea 
stalwarts in the assembly. The affiliation of the remaining ten 
CPP members of the government was uncertain. The only Chea Sim 
man in a powerful position was Sin Sen, as a Deputy Minister of 
Interior and Public Security, the others being in Tourism, 
Transport, and Public Works. 
  In October 1993 a new Royal Government of Cambodia was 
formed, with near equality between the two large parties 
maintained. Twenty-nine members of the Provisional Government, 
including 12 CPP and 15 Funcinpec, were dropped, and there were 
eight new faces, four CPP, three Funcinpec, and one listed 
without party affiliation. 
  The new line-up showed some gain for Chea Sim, who moved up 
from Vice-President to President of the National Assembly. Of 
the 12 CPP members of the Provisional Government dropped from 
the Royal government, three were his men against six from the 
Hun Sen group. Sin Sen was removed, but another protege, Sar 
Kheng, came into the government as a Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of the Interior. 
  Still, of the 24 CPP members of the government 11 are 
considered of the Hun Sen group, with only two certain Chea Sim 
followers. Most of the rest, because of their relative youth or 
intellectual background may also be presumed closer to Hun Sen 
than to Chea Sim. 
  In the provinces the parties share the 20 governorships 
equally, with a first deputy from the other party, and the CPP 
has shifted much of its personnel. In nine provinces, including 
those whose governors entered the National Assembly, the former 
governors have been removed. In any case the Funcinpec 
personnel may be figureheads, because of long-standing CPP 
relationships with subordinate officials and he population. In 
general, during 1979-93 the provinces were run by local people, 
not just functionnairies sent out from Phnom Penh. This does 
not, however, guarantee tight party control, and some provinces 
may constitute their own factions. 
  In the future, equal attention should be given to Funcinpec 
factions. Ranariddh has complained that not all members vote 
for his proposals, and there is a Funcinpec faction, probably 
centered on Sam Rangsi, which is lukewarm towards monarchy, 
especially of the Sihanouk variety. Likewise, members of the 
KPNLF/BLDP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front/Buddhist 
Liberal Democratic Party] of Son Sann, whose organization has 
never been royalist, may find more congenial colleagues among 
the new CPP elite. 
  The first sign of realignment may be in the military. Before 
the election both the KPNLF and the Sihanoukists suffered 
defections of generals to Phnom Penh; and immediately after the 
election the commanders of those three armies agreed to unite. 
The Phnom Penh army was headed by young generals without a 
Vietnam background, probably closer to Hun Sen than to Chea Sim, 
and the KPNLF army was run by a faction which formed the Liberal 
Democratic Party, a group of non-royalist younger men. Then the 
reorganized Cambodian Armed Forces, in a return to the situation 
preceding Untac [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] 
intervention, launched a campaign against the Khmer Rouge, 
adopting Hun Sen's policy against that of Sihanouk and Ranariddh. 
  If they succeed, they will have proven that peace in 
Cambodia 
required no more than international neglect of the Khmer Rouge 
and normalization of relations with Phnom Penh, and could have 
been achieved years ago.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Friday [15 April] supported 
a U.S. proposal that a new multilateral trade organization deal 
with the issue of deregulation. 
  The comment came in response to a speech Thursday by U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, in 
which he said domestic issues like government regulations should 
be taken up by the World Trade Organization (WTO), a forum to 
succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. 
  "Discussion in a multilateral setting will likely provide 
some solutions to issues like deregulation," Kumagai told a 
press conference. 
  Kumagai, however, opposed a proposal that Japan, the United 
States and the European Union (EU) create a trilateral forum to 
discuss economic and trade affairs. 
  In a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in 
Marrakech on Thursday, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan 
proposed such a forum. 
  "Such a trilateral forum would only complicate problems," 
Kumagai said, indicating his view that issues like the 
Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks should be basically held on a 
bilateral basis.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Germany's overnight rate 
cuts will not lead Japan to take fresh fiscal and monetary 
measures ahead of a spate of international meetings slated in 
Washington later this month, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Friday [15 April]. 
  "Japan will not change its policies and will continue 
steadily implementing its latest measures," Fujii told a regular 
news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  The Bundesbank's policy-making council decided overnight to 
cut its discount and lombard rates by a quarter of a percentage 
point to an annual 5.00 percent and 6.50 percent, effective 
Friday. 
  Fujii declined to comment on overseas policy, only saying 
that lower rates help a country's economy. 
  The timing of the rate cuts would allow other European 
nations to follow suit ahead of the international financial 
gatherings in Washington. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven 
(G-7) major industrial nations are expected to meet on April 24 
before a spate of twice-yearly meetings of the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
  With Germany set to portray its rate cuts as soothing 
growing 
concerns over the recent trend for a rise in long-term market 
rates in G-7 nations, Japan may be under pressure to demonstrate 
a commitment to reducing its huge trade surplus. 
  The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan and the United States.

<F P=106> [Roundtable Discussion with Takuma Yamamoto, board of </F>
directors chairman, Fujitsu; Yoshimasa Ito, president, director 
Koden Seisakusho; Kenji Naemura, professor, Keio University; 
Wataru Aso, director general, Japan Patent Office; place and 
date not given: "For Implementation of Globally Sustainable 
Patent System"] 
  [Text] Increasing Number of Intellectual Property 
Disputes 
  [Wataru Aso] These days the number of international patent 
disputes or, more generally, the number of international 
intellectual property disputes is increasing. Domestic patent 
disputes are also on the rise. Furthermore, huge sums are being 
awarded these days for patent infringements. 
  I'd like to start by getting a clear picture of the 
situation 
and your views on what's happening. First, I would like to start 
with Mr. Yamamoto, who is one of our leading industrialists. 
  [Takuma Yamamoto] Patent and copyright disputes having to do 
with software started increasing in the second half of the 
1980's when the United States first adopted policies to protect 
intellectual property--in other words, when it started taking a 
pro-patent stance. As indicated by Mr. Aso, the settlements have 
been fairly large. At one time, large corporations in the United 
States took a relatively generous position on patent questions. 
Recently that hasn't been the case. The United States is a 
society of lawyers, and although I don't have any evidence to 
support my suspicions, it seems they tend to stir things up 
among smaller and midsized businesses, giving rise to frequent 
litigation. 
  Even setting aside Fujitsu's case, I think we'll find 
examples where a broad interpretation is being given to patents. 
It's not a matter of simply being "pro-patent" or not. It's a 
problem of interpretation: something which the Japanese might 
not think is in violation of a patent will be interpreted in the 
United States quite differently. Another problem, which will 
probably be discussed later, clearly has to do with the patent 
system in the United States--with so-called "submarine patents" 
that one day seem to surface out of the blue. 
  [Aso] Mr. Ito's company [Koden Seisakusho] has trading 
partners all over the world. Are you encountering problems with 
regard to patents or intellectual property rights? 
  [Yoshimasa Ito] Well, I don't think that we're in violation 
of any patents, but when it comes to talk about triple indemnity 
awards and parity, those stories in themselves are enough to 
make me want to give up on the idea of going to the United 
States. Actually, those worries occupy a foremost place in our 
work. In the case of the United States, there were a lot of 
times, particularly in the case of patents, when I thought that 
certain situations wouldn't go well even if they were put in the 
hands of a professional. 
  As Mr. Yamamoto was saying, the United States is a litigious 
society, and in a sense, a part of its culture, which emphasizes 
on individualism, has taken a strange turn. I think one can say 
without exaggerating that there is a side to the current U.S. 
pro-patent system that makes it easy to turn patent problems 
into disputes, which can be considered to be even immoral. 
Certainly that has affected us psychologically to a very great 
extent. 
<H5>  Japan's Role With Regard to Developing Countries </H5>
  [Aso] Professor Naemura, what do you think of this 
situation? 
  [Kenji Naemura] Technology leads economies, and at a time 
when economies are turning global, technology naturally crosses 
national boundaries and enters various countries. When that 
happens, it is inevitable for technologies to come up against 
the cultures of those countries and their respective patent and 
legal systems. We have to think about strategies ahead of time 
premised on those differences. 
  Questions are now being raised, I think, about Japan's 
policy 
in light of the pro-patent policy of the United States. It's 
not a matter simply for the Japanese Government. More broadly, 
it has to involve consensus-building that includes those in 
industry. 
  Right now there are people in Japan asserting that a 
pro-patent stance will have the effect of "hollowing out" 
industries and that a move to strengthen the patent system, in 
and of itself, is not a good idea. Such views may be all right 
if one wants to treat the symptoms, but we have to have debates 
on whether that is in fact the general consensus in Japan. 
  With regard to damage awards--data exist showing that, 
compared to the early half of the 1980's when the United States 
started taking pro-patent measures, the average damage award has 
increased about five fold. Compared to increases in the average 
cost of goods, a five fold increase in 10 years is just too 
steep. 
  It's like the bubble phenomenon that occurred here with 
regard to land prices. Somehow we have to get this situation 
under control. At the time, people were asking what would happen 
if land prices were to drop suddenly. The same questions are 
being asked now. So it's imperative that we consider measures 
that will bring things to rest at a suitable level. 
  [Ito] Take the case of semiconductors for example. Useful 
products come into being as the cumulative result of a number of 
innovations. When an unreasonable amount is demanded in 
royalties for a single patent, technology is going to suffer. 
It's going to end up wrecking businesses. Within the United 
States, a rather confusing situation has come about as the 
result of cross-licensing. 
  The possibility of strengthening patents was just mentioned. 
But patents are like the flowering of an idea that begins with 
an individual and then builds on the accumulated wisdom of 
others. To claim credit, as if solely responsible for that 
flowering, on the basis of what is really only a small part of 
the entire process, is excessive and wholly undesirable. There 
should be counterarguments to such claims on philosophical 
grounds. 
  For example, when Japan provides technology to developing 
countries, we should be able to argue against such claims. Talks 
between industrially advanced countries and between advanced 
countries and developing countries include surprisingly 
nettlesome philosophical issues. U.S. demands at this time, I 
can't help feeling, are a little excessive. 
  [Aso] Mr. Naemura, how do you feel about the relationship 
between advanced and developing countries with respect to 
intellectual property rights? 
  [Naemura] I have the feeling the so-called developing 
nations 
are about two steps behind countries like the United States and 
Japan in regard to intellectual property rights. In developing 
countries, those rights haven't been clearly set down in a 
system yet. But let's say they are. It doesn't follow that these 
countries are then all going to be rushing forward in the same 
direction as industrially advanced countries. 
  There is another step in between where technology is 
introduced and that serves as the basis for further 
technological developments. Compared to economies, when 
technology is involved, the process involves at least one more 
step, and we have to think about how to help them through that 
additional step. It's the sort of problem that can't be solved 
simply by making a single rule and having that apply in common 
to everyone. 
  In the last 50 years or so since the end of World War II, 
Japan has come through that process, and the current generation 
has to pass that know-how on to developing countries. In that 
sense, Japan has an extremely important role to play. 
<H5>  U.S. System Is a Worldwide Problem </H5>
  [Aso] Unlike patents, which specify who the inventor is in a 
way that's evident to people, it's often hard, in the case of 
copyrights, to tell whose rights have been violated and at what 
point until a lawsuit or charge has been brought against the 
alleged violator. In other words, copyrights are like land 
mines. It's hard to tell where they might lie buried or how big 
an explosion they'll set off. Among companies, how is such a 
problem handled, I wonder? 
  [Yamamoto] Well, in the case of programs, one can't go and 
investigate each and every invention that has ever been 
developed independently. It's impossible to thoroughly research 
what amounts to a mountain of material. So a term like 
"clean-dom" has appeared. All one can do is isolate oneself in 
an environment uncontaminated by others and there development 
something uniquely one's own. 
  For general patents, the Patent Office is creating a 
paperless [electronic] database. We would like to use this 
database to research precedents and previous technology. It 
costs large enterprises a lot of money to research such matters, 
but I'm afraid the costs for medium-sized businesses and smaller 
enterprises may still be prohibitive. 
  The U.S. system has caused a lot of problems in the past. 
There hasn't been a system for the public to get information, 
and one day someone suddenly comes up claiming to have a patent 
for old technology which is so self-evident that people now take 
it for granted. This leads to a mess. It has driven me to the 
point sometimes of almost feeling it is the most unfair system 
around, and it really has to be revised. It is a problem that 
can probably be solved through harmonization. In any case, I 
would definitely like to see the problem resolved as soon as 
possible. 
  [Ito] One of the problems is that you don't know if you're 
going to be stepping on a land mine. You don't know where the 
land mines have been planted. And even if you do, besides 
knowing where they are, you have to have a system that you know 
how long a mine is going to be a threat; for example, a battery 
should be placed inside them with an expected life span of 20 
years, and when those 20 years are up, even if you should step 
on them, you're safe. 
  [Aso] A submarine patent has recently surfaced that has to 
do 
with [Jerome] Lemelson's image-processing technology. He applied 
for the patent in 1954. In 1992, 38 years later, the patent is 
finally approved. Under the U.S. system, this patent is in 
effect for 17 years, from 1992. Technology that everyone is 
using and has assumed is common property suddenly surfaces with 
a patent on it. Japan isn't the only country to suffer as a 
result. U.S. industries and industries throughout the world are 
suffering. This system has to be changed as soon as possible. 
  [Yamamoto] Lemelson's patent is for technology anyone would 
have thought of, and to that extent, it was inevitable that 
someone would have tried to patent the idea. The problem is that 
such ideas can be patented in the first place. One of the 
fundamental problems with the patent system lies here. The 
system is causing hardships throughout the world. It's enough to 
make me wish we could go back through history and set things 
right from the start. 
  [Naemura] For example, the United States and others are 
accusing Japan of having closed, idiosyncratic markets. Make 
them the same as markets elsewhere, we're told. But as far as 
patent systems go, the U.S. system is also closed and out of 
step with systems elsewhere. It also presents a problem in terms 
of its domestic-versus-foreign bias. So, we're at a period now, 
I think, when we should be asking why the U.S. system is closed 
and at the same time explaining to U.S. consumers how that 
system is hurting them and its industries in general. 
  It's true that Japanese industries are having a very hard 
time; but the United States isn't going to listen if we say 
we're hurting, so their system has to be changed. Rather, what's 
needed, I think, is to argue the point that the system is not 
only inconveniencing the United States but is bad for elsewhere 
in the world as well. 
  Europe and Japan's positions are very similar. We're both 
advocating the same kinds of things: change from a 
first-to-invent to a first-to-apply system, to a system where 
the public has access to patent information, and to a system 
where the patent period is calculated from the date of 
application. In the sense that other countries are advocating 
such changes, the U.S. system can be said to have become a 
worldwide problem. 
  The first-to-invent system that the United States is 
advocating is based on the idea of individualism--giving due 
respect to the individual and to individual gifts and 
talents--and places disproportionate emphasis on that 
philosophy. But I have a feeling that by establishing time 
limits, something can somehow be worked out. 
  [Yamamoto] I think a time limit is the first condition. But 
[patents] are very broadly interpreted. For example, in the case 
of the autofocus technology in cameras. You think there are no 
problems and then you go to the United States and there are. 
It's a tough situation to be in. One of the issues involved is 
how to decide on a matter when similar patents and similar 
claims emerge in a single stretch in the course of history. 
  In any case, what happens is that the differences in various 
systems and ways of thinking rub up against each other to cause 
friction among countries. And even with the harmonization of 
systems, I suspect there will still be problems. 
  [Aso] Even when systems are harmonized, the next problem to 
arise may be in their application and implementation. But, first 
of all, it's important to try our best to harmonize the various 
systems. 
  [Yamamoto] Yes, I hope we can move forward on this. 
<H5>  Technological Innovation, Source of Japan's Vitality </H5>
  [Aso] The United States is now trying to build consensus 
regarding the direction its people want to see for the WIPO 
(World Intellectual Property Organization) treaty. Professor 
Naemura, what do you think we should be anticipating from the 
United States? 
  [Naemura] It has already been mentioned in our discussion, 
but the U. S. system is very idiosyncratic. 
  [Aso] First of all, the United States has to be brought 
around to realizing that fact. 
  [Naemura] It means demanding changes in the current system 
in 
terms of the first-to-invent principle that it embodies and in 
terms of time requirements, public access, and the 
domestic-foreign bias that exists in the system. On the other 
hand, it means that demands will also be placed on Japan. For 
example, if the principle of parity is introduced and adopted, 
it will mean giving a broader interpretation in Japan to patent 
claims, and so it will be necessary to build consensus in Japan 
regarding such proposed changes. 
  [Aso] The United States is saying that Japan's patent review 
process takes too long. They also want applications to be 
accepted in English. Again, Japan recognizes objections from 
third parties before a patent is granted. The United States 
wants patents to be granted first and, then, if there are any 
objections, for those matters to be dealt with later. They are 
also asking for changes that would require a change in Japan's 
patent laws or fundamental revisions in the way the system 
operates--for example, when they say Japan's grace period is too 
short or the review period for applications is too long and they 
want it to be shortened. 
  If the United States said it would take bold steps to revise 
its system, then despite some problems, Japan too would make 
bold concessions. We have to approach future talks with an 
attitude that says to the United States, since Japan is going to 
make concessions, so should you. 
  [Yamamoto] I think a turning point has definitely come for 
private enterprises, too. First of all, it means paying serious 
attention to the system of investigating prior cases and 
precedents. It means not frivolously applying for patents. And 
through revisions in patent law, it means a shift which makes it 
possible to apply for ideas after they've been put together and 
better developed; in other words, it means a shift from quantity 
to quality. 
  [Ito] I think it's somewhat regrettable that the message for 
small and midsized enterprises may be to be very selective in 
their applications for patents, and wonder if some distinctions 
shouldn't be made in such cases. Of course, there's no way to 
argue against the idea of quality over quantity. But I think we 
also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that technological 
innovation has been an essential source of the energy that has 
been behind Japan's vitality. 
  [Aso] Yes, you're quite right. To ask applicants to be very 
selective in applying for patents is apt to hold down 
applications as a whole and be taken as a directive against 
inventing and developing new technologies, and that certainly is 
not our intention at all. We want people to keep coming up with 
a lot of good ideas. But we also want them to do their homework 
and look thoroughly into the matter of related, prior 
inventions. The Patent Office doesn't want to be flooded with an 
indiscriminate number of applications without this homework 
having been done. 
<H5>  Promote the Harmonization of Patent Systems and Their </H5>
Application 
  [Aso] Mr. Yamamoto mentioned this awhile ago, but in July 
1993 the Patent Office put a system into operation that is 
completely electronic. As part of our database, we've already 
processed some 30 million cases and made this information 
available to the public. We want the fruits of this paperless 
database be our common property. 
  [Yamamoto] Japan's Patent Office's paperless database system 
seems to be the first of its kind in the world. It's important, 
not only in the sense of preventing patent disputes, but also in 
the sense of being forward-looking. The system will probably be 
a useful reference for developing countries, too. We are looking 
forward to seeing the Patent Office working together with the 
appropriate countries when the time is right. 
  [Ito] It's splendid that a project of this scope has been 
successfully carried out. From here on, the task will be to 
update the system on a constant basis, and as Mr. Yamamoto said, 
I hope its use can be broadened to include assistance to 
developing countries. 
  [Naemura] I imagine that, through this system, the process 
of 
reviewing applications will be made much more efficient. 
Naturally, that's one of the points to be appreciated. I hope 
its merits will also be assessed in terms of volume. 
  [Aso] Right now, databases are kept separately. The United 
States has its own database and the same with Europe and Japan. 
So each of their respective patent offices has gotten together 
and they are trying to make it so that the data can all be 
mutually used. Also, since their methods are all different for 
searching and looking into previous technology, hopefully, there 
will be some harmonization here, too. 
  Another point is that views differ in respect to novelty or 
originality. This is the most difficult point, and work is now 
in progress in this area. In addition to harmonizing systems, I 
hope energy is put into harmonizing the way the systems are put 
into practice and operation. 
  Thank you for participating today in our discussion of so 
many different issues.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japan welcomed South 
Korea's decision Friday [15 April] to seek dialogue with North 
Korea to implement a 1992 declaration to denuclearize the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Japan gave high marks to the decision because it clarifies 
Seoul's policy to seek dialogue to solve the problem of North 
Korea's alleged nuclear development. The move is in line with 
the UN Security Council's presidential statement last month, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said. 
  The announcement also made clear Seoul's policy to promote 
dialogue with Pyongyang to implement an inter-Korean declaration 
aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said. 
  Japan will continue its close contact with the United 
States, 
South Korea and other countries, and urge North Korea to accept 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to respond to Seoul's calls for 
dialogue, he said. 
  South Korea's Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok said Friday 
that Seoul will no longer hold Pyongyang to an exchange of 
envoys as a precondition for a third round of high-level talks 
between North Korea and the U.S. 
  Yi, who also serves as national unification minister, said 
Seoul no longer believes the stance will help resolve the 
stalemate over the north's reluctance to permit international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The exchange of envoys, along with full nuclear inspections, 
had been key preconditions to holding high-level talks between 
Washington and Pyongyang. 
  North Korea allowed IAEA experts to inspect its facilities 
in 
March but blocked access to a key facility suspected of 
producing plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. 
Pyongyang says its nuclear program is peaceful. 
  North Korea has insisted on talking only with the U.S., 
refusing to discuss the issue with Seoul. It also rejected the 
UN Security Council statement. 
  Talks between Seoul and Pyongyang broke down last month when 
North Korean delegates stormed out of a meeting after 
threatening to turn South Korea into "a sea of fire."

  [Text] Nagoya, April 14 KYODO -- A group of Korean 
residents in Japan said Thursday [14 April] they have found a 
wartime Japanese Security Ministry document indicating Korean 
residents were conscripted to work at a warplane factory in 
Nagoya. 
  The document was seized by the general headquarters of the 
allied occupation forces after Japan's surrender in 1945, but 
was later returned to Japan. It has been kept in the Diet 
library until the group detected it recently. 
  The group is led by Yu Hwang-su, a senior official of the 
Tokyo headquarters of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun). 
  The group called a news conference at Chongryun's Aichi 
Prefectural headquarters and distributed copies of the document 
entitled "Thought Quarterly," compiled by the ministry in 1944. 
  The document says conscription squeezed the income of the 
Korean residents so steeply that the despondent laborers at the 
warplane engine factory in Nagoya had lost the will to work 
hard, the group said. 
  Security Ministry investigators who probed the factory's 
working conditions for 15 days starting February 16, 1944, found 
that 24 people, or 36 percent of the 67 korean laborers, failed 
to show up to work, according to the document. 
  Hong Song-chin, the group's secretariat chief and a 
Chongryun 
official, told reporters, "although we read 100,000 pages of 
official documents, this is the first specific name of the 
factory we have finally found" where Korean laborers were 
conscripted to work. 
  In a related development, the same group announced it will 
launch a nationwide investigation Monday to gather testimonies 
from Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan before or during 
World War II. 
  The probe is also designed to elucidate the truth regarding 
the Japanese Government's crackdown on pro-independence Korean 
activists and citizens during wartime, it said. 
  The group said the probe is the nation's first into Korean 
residents in Japan who were subjected to conscription or the 
clampdown on the pro-independence movement. 
  It said it will submit its findings to the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva this August. 
  Chongryun pollers will visit and distribute questionnaires 
to 
10,000 households of Koreans who survived the repression or 
conscription, it said. 
  The survey will cover pro-Pyongyang and pro-Seoul Korean 
residents, and the group hopes to complete it by the end of May. 
  The Korean community numbers some 670,000, of which 10 
percent are believed to be Koreans forcibly brought to Japan 
before or during World War II, and the remaining are their 
offspring. 
  The probe will touch on female laborers or "comfort women," 
who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops at frontline 
military brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japanese banks on Friday 
[15 April] completed swapping 650 billion yen worth of loans to 
Brazil for equities to restructure the debt, banking officials 
said. 
  The so-called Brady bonds will be listed in Europe and most 
of the banks are expected to sell them immediately, the 
officials said. 
  The officials said the bonds are expected to be sold for a 
total of 350 billion yen. This will leave the banks with losses 
of 300 billion yen which they expect to liquidate in closing 
their midterm books at the end of September. 
  The plan is part of the Brady initiative launched in 1989 by 
former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. 
  Under the initiative, creditor banks, after discounting 
credit, swap loans to Latin American countries for bonds issued 
by the debtor nations. 
  Banks have previously liquidated bad loans to Mexico, 
Venezuela and Argentina using a similar method. The Brazilian 
scheme wraps up the initiative, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The primary opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] should maintain unity over the 
choice of its own candidate for the premiership, a senior party 
official said Friday [15 April]. 
  "In any event, the best way for our party to return to power 
is to pull together and remain united," LDP Secretary General 
Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. 
  Mori made the remark in response to a question about former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's reported move to break away 
from the LDP, launch a new party and seek to become prime 
minister. 
  While declining direct comment on the report, Mori said he 
will closely monitor a meeting between LDP President Yohei Kono 
and Watanabe on Friday afternoon. 
  Kono is expected to ask Watanabe not to run for the 
premiership so as to avoid a major split of the LDP. 
  Watanabe's faction, the fourth largest among the LDP's five 
factions, is beefing up its campaign to promote their boss as a 
successor to Hosokawa by trying to collect signatures from some 
100 LDP members to back Watanabe's bid for power. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito [Clean 
Government 
Party], two of the key parties in the ruling coalition, have 
been considering the possibility of fielding Watanabe as a 
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, should 
the influential LDP figure bolt from the LDP along with a large 
number of his cohorts. 
  Although Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the leader of 
Shinseito, is widely seen as the favorite for the premiership, 
the squabbling coalition has yet to break a stalemate in the 
selection of a candidate to succeed Hosokawa, who offered to 
resign April 8. 
  Hosokawa, 56, will stay on as caretaker until a replacement 
is named.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe on Friday [15 April] turned down a request by 
Liberal Democratic Party president Yohei Kono not to break with 
but to defend the unity of Japan's largest opposition party. 
  Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also 
expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito 
and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in 
order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country." 
  Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and concurrently 
foreign minister of the once-dominant LDP, made the remarks 
after two hours of talks with Kono. 
  Earlier in the day, Japanese mass media reported that 
Watanabe had decided to quit the LDP to form his own party. 
  "We held extremely serious talks," Watanabe told reporters 
after emerging from his bargaining session with Kono, who paid a 
visit to the factional leader at his political office in his 
faction's headquarters. 
  Watanabe said, "I told him (Kono) it is necessary for 
politicians of the same political opinions and doctrine to band 
together to form an alliance in order to surmount the crises now 
confronting this country, from the standpoint of making 
full-fledged efforts to save the country." 
  Watanabe was apparently referring to the political ideals of 
intra-coalition forces led by the chief coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the core coalition 
component. 
  Ozawa has advocated the same stand as Watanabe on such key 
issues as Japan's role in UN peacekeeping missions, tax system 
reform and the need to take a tough stand against the suspected 
North Korean nuclear arms program. 
  Kono told reporters he has not given up his efforts to 
persuade Watanabe not to break away from the LDP, which lost its 
38-year lock on power in a 1993 general election following a 
series of defections. 
  Kono said he told Watanabe he does not have any intention to 
give up his own bid for the premiership in the Diet election for 
the post. 
  Kono said he told Watanabe, "I will take the responsibility 
as the president of the LDP." 
  A majority of LDP legislators have voiced their support for 
Kono's bid to run for the nation's stewardship, party sources 
said. 
  Watanabe said, however, he told Kono he also intends to run 
in the parliamentary vote for a new prime minister. 
  No date has yet been set for the vote to pick a successor to 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his 
resignation on April 8. 
  Watanabe also expressed his intention to change the nature 
of 
the current coalition, telling Kono, "I will become the 
torchbearer who will drive a wedge into the governing 
coalition's structure by advocating the LDP's policies." 
  The remark apparently reflects Watanabe's long-time 
criticism 
of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the 
ruling coalition, which he has repeatedly blasted as "distorting 
the policies of the coalition." 
  LDP sources said Kono and Watanabe agreed to resume 
discussion next Monday in an attempt to reconcile their 
differences over Watanabe's possible defection and his avowed 
bid to seek the prime ministership, while monitoring whether the 
coalition parties are able to narrow their gulf over the 
succession issue. 
  LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori later told a news 
conference that Watanabe gave no indication of his possible 
breakaway from the LDP in the talks. 
  "The point is that Mr. Watanabe and LDP president Kono 
shared 
serious perceptions of the current political situation," Mori 
said. 
  During the meeting, Mori said, Watanabe told Kono that he 
wants to join hands with those whose basic policies are close to 
his own as long as the LDP is in opposition and cannot directly 
take part in the management of national politics. 
  "That's what I call a 'moderately conservative' political 
setup," Mori quoted Watanabe as saying. 
  Kono retorted, however, that the LDP should take a 
wait-and-see attitude toward the current political development 
following Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits last week. 
  "It is evident the coalition government will suffer a major 
collapse next time around," Kono reportedly told Watanabe. 
  Watanabe and Kono agreed to continue their talks and to hold 
another round as early as Saturday, Mori said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Former Deputy Premier and 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe reiterated a wish Friday to run 
for a prime ministerial election, suggesting forming a new 
political party by breaking away from the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Watanabe told reporters ahead of a meeting with LDP 
President 
Yohei Kono on Friday afternoon that "I am groping for (a way) to 
realize our ideas and principles." 
  But Watanabe did not give a specific answer to a question of 
whether he has already decided to leave the LDP and set up a new 
party, saying, "now is not the time to declare it." 
  Asked when he will make an official announcement of his 
candidacy, Watanabe said, "I have to talk with my party's 
colleagues before speaking out on a final decision." 
  Kono is to meet with Watanabe in a last-ditch effort to 
settle on a sole LDP candidate for the prime ministerial 
election. 
  Political sources said Watanabe's remarks suggest he will 
reject Kono's request for giving up his candidacy, which may 
lead to a breakup of the LDP. 
  Although ousted from its 38-year grip on power last August 
by 
the coalition government led by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the LDP remains the largest force in the Diet. 
  Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, once a mentor of 
Watanabe as the former head of his faction, denied the 
possibility of Watanabe forming a new political party, saying 
that such a move "is not imminent."

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 14 KYODO -- Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, the favorite to become next prime 
minister, suggested Thursday [14 April] the ruling coalition 
could forge ties with Michio Watanabe if the former foreign 
minister leaves the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "There are no differences (with Watanabe) on major issues," 
Hata told reporters late Thursday night in Marrakech, Morocco 
where he is attending a ministerial meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], cited 
Watanabe's resignation from the main opposition LDP and a pledge 
to pursue political reforms as preconditions for cooperation 
with the ruling seven-party coalition. 
  "There is room for negotiation on many points," Hata said. 
"I do not think Mr. Watanabe will oppose the reform path."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Five House of 
Representatives members of the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) bolted the party and another five members 
plan to quit the party, LDP sources said Friday. 
  The move came amid reports that former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe has decided to break away from the LDP, launch a 
new party and vie to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  Michihiko Kano, Masahiko Kitagawa, Goji Sakamoto, Takao Sato 
and Teruhiko Mashiko, members of a faction led by former Trade 
Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, submitted letters of resignation to 
the LDP leadership, party officials said. 
  Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Koji Kakizawa, Taku Yamamoto and 
Shizuo Sato also plan to quit the party, the party sources said. 
  Earlier in the day LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a 
news conference the LDP should maintain unity over the choice of 
its candidate for the premiership. 
  "In any event, the best way for our party to return to power 
is to pull together and remain united," Mori said. 
  Mori said he will closely monitor a meeting between LDP 
President Yohei Kono and Watanabe on Friday afternoon. 
  Kono is expected to ask Watanabe not to run for the 
premiership in order to avoid a major split of the LDP. 
  Kano told reporters his group will form a new party aimed at 
bringing about a realignment of political parties. Kano's group 
is expected to team up with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a 
key party in the coalition. Ota and four others are members of 
a suprafaction policy study group called "liberals," which has 
urged Watanabe to run for the premiership.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the largest component in the governing coalition, 
will demand setting approval from all the coalition parties if a 
new party will take part in the eight-month-old coalition, SDP 
officials said Friday [15 April]. 
  At a hastily set meeting of the Central Executive Committee, 
the party's leadership body, the SDP decided to ask other 
coalition partners to attach the condition to participation of a 
new party, the officials said. 
  The SDP's move is apparently intended to block a group led 
by 
Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 
joining the coalition. 
  Watanabe, who served as deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister under then Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa of the LDP, which fell from power last August following 
failure to seize a majority in last July's general election for 
the House of Representatives. 
  Watanabe is widely reported set to leave the LDP and form a 
new party in an attempt to pursue ambitions to succeed outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation 
on April 8. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of the 
coalition's 
core party Shinseito, is currently considered the most likely 
replacement to Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP) 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), two of the seven 
parties in the ruling coalition, will form a joint policy study 
group as early as the end of this month, party sources said 
Friday [15 April]. 
  At the beginning of next week, Muneaki Samejima, deputy 
secretary general of the JNP, and Kansei Nakano, the DSP's 
policy board chairman, will begin preparing for the forum to 
study policies to achieve a better quality of life for Japanese 
people, they said. 
  The alliance will take over a suspended JNP plan to ask 
other 
coalition parties to join "Kaikaku (Reform)," the JNP's 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, the sources 
said. 
  The launching of the group, however, means that the DSP will 
join the reform in the future, they said. 
  The JNP, led by outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
disbanded a parliamentary alliance with new party Sakigake 
(Harbinger) led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
shortly after he announced his resignation on April 8. 
  It then formed the reform with two United Social Democratic 
Party members including Science and Technology Agency chief 
Satsuki Eda and began urging other ruling parties' members to 
join. 
  But the JNP suspended its campaign as ruling parties fell 
into deeper disagreement over selection of Hosokawa's successor. 
  Another reason for the suspension was that some JNP members 
objected to allying with Shinseito and Komeito -- two powerful 
forces in the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling 
coalition's chief strategist, said Friday [15 April] that it is 
much more important to form a stable government than to enact 
the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 that started April 1. 
  At a news conference, Ozawa said, "there are opinions urging 
enactment of the budget but it is much more important to 
establish a stable political structure through necessary 
discussions." 
  Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], has urged other coalition 
components to cement agreement on such key issues as tax reform 
and the stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear program 
before picking a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
who on April 8 said he will step down. 
  Meanwhile, Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member, said 
Friday that agreement on tax reform is the minimum requirement 
for policy discussions that start Saturday among deputy heads of 
coalition parties. 
  Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the establishment of 
the party's chapter in Ustunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, Funada 
also said that Shinseito will play a key role in selecting a 
successor to Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japan's top economic 
planning bureaucrat Friday [15 April] defended the government's 
forecast of an economic recovery to 2.4 percent growth this 
fiscal year. 
  Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning 
Agency 
(EPA), told a Tokyo audience he personally agrees with the 
agency's forecast for the year that began this month. 
  But he said the EPA has not ruled that the economy has hit 
bottom, which Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan 
governor Yasushi Mieno indicated Thursday may be nearing. 
  Noting that the official forecast is more bullish than that 
of most private economists, Tanaka suggested that they "tend to 
underestimate the strength of business recovery" in reversing 
from the nation's worst postwar slump. 
  He also noted that some economists have recently raised 
their 
forecasts to 1.4 percent growth for the fiscal year. They 
previously had predicted about 0.5 percent growth on average. 
  "The overall economy is still sluggish," he said but added 
that signs of "brightness" have recently spread beyond personal 
consumption, the biggest single engine for economic growth that 
has rebounded since late last year. 
  Households have nearly finished adjusting to "excessive" 
purchasing of consumer durables in the late 1980s boom, and 
consumer sentiment will continue to improve in coming months, 
Tanaka said. 
  On another major component for recovery, Tanaka acknowledged 
that the agency's forecast of roughly flat fiscal 1994 corporate 
capital spending "contrasts very sharply with private 
forecasts," which show a third straight year of decline. 
  Tanaka said there are "signs of bottoming out" in machinery 
orders, which anticipate movements in capital spending. That 
trend is not clear yet, he said, adding that a fixed investment 
turnaround is necessary for economic recovery. 
  He cited concern over employment, but said the worst fears 
for job security are over. Conditions will worsen a bit further 
before recovering, he said, but predicted little chance of 
another "major adjustment process." 
  Another area of uncertainty is foreign exchange, with 
companies needing the yen to fall to around 117 to the dollar to 
"feel comfortable" about their profits, Tanaka said. The dollar 
closed Friday in Tokyo at 103.95 yen, up 0.95 yen from the 
previous day. 
  If the yen stays high, boosting prices of Japanese exports 
in 
other currencies and crimping the yen value of repatriated 
profits, "the impact of that on the economy will not be 
negligible," Tanaka said. 
  But he played down concerns that the delays in passing the 
fiscal 1994 budget, due to the nation's political turmoil, could 
harm the economy. 
  Citing a backlog of investment to be executed from the 
current provisional budget and the third supplementary budget 
for fiscal 1993, he said, "There will be a smooth continuation 
of the budget investment programs despite the fact that the 
budget process is delayed." 
  Tanaka also predicted no significant inflationary impact 
from 
much-criticized hikes in public fees.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The number of corporate 
bankruptcies in Japan fell 2.9 percent in fiscal 1993 for the 
first dip in four years, despite staying above 14,000 for the 
second straight year, a private credit research agency reported 
Friday [15 April]. 
  Corporate failures with liabilities of 10 million yen or 
more 
numbered 14,019 in the year ended March 31, while liabilities 
left by the bankrupt firms slid 10.7 percent to 6.65 trillion 
yen for the second consecutive yearly fall, Teikoku Databank 
said. 
  The amount of liabilities was the third largest on record, 
it 
said. The record for liabilities was 7.77 trillion yen in 
fiscal 1991 when the economy was hard hit by a stronger yen. 
  Despite the overall decline in business failures, the number 
of recession-induced bankruptcies or those going bankrupt due to 
poor sales climbed 14.6 percent to 8,645, signaling that the 
economic slump still drags on, the agency said. 
  This type of bankruptcy accounted for 61.7 percent of total 
failures, up 9.5 percentage points from the previous year, it 
said. 
  Corporate failures were at high levels throughout the entire 
year with over 1,000 failures reported each month, during the 
worst economic slump in decades. 
  The findings come at a time when the economy is showing 
brighter signs in some sectors and as Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno has declared the worst is over. 
  But Teikoku Databank said Japan is still mired in the 
prolonged economic slowdown despite signs of recovery in some 
sectors, and noted that a full-fledged recovery is not expected 
until 1995, judging from such negative factors as the strong yen 
and an increase in long-term interest rates. 
  In March, corporate failures fell 4.3 percent from a year 
earlier to 1,282 cases with liabilities shrinking 40.2 percent 
to 463.62 billion yen, the agency said. 
  March was the second consecutive month in which business 
failures fell from the year-earlier level, but it was the first 
time in three months they have risen above 1,200, it said. 
  In the latest reporting month, the number of 
recession-induced failures dropped 5.8 percent from a year 
earlier, but their share of total bankruptcies exceeded 60 
percent for the eighth month in a row. 
  Such bankruptcies totaled 789 cases, compared with 838 cases 
a year earlier.
