<F P=106> [Report by Kim Chin-su from Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu announced that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] set the deadline for 
North Korea's acceptance of additional nuclear inspections at 
mid-May and that just in case North Korea exceeds the deadline, 
the IAEA will soon report to the UN Security Council. 
  Foreign Minister Han, who is in Belgium, said: Although many 
experts believe North Korea will accept the additional nuclear 
inspections in late April, in early May, or in mid-May, the IAEA 
has set the deadline for North Korea's acceptance at around 
mid-May. 
  Foreign Minister Han said: The IAEA has not set a definite 
date in mid-May as its deadline for North Korea to accept the 
additional inspections, but it will report to the UN Security 
Council when it is believed North Korea has exceeded the 
deadline. As a result, the North Korean nuclear issue will 
again be handled by the UN Security Council, as was the case in 
the UN Security Council presidential statement.

  [Text] Washington, April 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea 
reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at 
Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) has no right to inspect them. 
  "About the two military sites, there was no inspection 
allowed. It's not within the authority of the IAEA to inspect 
military sites," said Maj. Gen. Kim Yong-chol of the North 
Korean People's Army in an interview with America's Cable News 
Network (CNN). 
  In a dispatch from Pyongyang, CNN identified Gen. Kim simply 
as a senior military official. The taped interview was aired in 
the United States Monday night. 
  CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican 
president who was visiting Pyongyang, presumably for North 
Korean President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday last Friday. 
  Gen. Kim reiterated the North Korean position when CNN's 
Beijing correspondent, Mike Chinoy, asked why the Stalinist 
state refuses to let the IAEA inspect its facilities at the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex if it has no intention, capability or 
desire to develop nuclear weapons. 
  "Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt 
with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament 
between the two sides," Kim said. "The authority the IAEA was 
given is to inspect peaceful nuclear facilities." 
  Asked if North Korea cooperates militarily with countries 
like Iran, Syria or Libya, Kim said, "that is a question which 
is directly related to the distortions and the bad rumors about 
our country which are all fabricated, made up, by the West." 
  North Korea, as an independent state, has a right to 
maintain 
multilateral relations including military cooperation with other 
countries. 
  "There is no limited scope in the cooperation," Kim said. 
"If 
it suits our interests, we do it. If it doesn't, we don't do 
it."

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will not take the 
initiative in resuming the suspended inter-Korean dialogue as it 
has already dropped its demand for an envoy exchange as a 
precondition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with 
Washington. 
  But if Pyongyang changes its mind and embraces inter-Korean 
dialogue during its talks with Washington, Seoul will come to 
the bargaining table with Pyongyang on condition that the 
meeting should first discuss North Korea's nuclear program. 
  A government official said over the weekend that because the 
South announced it would no longer seek to exchange special 
presidential envoys with the North, Seoul would not be the first 
to offer to resume the suspended dialogue with Pyongyang unless 
the latter showed a change in attitude. 
  If there is firm evidence of a change in the North's 
inter-Korean dialogue policy, the government will seek to resume 
the talks on the principle of keeping open the dialogue channel 
at all times, he added. 
  If the dialogue resumes, the agenda will focus on mutual 
nuclear inspections between South and North Korea under the 
declaration of denuclearization of the peninsula, with the 
government seeking high-level talks or a joint nuclear control 
commission meeting, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Russia hopes to handle 
resettlement of North Korean loggers in Siberia without 
intervention by an international organization, Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said Friday. 
  Radio Moscow quoted him as saying that his country will be 
strict with human rights protection requirements in renewing the 
logging contract with North Korea. 
  Moscow should consider applying Russia's domestic laws on 
all 
people living on Russian soil, and their human rights have to be 
guaranteed at maximum level, Kozyrev said according to Radio 
Moscow. 
  But he indicated his country was against intervention by a 
third party, saying Moscow plans to resolve the issue without 
participation by international organizations. 
  The Seoul Government announced Friday it will accept all 
North Korean loggers who wish to settle in South Korea. Some 
100 North Koreans, virtually trapped inside logging camps in 
Siberia where escapees tell of rampant beating and near 
starvation, have asked to be sent to Seoul. 
  Seoul officials said they want to refer to the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in arranging their 
resettlement. 
  The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to 
expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still 
negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded human rights condition 
improvement inside the camps. 
  Next negotiation is expected in Moscow within first half of 
this year.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- More than 100 North 
Korean loggers in Russia will be brought to South Korea, 
presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Saturday [16 April]. 
  Chu made the announcement one day after Seoul said it had 
decided to accept all escapees from North Korean logging camps 
in Siberia wishing to settle in South Korea. 
  "As a result, the government will bring to South Korea more 
than 100 North Korean loggers who have applied for settlement in 
South Korea at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow," Chu said. 
  Chu also said the government expects more escapees from 
North 
Korean logging camps to seek refuge in the South "since we have 
decided to accept them." 
  "Even in that situation, the government will accept all 
North 
Korean loggers with the exception of those with serious 
problems," he said. 
  Chu clarified that "those with serious problems" include 
criminals such as "infamous offenders." 
  The Seoul government understands, however, that most of the 
"infamous" offenders committed "crimes" because they were hungry 
and tried to steal food, he said. 
  The South Korean Embassy in Moscow has conducted an initial 
screening of the North Korean loggers seeking refuge in the 
South and found almost no "infamous offenders," Chu said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
negotiate directly with North Korea if Pyongyang makes an issue 
out of Seoul's decision to resettle fleeing North Korean loggers 
in the South. 
  A senior government official said Sunday there was a strong 
possibility that North Korea would officially broach Seoul's 
decision last week to give North Korean loggers refuge in the 
South. 
  "In that case, the government plans to push direct 
negotiations with North Korea on this problem," he said. 
  An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to have escaped from 
Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, many of whom are hiding 
in various parts of Russia to elude North Korean agents while 
seeking refuge in South Korea. 
  The official, who declined to be identified, noted that when 
many East Germans tried to escape to West Germany, the Bonn 
government solved the problem by negotiating directly with East 
Germany. 
  The government will cooperate with Russia and the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the process of 
settling the North Korean loggers in the South, he said. 
  But there is a possibility that North Korea, insisting the 
loggers are "criminals," will demand their repatriation. The 
government has decided to prepare for this eventuality by 
checking the background of all North Korean loggers applying for 
refuge in the South, he said. 
  In addition, the government will introduce a procedure 
allowing the UNHCR to confirm whether the loggers indeed want to 
leave their country or settle in nations other than South Korea, 
in order to prevent Pyongyang from leveling charges of 
kidnapping against Seoul, the official said.

  [Text] The North Korean side sent a telephone message to 
our side on 19 April demanding the repatriation of Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan, who have not converted from communism over a long 
period of time. 
  Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the 
North Korean Red Cross Society, North Korea sent a telephone 
message to Kang Yong-hun, chairman of the ROK National Red 
Cross, on 19 April, pointing out that for the South side to 
reject the North side's demand to repatriate the two men, which 
has happened on two occasions, runs counter to the humanitarian 
ideology of the Red Cross. 
  Today's message by North Korea is being interpreted as a 
countermeasure to the fact that the South side has started to 
show interest in the North Korean humanitarian issue, such as 
the South Korean Government's decision to allow North Korean 
loggers who escaped from logging camps in Russia to defect to 
South Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Pak Tae-sok from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Diplomatic sources in Beijing have stated that last 
week North Korean President Kim Il-song expressed the wish to 
visit the United States. This is a sign of an important change 
indicating that North Korea would no longer use the nuclear 
program as a nuclear card and that it would concentrate 
diplomatic efforts on resolving its economic problems. 
  The diplomatic sources said that the current North Korean 
economic situation is more serious than the nuclear issue, and 
that North Korea would therefore accept, in any form, the 
comprehensive nuclear inspections [kwangbomwihan haeksachal] 
required by the international community during next month in 
accordance with the statement issued by president of the UN 
Security Council. 
  They also said that China and North Korea had held meetings 
-- official or unofficial -- in New York, Beijing, and Vienna 
regarding the nuclear issue and that they had in-depth 
discussions to discuss North Korea's economic opening after the 
settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  They predict that Kim Il-song will visit Beijing soon 
because 
the North Korean leadership, including Kim Il-song, actively 
supported China's economic opening during the successive visits 
to Pyongyang by members of the Political Bureau of the CPC and 
envoys of China's Liberation Army since July last year, and 
because Kim Il-song stressed trade development in his New Year's 
address.

  [Text] A Beijing-based source said that North Korea had 
sent a special task force to Beijing during President Kim 
Yong-sam's visit to China. The task force was made up of 
responsible North Korean high-level working officials from 
various sectors -- such as politics, international affairs, and 
economics -- and arrived in Beijing two days before President 
Kim Yong-sam's visit and collected information regarding the 
contents of the ROK-PRC talks, including the summit talks 
between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin, and the future 
development of their talks. 
  The source stated that through the task force, in 
particular, 
North Korea prudently focused on China's position regarding the 
nuclear issue and observed how the ROK-PRC talks could affect 
the United States or the United Nations.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- The government on 
Saturday carried out a regular reshuffle of senior Army and Air 
Force officers featuring the appointment of Lt. Gen. Chang Song, 
superintendent of the military academy, as commander of the 
Korea-U.S. Combined Forces [CFC]. 
  Chang, who will get his fourth star upon assuming his new 
post, succeeds Gen. Kim Chae-chang as CFC commander. 
  Kim and five lt. and maj. generals were relieved of their 
duties apparently for their past affiliation with Hana-hoe, a 
private Army organization whose members monopolized key military 
posts under the regimes of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. 
  The five sacked Hana-hoe generals included Pyo Sun-pae and 
Kim Kil-pu, both corps commanders. 
  The shake-up also resulted in Maj. Gen. Yu Chong-kap, head 
of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collection and security department, 
being named as director of the Defense Ministry Intelligence 
Agency and Lt. Gen. Choe Tong-hwan, vice Air Force chief of 
staff, as director of strategy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
  Those named to take over the duties of the dismissed corps 
commanders were Maj. Gen. Kwak Tong-to, Army deputy chief of 
staff for personnel, and Maj. Gen. Kim sok-won, Army deputy 
chief of staff for operations. 
  In another step, Maj. Gens. Kim Hyon-su and Kil Yong-chol, 
both division commanders who were former Hana-hoe members, were 
relieved of their duties while another Hana-hoe general, Brig. 
Gen. Min Pyong-kuk, a deputy corps commander, was somehow 
promoted to maj. general and named as a division commander. 
  It has been learned that Gen. Kim Chae-chang and seven 
Hana-hoe lieutenant generals relieved of their duties Saturday 
will be placed on reserve status soon.

decided Tuesday to scrap the regulation restricting an 
individual's foreign currency holdings to 10,000 U.S. dollars 
beginning June 1, setting no possession limit. 
  The Ministry, however, called on those who have over 50,000 
dollars to report to the authorities, citing the need to have 
correct information on the country's foreign currency reserves 
for effective implementation of economic policies. 
  In another effort to internationalize the nation's economy, 
the Ministry allowed businesses to use Korean won equivalent up 
to 300,000 dollars, compared to the present limit of 100,000 
dollars, in settling import, export and reinsurance accounts. 
  The Ministry also allowed businesses to spend Korean won in 
settling freight and insurance accounts incurred through the 
export and import of goods.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 18 (KPL) -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed on April 16 arrived 
here on a three-day official visit to the Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] at the invitation of Lao Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon. 
  The visit was in response to the December 1992 visit of the 
Lao prime minister to Malaysia, where three agreements were 
signed between the two governments concerning investment 
promotion and protection, economic, scientific and technical 
cooperation and air transportation. 
  During the visit, the Malaysian prime minister called on Lao 
President Nouhak Phoumsavan and met with Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon. 
  Talking with the Malaysian prime minister, President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan said this visit was very significant in the history 
of the Lao-Malaysian relations. He expressed hope that the 
bilateral relations would further develop fruitfully in many 
areas. In response, the Malaysian prime minister expressed 
pleasure over a warm hospitality the Lao Government and people 
gave to him and his party. He voiced support to the open-door 
policy of the Lao Government on economic relations and 
cooperation with foreign countries, and confirmed that he would 
do all he could to develop the friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in his discussion with 
his Malaysian counterpart also said that the visit was historic. 
He considered it as implementing the three agreements signed 
between the two governments in 1992. 
  On the same day afternoon, talks were held between the 
government delegations of the two countries headed by their 
respective prime ministers. At the talks, both sides discussed 
a wide range of issues concerning their bilateral cooperation, 
both public and private, in various fields. 
  The two prime ministers then witnessed the signing of an 
agreement on banking settlement between the governors of the 
central banks of the two countries. 
  In the evening, Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon hosted a 
banquet in honour of his Malaysian counterpart. 
  The Malaysian prime minister was officially welcomed at the 
airport by Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon together with 
Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and other members of the Lao Government 
officials. This three-day visit was the first ever made to the 
country by the Malaysian prime minister following the Lao prime 
minister's visit to Malaysia in December 1992. 
  The Malaysian delegation was accompanied by several 
important 
figures in the business circle of Malaysia.

  [Text] At 1930 yesterday, His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai 
Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR], and his wife arranged a dinner at the National 
Assembly Hall in Vientiane capital in honor of H.E. Dr. Mahathir 
bin Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia, his wife, and the 
high-level Malaysian delegation, which is currently on an 
official, friendly visit to the LPDR. Attending the banquet on 
the Lao side were H.E. Phao Bounnaphon, minister attached to the 
Prime Minister's Office; H.E. Somsavat Lengsavat, minister of 
foreign affairs; H.E. Osakan Thammatheva, minister of 
information and culture; and H.E. Boun-gnang Volachit, governor 
of Vientiane Municipality; along with deputy ministers, members 
of the National Assembly, and many high- ranking cadres. 
Attending on the Malaysian side were H.E. Datuk Abdullah bin 
Haji Ahmad Badawi, minister of foreign affairs, and H.E. Dr.Lim 
Keng Yaik, minister of primary industries, along with some 25 
high-ranking officials and businessmen. 
  During the banquet, which proceeded in an atmosphere of 
friendship and mutual understanding between Laos and Malaysia, 
H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon delivered a speech 
welcoming the visit to Laos by the high-level delegation of the 
Malaysian Government. He said: [Begin Khamtai Siphandon 
recording] We are very pleased to welcome your excellency and 
wife in the land of the LPDR at a time when our Lao nation is 
celebrating the traditional new year. First of all, I would 
like to wholeheartedly salute and welcome the first official, 
friendly visit to the LPDR by H.E. Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir 
bin Mohamed and his wife. We highly value this visit by your 
excellency, a visit which has brought to the Lao people profound 
friendship and intimate affection from the Malaysian people. 
This visit is considered a very significant event in the 
history of the good relations and cooperation between our two 
countries. 
  Your respected Excellency the Prime Minister, I had an 
opportunity to lead a delegation of the LPDR to visit your 
beautiful country [words indistinct]. Though time has passed, 
the impression of the visit still remains in our memories. We 
are elated to note that the relations and cooperation between 
our two countries, as close friends, have been fruitfully 
developed in many fields, thus bringing about concrete benefits 
for our two peoples. We are convinced that with the results of 
the talks between our two delegations, as well as with the visit 
by your excellency on this occasion, the relations and 
cooperation between our two countries in various spheres, both 
in the state and private sectors, will be further and ever more 
vigorously expanded. The LPDR is elated at the great success 
won by Malaysia in the economic field, and highly appraises the 
ever increasing role of Malaysia in the region as well as its 
significant contribution to solving various international 
problems. 
  I would like to take this occasion to wish the Malaysian 
people glorious and ever greater success on the path of the 
farsighted policy of your excellency's government. 
  Your Excellency, distinguished guests, at present, we are 
concentrating all the potentials of the country and trying to 
gain assistance and cooperation from foreign countries on 
exploiting our natural resources, which are regarded as our main 
strength -- the agro-forestry branch, which is related to the 
processing industry, hydroelectric power, and the mining 
industry, being one example. Simultaneously, we have striven to 
build and expand the infrastructure while developing human 
resources with a view to increasing the average rate of economic 
growth of the nation for the period from now to the year 2000 
[words indistinct]. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR will 
continue to promote and expand domestic potentials, securely 
maintain political and social stability, and promote the 
building of a market-oriented economy. At the same time, the 
LPDR will broaden relations and cooperation with various 
countries, first and foremost with neighboring countries. We 
hope that more businessmen from Malaysia and other friendly 
countries will invest in our Lao country to contribute toward 
freeing the Lao people from a state of underdevelopment and 
bringing about peace, (?stability), friendship, and cooperation 
in this region. 
  On this auspicious occasion, I would like to convey to His 
Majesty the Paramount Ruler of Malaysia my best wishes for his 
happiness and long life. I wish H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
president of the LPDR, good health. I wish H.E. Mahathir bin 
Mohamed and his wife good health. I wish all the distinguished 
guests here good health. May the friendship and cooperation 
between Laos and Malaysia be increasingly strengthened and 
fruitfully developed! [end recording] 
  Afterwards, H.E. Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime minister of 
Mlaysia, delivered a speech of reply. He said: We are very 
pleased to visit Laos amid the the Lao people's traditional new 
year festival celebrations. On this traditional new year 
occasion, we wish H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and wife, together with 
the government and people of Laos, great success and good 
health. We are touched by the friendly welcome accorded us by 
the Lao people. Though our visit is short, it will be forever 
engraved on our hearts. 
  On the occasion of your excellency's visit to our country in 
December 1992, we had an opportunity to exchange views on many 
issues. In fact, our friendly relations have been promoted and 
developed since then. Our friendship has also been increasingly 
consolidated and promoted to the extent that we believe it 
should noe be expanded in the area of cooperation. For this 
reason, I have accepted the invitation of your excellency and 
the Lao Government to pay the official visit to Laos. 
  Your excellency, though this is my first visit to Laos, it 
is 
considered a very significant event as it is the first visit by 
the Malaysian prime minister to this country. Our delegation 
comprises senior ministers, high-ranking officials, and 
personages from our business circles. I hope that these 
personages will gain a better understand of the Lao situation so 
that mutual understanding between our two nations can be 
promoted. We witnessed the signing of an agreement between the 
two central banks on the payment issue, an agreement which is 
considered an important document serving as a basis for the 
promotion and expansion of the friendly relations and the 
exchange of goods and trade between our two countries. Our 
Malaysian companies and businessmen, being confident in the fine 
line and policy of the Lao Government, intend to invest and run 
businesses in Laos. We -- Malaysia and Laos -- have the same 
intention of promoting and expanding relations and cooperation 
with each other. As for Malaysia, we stick firmly to the policy 
of promoting and expanding south-south cooperation. We maintain 
that the building of a prosperous and civilized Laos will result 
in building a prosperous and developed Southeast Asia region, 
and that with a developed Southeast Asia, stability can be 
maintained in the region. Our two countries maintain similar 
tasks and responsibilities, namely, the promotion and 
establishment of peace and stability. We have agreed with each 
other that it is necessary for us to continue to positively 
carry out our roles and responsibilities in order to [words 
indistinct] and turn the entire region into a prosperous region 
so as to guarantee the achievement of stability. 
  I would like to toast the good health, prosperity, and 
happiness of H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and his wife; the good 
health of H.E. the President of the LPDR; and the success of the 
Lao people.

  [Text] [Iraqi] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, 
President Saddam Husayn's envoy to Indonesian President Suharto, 
met in Jakarta today with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas. Al- Sahhaf briefed his Indonesian counterpart on the 
status of the relations between Iraq and the United Nations 
regarding the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, 
especially Resolution 687. He stressed that a clear majority 
has emerged at the UN Security Council calling for dealing with 
Iraq in light of the implementation of the resolutions. This is 
in order to set a clear timetable for closing the file of Part C 
of Resolution 687, which would mean that the UN Security Council 
should immediately start implementation of Paragraph 22 of the 
resolution, allowing Iraq to export its products abroad. 
  The foreign minister also briefed the Indonesian side on the 
recent National Assembly speaker's statement on Iraq's readiness 
to receive a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation. 
  Ali Alatas expressed understanding of Iraq's position. The 
two sides discussed bilateral cooperation and coordination 
within the Nonaligned Movement. They also discussed ways of 
bolstering bilateral relations in the interest of both countries.

  [Text] In his capacity as chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement and president of the Republic of Indonesia, President 
Suharto has promised to work for the lifting of UN economic 
sanctions against Iraq. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this 
to reporters after he accompanied his Iraqi counterpart Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf who paid a courtesy call on the president at Jakarta's 
Bina Graha presidential office this morning. 
  The Iraqi minister, who held hour-long talks with the 
president, conveyed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's oral message 
on efforts to lift economic sanctions as stipulated in Clause C 
of the UN Resolution No. 687, which Iraq believes it has fully 
conformed to. Iraq hopes the four-year-old sanctions will be 
lifted soon because it has caused severe hardship to its people. 
The Iraqi minister said his country's infant mortality rate has 
increased (?sevenfold) against that before the war, while the 
mortality rate for children over five years old is four times 
higher. As a result of severe economic sanctions, about 150,000 
children have died due to malnutrition and even hunger. 
  During talks between President Suharto and the Iraqi foreign 
minister, various steps have been agreed on in approaching the 
United Nations through the Nonaligned Movement's Coordinating 
Bureau at the UN headquarters and urging the UN Security Council 
to review the sanctions and conduct an objective study aimed at 
lifting the four-year-old sanctions. In this connection, Iraq 
also called for solidarity and support of all Nonaligned 
Movement members.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, 6 Apr -- Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of 
the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Indonesia 
should not consider the people's Republic of China (PRC) as a 
competitor in the fields of trade and investment. This is 
because the two countries can play an equally important role in 
supporting economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Aburizal Bakrie was speaking to newsmen during a break in a 
seminar on Trade and Investment Relations between Indonesia and 
China held in Jakarta on 5 April. 
  He said that it is impossible for the Asia-pacific economy 
to 
grow without higher economic growth in Indonesia and China, the 
two most populous countries in the region. Therefore, if the two 
countries are competing with each other, let it be a healthy 
competition that is mutually complementary. [Passage omitted] 
  In his written message to the seminar, Minister of Trade 
Satrio Budiarjo Judono, expressed the hope that traders from 
Indonesia and PRC would forge closer cooperation and take 
advantage of the vast opportunities available in the two 
countries. 
  He said that Indonesian businessmen should increase their 
volume of exports to the PRC. In 1993, the value of Indonesia's 
exports to the PRC totaled $1.249 billion. The receipt from oil 
and gas exports was US$554.3 million, along with US$ 695.2 
million from exports of nonoil and nongas commodities. 
  Continuing, he said Indonesia's imports from PRC in the same 
period totaled US$936 million, and this included imports of oil 
and gas, which stood at US$39.5 million; while imports of nonoil 
and nongas commodities stood at US$896.5 million. 
  Indonesia's major import from PRC was textiles fiber, which 
reached US$92.9 million; while Indonesia's main export to PRC 
was plywood, which totaled US$481.05 million. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Altas said that Indonesia is 
worried about the indecisive attitude shown by the United 
Nations and NATO toward the Serbs in Gorazde, Bosnia. He said 
that the United Nations had declared Gorazde a safe haven and 
that no party could interfere there. Therefore, according to 
the resolution, the United Nations and NATO should take firm 
action against the Serbs for violating the United Nations 
resolution several times. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that the Foreign Affairs 
Department is continuously monitoring the situation in Gorazde 
and is making efforts to seek the release of five Indonesian 
military observers taken hostage by the Serbs. He said the 
worrying situation in Bosnia does not change Indonesia's wish to 
send health officials or other military observers to Bosnia.

  [Text] The North Sumatera regional chapter of the 
Coordinating Agency for the Strengthening of National Stability 
will take stern action against workers who stage protest 
demonstrations within its jurisdiction. Major General Pranowo, 
commander of the Bukit Barisan Regional Military Command, said 
this to reporters in Medan today after tens of thousands of 
workers yesterday staged violent demonstrations, during which 
they destroyed dozens of houses, four cars, and one motorcycle. 
  He said the authorities will not tolerate any protest 
rallies 
staged by workers in the future because such rallies will lead 
to destructive actions. Besides, the workers' demands no longer 
represent the true wishes of the workers themselves due to the 
interference of irresponsible elements which may undermine 
national unity and stability. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in a Jakarta datelined item at 1201 GMT adds 
the following: "Indonesian security authorities in North 
Sumatera Friday clashed with 40,000 workers demanding better 
conditions and arrested at least six of the demonstrators, a 
lawyer said. 
  "The demonstration occurred on the outskirts of the North 
Sumateran city of Medan, and the number of participants was 
double that who protested on Thursday, said Hasbi Ansori, an 
attorney with the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute (LBH). 
  "Ansori, who was at the demonstration, said security forces 
attempted to break up some 40,000 workers from around 40 
factories in an industrial area north of the city. 
  "But an officer at the North Sumatera Police said the 
demonstration involved only 10,000 workers in the three 
industrial zones of Mabar, Pulau Brayan and Gelugur. He said 
the workers had been completely dispersed in the afternoon and 
that 70 people were under questioning. 
  "As the demonstrators were marching towards the city, Ansori 
said he saw at least six people being hauled away by security 
forces after the rally turned violent. 
  "Security forces began to break up the protest as 
demonstrators threw stones at factories and passing cars. 
  "The officer, who declined to be named, said that police 
forces in the Medan area had been put on 'first alert' Friday, 
but that the status might fall back to 'second alert' Saturday. 
  "North Sumatera military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel 
Marjono 
said on the telephone from Medan that security authorities 'will 
not tolerate (this type of activity) and will take firm action 
against labor protests because they have stepped out of limit.' 
  "Marjono, however, denied that any arrests had been made. 
  "Ansori said shops and offices had closed Friday in Medan, 
the third largest city in Indonesia, for fear of trouble. The 
city's streets were deserted. 
  "He said he believed the workers staged Friday's rally 
because they had failed to obtain a meeting with North Sumatera 
Governor Raja Inal Siregar during their rally Thursday. 
  "'It might become bigger and bigger should the authorities 
ignore their demand,' Ansori said, adding that at least two 
isolated groups of workers were still protesting in the 
industrial area. 
  "The workers urged the government to improve employee 
conditions and grant them the freedom to organize and improve 
wages. They also wanted an investigation into the death of one 
of their fellow workers who died last month in the wake of a 
labor protest. 
  "The battered body of Rusli, a worker of rubber industry PT 
Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he 
had led a workers protest last month. But no investigation into 
his death had been undertaken, Ansori said. 
  "Earlier this month, Indonesia's largest independent trade 
union postponed its planned nationwide strike that had been 
scheduled for early April to protest worker conditions, saying 
that discussions with the government were underway. 
  "The US government has threatened to revoke Indonesia's 600 
million dollars worth of annual trade privileges unless it 
improves worker conditions, and temporarily extended the 
privileges for another six months."]

  [Text] Jakarta, April 18 KYODO -- Labor-related 
demonstrations in north Sumatra have spread from the provincial 
capital to two other cities and turned into violent anti-Chinese 
riots, military and labor sources said Monday [18 April]. 
  The sources said some 10,000 workers held a three-hour 
protest Monday morning in Pematangsiantar, 120 kilometers 
southeast of Medan and 1400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, in 
which seven people were injured. 
  Some reports said there were similar protests in Belawan, 40 
kilometers north of Medan. 
  Sunarti heads the central board of the Indonesian Prosperity 
Trade Union (SBSI), an independent union which has been 
challenging the government's policy of only allowing one trade 
union, the All Indonesian Workers' Union (SPSI). [sentence as 
received] 
  At a news conference Monday, Sunarti said at least 81 people 
have so far been detained by the police, including two 
executives of the SBSI and the wife of a union executive. 
  They were arrested following five days of rioting in Medan, 
during which one ethnic Chinese businessman was killed. 
  The protesters are calling for better working conditions and 
higher wages. They protested the unexplained death of 
22-year-old Rusli, a worker at a Medan-based company, after he 
took part in a labor strike that was only broken up when the 
troops were sent in. 
  Many believe the SBSI is the motivating force behind the 
rally. 
  The protests, however, have turned into violent anti-Chinese 
riots. 
  Police reports said that some angry demonstrators pelted 
shops, factories and vehicles owned by ethnic Chinese. 
  Chinese account for about three percent of the population of 
around 185 million in the mainly Muslim country. They are 
widely resented in Indonesia because of their economic power. 
  In the country, the ethnic Chinese are often the target of 
jealousy because of their economic success. 
  Some anti-Chinese leaflets were distributed among 
demonstrators saying, "Kill Chinese people as colonialists of 
the fundamental rights of indigenous Indonesian people," and 
"Send Chinese people back to China, because Indonesia is not 
their land." 
  Sunarti said, "The pamphlets are not ours. We never 
distributed them. There must be third parties who have been 
using our protest for their own interests." 
  The SBSI, Sunarti added, is only responsible for the protest 
for better working conditions, higher wages and the 
investigation into the death of Rusli, but not for the 
anti-Chinese riots. 
  The situation in Medan is still tense, although Lt. Col. 
Agus 
Ramadan, the district military commander, said the streets were 
quiet and many shops and companies were still closed. 
  Vincent Wijaya, an executive of the north Sumatran branch of 
the Indonesian trade chamber, told reporters that a Malaysian 
company had canceled its plans to buy land within the industrial 
estate after the riots. 
  The Indonesian legal aid foundation said the protests would 
continue if the government fails to improve its labor policy.

  [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 18 (AFP) -- North Sumatra' 
main city of Medan was returning to normal Monday after workers' 
protests in which one businessman died, but anti-ethnic Chinese 
sentiment was still apparent. 
  Most businesses were back in operation and traffic had 
returned to normal but a businessman said "there are still some 
worries" and said that many of his women colleagues and 
employees were still being brought to and from works by male 
relatives. 
  The number of security officials deployed in strategic areas 
in the city, including shopping areas, was increased to 3,000 
from 2,000 Sunday following rumours that students might join the 
protests, a witness said. 
  The witness added that most workers involved in the protests 
had yet to return to work. 
  Pamphlets circulated in private by an organization claiming 
to be "an indigenous group", called on Medan residents to rid 
the city of ethnic Chinese whom they said "destroy Indonesia's 
economy and destroy the moral of officials by among others, 
colluding with officials to get credits." 
  This was a reference to the case of the state-owned Bank 
Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which suffered losses of up to 
613 million dollars after issuing credits without proper 
collaterals and procedures following alleged collusions between 
high-ranking officials and ethnic Chinese businessman Eddy 
Tansil. 
  Labour protests in North Sumatra started Thursday, involving 
tens of thousands of workers who, among other demands, urged the 
government to increase wages and recognize the right of workers 
to organize. At present the government only recognizes the All 
Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI). 
  The protests, which continued Friday on a larger scale, 
degenerated into an anti-Chinese riot and an ethnic Chinese 
factory owner, July Kristanto, was killed as scores of shops and 
factories were vandalized. 
  The Chinese, who make up about one-third of Medan's 1.5 
million population, are widely resented in Indonesia because of 
their economic power. 
  The REPUBLIKA daily Sunday quoted an unidentified 
businessman 
here as saying the riots had forced several ethnic Chinese 
businessmen to flee to Singapore and other countries. 
  Medan District Military Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Agus 
Ramadan, said that four battalions totalling about 2,600 
security personnel had been deployed in the area in anticipation 
of further "anti-ethnic Chinese demonstrations". 
  The military said that about 120 people had been arrested 
for 
alleged involvement in murder, vandalism and arson, but that all 
but 20 had since been released. 
  A Vice-Chairman of the Sejahtera (Prosperous) independent 
labour union (SBSI), Ghufron, said in Jakarta Monday that the 
union had together with eight other non-governmental 
organizations, organized Thursday's demonstration but denied 
inciting the demonstrators to violence. 
  An SBSI official dispatched to Medan on a fact-finding 
mission, reported that several local thugs had admitted to being 
paid by "certain parties" to manipulate the strike by initiating 
vandalism and attacking people," another SBSI Vice-Chairman, 
Sunarti, said. 
  Sunarti declined to elaborate until the fact finding mission 
had been completed. 
  "The workers detained in the wake of the strike should be 
immediately released," Sunarti said, adding that the government 
should also "be capable of arresting and punishing those who 
have consciously manipulated the strike with violence." 
  The union said that 78 people were still detained by police 
in Medan, including the union's local chapter secretary and 
treasurer and the wife of a union secretary. 
  The protest which spread to two nearby provincial towns 
Sunday, were reported to be continuing Monday in one of them, 
Siantar, although on a much smaller scale, an SBSI executive 
said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 18 (ANTARA) -- Chairman of the 
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie 
affirmed that employers in Medan are willing to increase the 
wages of their employees but only if their demands are 
reasonable. 
  The workers' demand for a pay increase to 7,000 rupiah 
(around US$3.33) per day is unreasonable compared to the 
regional minimum wage of only 3,100 rupiah per day (around 
US$1.5), Bakrie told a press conference after a meeting with 
President Suharto at Merdeka Palace [Presidential Palace] Monday. 
  The conflict began in Medan on Thursday when more than 
10,000 
workers went on strike to demand higher wages and holiday bonus 
payments. The demonstration ended in a riot following the death 
of one worker. More than a hundred shops were ransacked and 
dozens of cars were set ablaze. 
  Indonesian police and troops in armoured cars remain on 
alert, guarding Medan's industrial areas, particularly on the 
city's outskirts where most of the rioting took place.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The demonstrations by workers in Medan, North 
Sumatra, that degenerated into ugly riots should serve as a 
lesson to all groups in the country. We all regret 
demonstrations that deteriorate into destruction. The 
uncontrolled demonstrations would have become more serious if 
the security authorities had not acted swiftly to control them. 
  As reported in several newspapers, the workers in Medan and 
the surrounding areas had endured difficulties since March. The 
climax was reached last Friday when tens of thousands of workers 
from several factories in the city held illegal demonstrations 
because they thought they had been improperly treated by their 
employers. 
  Dozens of shophouses in the North Sumatra provincial capital 
were destroyed by rampaging mobs throwing stones and looting 
property. One businessman was even reported to have met a 
tragic death. The stampede spread to other places and was only 
stopped when security authorities interfered. 
  The question now is who should be held responsible for the 
events that degenerated into crime. The answer will certainly 
emerge after authorities complete their thorough investigation. 
Another question is whether there will be a repeat of these 
ugly events in the future. We must also think of those who will 
eventually suffer from the destruction in Medan and the stoppage 
of economic activities, which will certainly have a nationwide 
impact. The conclusion is that the Medan incident is highly 
regretted and we do not want to see a recurrence of the incident. 
  As Asians who have undergone both pleasant and unpleasant 
times since the colonial era, we are good at learning a lesson 
from any unpleasant experience. In this connection, the 
government, businessmen, and workers should work together 
through existing channels and mechanisms. The rule of the game, 
as stipulated in existing labor laws, government regulations, 
ministerial decrees, and other labor regulations, is clear and 
adequate. It now depends on how all sides understand, 
implement, and put them into practice. All sides must admit that 
the ugly incidents in Medan and other towns originated from 
simple demands for an increase in workers' wages, a guarantee of 
welfare services, and proper treatment by employers according to 
existing regulations. 
  What is most important is how the government and businessmen 
respond to such demands. As for workers, they should be 
vigilant against possible interference by a third party wanting 
to fish in troubled waters. A lack of response and delay in 
seeking a solution will only make things more difficult. We do 
not want to see a repeat of the case of Marsinah [woman labor 
activist who was murdered in East Java] or the murder of another 
businessman in Medan. This is especially important at a time 
when we are still under the watchful eyes of foreign countries 
which have placed our labor conditions under spotlight. 
Meanwhile, the swift action by security authorities in coping 
with any emergency anywhere within the country at any time 
deserves our praise.

  [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 19 (AFP) -- Fresh 
anti-Chinese sentiments flared again here Tuesday with thousands 
of people sacking and looting a downtown ethnic Chinese-owned 
commercial mall, witnesses said. 
  Between 1,000 and 2,000 people, armed with machetes, iron 
picks and stones, attacked the Thamrin Plaza in downtown Medan, 
owned by leading local ethnic-Chinese businessman Tanoto 
Sukanto, vandalizing the building and looting the shops, the 
witnesses said. 
  Intervening security forces immediately blocked the downtown 
business area where the mall was located while shops and offices 
in the area were closed again, they added. 
  Lawyer Hasbi Ansori of the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid 
Institute confirmed that the attack took place but said the 
building was not "severely damaged." He could not say how many 
attackers had been involved in the incident. 
  Ansori said the city's downtown business district was now 
completely deserted except for security forces as all businesses 
had closed again. 
  There were no reports of arrests, the witnesses said, and 
the 
regional police and military spokesmen could not be reached for 
comment. 
  Demonstrations on Thursday and Friday here by tens of 
thousands of workers demanding better working conditions 
degenerated into anti-Chinese rioting in which one factory owner 
was killed and many ethnic Chinese properties were vandalized. 
  Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's 
protest, focusing on how ethnic Chinese were accumulating wealth 
to the detriment of other Indonesians, have continued to 
circulate in the city. 
  Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority -- making up about three 
percent of the population -- is widely resented for its hold on 
economic power. 
  Meanwhile, thousands of workers around this northern 
Sumatran 
capital Tuesday refused to return to work for the second day in 
a row. 
  "Today, many of the factories are still closed and the 
workers are still gathering near their factories," said Jansius 
Lumban Tobing, Director of the Medan Industrial Zone north of 
here, adding that some 12,000 workers were believed to have 
taken part in a similar strike the previous day. 
  "They do not want to work but only sit around near their 
factories," Ansori said, adding that a strong security presence 
was now in place in and around the industrial zone and that 
shops had begun to reopen. 
  In Belawan, some 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of here, an 
officer at the local police post, First Sergeant Purba, said 
although some of workers in the area had started to return to 
work, "most were still standing outside the fences of their 
factories... demanding that their detained friends be set free." 
  Medan City Police Chief Colonel Chaerudin was Tuesday quoted 
by the BERITA BUANA daily as saying that as of noon Monday, a 
total of 112 suspects were being detained for questioning. 
  Witnesses said labor protests had Monday spread to Binjai, 
Tanjung [word indistinct], Deli Tua and Belawan -- all towns 
around Medan -- as well as in Pematang Siantar, some 125 
kilometres (77 miles) southwest of here, where about 6,000 
protestors went on the rampage and vandalized nine cars and a 
plastic factory. 
  Pematang Siantar Police Chief Lieutenant Colonel Baroto 
Badrus said the town was now calm. 
  Local military chief, Colonel Sunarto, said security 
authorities were letting workers gather in front of their 
factories "as long as they do not resort to destruction."

  [Text] Semarang, Central Java -- Some 1,500 workers at PT 
[Limited Company] Jati Luhur Agung went on strike yesterday 
demanding a pay raise in compliance with the government's 
regional minimum wage. 
  One of the demonstrators, Sugito, told THE JAKARTA POST that 
the workers had conveyed their demands to the management on 
April 4th but to date had not received any reply. 
  The workers currently received Rp [Rupiah] 2000 a day, far 
below the sanctioned minimum of Rp 2,700 (US$1.27) for labor in 
Central Java. 
  "We will be happy to return to work as soon as they address 
our demands," he said. 
  The workers disbanded without incident from the wood 
floor-panel factory at 2 p.m. [0700 GMT] under the watchful eye 
of the police and armed forces.

  [Text] A meeting on Thai-Cambodian border problems was 
held at the Foreign Ministry today. The attendants were Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri; Interior Minister 
General Chawalit Yongchaiyut; Gen. Charan Kunlawanit, National 
Security Council secretary general; Navy Commander Admiral 
Prachet Siridet; and other officials concerned. 
  Reporting afterwards, the foreign minister said the meeting 
discussed problems along the Thai-Cambodian border and 
retaliatory measures against Cambodia. The Foreign Ministry 
will today send a letter to Cambodian Prime Ministers Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen regarding the Cambodian 
allegations about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter 
will clarify what has occurred and point out that Thailand is 
basically complying with the Paris Agreement. It will confirm 
that Thailand has not supported any particular Cambodian group, 
as well as not having supplied weapons to the Khmer Rouge. 
  The foreign minister said Thailand will not accept further 
Cambodian refugees. The Foreign Ministry will encourage 
Cambodia to promptly establish within one year a safety zone for 
refugees fleeing the fighting. The foreign minister said the 
Thai military will take drastic action to deal with shelling of 
Thai territory by the Khmer Rouge or Cambodian Government forces.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit was 
guarded yesterday in his reaction to Phnom Penh's warning it 
would attack Khmer Rouge tanks found on Thai soil, saying only 
that the military was responsible for safety and security along 
the border. 
  Wimon refused to make any comment about exactly how the Army 
would respond to any possible encroachment on Thai territory by 
Phnom Penh forces. 
  He repeated Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's comment on 
Friday that the allegations by Cambodian leaders that the Khmer 
Rouge was operating from Thai soil were groundless. 
  Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh last 
week alleged Khmer Rouge tanks had fired from inside Thailand at 
Phnom Penh government forces in Pailin. 
  On Thursday the Prince warned that his forces might attack 
the Khmer Rouge tanks even if they were on Thai territory and 
that he was losing patience over what he called Thailand's 
continued failure to crack down on Khmer Rouge forces. 
  "If you say they are not on your territory, please don't 
make 
any protest if we violate your territory. We don't intend to do 
that," he reportedly said. 
  The Khmer Rouge are universally held responsible for the 
deaths of more than one million Cambodians during the Pol Pot 
reign of terror from 1974 to 1979. 
  Wimon on Friday met Foreign Minister Prasong, Interior 
Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, Defence Minister Wichit 
Sukmak and senior military officials to discuss the charges. 
  Meanwhile, Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan insisted 
that 
Thailand has never allowed any foreign troops onto its territory 
and that Prince Norodom's allegation was unfounded and unfair to 
Thailand. 
  He also said the Army has not been involved in Cambodia's 
internal affairs or provided assistance to the Maoist faction 
since the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in August 1991. 
  "Cambodia should think of its relationship with Thailand 
before making accusations of this sort," he said. 
  Phalangkun also said the Army would give an abrupt and harsh 
response if Cambodian forces are found on Thai soil.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop Making Groundless Accusations To Drive a </F>
Wedge between Thailand and Cambodia"] 
  [Text] The abrupt cancellation, on 16 April, of a planned 
visit to Thailand by Cambodia's second prime minister, Hun Sen, 
clearly reflected that the Cambodian leaders really believe, as 
they charged earlier, that Thailand has been helping Khmer Rouge 
forces in operations close to the Thai border by providing them 
with supplies and logistics. They have dismissed Thailand's 
repeated statement that its policy is that of supporting the 
elected Cambodian Government. 
  Although we do not think the Cambodian leaders' charge that 
Thailand, as a "state," supported the Khmer Rouge troops has any 
factual basis, we cannot deny that support has existed at the 
border. Yet, this has been rather mutual help at the people's 
level within the normal range of contacts for border trade and 
visits -- these contacts exist at other points along Thailand's 
borders. 
  We think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian leaders 
does not reflect realities. If this continues, it will only 
worsen relations and aggravate tension between the two 
countries. This is not good for either side, especially 
Cambodia, which is at the stage of national reconstruction. 
Besides, we think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian 
leaders could spoil the talks between the Cambodian leaders and 
the Thai Army commander, who is scheduled to visit Cambodia 
within a few days. 
  The Thai Army is the prime target in the charge made by the 
Cambodian leaders -- a spokesman of the Cambodian Information 
Ministry said that there are bad elements in the Thai Army who 
have supported the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in violation of the 
Thai Government's policy of support for the Cambodian 
Government. The charge was serious; and it was directed against 
the Thai Armed Forces when Cambodian leaders failed to locate 
the sources of fresh munitions and cannon rounds the Khmer Rouge 
have in their possession. 
  During his visit to Cambodia, the Army chief will have to 
answer those charges, and he might well have to put up with a 
few proposals from the Cambodian Government -- they can be about 
nothing other than Thailand's support for Cambodian guerrillas, 
regardless of the fact that the Thai military has completely 
ceased giving support to the Khmer Rouge since the peace 
agreement was signed in Paris by the four Cambodian factions. 
  On behalf of the Thai people, we call on the Cambodian 
Government to stop making groundless accusations. Not only will 
they bring "a chill" in relations between Thailand and Cambodia, 
the accusations will seriously affect national reconstruction in 
Cambodia, badly torn by civil strife. We hope that the story of 
a farmer and the viper, which referred to Cambodian leaders in 
the past, will not have to be retold.

  [Text] ARMY Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday issued a 
veiled threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand 
cannot maintain a good relationship with an "insincere friend", 
referring to repeated complaints from Phnom Penh that Thailand 
is helping Khmer Rouge leaders escape justice. 
  "Between human beings, true friendship is sacred. So it is 
with international relations. Without sincerity, there can be 
no friendship," Gen Wimon said in his strongest denials of Thai 
aid to the Khmer Rouge in a week. 
  Gen Wimon also warned that without Thailand as "a true 
friend", Cambodia would be in trouble. "I doubt whether the 
friendship offered (to Cambodia) by others is as genuine as 
ours," Wimon said. 
  Likening the Cambodia of the recent past to "a person 
without 
clothing, food, or shelter", Gen Wimon said Thailand has 
demonstrated its commitment to its neighbour repeatedly with 
various forms of assistance. 
  "We have given them help despite problems of our own. Now 
that things have improved, the Cambodians have forgotten all we 
have done for them," he said. 
  Wimon interspersed his accusations of ingratitude with 
hinted 
allegations that enemies of Thailand had bribed Cambodian 
leaders to make these accusations. 
  Reiterating Thailand's anti-Khmer Rouge stance, Gen Wimon 
said the army is losing its patience and will not tolerate 
further accusations. 
  Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and 
Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, both of whom maintained 
a good relationship with the Thai military during their struggle 
against the Vietnamese-backed former government in Phnom Penh, 
have stepped up their allegations over the last week. 
  Last Wednesday Ranariddh went so far as to say he would 
order 
Cambodian troops to fire on any Khmer Rouge tanks observed on 
Thai soil. 
  Armed Forces' spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, 
meanwhile, confirmed that the cancellation of Supreme Commander 
Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari's trip to Cambodia was a 
protest over the Cambodian accusations. 
  The decision came on Friday, one day after the Cambodian 
Foreign Ministry informed its Thai counterpart of the 
postponement of Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's trip 
to Thailand, following a closed-door session which included 
members of the Foreign Ministry and the armed forces. 
  Gen Anuson does not believe, however, that the cancellations 
will necessarily worsen the situation. 
  The Thai Foreign Ministry also lodged a formal protest when 
Thai Ambassador to Cambodia Sakthip Krairoek paid a courtesy 
call on Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut 
yesterday. 
  "Now we wait and see," said Gen Anuson. 
  Anuson denied reports that Khmer Rouge leaders are hiding in 
the Phnom Dong-Rak mountain range, which straddles the 
Thai-Cambodian border, saying the immigration controls in the 
area are very strict. 
  The spokesman suspects the spill-over of Cambodian shelling 
onto Thai soil was deliberate and said it could have been 
avoided if the Cambodian military commanders were serious about 
it. 
  He also believes the accusations against Thailand were in 
retaliation for the unwanted repatriation of Cambodians believed 
to be the families of Khmer Rouge guerrillas fleeing the town of 
Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold, which fell to 
government troops on March 19.

  [Text] THAILAND will explain the recent border conflicts 
with Cambodia to other members of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations next week, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said 
yesterday. 
  ASEAN senior officials will gather in Phatthaya for a 
three-day meeting starting on Monday to prepare agendas for the 
foreign ministers' meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum in 
Bangkok in July. 
  The Foreign Ministry would use the opportunity to sound out 
"opinions of other ASEAN countries" about the sour relations, 
said Sqn Ldr Prasong while participating in the Ministry's 119th 
anniversary celebrations. 
  He denied that the scrapped visit to Cambodia by Supreme 
Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari was a protest 
against the Phnom Penh government. 
  ACM Woranat was possibly not ready for talks with Cambodian 
officials, he said. 
  ACM Woranat's plan was to hold discussions on border 
conflicts with high-ranking officials in Phnom Penh. 
  Thailand has protested against Cambodian accusations that 
Thailand is supporting the Khmer Rouge. 
  A letter will be handed to the Cambodian foreign ministry. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he did not expect to hear any response 
to the move which was aimed at explaining the truth as well as 
explaining Thailand's generosity to Cambodia. 
  He said Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had no time, because of 
a tight schedule, to host Cambodian co-premier Hun Sen's planned 
visit to Bangkok. 
  The premier was scheduled to visit Malaysia on Thursday. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong leaves for Rangoon today for an official 
visit as chairman of the ASEAN standing committee. 
  The visit is an attempt to invite Burma to be a guest at the 
ASEAN foreign ministerial meeting to create mutual understanding 
and bring Burma into the outside world under ASEAN's 
"constructive engagement" policy. 
  Meanwhile, the Cambodian government yesterday closed the 
Poipet-Klong Luek border pass in Aranyaprathet. 
  The shutdown came more than a week after the Thai military 
closed this important border point in retaliation for 
cross-border shelling by Khmer forces. 
  A Cambodian official based in Poipet said yesterday the Thai 
action was unjustified and unreasonable. 
  He admitted that closing the border would have a detrimental 
effect on the Cambodian economy and tourism, especially at the 
usually busy Poipet market which is now deserted. 
  All consumer goods and services that have to be imported 
from 
the Thai side are becoming scarce and prices are soaring, said 
the official, noting that a big chunk of ice which fetched only 
60 baht in Poipet before the closure of the border was now 
priced at 280 baht.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
said that Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari 
had postponed his visit to Cambodia because the military leader 
was not ready to pay the visit now. Regarding the postponement 
of the visit to Thailand by Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun 
Sen to discuss border problems, Prasong said that we are working 
with Phnom Penh authorities on a new schedule because of the 
Thai prime minister's planned visit abroad. 
  [Begin Prasong recording] We want Cambodia to understand our 
good intentions. Thailand wants to see the Cambodian problem 
settled through national reconciliation. We do not want to see 
conflicts or fighting. Thailand is willing to provide 
assistance to help bring in national reconciliation in Cambodia. 
We do not have a policy of supporting the Khmer Rouge or any 
particular faction. Our policy is to help them settle their 
problems in line with the Paris Peace Agreement. Other 
countries should refrain from acting in a way which can 
aggravate the conflict. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Supreme Command Information Department Director 
Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani said that the Supreme 
Commander had indefinitely postponed his visit to Cambodia 
because senior Cambodian leaders had accused Thailand of 
supporting the Khmer Rouge. Thailand has a policy of not 
supporting any Khmer faction, and has persistently adhered to 
that policy. On 12 April when an armed force crossed into Pong 
Nam Ron District of Chanthaburi Province, the Thai side disarmed 
and pushed them back. Lt. Gen. Anuson believes that the 
cancellation of the supreme commander's visit to Cambodia and 
the cancellation of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to 
Thailand will not cause military tensions.

  [Text] Although Thailand played a significant part along 
with the international community in stopping the civil war and 
bringing about the election in Cambodia, it appears that it has 
not received due credit from certain leaders in the Cambodian 
Government. Thailand has even been discredited on several 
occasions. 
  The sole issue the Cambodians have repeatedly used to 
discredit Thailand results from distrust of Thailand out of fear 
that the Thai military might still aid the Khmer Rouge due to 
interests arising from various activities along the border. 
This issue has frustrated Thai military leaders for some time. 
  The issue came to a boiling point when certain Cambodian 
Government leaders in order to discredit Thailand brought out 
pictures taken long ago of Thai military officers with Khmer 
Rouge leaders. The military leaders appealed to the government 
to voice an objection and take immediate retaliatory measures. 
  This is the first time that Thai military leaders have 
displayed their anger, and it is understandable. However, the 
vehement display of their feelings could have international 
ramifications, because it is tantamount to an unwritten 
declaration of Thailand's readiness to take military action. 
  Political ruses are engaged in all the time. They should be 
countered politically, not by pounding the table. Therefore, 
although we sympathize with the Thai military over the unfair 
accusations, we appeal for calm so that we can make a proper 
analysis of the game the Cambodians are playing and its intended 
objective. 
  We do not believe that certain Cambodian Government leaders 
are unaware of the change in Thailand's border policy. Trading 
activities with the Khmer Rouge by minor businessmen have 
continued to some extent. But why use them to discredit 
Thailand? By saying that the Thai military and government have 
two separate identities, we think the Cambodian leaders are 
giving themselves room for dialogue. 
  In international politics, an aggressive stance is taken up 
by one side when it is confident that it can cause the other 
side to retreat or when it is far superior in power. This stand 
is taken only as a last resort. We wish every side concerned to 
reconsider whether it is now time to display such a stance.

  [Text] Manila, April 15 KYODO -- Okinawa Governor Masahide 
Ota said Friday [15 April] the conversion of the former United 
States naval base at Subic Bay into a commercial and industrial 
free port is a good example for Okinawa to follow. 
  Ota, who is on a six-day visit to the Philippines, told 
reporters during a visit to Subic that he "envies" its 
conversion, which followed the U.S. withdrawal of forces from 
the port in 1992. 
  Subic Bay was once the largest U.S. overseas naval base. 
  Ota said he could foresee a bustling commercial and 
industrial free port in Subic 10 years from now, adding, "I 
really envy the successful conversion of the Subic naval base 
into a commercial district." 
  Subic is about 70 kilometers north of Manila. 
  The Okinawan archipelago in southern Japan, still plays host 
to a strong U.S. military presence.

  [Text] Lt. Gen. Arturo T. Enrile, chief of the Philippine 
Army and incoming chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (AFP), vowed yesterday to give top priority to the 
10 year modernization program of the AFP which, he said, is 
expected to have an expanded and more dynamic role in view of 
the country's fast improving political, social, and economic 
situation. 
  In an interview at the Philippine Army Headquarters at Fort 
Bonifacio, Makati, Enrile said that in his tour of duty as the 
next chief of staff, the military organization will assume more 
relevant roles in economic development, particularly in the 
field of infrastructure and environmental preservation. 
  He said that his program "peace offensives" in the 
Philippine 
Army is applicable for the entire AFP since it will be the 
military's contribution to nation building. Enrile, a member of 
the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class '62, was named by 
President Ramos, also commander-in-chief, as the next AFP head 
replacing Gen. Lisandro C. Abadia who is scheduled to end his 
three-year term as AFP chief of staff on 12 April. Abadia who 
is turning 56 next month, is also a member of PMA Class '62. 
  As Army chief, Enrile has vigorously pursued the Chief 
Executive's campaign to protect the country's remaining forests 
through the involvement of Army Special Units. 
  The Army chief also revealed plans to redeploy armored, 
fighting vehicles in forest areas as a deterrent to illegal 
loggers amidst the decline of communist threat. 
  However, Enrile said that he will give emphasis on the 
modernization of the AFP since, he claimed, his predecessors had 
successfully worked for the unification and professionalization 
of the military institution. 
  "Actually, there is a much lesser work load for me now 
because of the effectiveness of my predecessors. But still, I 
am ready to make innovations that would keep the AFP as relevant 
as it is," he said. 
  Despite giving a list of five candidates for the top AFP 
post, military sources said Abadia endorsed Enrile to President 
Ramos because of his professional competence. 
  Enrile said he is not expecting any "sour graping" from any 
of the four candidates. "All of us are professionals and experts 
in the military career," he said. 
  Enrile was born in Lucena City, Quezon on 20 June 1940. His 
parents are Felix D. Enrile of Lucena City and Jovita Tiongson 
of Nueva Ecija. 
  He is married to Mara Miciano of Metro Manila and is blessed 
with a 12-year-old daughter Tanya Angela. 
  Many remember Gen. Enrile as the only Army officer who 
convinced more than 400 rebel soldiers to "return to barracks" 
after occupying the high-rise buildings in Makati for seven days 
during the December 1989 failed coup attempt. 
  As superintendent of the PMA, Enrile was also responsible 
for 
instituting reforms at the country's premier military academy, 
particularly the eradication of traditional hazing activities. 
  President Fidel Ramos designated yesterday Maj. Gen. Alfredo 
Filler as new vice chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (AFP) in place of Vice Admiral Mariana Dumancas. 
  Filler's appointment followed the designation of Gen. Arturo 
Enrile as incoming AFP chief of staff, vice Chief of Staff 
Lisandro Abadia who is retiring on 12 April. 
  Malacanang [presidential office] said Dumancas had earlier 
requested the president to be allowed to go on terminal leave 
effective today prior to his compulsory retirement on 30 October 
1994. The president approved his request.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Enrile A Good Choice"] </F>
  [Text] By appointing Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile over more 
senior nominees as Armed Forces chief of staff, President Ramos 
reaffirmed his policy of not appointing any officer to key 
positions in the uniformed service if they are retiring within 
six months of their appointment. The policy was earlier upheld 
when the president reappointed Superintendent Umberto Rodriguez 
as director-general of the Philippine National Police (PNP). 
  The new appointment has been generally welcomed by various 
sectors. It helps that General Enrile is popular and well-liked 
in the defense and military establishment. This early, it is 
easy to see that Enrile's appointment will breeze through the 
Commission on Appointments and public opinion circles, unlike 
the Rodriguez appointment which has been hounded by controversy 
since the start not because of the PNP chief's qualifications 
but of the overall problematic state of the police. 
  It also helps that General Enrile has more or less been 
groomed for the post. The new chief of staff was catapulted 
into national prominence when as superintendent of the 
Philippine Military Academy, he negotiated the surrender of army 
mutineers in the 1989 coup attempt against [former President] 
Corazon C. Aquino. He was a possible successor to Renato de 
Villa when the latter retired as chief of staff in 1991; Mrs. 
Aquino, however, chose Lisandro Abadia and named Enrile army 
chief President Ramos chose General Enrile as the new chief of 
staff over more senior officers without risking a backlash from 
the military establishment. Such would have been inconceivable 
three years ago when the air was charged with recrimination and 
suspicion over appointments to the military service, a hangover 
from the martial-law years when the military controlled the 
political life of the nation. In fact, Mrs. Aquino suffered the 
indignity of having to justify her choice of Abadia when the 
deputy chief of staff at that time, Alexander Aguirre, protested 
that he had been bypassed and charged that the appointment was 
politically motivated. 
  It is to the credit of Abadia that he had stayed 
non-partisan 
during his stint, thereby proving Aguirre wrong. During the 
1992 synchronized elections, the military under Abadia tried to 
stay above politics and ensured a democratic and peaceful 
turnover of power. Minus his unfortunate indiscreet and rather 
arrogant remarks on how he refused businessmen's offers to lead 
a coup against Mrs. Aquino before the 1992 election, Abadia was 
a good chief of staff who was successful in disciplining and 
professionalizing the Armed Forces. It is hoped that Enrile 
would continue with Abadia's reforms. 
  There is another dimension to the Enrile appointment. The 
naming of another Army man as chief of staff and not, say, Vice 
Chief of Staff Mariano Dumancas who is a Navy man, shows that 
despite the dwindling fortunes of the various insurgencies, the 
military will still play a prominent, though diminishing, role 
in counter-insurgency. Earlier, the deadline for the PNP to 
take over the counter-insurgency operations from the military 
was extended for another two years. It is expected that by 
1996, the insurgencies would have abated as to allow the 
military to turn over the offensive against rebels to the police. 
  By that time, the military would be able to concentrate 
fully 
on its essential role: defending the country against external 
aggression and other threats to its national security. To speed 
up the transition, it would do well for Congress to finally pass 
the bill modernizing the Armed Forces and keeping our defense 
capability at par with that of our neighbors in the region who 
have embarked on an alarming arms build-up. 
  The modernization bill has been held by bureaucratic 
incompetence; apparently the military and the Executive could 
only provide ballpark figures on the costs of modernization that 
are much like those aimless growth and fiscal targets churned 
out regularly by our economic planners. The senators doubt the 
veracity of the figures. There is support for the bill in 
Congress, especially the Senate, but the Armed Forces and the 
Executive must get their act together.

<F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Dinh Khai on the news conference </F>
given by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov in Hanoi on 
15 April] 
  [Summary] Russian Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov, chairman of 
the Russian-Vietnamese Intergovernmental Committee for Economic, 
Trade, and Science and Technology Cooperation, was in Vietnam to 
attend the third working session of the committee. To conclude 
the working visit, Mr. Yarov held a news conference. 
  At the news conference, Mr. Yarov reported on the results of 
the third session of the intergovernmental committee and the 
visit of the delegation to the Hoa Binh Hydroelectricity Plant. 
He revealed that Russia will continue its cooperation with 
Vietnam in power projects; in the joint venture in oil 
exploitation; in upgrading factories, including the Lao Cai 
Apatite Factory; and in post and telegraphic services. The 
Russian and Vietnamese sides both agreed to set up working 
groups to speed up cooperation. 
  He also revealed that "the next working session of the 
intergovernmental committee will be held in the first quarter of 
1995 in Moscow, and he hoped that by then a Vietnamese 
electronic assembly factory would have been set up in Moscow." 
  Mr. Graskov, vice chairman of the intergovernmental 
committee, talked about "certain difficulties in receiving items 
of merchandise that Vietnam uses to pay for its debts to the 
Russian Federation. We want the goods to be in greater quantity 
compared with the existing ones, more diversified, and of better 
quality with more competitive prices." 
  He also said the "Russian side has created conditions for 
Vietnamese goods to get into the Russian market, and hence we 
expect similar action from the Vietnamese side, primarily to 
create conditions for Russian machinery and equipment to access 
the Vietnamese market."

  [Text] In furtherance of an agreement between the 
governments of Vietnam and the Russian Federation, the 
Vietnam-Russia Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, 
and Scientific-Technological Cooperation convened its third 
meeting in Hanoi from 12-15 April. Deputy Prime Minister Tran 
Duc Luong, chairman of the Vietnam's Sub-Commission for 
Economic, Trade, and Scientific- Technological Cooperation and 
head of the Vietnamese Government delegation, presided over the 
meeting. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov, chairman of

Government delegation. Also attending the meeting were leading 
officials of a number of ministries and sectors as well as 
representatives of Vietnamese and Russian local administrations. 
  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov and members of the 
Russian Government delegation paid a floral tribute to President 
Ho Chi Minh at his mausoleum and visited his residence and 
office. They were also accorded a warm reception by General 
Secretary Do Muoi and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet thanked Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and

  The Vietnamese leaders warmly welcomed the Russian 
Government 
economic delegation's working visit to Vietnam. They highly 
valued the results that both countries have recorded over the 
past years in the framework of their bilateral cooperation 
program, especially in the domains of energy and oil and gas. 
They reiterated Vietnam's constant efforts to consolidate and 
promote the traditional friendship and cooperation with the 
Russian Federation based on the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit. 
  The Russian Government delegation attended the inauguration 
of the eighth, and also the last, group of generators of the Hoa 
Binh hydroelectric power plant. Now that the last group of 
generators is commissioned, the plant can operate in full 
capacity. 
  At the meeting, the two sides studied practical issues 
relating to the implementation of agreements on economic, trade, 
and scientific-technological cooperation for the 1993-94 period. 
The two sides maintained that the implementation of the 
agreements reached at the second meeting in May 1993 has led to 
practical results and contributed to promoting the economic, 
trade, and scientific-technological cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  The two sides exchanged views on measures to resolve 
existing 
problems and on ways to further enhance the efficiency of 
cooperation in energy, oil, and gas development; agro-industrial 
joint ventures; and exchanges of goods. Both sides agreed on 
the need to make continued efforts to renovate the mechanisms to 
create favorable conditions for establishing direct contacts 
between sectors and localities in the two countries. 
  The two sides signed the minute of the third meeting and the 
agreements on post and telegraph cooperation and on the 
preparatory work for the signing of the agreements on investment 
promotion and protection and on agro-industrial joint ventures, 
and a number of other agreements. 
  The Russian Government economic delegation toured a number 
of 
economic and cultural facilities. It also met and exchanged 
views with Vietnamese businessmen. Leading officials of a 
number of Vietnamese and Russian ministries, sectors, and 
localities also met and exchanged views on a number of practical 
issues relating to bilateral cooperation. The two sides agreed 
that the fourth meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission 
would take place in Moscow in the first quarter of 1995. 
  The meeting took place in an atmosphere of friendship, 
frankness, and mutual understanding. The Russian delegation 
visited a number of southern provinces from 16 to 17 April.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov is 
currently in Vietnam to attend the third session of the 
Russia-Vietnam Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, 
Scientific, and Technological Cooperation. 
  Mr. Yarov, in an interview with Radio Voice of Vietnam, 
spoke 
of the results of this session. 
  [Begin Yarov recording, in Russian fading into English 
translation] It marks a new step in the comprehensive 
cooperation between Russia and Vietnam. The conference decided 
to continue the cooperation between the two countries, 
especially in energy and oil and gas joint ventures. It also 
considered the renovation of some enterprises. The two sides 
agreed to cooperate in building industrial and agricultural 
sectors and fishery. The two countries also signed an agreement 
on cooperation in postal and communications fields. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Yarov spoke of the cooperative relations between Vietnam 
and Russia in the present situation. He said: What Russia has 
done in Vietnam, it does not want to shift to other countries. 
We plan to consolidate and develop the relations between the 
two countries. Now Russia will continue to cooperate with 
Vietnam as the former Soviet Union did in the past, because old 
friends are always better than new ones. 
  During his visit, the deputy prime minister of Russia also 
attended the inauguration of the eighth generator unit of the 
Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Voice of Vietnam asked 
for his comments and whether Russia plans to cooperate with 
Vietnam to build other projects on such big scale. He said: 
  [Begin Yarov recording, in Russian fading into English 
translation] The Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Project is a 
combination of the joint effort of Vietnamese workers and 
Russian experts. I would like to congratulate Vietnam for 
building this project through its own effort. It proves that 
Vietnam is able to do other bigger projects. The Hoa Binh 
Hydroelectric Project is the symbol of the close relations 
between Vietnam and Russia. It makes relations between Vietnam 
and Russia as well as other countries in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States become closer and closer. In future, Russia 
may install two other generator units at the Hoa Binh 
Hydroelectric Power Plant, and two other generator units at the 
Pha Lai Thermal Electric Power Plant. When Russia is [word 
indistinct] from its crisis, and it is certainly getting out of 
the crisis, we will have more joint ventures and investment in 
Vietnam. [end recording] 
  Mr. Yarov then gave his impression about Vietnam and its 
people. He said: The Vietnamese people are hardworking and 
hospitable. During my working visit to Vietnam, the Vietnamese 
Government has created favorable conditions for us, especially 
during my visit and in our presence at the inauguration of the 
eighth generator unit of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. 
The weather in Vietnam is very beautiful.

<F P=106> [Eighth installment of "basic contents" of Hanoi 20-25 </F>
January Midterm Party National Conference resolution] 
  [Text] At present, our party still upholds its tradition of 
unity, a very important factor for our party's strength in 
leading the public to overcome difficulties and obtain very 
important achievements in the renovation undertaking. However, 
we must always highly rate the duty of strengthening party unity 
because although, generally, out party is united, some party 
organs and party committees are facing a lack of unity -- 
serious in some places; some party cadres and party members do 
not strictly observe the principle of democratic centralism; and 
hostile forces are finding ways of interfering with our internal 
affairs, degrading our cadres' political and moral quality, and 
dividing us in line with the implementation of their "peaceful 
evolution" conspiracy. 
  In order to strengthen internal unity, we must perform many 
tasks. Party committees must outline appropriate measures 
suitable for their practical conditions. But there is a common 
point that all party organs, cadres, and members must take heed 
of: this is the implementation of the party principles on 
organization and activity, beginning with the principle of 
democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership 
and individual responsibility. These very principles, on one 
hand, help to develop the party's intellectual ability so that 
it can reduce mistakes and shortcomings in its decision and 
ensure the party's stable and dynamic management. On the other 
hand, they make sure that our party is a united bloc and a 
strong organization. 
  It is necessary to stress that these principles do not 
destroy democracy. The party statures clearly state: In 
organizing and in discussing all issues, every party member is 
allowed to fully express his view. However, when an issue has 
been decided upon by the majority, a person with a view which is 
in the minority can retain his view, but he must conform with 
the decision of the majority. 
  Together with the implementation of these principles, the 
political report clearly points out that party cadres and party 
members must inculcate in themselves a revolutionary morality 
and a healthy lifestyle and fight against waste, corruption, 
illegal business practices, individualism, indiscipline, 
authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness, because these 
evils will lead to disunity. 
  c. The national block must be broadened, and the close 
relationship between the party and public must be consolidated. 
Uncle Ho's thought must be promulgated to broadly unite the 
Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause for 
national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves 
from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward 
the goal of a prosperous population, a strong nation, and a just 
and civilized society. 
  We must consider the national interest as our common goal. 
At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as 
they do not run counter to the national interest. We should 
eliminate obsessions and hatred and look forward to the future. 
The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all state 
guidance, policies, and laws. 
  Is national unity a strategic policy? 
  National unity is a fundamental policy of our party and 
state. The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all 
state guidance, policies, and laws and in all areas of politics, 
economy, society, security, national defense, and foreign 
affairs to meet the legitimate interest and aspiration of people 
from all walks of life; link benefit with responsibility and 
individual interest with citizenship obligation; respect 
national interest; and create favorable conditions and an 
environment to completely liberate the power of production and 
encourage all people and economic sectors to increase 
production, improve business, enrich themselves legally, 
practice thrift for national construction and protection, and 
continuously improve the people's material and cultural life. 
At the same time, it encourages all people to satisfactorily 
implement social welfare policies by repaying debts to people 
who have rendered meritorious service to the nation, to 
participate in public work and charity and humanitarian 
activities, and to help each another eliminate starvation, 
reduce poverty, and develop the tradition of kindness and 
gratitude of our ancestors. 
  We must broaden the national unity in diversified forms. We 
must organize and develop more new activity forms from low to 
higher levels and create different forms suitable to different 
walks of life. We must develop the active role of exemplary 
persons in all social classes, levels of society, ethnic 
communities, and religions. We must direct our activity to 
villages, subwards, and households. And we must consolidate the 
alliance between the worker and the peasant and intellectuals, 
making it a foundation for national unity. 
  d. We have to reform the cadre-related work. First, we must 
renew the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in 
assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying cadres, 
especially key cadres. Gifted people must be trained, 
encouraged, and employed. We have to create favorable 
conditions for sound people -- both inside and outside the party 
and inside and outside the country -- to contribute their best 
efforts for the nation. We have to rejuvenate the contingent of 
cadres and promote elderly cadres with sound knowledge, 
experience, political stance, and health. Woman and ethnic 
cadres must be given special attention. And we must fight 
narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination.

<F P=106> [Last installment of "basic contents" of Hanoi 20-25 January </F>
Midterm Party National Conference resolution] 
  [Text] What are the bases for evaluation, selection, and 
deployment of leading cadres? 
  The political report clearly stipulates: "The evaluation, 
selection, and deployment of leading cadres at all levels should 
be based on the fundamental criteria determined by the 
resolution of the Party Central Committee Third Plenum: 
  -- A steadfast political standpoint, determination to 
follow the socialist path, and determination to bring the 
renovation undertaking of the country to victory. 
  -- Sound knowledge and the ability to participate in a 
collective decision making process, as well as the ability to 
organize and implement any assigned tasks efficiently. 
  -- Possession of revolutionary morality; being diligent, 
thrifty, just, fair, objective, and unbiased; and having a 
determination to protect the lines and policies of the party. 
  -- Being discipline oriented and protective of the unity 
in the party. 
  -- Being close with people and trusted by them. 
  Among these criteria, special attention should be paid to 
political acumen; dedication to the aims and ideals of the 
party; commitment to lead a moral, healthy, and clean life; and 
non- involvement in corruption. Ability is very important, but 
the above criteria should also be considered carefully. This is 
because the renovation undertaking carried out by our party is 
bringing about many advantages as well as many dangers and 
difficulties. Leading cadres will have to confront countless 
ordeals, and if they, being core leaders, falter and show a lack 
of determination and political acumen, then it is very likely 
that they will head in the wrong direction. Working in a 
market-based economy where leading cadres are empowered with 
vast responsibility for managing public properties, and in an 
environment where various forces would love to buy those leaders 
with their money, if the leading cadres let themselves be 
spoiled by money and become committed to corruption activities, 
then the state will lose not only its money and its cadres, but 
also the trust of the people. We definitely should not inject 
into the leading organs of the party those who are politically 
and morally degenerate. 
  Cadre work must be democratized. The evaluation of cadre 
should be done by the managing party committee and other 
relevant organs as stipulated, and it should be carried out in 
orderly, democratic, proper, and just ways. Every cadre has the 
right to know and answer to the evaluation by the party 
committee and the leader of that individual cadre. 
  The political report also highly values the fostering and 
training of talents, which are considered precious assets of the 
country. To bring the country to prosperity and powerfulness, 
we should have many talented people in all fields: outstanding 
politicians, excellent entrepreneurs, and talented scientists, 
technicians, culturalists, and so forth. Favorable conditions 
should be created so that all people with sound character and 
ability, both inside the party and outsiders, both living 
domestically and overseas, can have a chance to contribute their 
utmost to the country. 
  The training and retraining of cadres should be done 
according to plan. The training contents must be specific for 
each task and for the requirements of each position concerned. 
Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying 
methods, while adequate funds must be provided for the training. 
  All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the 
existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they 
will make plans for party member work from now until the year 
2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the 
quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. This is our major 
but difficult task that requires our best efforts to fulfill. 
The party central committee will give out directives on this 
task, but each sector, each locality should be a striking force 
in the implementation process. 
  D. Are Party Members Allowed To Engage in Private Capitalist 
Economic Activities? 
  The party by-laws stipulate that a party member "must be 
exemplary in labor, combat, and study; and lead a healthy, 
clean, and non-exploiting life." The Party Construction Report 
of the Seventh Party Congress also confirmed: "Party members who 
are currently employed as workers and employees, in addition to 
the fulfillment of their assigned tasks, are encouraged to 
develop family economic activities. Party members can be 
shareholders of companies, state or collective enterprises. 
Party members who are not employed directly in organs of the 
party, state, or mass organizations, but directly involved in 
labor (manual labor, technical labor, or management labor), are 
allowed to organize a collective economic establishment 
(production group, cooperative, and so forth), to tender for 
bidding, and to lease land or other property of the state and 
other collective organizations. They are also allowed to do 
business as individual, small proprietors. Party members are 
not allowed to be private economic capitalists." The political 
report reaffirms this and all members should strictly abide by 
it. 
  Regarding party members who are presently owners of private 
capitalist economic establishments, the relevant party 
organizations need to handle them on an individual case basis. 
They can be helped to transform to enterprises, share-holding 
enterprises with shares of the laboring partners or the state, 
or to other forms of collective economic establishment, in order 
to motivate the capital and entrepreneurial skills of party 
members on one hand, and to ensure the class characteristic of 
our party on the other.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 19 April commentary: "A Warmonger's Visit </F>
for War"] 
  [Text] It has been reported that U.S. Secretary of Defense 
Perry will visit South Korea. A spokesman for the Department of 
Defense said that the main purpose of his visit to South Korea 
is to hold meetings with military leaders, to receive briefings 
from commanders in South Korea on situations, and to take 
necessary military steps, while talking about the North's 
military moves. 
  This shows that Perry's visit to South Korea is a dangerous 
visit for war [wihomhan chonjaeng haenggak] to further 
strengthen military pressure against us, to extremely aggravate 
tensions on the Korean peninsula, and to embark upon the road of 
war under the pretext of the nuclear issue. 
  As disclosed recently, last year, the U.S. imperialists 
formulated a plan for a war of northward invasion, the so-called 
New Operational Plan No. 5027, along with the South Korean 
puppets. Based on this, they have concentrated their massive 
arms of aggression on the Korean peninsula, as well as the areas 
surrounding it. 
  According to the report issued by the U.S. Department of 
Defense in mid-February this year, the U.S. imperialists have 
maintained approximately 100,000 aggressive troops in the Far 
East in preparation for the emergency situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Also they have reinforced the military equipment for 
U.S. Forces occupying South Korea, including the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to South Korea, and accelerated military 
preparedness for the wartime situation [chonsi cheje]. 
  After occupying the post of secretary of defense, Perry has 
made many remarks that reek of gunpowder [hwayangnae pungginun], 
while taking the lead in talking about the nuclear development 
by the North. He has babbled loudly that he will make the North 
stop developing nuclear weapons at the price of another war on 
the Korean peninsula, and instead of discussing mere plans for 
military steps during this visit to South Korea, that he will 
concretely discuss how, when, and why military steps should be 
taken. 
  This shows that the U.S. secretary of defense's visit to 
South Korea is a visit for his front-line command [ilson 
chihwihaenggak] aimed at reorganizing their wartime system in 
order to put their already established plan for a Northward 
invasion war into practice, as well as a visit to plot their 
operation to organize a combined armed forces [yonhap muryok] 
against us. 
  Perry, the boss of a war plot, will visit South Korea at a 
time when the U.S. imperialists are concentrating their massive 
arms of aggression on South Korea and the areas surrounding it 
in order to bring the disaster of nuclear war to our nation. 
Therefore, this is not a thing that can be overlooked. 
  Also, his visit to South Korea is a visit to plunder and 
exploit the South Korean people by heightening tensions on the 
Korean peninsula, by subjugating South Korea even more 
militarily, and by sending stocked military supplies to South 
Korea. It is well known that the U.S. leaders [udumoridul] are 
aggravating tensions and stirring up disputes in every place to 
find an outlet for the munitions industrial complexes which have 
faced difficulties finding markets since the Cold War ended. As 
a person formerly in charge of military equipment affairs from 
the mid-sixties until recently, U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry 
has had close relations with large munitions businesses. He was 
also in charge of military equipment for coping with South Korea 
[taenamjoson kunsa changbi] in the past. It is clear that Perry 
will visit South Korea to generate profits for munitions 
businesses, to militarize the South Korean economy, and to force 
the puppets to increase their proportion in the fund for 
maintaining the U.S. Forces in South Korea by deliberately 
aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and by turning 
South Korea into a U.S. arms exhibition center. 
  Perry's visit to South Korea will accelerate the driving of 
the Korean peninsula's situation to the dangerous brink of war 
and will infringe upon the South Korean people's interests. In 
view of this grave consequence, his visit to South Korea is 
totally regarded as a trip for aggression and war [cholchohi 
chimnyakkwa chonjaeng haenggak], and inevitably faces our 
people's opposition and rejection [pandae paegyok]. 
  What matters is that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, as a 
U.S. war servant [migugui chonjaeng mosumggun], is welcoming the 
U.S. military head's visit to South Korea and is running 
indiscreetly to set a fire of war against fellow countrymen with 
the United States. 
  After rupturing working-level contacts for the exchange of 
top-level special envoys of the North and the South, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique put the entire puppet Army on alert and 
is accelerating preparations for a northward invasion while 
talking about strong countermeasures, punishing retaliation, and 
the like. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has recently dispatched a 
special inspection team to the military and even made a stir of 
reconfirming the state of ammunition held in reserve for combat 
and of inspecting the management of ammunition in store. It is 
needless to say again that this was conducted according to the 
U.S. imperialists' adventurous, new war maneuver. 
  When the U.S. bellicose military head and South Korea's 
civilian warmongers sit face to face, they have nothing to do 
but scheme up a war, and it leaves no room for doubt that this 
will threaten peace and reunification of Korea more gravely. 
  We will attentively watch the warmonger's ominous 
[simsangchi 
anun] visit to South Korea. If the aggressors and 
nation-sellers set fire first [sonbulchirul handamyon], they 
will be made to pay dearly for their behavior.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Two transports of the 
U.S. Navy loaded with Patriot missiles to be deployed in South 
Korea arrived at Pusan port on Monday, says a report from Seoul. 
  The unloading of 48 launching pads, 192 Patriot missiles and 
84 stinger missiles has begun. Their frontline deployment will 
reportedly be completed by the 29th of this month. 
  The second batch of Patriot missiles will shortly arrive to 
be deployed by the same date, the report says. 
  The shipment of Patriot to South Korea by the United States 
and the South Korean puppet clique is a very dangerous 
development leading the military situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. This is a vivid indication that 
the rash scheme of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam 
traitor clique to overpower our Republic militarily has already 
entered a practical stage. 
  Our people and the Asian people are deeply concerned over 
the 
reckless military action of the U.S. and the South Korean 
puppet clique. 
  The U.S. authorities claim that the Patriot is "a defensive 
weapon." But it is a nonsense. In the Korean peninsula which is 
not large, it can also be used as an attack weapon capable of 
striking any spot. It is known to everyone that the target of 
its strike can be freely altered by the warhead it is tipped 
with. 
  The shipment of the new-type Patriot to South Korea by the 
United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is an open new 
war provocation act to pose a military threat to the DPRK and 
deal a preemptive strike at it. 
  The fact proves that the United States, from the very 
beginning, did not have the intention to solve the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but has 
used the problem as an expedient to overpower our Republic, 
motivated by its outdated hostile policy to stifle it. 
  In trying to subdue us with the help of outside forces by 
bringing in without hesitation even the Patriot, a mass 
destruction weapon, the South Korean puppet clique stands naked 
once again revealing its ugly color to the world as a 
never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist traitor and warmaniac. 
  It is a foolish dream for the United States and the South 
Korean puppet clique to try to overpower us with strength. It 
is the unshakable will of our people to answer strength with 
strength. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must 
not 
act rashly but promptly stop the deployment of the new-type 
missiles in South Korea, clearly seeing the unshakable will of 
our people.

  [Text] This news is just in. College students in Seoul and 
Kwangju Districts have staged violent anti-U.S. demonstrations, 
chanting slogans such as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!" 
  According to Seoul radio reports, on 19 April, the college 
students in Seoul and Kwangju waged violent demonstration 
struggles, protesting the arrival of Patriot missiles in the 
port of Pusan and U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's junket to Seoul. 
  In Seoul, a group of students, breaking a tight police 
cordon, waged a demonstration struggle in front of the U.S. 
Embassy in Seoul, chanting anti-U.S. slogans with placards such 
as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!" 
  In the meantime, on the morning of 19 April, some 500 
members 
of the Kwangju Chonnam District General Student Council staged a 
protest rally in front of the Kwangju American Cultural Center. 
Branding the U.S. defense secretary's junket to Seoul and the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea as a criminal act 
of increasing the danger of war, the students threw some 200 
bottles of paint at the American Cultural Center building. 
  The puppet clique, perplexed by the students' strong 
protests, mobilized numerous combat policemen to brutally 
suppress the student demonstrators. However, the demonstrators 
did not yield to this and continued their struggle, chanting 
slogans calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist 
aggression forces.

<F P=106> ["Halt to Arms Buildup Urged" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The United States and 
the South Korean rulers must clearly see the strong spirit and 
iron will of the Korean people, who never pardon those who 
infringe upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of 
the country, promptly stop aggressive arms buildup including the 
deployment of Patriot missiles and discontinue the reckless war 
provocation moves at once, urged the Korean anti-nuke peace 
committee in a statement released today. 
  Branding the deployment of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of the DPRK-U.S. 
joint statement and the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearization and an undisguised military provocation aimed 
at unleashing another war, a thermonuclear war in Korea at any 
cost, the statement says: 
  The introduction of the Patriot rejected in other regions is 
an inevitable product of the despicable flunkeyist and 
treacherous policy pursued by the Kim Yong-sam group, which has 
turned South Korea into an exhibition ground for new and old 
U.S. weapons and into an arms market. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working 
contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and 
the South which had been arranged with so much efforts and, 
later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about "the 
North's scheme to provoke a war against the South," and made 
public even a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation 
Plan No. 5027" which had been kept in secrecy. All this was 
motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a pretext for a 
massive shipment of U.S.-made destruction weapons into South 
Korea and legalizing it, thus furthering the interests of the 
United States, its master. 
  It has become clear to everybody that with such a traitor as 
Kim Yong-sam left in power in South Korea, the interests of the 
nation cannot be defended and our fellow countrymen cannot avoid 
a nuclear disaster. 
  The South Korean students and people must invigorate the 
anti-America, anti-war, anti-nuke and anti-"government" struggle 
to oust the Kim Yong-sam group from power and establish an 
independent and democratic government and to check the 
introduction of the Patriot into South Korea. 
  If the United States and the South Korean puppets finally 
started a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, ignoring the 
aspiration of the times and the demand of the nation and 
steadily reinforcing the aggression forces, the provokers would 
never get off scotfree.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "War Commotions Expanded Step by Step"] </F>
  [Text] Recently, the heads of U.S. military circles have 
increased their military threats against us. 
  Some time ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry let loose 
outbursts that our nuclear development should be stopped even at 
the risk of another war on the Korean peninsula, that the United 
States will not rule out a preemptive strike against us, and 
that it will make military preparations against war. 
  At the same time, the U.S. military circles are taking 
actions, such as bringing in massive military equipment, 
including Patriot missiles, to South Korea; concentrating its 
Naval force in the waters around our country; and frequently 
staging military exercises with the South Korean puppets. 
  The outward escalation [nogoljogin hwaktae] of the U.S. 
military circles' military actions are extremely dangerous 
provocative acts designed to carry into practice the war 
scenario which they had rounded off through the Team Spirit 
exercises with the purpose of crushing [apsal] our socialism 
with force [him]. 
  As it has been widely known, the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise is a test nuclear war and a preliminary war opposing 
us. The goal of such exercise is aimed at not only threatening 
us militarily but also rounding off their preparations to 
unleash a new Korean war. Now, the U.S. military circles 
attempt to carry their provocative war plan into practice. 
  The step-by-step escalation of the U.S. military circles' 
military actions opposing our republic is an expression of the 
strategy of the expansion of arms market which had been worked 
out through back-door dealings [maghuhungjong] between the U.S. 
Administration and the U.S. war industry monopolies. The U.S. 
war industry monopolies try to aggravate the situation by all 
means in order to make enormous profits by manufacturing more 
weapons. However, with the end of the Cold War, it became more 
difficult for them to sell lethal weapons. 
  The U.S. administration officials are, without exception, 
servants of big monopolies, especially munitions industry 
monopolies. Hence, they try to unleash a war on the Korean 
peninsula to fatten the munitions industry monopolies. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppet clique, which tries 
to sustain its filthy life through outside dependence, maneuvers 
to massively bring in U.S. weapons to give enormous profits to 
the U.S. war industry monopolies and drive its fellow countrymen 
into a whirlpool of war. 
  Stemming from these political goal and economic interests, 
the U.S. military circles have set themselves onto the stage of 
raising the curtain of the already-plotted Korean war scenario 
and buckling down to promote it on a full scale. 
  Taking advantage of the reckless military actions taken by 
the United States, the South Korean puppets made public their 
war plan to invade the North, the New Operation Plan No. 5027, 
and issued a special alert on the puppet Army. In this 
connection, the puppet Armed Forces are fully prepared to kindle 
a war at any time. 
  Currently, a very grave situation is being created on the 
Korean peninsula in which the flames of war may flare up even 
over a trivial and accidental element. This kind of situation 
was born wholly because the United States and the South Korean 
puppets have already entered a stage of actual military action 
to provoke a new war. 
  It is brazen-faced for the U.S. military to depict such 
reckless antirepublic military action as if it were for its 
self-defense while talking about a diplomatic resolution through 
patience. 
  It is a well known fact that historically, before attacking 
another country, the United States has used the method of 
advocating a diplomatic resolution and then justifying a 
military action. In the past, when committing armed invasion 
toward countries such as Grenada and Panama, the U.S. ruling 
class hung the seemingly signboard of protecting the U.S. 
citizens, the antidrug struggle, and so on. 
  The active and tolerant diplomatic resolution which they are 
professing toward us constitutes war diplomacy to yield and gain 
supremacy over us through armed invasion. Also, their so-called 
defense is nothing but a smokescreen to hide their bellicose 
nature and aggressiveness. 
  What is absurd is that some members of the U.S. ruling class 
are spreading falsehoods by saying things as if we were taking 
some kind of military action first, and are attempting to 
justify their military adventurous maneuver. This is a 
defilement of our peace- loving position and a nasty act which 
is to damage the self- defensive character our revolutionary 
armed force possesses. 
  The international social circle officially recognizes our 
peace- loving position and policy. Our revolutionary armed 
force is through and through a self-defensive armed force in 
which its fundamental mission is to defend our republic's 
sovereign right and security. 
  It is preposterous for some members of the U.S. ruling class 
to publicize about our so-called military attack, and is the 
same as the proverb, "Like a thief calling another a thief." 
During the Persian Gulf war, the United States put on a bold 
front of the single superpower, openly moved and deployed the 
aggressive forces in this region, and committed an overall war 
on Iraq. However, in our country, the United States laid a 
smokescreen of so-called self-defense, is concentratedly 
deploying armed forces in South Korea and its region, and is 
also trying to carry out a military attack opposing our republic. 
  However, they have miscalculated. No forcible measures can 
work for us at all. Our people and the People's Army are 
sharply observing the unusual war attempt by the United States. 
If the United States and its cat's paw kindle the fire of war 
to the end, we will answer through a resolute counterattack by 
defending our country's socialist system and the Republic's 
dignity. 
  The truth of history is that justice is victorious and 
injustice is defeated. The United States must not carry out 
rash and thoughtless acts, and it will be good for it to not 
forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.

<F P=106> ["Military Analyst on Scheme of U.S. Military for New Korean </F>
War" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a military analyst's commentary hitting out at 
the scheme of the U.S. military to start another war in Korea. 
  The U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, some time ago let 
loose an impudent blast, threatening that the U.S. "will not 
rule out a preemptive strike" at the DPRK over its fictitious 
"nuclear suspicion." 
  Signalled by this, the U.S. military is making a massive 
shipment of military hardware including Patriot missiles to 
South Korea, massing its naval force in the waters around Korea 
and frequently staging military drills with the South Korean 
puppets in their intensified military actions. 
  Viewing this as dangerous provocative acts intended to carry 
into practice the war scenario which it had rounded off through 
the "Team Spirit" joint war games from long ago for the purpose 
of stifling the socialism of the DPRK with "strength," the 
military analyst says: 
  The escalation of the U.S. military actions against the DPRK 
is an offspring of the strategy of the expansion of arms market 
which had been worked out through "back-door dealings" between 
the U.S. administration and the U.S. war industrial monopolies. 
The officials of the U.S. administration are, without 
exception, servants of big monopolies, especially munitions 
industrial monopolies. Hence their manoeuvres to ignite a war 
on the Korean peninsula and fatten the munitions industrial 
monopolies which find themselves in a sorry plight with the 
shrinkage of the arms market after the end of the cold war. 
  Motivated by these interests, the U.S. military raised the 
curtain of the Korean war scenario and buckled down to its full- 
scale promotion. 
  Now a very grave situation which might touch off a war for a 
slightest casual factor is prevailing on the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. military is shameless enough to harp on "a patient 
diplomatic solution," describing its harebrained anti-DPRK 
military actions as "for self-defense." 
  It is well-known a fact that the United States has down 
through history cried for "a diplomatic solution" before 
invading other countries and then tried to justify its military 
actions. The "active and patient diplomatic solution" vis-a-vis 
the DPRK advertised by the U.S. is nothing but a war diplomacy 
to bring it to its knees and overpower it by armed invasion and 
the socalled "defense" on the lips of the U.S. is no more than a 
smokescreen to conceal its bellicose and aggressive nature. 
  Behind the smokescreen of "self-defense" the United States 
is 
scheming to mass armed forces in and around South Korea and 
venture a military action against the DPRK. 
  But they are committing a mistake. 
  No strong arm works with us. Should the United States and 
its lackeys dare provoke a war, we will answer it with a 
decisive counter blow to defend our socialist system and the 
dignity of our republic. 
  The United States would be well advised not to act rashly or 
forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Greenpeace, the 
international organisation of environmental movement, urged the 
puppet authorities of South Korea to stop the construction 
project of the atomic power station now underway, according to a 
radio report from Seoul. 
  Some 20 members of the organisation raised this demand at an 
anti-nuke rally they held in Samchok on April 14 with about 
1,000 members of environmental protection and anti-nuke 
organisations of South Korea. 
  Sounding a warning against the danger of radioactive leakage 
from the South Korean atomic power station, Greenpeace is 
strongly demanding a stop to its construction project, said the 
radio.

South Korea held a rally in Seoul on April 16 against the 
treacherous farm market opening by the traitor Kim Yong-sam, 
according to a foreign press report. 
  After the rally, they went over to a demonstration and 
marched toward the U.S. Embassy in Sejong Street, Seoul, 
clashing with riot police and shouting "Yankees, Go Home" and 
"Oppose Foreign Farm Goods". 
  The protesters carried U.S. flags with an "x" drawn across 
them to show their anti-American resolution.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Cho Il-min, chief of 
the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National Democratic 
Front (Hanminjon), issued a statement to the press on April 18 
on the lapse of 34 years since the April 19 popular uprising. 
  The heroic April popular uprising involving patriotic 
students and people of various strata of South Korea was a 
historical event that marked a brilliant victory in the struggle 
of the South Korean people to overthrow the Syngman Rhee 
dictatorial "regime" and build a national independent government 
free from subjugation and fascism, he said. 
  Pointing out that the colonial fascist repressive rule of 
the 
U.S. imperialists and their stooges is still in force in South 
Korea contrary to the desire and aspirations of the valiant 
participants in the April uprising, he said: 
  "We must kindle fierce flames of struggle once again to 
bring 
the second April 19 uprising to the land of South Korea and oust 
the Kim Yong-sam group from power. 
  "Our Hanminjon will wage a more staunch struggle to drive 
the 
U.S. imperialist aggressors out of South Korea and liquidate 
their colonial rule, holding higher the banner of independence 
against the United States, in the van of the people of all 
strata including students. 
  "For the present, we will expand the mass struggles against 
the rice market opening, the introduction of Patriot missiles 
and the resumption of the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises 
and rapidly develop them into anti-war, anti-nuke, anti-American 
struggles. 
  "We will certainly accomplish the cause of national 
reunification in the 90s by smashing all the anti-nation and 
anti-independence moves of the splittists at home and abroad, 
upholding the banner of the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country' 
put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song."

<F P=106> ["34th Anniversary of April 19 Uprising Marked" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Hyongyang citizens and 
students held a meeting today to commemorate the 34th 
anniversary of the April 19 uprising of the South Korean people. 
  The heroic popular uprising in South Korea on April 19, 
1960, 
was a massive anti-America, anti-fascist resistance against the 
U.S. imperialists' colonial domination and their stooges' 
fascist suppressive rule and for independent and democratic new 
politics, new system and new life. 
  In his report Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central 
Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, 
said the April popular uprising developed the anti-America, 
anti-fascist struggle and national reunification movement of the 
South Korean students and people to a new stage and fully 
demonstrated worldwide their indomitable, patriotic spirit. 
  He said the desire of the uprisers had not yet been realised 
in South Korea because the U.S. imperialists were still pursuing 
the old policy of keeping hold on South Korea as their colony. 
  He said: 
  "The United States has not only failed to implement the 
DPRK-U.S. joint statement but also reversed the simultaneous 
action steps agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, 
made the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive under an 
unreasonable pretext and egged some dishonest officials of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on to take `the nuclear 
issue' of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council in a 
bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK by abusing the name of the 
United Nations. The United States has brought nuclear war 
equipment including Patriot missiles into South Korea and massed 
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and many warships in the 
waters around the Korean peninsula. This indicates that the 
United States is seeking a solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula with `strength.' 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group has engaged in flunkeyist and 
treacherous acts, following outside forces, suppressed the 
pro-reunification patriotic forces, acted a shock brigade in the 
`nuclear' clamor against the DPRK, chiming in with the United 
States in its strategy of a nuclear war, to extremely 
deteriorate the North-South relations and bring the danger of 
nuclear war to the Korean peninsula. 
  "All the compatriots in the North, South and overseas must 
rise up as one in the nationwide struggle for national 
reunification through confederacy and open a new phase for the 
country's reunification this year, united closely under the 
banner of `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunification of the country,' irrespective of 
idea, political view, religious belief, political grouping, 
classes and strata and property status."

League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Central Committee, at 
a meeting marking the 34th anniversary of the 19 April uprising 
of the South Korean people held at Pyongyang's Central Workers 
Hall on 19 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The United States is not 
fulfilling the DPRK-U.S. joint statement which was agreed with 
us. Moreover, it overturned the steps of simultaneous action 
[tongsi haengdong chochi] which was agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York, aborted the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks 
by giving unreasonable excuses, and is scheming to isolate and 
stifle [apsal] our Republic under the name of the United Nations 
by laying our nuclear issue before the UN Security Council and 
instigating some insidious officials of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  On top of that, while babbling that it will not rule out a 
preemptive military attack against North Korea, the U.S. 
bellicose class is bringing in nuclear war equipment, including 
Patriot missiles, to South Korea. Also, it is concentrating 
nuclear aircraft carriers and many military vessels around our 
country's neighboring waters. 
  This clearly shows that the United States does not have the 
will to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
through peaceful means, and that it is trying to resolve it 
through force. 
  The hostile policy toward Korea by the U.S. imperialists is 
being all the more promoted by the South Korean nation-selling 
traitors and is bringing about a more grave situation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The first and second 
issues of the South Korean magazine HUMAN RIGHTS of 1994 
reported that the South Korean headquarters for the promotion of 
the repatriation of old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan which was 
formed in June last year has conducted brisk activities 
demanding the repatriation of these two old men, long-term 
prisoners who have refused to be converted. 
  This headquarters involves the human rights committee of the 
Council of Christian Churches, human rights committees of Roman 
Catholic and Buddhist organisations, the bar association for a 
Democratic Society, the Council of Family Movement for Realising 
Democracy and other civilian human rights organisations, and 
human rights committees and dissident organisations in Taejon 
and Kwangju. 
  After its inauguration, it sent appeals to the South Korean 
"minister of the Unification Board" and presidents of the 
International Red Cross and of the South Korean Red Cross, 
strongly demanding the repatriation of the two unconverted 
long-term prisoners to the northern half of Korea. 
  A statement of the headquarters carried in the magazine 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS said old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must have been 
repatriated at the time of exchange of POWs according to the 
Geneva Conventions because they were taken prisoners during the 
war, but they had been submitted for trial by the 
"court-martial" and made to suffer in prison for scores of 
years. It strongly urged the South Korean authorities to return 
the two old men to the North as soon as possible.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- A committee for the 
promotion of the repatriation of old Kim Yong-tae, a long-term 
prisoner who has refused to be converted, is now active in South 
Korea, according to the South Korean magazine "HUMAN RIGHTS" 
Nos. 1 and 2 of 1994. 
  Hailing from Chongju, North Phyongan Province, he 
volunteered 
to join in the People's Army at the age of 18 when the U.S. 
imperialists unleashed the war of aggression against Korea in 
1950. 
  He was wounded on the front and taken prisoner. He should 
have been repatriated to the northern half of Korea according to 
the Geneva Convention. But, he has not been sent back to the 
North due to the unlawful acts of the South Korean puppet clique 
and had to serve a prison term of 33 years in South Korea for 
his refusal to be converted. 
  A committee for the promotion of the repatriation of old Kim 
Yong-tae centering on a Christian organisation was formed early 
in December last year. 
  According to the magazine, Kim Yong-tae in a recent letter 
to 
the president of the International Red Cross said that although 
he was released from prison, he was making his living by 
toilsome work for many hours at a rough-work place as a lonely 
and old disabled man without his relatives, chained by the "law 
on supervision for public peace." He asked for help, saying that 
it was his cherished desire to meet his relatives once before he 
died.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting 
chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, 
in a letter sent today to Kang Yong-hun, president of the South 
Korean Red Cross, urged the South side once again to show a 
positive response at an early date to the reasonable demand of 
the North for an immediate repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan, prisoners of war. 
  The letter says: 
  The South side in a telephone message December 3 last year 
turned down the reasonable demand of the North for the 
repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, contending that they 
did not belong to the category of prisoners of war because of 
their guerrilla activities and acceptance of nationality. Its 
wrong attitude and assertion are quite contrary to the 
humanitarianism of Red Cross. 
  According to international law, those who are arrested by 
the 
warring party while in action are to be considered prisoners of 
war, be they soldiers or guerrillas. Therefore, Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan must be treated as prisoners of war and should have 
been repatriated under the Korean Armistice Agreement. 
  The South side's refusal of their repatriation on the ground 
of their nationality acceptance shows that it acts contrary to 
the humanitarianism of Red Cross, manipulated by some seditious 
forces that dislike national reconciliation and unity. 
  As you know, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not want to live 
in 
South Korea and have already asked the International Committee 
of the Red Cross to help them in their repatriation to the North. 
  The two daughters of Kim In-so, the sister of Ham Se-hwan in 
her eighties and other family members and relatives in the 
northern half of the country are earnestly wishing their 
repatriation to the North. 
  We hold that the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
who are undeniably prisoners of war, must be realised at an 
early date as required by the Korean Armistice Agreement and the 
international law on prisoners of war, unhindered by any pretext 
or condition.

delegation of old officials of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) headed by Paek Chong-won, 
chairman of the Korean Physical Culture and Sports Federation, 
and the 209th short-term home-visiting group of Korean residents 
in Japan on a visit to the socialist homeland met comrade Yi 
In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, at the People's Palace 
of Culture on April 17. 
  Noting that he had fought, keeping his pledge to the party 
and the leader and the motherland, Comrade Yi In-mo said "we 
will certainly win if we have the revolutionary faith to uphold 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il." 
  The visitors said they would devote their all to the 
national reunification and patriotic work of Chongnyon, 
upholding the leadership of respected Generalissimo Kim Il-song 
and dear Marshal Kim Chong-il with loyalty. 
  They hardened their indomitable will, singing in chorus "We 
will win because you are leading us", a song of faith. 
  On the same day, the delegation of old officials of 
Chongnyon 
met anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters, veterans of the 
fatherland liberation war and those who had rendered meritorious

  [Text] Pyongyang April (KCNA) -- A meeting of 
representatives of the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan (Chongnyon) and its organizations supporting the 
convocation of a national conference proposed at a joint meeting 
of the government, political parties and social organizations of 
the DPRK was held in Tokyo on April 13. 
  The joint meeting held on April 11 proposed to the South 
Korean authorities, political parties, organisations and 
individual figures and overseas Koreans to hold a national 
conference in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15. 
  So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of Chongnyon, in his report at the meeting said the proposal is 
fair and feasible one acceptable to anyone either in view of the 
time or in view of its content. 
  The proposal of the joint meeting for convening a national 
conference enables all Koreans who want national reunification 
to unite as one nation, transcending the difference in idea, 
ideology and system, no matter where they live and what they do, 
and enables not only the authorities but also the compatriots of 
all walks of life in the North and South and overseas to take 
full responsibility for the reunification of the country, he 
said. 
  He strongly demanded that the South Korean authorities 
renounce confrontation and nuclear war exercises and actively 
respond to creating a favorable atmosphere for convening a 
national conference from the stand of great unity of the nation. 
  He called for waging as an all-compatriotic movement the 
struggle to bring to a success the convocation of a national 
conference proposed at the joint meeting. 
  A statement supporting the convocation of a national 
conference was adopted at the meeting.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting 
group of former heads of state and government and politicians of 
different countries led by ex-president of Costa Rica Rodrigo 
Carazo Odio staying in Korea visited the West Sea barrage Friday. 
  The barrage with a 8 km dam across a rough sea tens of 
metres 
deep was built by soldier builders in a matter of 5 years. 
  The head of the visiting-group had this to say: 
  "The West Sea barrage is a monumental edifice for the 
prosperity of the country and the welfare of the people. 
  "The excellent monumental creation can be built only when 
wise guidance, mass strength and technical wisdom are combined. 
I think it is very beneficial for visitors to Korea to see this 
monument. It is because the only people who aspire after peace, 
progress and prosperity can create such a great and magnificent 
monument. It is a creation which serves peace and the promotion 
of people's living." 
  He expressed thanks to the government and people of Korea 
who 
have built the excellent monument showing the massive will and 
strength and leadership as a whole. Executive Director of the 
Summit Council for World Peace Antonio Betancourt wrote in 
visitor's book that the barrage is a great creation showing the 
ardent love of the Korean people for their leader, their country 
and future. 
  On the same day, the visiting group was ushered to the 
recreation ground on Mt. Taesong, where the group spent a 
pleasant time of rest with working people in Pyongyang enjoying 
the April holiday.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Former 
Governor-General of Canada Edward Schreyer on a visit to Korea 
told a press conference here on April 15 that the reports of the 
West about Korea were distorted and the impressions he got from 
his current visit were so deep that they were beyond wordy 
description. 
  "What I have seen in your country is quite different from 
what I have heard through the Western media," he said, and 
continued: 
  "While staying in your country, I have been deeply impressed 
by the fact that the Korean people live with smiles and enjoy 
happiness to the full unlike what I have heard in the West. 
  "Your people live with their own aim and have successfully 
built their country with industrious and creative activities. 
  "The grand and beautiful architectures built by your people 
made me think a great deal. 
  "The wonderful architectures are rich in content and 
peculiar 
in architectural beauty, to say nothing of the external style. 
  "We do not want the outbreak of a war in your country but 
hope that the Korean people will live in peace"

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang-visiting 
group of former heads of state and government and politicians of 
different countries, after going round various places of Korea, 
refuted the false propaganda of Western countries and South 
Korean rulers about the DPRK. 
  The former governor-general of Canada, Edward Schreyer, 
after 
visiting the Panmunjom cooperative farm in the demilitarized 
zone along the military demarcation line said he has learned at 
first hand there that the DPRK does not build arms, contrary to 
so many false reports about it in the West now. 
  He further said: Here on the spot, I found every house is 
occupied, unlike I was told in Seoul. Today I called at any 
house I wanted and saw it is occupied. It is a sheer lie to say 
that nobody lives in this place. 
  The executive director of the Summit Council for World 
Peace, 
Antonio Betancourt, said after going round the farm that they 
were told in the South that nobody except army soldiers lives in 
this place. "But what I have seen here is quite contrary to what 
I heard there," he said. 
  He said those who don't want peace are now making distorted 
reports about the reality of Korea. "The looks of Pyongyang will 
be introduced as it is to many countries by the journalists of 
different countries included in the visiting group," he added. 
  Vice-president of the Summit Council for World Strategy of 
Japan, Togashi Takayoshi, said he has clearly learned through 
the current Korea visit that the Korean people earnestly desire 
peace. 
  Ex-president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Carazo Odio, who is 
heading the visiting group, said after inspecting the West Sea 
barrage that he didn't think the Korean people built this great 
structure to destroy something.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting 
group of former heads of state and government and politicians 
from different countries toured Kaesong Municipality on Sunday. 
  Keenly experiencing the tragedy of national division of the 
Korean people, they expressed their resolution to strive for a 
peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  They, participants in the second meeting of the summit 
council for world peace, were to visit Pyongyang through 
Panmunjom late March. Owing to the obstructions of the South 
Korean authorities, however, they had to make a long detour, 
though this place is no more than 70 km away from Seoul. 
  After inspecting Panmunjom, former President of Costa Rica 
Rodrigo Carazo Odio who is leading the group said he had flown 
to Central America and came here by making a detour of 35,000 km 
through the United States and China because passing through 
Panmunjom was not allowed. "This makes us feel sick at heart," 
he added. 
  Former Governor-General of Canada Edward Schreyer said he 
learned at first hand that Korea is not building armament, 
contrary to what he had heard in the West. "Your country wants 
peace, not a war, and is making a great progress in socialist 
construction," he noted. 
  William Taylor, vice-president of the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies of the United States, said that the 
continued tense military confrontation along the Military 
Demarcation Line may create an unpredictable situation with an 
accidental incident and so, the DPRK and the United States must 
have further talks and find a solution to the matters, promoting 
mutual understanding through talks. After seeing the concrete 
wall built by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
authorities in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line 
bisecting one country, one nation and families into two, the 
guests said they learned well who was the very one blocking the 
reunification of Korea. 
  Noting that the concrete wall is a very torturous one for 
the 
Korean people who are suffering the sorrow of the division for 
nearly 50 years, Antonio Betancourt, executive director of the 
Summit Council for World Peace, stressed that the Summit Council 
for World Peace will strive to achieve the reunification of the 
country, the final aim of the Korean people, through 
international efforts. 
  Togashi Takayoshi, vice-president of the Summit Council for 
World Strategy of Japan, said: "To build even a barrier dividing 
one nation shows that the South Korean authorities pay no heed 
to the nation." 
  That day the guests went round the Panmunjom cooperative 
farm. Noting the South Korean rulers' propaganda that people do 
not live here is a sheer lie, the guests said in unison that 
they could see at first hand the people in the North taking part 
in peaceful construction, not in war preparations.

group of former heads of state and government and politicians of 
different countries led by ex-President of Costa Rica Rodrigo 
Carazo Odio, staying in Korea, visited the Mansudae Art Studio 
on April 18. 
  They saw wonderful porcelains, embroidery articles, 
engravings and Korean paintings created under the wise guidance 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  At the end of the visit, the head of the group wrote in the 
visitor's book that the studio is a comprehensive creative base 
showing how excellent the Korean art and fine arts are. 
  Former Prime Minister of Egypt Aziz Sedky said all the works 
of the studio fully show the Korean art which is very excellent 
and charming. 
  The group visited the Pyongyang metro. 
  After the visit Mark P. Barry, director of Research of the 
Summit Council for World Peace, said this metro is the most 
beautiful, excellent and clean in the world. 
  Noting that the world knows little about this, he said he 
was 
pleased to hear that the metro would be extended in the future. 
  He expressed the belief that it would be not a long time 
before the whole world come to know what a developed country 
Korea is. 
  Earlier, the guests visited the Tower of the Chuche Idea and 
the Korean Central History Museum.

delegations and figures of overseas compatriots from different 
regions and organizations who came here to deliver unanimous 
greetings from overseas compatriots to the great leader. 
  Since he embarked on the road of revoluion, the respected 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song has victoriously led the Korean 
revolution with his outstanding and tested leadership and 
tireless efforts of devotion for a long time. In doing so, he 
performed immortal exploits for the country, the revolution, the 
times, and history. 
  Even today, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song -- with 
extraordinary wisdom, excelled leadership, and lofty popular 
traits -- is vigorously leading our people's struggle for 
socialist construction and the national reunification on a 
correct road of victory, and is directing big efforts for the 
country's ever-lasting prosperity. 
  Thanks to the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song's 
outstanding and tested leadership, our people are powerfully 
demonstrating the superiority of the popular mass-centered 
socialism of our own style; are effecting a constant upswing in 
socialist construction; and are valiantly advancing toward the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the independent and 
peaceful reunification of the country without the slightest 
vacillation under the complex and difficult conditions created 
by the continued challenges and obstructions by the imperialists 
and reactionaries. 
  Independence, peace, and friendship are basic doctrines in 
the foreign policy our party and republic's government have 
consistently carried through. 
  Our party and republic's government, as in the past, will 
invariably and consistently implement the foreign policy of 
independence, peace and friendship, and thus actively contribute 
to the peace and progress of mankind and the world's cause of 
independence. 
  At this meaningful place filled with a sense of boundless 
admiration and warm friendship for the great leader, I propose a 
toast to our fatherland's everlasting prosperity, to our 
nation's eternal happiness, to national reunification, and to 
the completion of the chuche revolutionary cause. 
  I also propose a toast to the long life and good health of 
Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people, 
who is observing the 82d anniversary of his birth; to the health 
of delegations of foreign parties of various countries; and to 
the health of foreign comrades and friends who came to 
congratulate the auspicious holiday of the nation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Should Lead New Trade Framework"] </F>
  [Text] A global trade framework was newly established at 
the GATT Uruguay Round ministerial conference in Marrakech, 
Morocco. 
  The Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiation 
started in Punta del Este, Uruguay, over seven years ago. 
Negotiations were repeatedly deadlocked, but finally achieved a 
historic success. 
  Including agreements on trade, farm products, textile, 
antidumping, and trade subsidies, the Uruguay Round worked out 
documents numbering over 20,000 pages. Thus, the rule book of 
international trade was drastically revised, and new rules were 
provided for farm and service trade, as well as protection of 
intellectual property rights. 
  We would like to extend our congratulations to all persons 
who contributed to the settlement of the unprecedented 
negotiations. The new trade framework will play an important 
role in preventing bloc economy like in the 1930's. 
  The world economy is undergoing fundamental changes. 
Economic growth of industrialized nations is slowing, but such 
nations as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, 
Poland, and Turkey are becoming new key players with stronger 
competition power. 
  In particular, China is demonstrating its presence as a 
major 
economic power that leads fast-growing Asia. Uneven growth in 
the world economy is intensifying frictions and tension between 
existing and new emerging economic powers. 
  In January 1995, GATT will be replaced with the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). As a new watchdog of the free trade system, 
it will mediate trade-related disputes, and fight against 
protectionism and bloc economy. 
  Here, we would like to stress how Japan and the United 
States 
played important roles in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
After the G-7 summit in Tokyo last July, the two nations jointly 
contributed a lot to the successful conclusion of the round. To 
achieve the goal, Japan had to endure great pain of the partial 
liberalization of its rice market. 
  The initiative of Japan and the United States is very 
important for the WTO. Since some quarters in the U.S. Congress 
are against U.S. ratification of the WTO agreement, President 
Bill Clinton is supposed to try his best to obtain support from 
his nation. 
  Meanwhile, during the Marrakech conference, Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor failed 
to agree on a resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. 
  In the "economic reform guideline," Japan has pledged to 
hammer out tangible measures for settling the top three trade 
disputes with the United States -- macroeconomic policy, 
government procurement, and insurance and auto trade -- before 
the end of June. We hope the government will try its best to 
carry out reduction of trade surplus and expansion of imports 
for the sake of the Japanese public. 
  At the same time, we have some requests for the Clinton 
administration. The United States should drop its demand for 
"objective criteria" which may impose restrictions on trade 
partners as target figures. 
  The United States is proposing "labor criteria," which is 
intended for controlling imports from developing nations on the 
pretext of inadequate wage and labor right policies of these 
nations. However, this should not be brought in the new trade 
framework because this is another form of protectionism. 
  Regarding ways of handling trade disputes, the United States 
should not lean on unilateral measures such as the Super 301 
provision (which stipulates sanctions against unfair trade 
practices of specific nations). Such an attitude is to neglect 
the WTO's grievance mechanism from the starting point. 
  Aggressive market opening policies may bring about 
deindustrialization, but Japan cannot be free from competition 
in the world market. Based on a concept that the free trade 
system makes the world prosperous, both Japan and the United 
States must overcome temptation of protectionism, and jointly 
support the WTO at any rate. 
  Such positive approaches will benefit Japanese and U.S. 
public eventually.

  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, commented on his talks with U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor in Morocco last week at a news conference 
on 18 April. He said, "There were certain misunderstandings 
between us, but we have deepened our understanding (through the 
talks)." He stressed that the talks resolved misunderstandings 
and were beneficial. 
  With regard to the Japanese and U.S. positions on "objective 
criteria," which constituted the greatest point of disagreement 
at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, Hata said, "We 
have come to understand fully what the other side thinks." He 
further stated that he has come to understand that the United 
States is not obsessed with the so-called "numerical targets" -- 
such as market shares.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The United States has 
hinted that if North Korea refuses to allow additional nuclear 
checks before the end of April, it will go its own way to impose 
sanctions on the Stalinist state even before the United Nations 
adopts any resolution and seek Japanese cooperation in that 
case, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. 
  Quoting both Japanese and American diplomatic sources, the 
newspaper said the idea had been put to Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata by U.S. Vice President Al Gore during last week's meeting 
in Marrakech, Morocco, to sign the Uruguay Round trade accord. 
  Gore, noting that North Korea's nuclear program has a 
greater 
impact on Japan's security than his own country's, suggested 
that the United States might impose sanctions on its own if 
North Korea failed to permit additional IAEA (International 
Atomic Energy Agency) inspections of its suspected nuclear sites 
by the end of April, the report said. 
  Foreign Minister Hata told the vice president that Japan 
would examine the plan but did not give him an immediate answer 
in view of the need for the ruling coalition to first coordinate 
policy differences among its member parties in naming a new 
prime minister to replace the outgoing Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Entering the equation is a demand made by Shinseito, a major 
party in the coalition, which called for strong measures Monday 
to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, it added. But a 
basic strategy proposed by the Nihon Shinto, another party of 
the coalition, urges "responsible Japanese action according to 
U.N. policy" in handling the issue: This would preclude 
Japanese cooperation in any U.S. sanctions imposed before U.N. 
action. 
  Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scenes strongman in 
the coalition, met Foreign Minister Hata -- a likely bet to 
succeed Hosokawa as prime minister -- at the latter's office on 
Tuesday, raising speculation that they discussed dealing with 
North Korea when Hata becomes prime minister.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 18 (ANTARA) -- Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn is asking Indonesia as chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement (NAM) to help settle the problem of continuing United 
Nations' economic sanctions against his country, Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said here on Monday. 
  "Iraq maintains that the sanctions should have been stopped 
long ago as Baghdad has complied with all UN Security Council 
resolutions including those on non-proliferation of nuclear and 
chemical weapons," the minister told the press after a meeting 
with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Sa'id al-Sahhaf. 
  Alatas said a letter from the Iraqi President containing the 
request would be handed to President Suharto by Sahhaf on 
Tuesday. 
  He said Indonesia had been closely following developments 
involving Iraq and made informal approaches to other NAM member 
countries to collect their views on Iraq's stance that it had 
implemented all of the Security Council's resolutions. 
  "We have the impression that Iraq has carried out all 
resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council. Yet the UN 
economic sanctions have continued to be in force," Alatas said. 
  "Indonesia as chairman of NAM will certainly attend to 
matter 
and, after an in-depth study, make efforts to help resolve it," 
Alatas said, adding that all decisions on the steps NAM would 
take to help Iraq would be made by President Suharto.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai soldiers yesterday fired eight 
mortar shells into Cambodia after five rockets believed to have 
been fired by Cambodian government gunners landed in a Thai 
village at Ban Saensuk of Tambon Khlong Namsai. 
  One rocket fell on the house of Samran Ploimali, 30, and the 
shrapnel slightly injured her daughter, Sirikanya, 12. 
  Thai gunners at first fired a smoke shell to warn Cambodian 
troops but Cambodian gunners, stationed at kilometre 4 on 
Highway No. 5, refused to heed the warning and kept on firing 
artillery, mortar and rocket-launchers at the Khmer Rouge 
stronghold at Phnum Malai with stray shells landing in Thailand, 
according to Thai sources. 
  Thai gunners then fired eight mortar shells into Cambodia. 
  It is not known whether the shells caused any casualties 
among Phnom Penh troops.

  [Text] Members of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to file a resolution resisting 
social clauses in trade agreements with the International Labor 
Organization. 
  Labor officials of the nations who attended the ASEAN 
Sub-Committee on Labor Affairs (ASCLA) meeting decided to bring 
up the matter during the International Labor Conference (ILC) in 
June. 
  ASCLA Chairman Bienvenido Laguesma said the social clauses, 
which are standards or conditions imposed on developing 
countries before they are granted trade access, are "stringent 
standards for developing nations." 
  He said "the ASEAN countries' stage of development is not 
sufficient enough for us to be able to comply with the 
conditions they have made." 
  "We also have to consider the cultural differences of each 
country involved. A practice in our country may be considered 
child or forced labor by other countries when, in fact, our 
culture dictates otherwise which only shows that we have a 
different situation from them," he added. 
  Last February, the European Parliament issued a resolution 
which provides for the inclusion of social clauses in 
international trade agreements designed to combat child and 
forced labor . 
  Mr. Laguesma said "the motive is good but the standards are 
too high. It's one way of keeping developing countries from 
gaining trade access and competing against developed countries." 
  He also said the move of ASEAN countries to file the 
resolution is "important because this could mean that the ILC 
will he adopting several measures as instrument to resolve the 
issue. 
  He added that last year, ASEAN attempted to file a similar 
resolution. Unfortunately, it was not tackled because there 
were other more important issues on the agenda. 
  At the same time, the member countries agreed to consider 
the 
possibility of holding dialogues with the International Trade 
Secretariats (ITS) to diffuse the tension between the parties. 
  ITS are countries or group of countries that regulate or 
determine which imports could enter their market. 
  If standards of the ITS are not met, they can impose trade 
sanctions, either by reducing the quota or banning the 
importation of products from the countries that have not 
complied with the conditions.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video on DPRK President Kim </F>
Il-song's written reply to NHK inquiries; and interview with 
DPRK Major General Kim Yong-chol by "Western news media" on 18 
April -- place not given; Major General Kim speaks in Korean, 
with Japanese subtitles; translated from the Japanese; from "NHK 
News 7" program] 
  [Text] Today, North Korean President Kim Il-song provided 
written answers to questions from NHK. In the written response, 
President Kim said the nuclear issue will be settled if the 
United States abides by the agreement between the two countries. 
In this way, he called on the United States again to 
unconditionally reopen high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. [Begin report 
from Pyongyang by Toshiro Kishi] [video shows still photos of 
Kim Il-song] President Kim said as follows: The United States 
is applying pressure on us by wrongly accusing North Korea, who 
has never had nuclear weapons and who even accepted inspections 
by the international organization. The United States also 
deployed nuclear weapons in the South and is intimidating North 
Korea with nuclear threat. It is the United States who has been 
fueling suspicion about North Korea developing nuclear weapons. 
Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can only be 
settled through direct talks between North Korea and the United 
States. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can be settled 
smoothly if both North Korea and the United States observe and 
carry out the principles clearly shown in the joint statement 
between the two countries. We only hope that the United States 
will sincerely abide by these principles together with us. Of 
late, Japan is strengthening its policy of treating the DPRK as 
an enemy nation by taking advantage of the anti-DPRK racket 
[sawagi], in which the United States claims that North Korea is 
developing nuclear weapons. In order to improve and formalize 
the relations between the DPRK and Japan, the Japanese 
Government should stop considering North Korea as an enemy and 
abandon its anti-DPRK stance. Prospects for improving relations 
between North Korea and Japan will emerge only when the Japanese 
Government actually changes its policies toward the DPRK. [end 
recording] 
  In this connection, Major General Kim Yong-chol of the North 
Korean Defense Department held an interview today [18 April] 
with Western news media, including NHK, and said as follows: 
[Begin Kim Yong-chol recording] [video shows General Kim in 
military uniform] The United States has not made it clear 
whether or not nuclear weapons are still deployed in South 
Korea. This suggests that nuclear arms have not been removed 
from South Korea. I believe that nuclear weapons in South Korea 
can be used at any moment. A U.S. aircraft carrier armed with 
more than 50 nuclear warheads has made a port call at Yokosuka 
in Japan. These factors represent a nuclear threat against 
North Korea. [end Kim Yong-chol recording] 
  [Begin Kishi recording] As you have just heard, North Korea 
is saying they cannot believe the United States has taken away 
nuclear warheads from South Korea. As for the nuclear issue, it 
is inevitable that the UNSC will discuss early next month the 
possibility of imposing economic sanctions against North Korea 
if North Korea does not accept additional inspections by the 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. Because of this, 
attention is focused on how North Korea will act next. As far 
as the written response President Kim Il-song sent to NHK today, 
and comments by authorities concerned, it is almost impossible 
to imagine that North Korea will unconditionally accept further 
nuclear inspection. 
  As a condition of returning to the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty issue, it has been disclosed that North Korea is calling 
for removal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella on Japan and the ROK. 
Because of this, we can say it has become difficult for the 
United States to seek a compromise on further nuclear 
inspections by resuming dialogue with North Korea for the time 
being. Therefore, it seems difficult to settle the North Korean 
nuclear issue at a stroke before the UNSC holds its meeting 
early next month. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The United States Must Stop the </F>
Maneuver To Deploy the Patriot Missiles"] 
  [Text] The U.S. imperialists' maneuver to provoke a nuclear 
war in South Korea is being taken to a very grave stage. 
According to a report, the first Patriot missile unit, 
consisting of 48 missiles and some 800 soldiers, will arrive in 
South Korea sometime this week and will be deployed in 
accordance with U.S. Defense Department orders. 
  According to another report, the second Patriot missile unit 
will soon be dispatched to the Korean peninsula. As it has 
already been reported, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will make a 
junket to South Korea this week and will hold discussions with 
the South Korean puppet defense minister on the situation on the 
Korean peninsula. This shows that the situation on the Korean 
peninsula is heading all the more toward the brink of war. 
  As it is known, the United States and the South Korean 
puppets decided to gradually deploy the Patriot missiles to 
South Korea beginning in October 1994. Nevertheless, the United 
States is starting to deploy them to South Korea from the middle 
of this month, six months earlier than scheduled. 
  What does this show? This shows that the United States is 
trying to provoke a nuclear war in Korea without fail by finding 
fault with our nonexistent nuclear issue. 
  As it is known, the U.S. military is drawing up an 
aggressive 
war plan to bring in 600,000 aggressive forces, over 200 
vessels, and over 1,600 airplanes--including two Marine Corps 
divisions--from the continental U.S. within 80 days in event of 
an emergency on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets are assuming a posture of attack by 
even making public their plan to invade the North under the new 
strategy plan 5027 which had been kept secret up until now. 
  We cannot but take seriously the remarks made by U.S. 
Defense 
Secretary Perry who openly said that the possibility of a 
preemptive military strike on North Korea will not be ruled out 
and that he is ready to risk a war. The U.S. Patriot missile 
units are arriving in South Korea at such a time. 
  U.S. military officials are lecturing that the Patriot 
missiles they introduced are defensive weapons to prepare 
against an attack. That is merely a deceptive talk to disguise 
their aggressive nature. The Patriot missiles are of an improved 
type and their threat varies with the type of warheads 
installed. This proves that Patriot missiles are not simply 
defensive weapons but can also be used as offensive weapons to 
strike the opponent. 
  Patriot missiles are being deployed to South Korea at a time 
when the United States has moved numerous Navy carriers around 
the Korean peninsula, has put them in a ready posture for 
immediate deployment at any time, and is trying to conduct the 
Team Spirit joint military exercise by all means. This shows 
that the risk of a nuclear war in our country is approaching a 
visible reality. 
  There is no guarantee that the United States would not 
attack 
us with Patriot missiles after putting the South Korean war 
maniacs in the front to ignite the fuse of war. Our people 
cannot but heighten an equivalent alert regarding the reinforced 
commotion of military power buildup in South Korea coinciding 
with the U.S. defense secretary's junket to South Korea. 
  If the United States continues to build up military power 
indiscriminately despite our repeated warnings and chooses the 
direction of a nuclear war in the end, it will sustain a staunch 
punishment [tanhohan chingbol] by our people. 
  The aggressors will only be met with bitter defeat and 
deaths.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Brands U.S. Defense Secretary's Visit to </F>
South Korea as Dangerous War Trip" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today condemns the upcoming visit to South Korea of U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry as a dangerous war trip 
intended to increase military pressure on the DPRK, push the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain 
and unleash a war on the pretext of the "Nuclear Issue". 
  In a commentary entitled "War Trip of a Bellicose Element" 
the analyst says: 
  After his assumption of office as Secretary of Defense Perry 
raved that the North's "nuclear development" should be stopped 
even at the risk of another war on the Korean peninsula and that 
during his tour of South Korea he would not merely seek measures 
for "military sanctions" but discuss in detail when, how and why 
such military steps must be taken. 
  This tells that his visit to South Korea will be a trip for 
commanding the frontline to reorganize the wartime system for 
the execution of their already mapped-out scenario of war 
against the North and a trip for operational discussion to form 
combined forces against the North. 
  It must not go unnoticed that Perry, a boss of war fanatics, 
is coming to South Korea at a time when the U.S. imperialists 
have massed their huge aggression forces in and around South 
Korea to inflict the scourge of a nuclear war upon the Korean 
nation. 
  Perry's tour of South Korea is also a trip of plunder to 
further subjugate South Korea to the United States militarily, 
while keying up the tensions by taking issue with the North, and 
fleecing the South Korean people through the shipment of their 
stockpiled munitions. 
  Perry had once kept close contacts with big military 
industrial businesses, while taking charge of military hardware 
until some time ago since the mid-1960s. It is clear that Perry 
with such a career behind him is coming to visit South Korea 
with the aim of deliberately aggravating the situation on the 
Korean peninsula and turning South Korea into a U.S. arms 
exhibition so as to make munitions businesses rake in profits 
and further militarize the South Korean economy and with the aim 
of forcing the puppets to pay more for the maintenance of the 
U.S. forces present in South Korea. 
  There is no doubt that the bellicose U.S. military boss and 
the "civilian" warmaniacs of South Korea will have nothing to 
discuss but war when they sit face to face and peace and 
reunification of Korea will subsequently face a more grave 
threat. 
  We are following with vigilance the warmaniac's ill-boding 
trip to South Korea. 
  If the aggressors and the traitors open the fire first, they 
would have to pay dearly for it.

<F P=106> [Alexander Nicoll report: "Asia Set in Economic Fast Lane"] </F>
  [Text] Asia's economic boom is set to continue over the 
next two years although China remains at risk from overheating 
and India needs to enact further far-reaching reforms, the Asian 
Development Bank [ADB] said yesterday. 
  The annual Asian Development Outlook published by the 
Manila-based institution forecast robust growth for Asia even 
though recovery in the industrialised world, the market for many 
Asian exports, was expected to be slow. 
  Growth was expected to be strong in all the main east and 
south-east Asian economies outside Japan. Even the Philippines, 
the laggard of recent years, is forecast to accelerate 
substantially. South Asia is also likely to see healthy though 
unspectacular expansion. 
  Overall, Asia's developing countries are expected to grow 
7.2 
per cent in each of 1994 and 1995 -- compared with the bank's 
estimate for world growth of 1.8 per cent this year and 3 per 
cent in 1995. Last year the figures were 7.4 per cent for Asia 
and 0.6 per cent for the world. 
  China, which has seen 13 per cent growth in each of the past 
two years, is forecast to slow to 10 per cent this year and 9 
per cent in 1995. But the ADB warned: "For the next two years, 
money supply and bank credit should be tightly controlled to 
help prevent economic overheating." Failure to prevent 
overheating could seriously undermine financial sector reforms 
now under way, it said. 
  The ADB saw potential for rapid growth in India, which has 
also undertaken sweeping economic reform. However, it called 
for faster progress on tax and subsidies, restructuring of the 
public sector and policy on closure of lossmaking companies. 
  "The prospects for the Indian economy will depend on its 
success in accomplishing a range of far-reaching and politically 
sensitive changes," it said. 
  The bank forecast a resurgence of growth in South Korea and 
Taiwan and sustained rapid expansion in south-east Asia. 
  However, the bank noted that poverty remained a serious 
problem in many Asian countries. 
  It also warned that Aids was a growing threat to the region, 
with India and Thailand each feared likely to have 1m [1 milion] 
people infected with the HIV virus by the end of the century.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] U.S. monetary authorities are increasingly pursuing 
a tight money policy following the economic recovery. Asked to 
comment on the U.S. tight money policy at a news conference on 
19 April, Finance Minister Hiroshi Fujii said, "I have no 
intention of commenting on another nation's monetary policy." 
Being affected by the U.S. tight money policy, Japan's bond 
prices plummeted and long-term interest rates jumped on 19 
April. Influenced by a fall in stock prices in the United 
States, the yen has further appreciated against the dollar. At 
the news conference, Finance Minister Fujii did not raise any 
objection to the "U.S. tight money policy aimed at keeping 
inflation in check" but rather expressed his understanding of 
the U.S. policy. 
  The G-7 talks of finance ministers and central bank 
governors 
[to be held on 24 April in Washington, D.C.] will almost 
certainly take up for discussion the issue of high long-term 
interest rates worldwide. The Finance Ministry and the Bank of 
Japan for now have no intention of claiming at the G-7 summit 
talks that the U.S. tight money policy has triggered a worldwide 
rise in long-term interest rates and that the policy has 
adversely affected the world economy. The Bank of Japan says: 
"The United States is raising long-term interest rates to rein 
in inflation. If the tight money policy generates the effect of 
curbing inflation and if the U.S. economy stays stable for a 
long time, long-term interest rates will go down." 
  The Finance Ministry takes the view that "monetary 
authorities can only manipulate short-term interest rates, and 
long-term interest rates are determined on the financial market" 
(according to the International Financial Bureau). The Finance 
Ministry stresses that the high long-term interest rates in the 
United States will not become a major item on the agenda of the 
G-7 talks. 
  The Japanese Government has almost firmed up Japan's stand 
at 
the G-7 talks. At the G-7 talks, Japan will stress two points: 
1) The Japanese economy is increasingly showing signs of a 
recovery, and Japan has steadily been taking steps to expand 
domestic demand; and 2) Japan has been promoting improvement in 
its economic structure while mapping out in March a package of 
measures to spur its economy. Japan intends to stress the two 
points in a bid to avoid being criticized at the G-7 talks for 
its huge trade surplus. The Japanese Government takes the view 
that it is a good policy for Japan to take the position of 
explaining its domestic measures rather than commenting on the 
economic policies of the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations. 
  If Japan clumsily criticizes at the G-7 talks the United 
States for pursuing its tight money policy, it would come under 
a barrage of criticism from other nations for its trade surplus, 
which hit a record high in 1993. In particular, the United 
States is still strongly discontented with Japan's failure to 
cut taxes more deeply and to take more aggressive steps to 
correct the trade imbalance between the two countries. 
  Japan's "huge sums of trade surplus" have become its weak 
point. Japan is different from European nations that are in a 
position to express relatively candidly their concerns over the 
step taken by the United States to raise long-term interest 
rates. Japan will be placed in a difficult position at the G-7 
talks. 
  Japan's long-term interest rates are not necessarily 
affected 
directly by U.S. long-term interest rates. The recent increase 
in Japan's long-term interest rates was triggered by Japan's own 
financial factors. Japan's long-term interest rates have been 
increasing since January, when the government announced plans to 
sell bonds to raise funds to finance public works projects for 
economic stimulation. 
  The high long-term interest rates in the United States have 
increased Japanese enterprises' cost of raising funds. Japan's 
high long-term interest rates, coupled with the appreciating 
yen, will undermine Japan's economy, which is just showing signs 
of bottoming out. Private sector banking institutes are voicing 
concerns that the high U.S. long-term interest rates will have 
an adverse impact on bond prices in Japan and on the yen's 
exchange rate against the dollar.

  [Text] During talks with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakech, U.S. Vice President Gore 
asked that if the United States imposes independent sanctions on 
North Korea prior to the UN Security Council doing so, will 
Japan cooperate with the U.S. sanctions? This was disclosed on 
18 April by a diplomatic source familiar with Japan-U.S. 
relations. 
  According to the diplomatic source, Vice President Gore 
stressed to Foreign Minister Hata: "North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons is a graver issue for Japanese 
security than for the United States." During his talks with 
Foreign Minister Hata, Vice President Gore also said that if 
North Korea refuses to accept further inspections of its nuclear 
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the 
United States may impose its own sanctions against North Korea; 
he asked for Japan's aggressive cooperation with the U.S. 
sanctions. In response, the foreign minister promised to study 
if Japan should cooperate with sanctions. However, the foreign 
minister refrained from giving an immediate answer, and 
explained Japan's political situation by saying: "North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons is high on the agenda 
of consultations among the ruling coalition parties as regards 
the basic policies of the new government." 
  At an 18 April meeting of representatives of the ruling 
coalition parties to discuss the basic policies of a new 
government, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] demanded a change in 
the basic policy of dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development on the basis of the U.S. request. The basic policy, 
the contents of which were changed at Shinseito's request, says: 
"Japan will act in accordance with UN policy." Says a 
concerned official in Tokyo, Shinseito is believed to have 
demanded a change in the basic policy after concluding Japan 
would be helpless when it needs to cooperate with the United 
States in enforcing the sanctions.

  [Text] Delivering a lecture at a Tokyo hotel on 18 April, 
Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin referred to China's role 
concerning the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons. He stressed: "The issue should be settled 
between the parties concerned. The international community 
should not expect too much from China." In this way he 
indicated that there is certain limitation to China's role. 
  The ambassador made it clear that China's basic position 
that 
the Korean peninsula should be denuclearized and nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
should be carried out remains unchanged. But he added: "The 
issue should be settled through patient dialogue, and we do not 
agree to the idea of applying pressure, such as economic 
sanctions," thus holding a move toward imposing economic 
sanctions against North Korea in check.

  [Text] The "Defense Issues Forum" (with Kotaro Higuchi as 
chairman), a private advisory council to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, held its seventh meeting at the Prime Minister's 
Official Residence on 18 April to discuss various issues such as 
the current situation concerning UN peacekeeping operation (PKO) 
activities and the creation of a new organization to promote PKO 
participation and disarmament and arms control. As advocated by 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SPDJ] and other parties, 
the argument for a new organization for PKO participation 
concerns the concept of creating a new organization other than 
the Self-Defense Forces. 
  Chairman Higuchi said that in the course of the discussions, 
a majority of the panel members voiced their opposition to the 
plan. For example, one said, "When the United Nation requests 
the dispatch of military personnel, the military ranks of the 
personnel are specified." And another said: "Even if a new 
organization should be created, it would be considered by the 
international community to be a military force and its members 
to be servicemen. Therefore, it will not be efficient to take 
the trouble to create a new organization."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Coalition Government Aims Only To Stay in </F>
Power"] 
  [Text] The political situation has been mired in turmoil 
triggered by Prime Minister Hosokawa's announcement of his 
intention to resign. Now that the ruling coalition parties have 
moved closer to reaching an agreement in which they will 
maintain the coalition government and choose Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Hata as the successor to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, the political turmoil has begun to show signs 
of subsiding. If things go smoothly, a new prime minister will 
be named and a new government inaugurated early next week. 
  The prime minister's personal financial scandal triggered 
the 
collapse of the coalition government. However, in fact the 
Hosokawa government was on the verge of collapse after rapidly 
losing its centripetal force [kyushinryoku] following enactment 
of the Political Reform Law, which was high on the domestic 
agenda of the Hosokawa government. The ruling coalition parties 
were feuding over such major issues as reshuffling the cabinet 
and planning a national welfare tax; the cabinet lost its 
cohesiveness. The confrontation among the ruling coalition 
parties stemmed from their policy differences, their different 
policy-decision processes, their different political tactics, 
and their diverging perspective of the coalition government. 
  Their confrontation abruptly surfaced in the wake of 
Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation. The confrontation 
could lead to a change in the coalition framework. There is 
significance in the Hosokawa government bringing about a change 
of government after ending one-party rule by the Liberal 
Democratic Party. The ruling coalition parties that were united 
by their consensus on the need to push for political reform 
formed the coalition government. Now that the Political Reform 
Law has been enacted, the Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its 
primary mission. 
  We hope all political parties will use Hosokawa's 
resignation 
as the best chance to rally political forces around a consensus 
of policies and political beliefs, transcending the framework of 
the LDP or non-LDP, in order to realign themselves. Even if the 
coalition partners formed another new coalition government to 
stay in power, their energy would be consumed coordinating the 
infighting, leaving key policy tasks unaccomplished. Politics 
would ultimately reach the point where politicians ratify policy 
decisions made by bureaucrats. 
  While Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]; Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito; 
and former Deputy Prime Minister Watanabe of the LDP are making 
visible moves, Sakigake [Harbinger] has announced a party 
platform entitled "our party's basic attitude toward forming a 
new government." These moves are aimed at realigning the 
established political parties based on a consensus of policies 
and political beliefs. 
  Under the present situation, where the Diet's deliberation 
of 
a draft budget for fiscal 1994 has yet to be held, it is 
necessary to form a new government as soon as possible and keep 
the current political turmoil from being protracted. In that 
sense, there is not enough time left to choose a candidate to 
succeed Hosokawa as prime minister and form a new government, 
all of which could lead to a full-fledged realignment of the 
political parties. If a new prime minister is chosen under the 
present coalition framework, the action may be accepted 
positively by the people as an emergency evacuation. 
  The ruling coalition parties lost their common policy goals 
following enactment of the Political Reform Law. What are they 
going to do in a post-Hosokawa government? The ruling coalition 
parties widely differ from each other on how to reform the 
current tax system, how to handle North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development, how to shape an identical view on the 
state, and how to realign the established political parties. It 
would be lamentable if the adhesive that until now has held the 
ruling coalition parties together is also used as a mean to keep 
them in power--in other words, to keep the LDP from taking power. 
  The political upheaval is beginning to subside because the 
ruling coalition parties have found it is in their interests to 
keep the coalition framework from collapsing, deciding to give 
priority to keeping themselves in power while shelving their 
differences over major policies and basic political beliefs. 
They have decided to do so based on the calculation they will 
face difficulty maneuvering for a majority of seats in the Diet, 
and do not want to abandon their savory positions as ruling 
parties. If the coalition government remains in power with its 
basic policy differences left uncoordinated, it will be a 
temporary government tasked with getting the 1994 budget passed 
in the Diet. Sooner or later, there will be full-fledged moves 
to realign the political parties.

<F P=106> [Article by freelance commentator Taro Yayama in "Fair </F>
Argument" column: "Do Not Easily Compromise on Forming New 
Government"] 
  [Text] The LDP Versus Non-LDP Structure Is Outdated 
  The ruling parties seem to have been split into two due to 
differences in their positions on how to form the next 
government following Hosokawa. Now that the situation has 
become serious, they should not make any compromise to patch 
things up. It is fervently hoped that all Diet members will be 
fully aware of the current political situation and consider what 
Japan is required to do, and what they have to do. 
  Carrying out political reform -- which the two previous 
cabinets failed to carry out -- is the greatest political 
achievement of the Hosokawa government. However, it can be said 
that political reform has not been completed until redistricting 
for new constituencies is decided and the effective date of the 
new electoral system is set. Among conservatives within the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ], some want to see political reform canceled by 
holding a general election after the Diet dissolution under the 
current multiple-seat constituency system. Therefore, 
regardless of what sort of cabinet the next government will be, 
the Diet should not be dissolved until the new electoral system 
is completely established. 
  The biggest immediate problem facing Japan is the issue of 
North Korea. The United Nations is about to implement sanctions 
against North Korea which is suspected of developing nuclear 
weapons. Although I hope this issue will be settled peacefully, 
I cannot help wondering what action Japan will take if the 
United Nations should decide on sanctions. Senator William Roth 
(of the Republican Party), who is versed in Japanese affairs, 
stresses: "If Japan does not take any action, the Japan-U.S. 
Security Treaty will be just a piece of paper." The government 
is required to realize the possibility that if Japan, which 
advocates UN-centered policies, should fail to comply with the 
United Nations' possible decision on economic sanctions, not 
only will its loyalty to the United Nations be called into 
question -- and thus Japan will be isolated from the 
international community -- but also the United States will 
review its security treaty with Japan. Japan's evasion of its 
responsibility by providing financial contributions, like during 
the Persian Gulf war, will not be allowed this time. In order 
to completely discontinue exchanges of things, money and people 
with North Korea, it is necessary to review all the existing 
laws and at the same time legislate new laws. The North Korean 
issue is an important problem that tests Japan's ability to deal 
with a crisis. Actually, instructions should have already been 
given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to ministries and 
agencies to study how to deal with the North Korean issue. 
However, Mr. Takemura, who has close relations with North 
Korea, has not done anything about it. Although there have been 
calls for Mr. Takemura to be chosen as prime minister, it is an 
absurd view. It may be all right to choose him as prime 
minister if the situation is calm. But given such a serious 
situation, we should by all means not let him take power. 
  Regarding the North Korean issue, SDPJ General Secretary 
Kubo said: "Our party has fraternal relations with the Workers' 
Party of Korea [WPK], and we can talk to the WPK because the WPK 
is a fraternal party of the SDPJ." It is all very well, but I 
wonder what the SDPJ will do if the situation does not allow the 
SDPJ to talk to the WPK. When the Persian Gulf war broke out, 
Ms. Takako Doi flew to Iraq and met with President Husayn. But 
her effort ended in complete failure. I would like to ask the 
SDPJ what action it will take if North Korea rejects requests of 
such SDPJ leader as Mr. Kubo for accepting nuclear inspections, 
and if the United Nations implements sanctions. 
  Mr. Takemura recently published a book entitled 
Japan--A Small But Brilliant Country. In short, this 
is a book of schoolgirlish tastes. When I visited Jakarta 
recently, I asked a high-ranking Indonesian official which 
countries the word "a small but brilliant country" brought to 
mind. He answered "Singapore." This answer is common sense. 
Japan is not "small." Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) 
accounts for 15 percent of the total GDP of the world, and when 
the GDP of the United States is added, it reaches 40 percent of 
the world GDP. The view of the international community is that 
Japan should have a more responsible role in the United Nations. 
With such hopes in mind, foreign nations say that they can let 
Japan become a permanent member of the UN Security Council when 
the United Nations is reformed. I think Mr. Takemura and the 
SDPJ probably want to avoid any military duties. However, they 
should recognize that Japan will not be allowed to take such a 
special position in the United Nations. 
  Need To Promote Economic Reform 
  The next immediate task is to seek ways to solve the 
Japan-U.S. economic friction. Japan is frowned on by foreign 
nations for storing up a $130 billion trade surplus. Of course 
the United States and European nations cannot criticize Japan if 
Japan's market is fully open to other nations. However, in 
Japan various regulations and barriers were established in 
wartime and during the period of postwar reconstruction. From 
the standpoint of the other nations, it is not easy for foreign 
nations to access Japan's market. This reflects the fact that 
the Japanese are unable to obtain cheaper foreign products. The 
gap between domestic and foreign prices is about 30 to 50 
percent. Getting rid of regulations and barriers will not only 
help solve trade friction but also lead to creating a society in 
which the people feel comfortable and satisfied with their 
lives. The Hosokawa government, after carrying out political 
reform, set "economic reform" as the next task to be fulfilled. 
It was a correct decision. However, carrying out economic 
reform requires a capability to overcome the heavy resistance of 
bureaucrats. In view of this, the ruling parties need to get 
united. The Hosokawa government failed to take the leadership 
because of the split in the ruling parties resulting from the 
conflict over political realignment and policy matters, thus 
failing to bear down on bureaucrats. Meanwhile, however, a line 
has already been laid by Hosokawa. What the next government has 
to do is to run on the track like a weighty train. 
<H5>  Rise in Consumption Tax Unavoidable </H5>
  Carrying out tax reform is also an unavoidable matter. 
Unlike the time when consumption tax was introduced, the people 
are now gradually understanding the meaning of indirect tax. 
The current component ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax 
revenue is 7:3. If this current component ratio should remain 
unchanged in the coming aging society, payment of income tax 
will be unbearable for tax payers. For this reason, a rise in 
consumption tax is unavoidable. The new coalition government 
should keep this point in mind. 
  Revision or abolition of the current food control system is 
also indispensable. 
  It is urged that politicians who share a common 
understanding 
on the current political situation described above get together. 
The government formed through such a process will be able to 
work in the people's interests.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The conflict inside the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] over the election of a successor to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa came to a temporary halt after Michio 
Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
decided on 19 April to give up his plan to leave the party and 
run as candidate for prime minister. 
  However, the current political upheaval has brought about 
great turmoil in the party which involved even a faction leader 
and caused the defection of as many as 12 Diet members, thus 
leaving behind a major crack in the LDP. Intraparty criticisms 
of LDP President Yohei Kono's leadership for not being able to 
take advantage of a golden opportunity to recapture political 
power are expected to increase. The LDP is still plagued by 
potential further defections as it enters a volatile state 
wherein it is unable to control its party factions. 
  On the afternoon of 19 April, two policy groups were having 
heated exchanges at the LDP's headquarters, where the meeting 
between Kono and Watanabe was under way. One was a general 
meeting of the Sasshin no kai [Association for Change] (chaired 
by Taro Nakayama) consisting mostly of Diet members who had been 
reluctant to support electoral reforms. There was an outpouring 
of criticism against the LDP's leadership over the commotion in 
the party. Some members claimed that "it was possible to take 
back political power, but we failed to do so. The 
responsibility of the president, secretary general, and other 
leaders in this should be called into question." The meeting 
decided to demand a change of leadership. 
  At the meeting of the Parliamentary League for the Promotion 
of Political Reform (chaired by former Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu) held in the next room, participants expressed the 
following opinions: "If top priority is given only to avoiding 
the splitting of the party, the LDP will perish gradually; our 
ship will sink"; "If you talk only of solidarity, there can be 
no hope for the renewal of the party." The meeting adopted an 
emergency declaration asking the leadership to promote party 
reform. 
  Ironically, these two groups, which were once rivals in the 
party which took opposing positions on the issue of political 
reform, are now partners in their criticism of the leadership. 
  The Kono leadership, which was launched under a pledge to 
reform the party, has so far been forced to manage party affairs 
defensively by giving top priority to party solidarity. This 
was the first time that the LDP faced a situation in which it 
could take the offensive. While it succeeded in toppling the 
cabinet, it in turn allowed Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and others from the ruling 
parties to meddle in LDP affairs, which resulted in the 
attempted defection of Watanabe, a faction leader, and the 
actual defection of a number of Diet members. In the present 
case, a feeling of helplessness also permeated all the factions, 
which were unable to take unified action and to control faction 
members like in the past. 
  At the LDP General Council meeting on 19 April, a veteran 
Diet member lamented: "At least, Mitchi [Michio Watanabe] was 
able to express his views on recapturing political power. The 
leadership was not able to say anything." Kono listened to this 
criticism with a grave expression. 
  Together with party reform, Kono intends to step up 
preparations for the next general election under the new 
electoral system for the lower house, and for the upper house 
elections next year, by appealing to "recapture political power 
through elections" and by maintaining party unity. 
  A majority in the party believe that "the coalition 
government is plagued with various contradictions in policy and 
in other areas; it will be a matter of time for the new 
administration to come to an impasse" (according to a senior LDP 
official). However, the LDP's prospects for recapturing the 
government also remain uncertain. A young Diet member belonging 
to the Obuchi faction says, "If another coup d'etat occurs, the 
LDP will certainly face the danger of a major breakup." A sense 
of crisis is already spreading in the party.

"Outlook: Personnel Appointments in Kasumigaseki"] 
  [Text] Ministry of Finance 
  Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito (entered the 
ministry 
in 1959) [the following dates in parentheses indicate when the 
person entered service with the Japanese Government]; Budget 
Bureau chief Kyosuke Shinozawa (1960), who is certain to become 
the next vice minister after Saito; and Tax Bureau chief Tadashi 
Ogawa (1962), who is expected to become the vice minister after 
Shinozawa, remain in their posts. [The reason for keeping these 
three officials in their posts is based on] the recognition that 
now is the time to determine the future course of the finance 
and tax systems, because the examination of a major tax reform 
by the ruling coalition parties will reach its peak at the end 
of June, and it will seek to pass the [tax reform] bill within 
the year. Saito will be the first vice minister to serve for 
two years since Yoshihiko Yoshino (1953), president of the Japan 
Development Bank, who held the post six directors before Saito. 
  Also in the field of international finance, Kosuke Nakahira 
(1963), deputy vice minister for financial affairs and who has 
held his post for a year, and Takatoshi Kato (1964), chief of 
the International Finance Bureau, will remain in their posts and 
work on finding a way out of difficult situations such as the 
increasingly strained relationship between Japan and the United 
States. 
  Eisuke Hamamoto (1961) will retire voluntarily from the post 
of National Tax Administration Agency director general, which is 
a vice-ministerial-level post. Then, Banking Bureau chief 
Nobuyuki Teramura (1961), who has dealt with the management 
problems of financial institutions for two years, will be 
promoted to Hamamoto's post. 
  Those who entered the ministry in 1963 are the focus [of the 
ministerial reshuffle]. Yoshimasa Nishimura, director of the 
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, is certain to be 
promoted to Banking Bureau chief. Also, Takeshi Komura, 
director of the Secretariat, who seems certain to be the next 
Budget Bureau chief after Shinozawa, is expected to remain in 
his post. There is a possibility that Financial Bureau chief 
Masami Ishizaka and Securities Bureau chief Sohei Hidaka will 
resign. If either of them quits, the vacant post will be filled 
by Koji Tanami (1964), deputy vice minister of policy 
coordination. 
<H5>  Economic Planning Agency [EPA] </H5>
  It is strongly believed that Tsutomu Tanaka (1959), 
administrative vice minister of economic planning, will remain 
in his post because there is a need to grasp the outlook for the 
economy. In that case, the probability of Coordination Bureau 
chief Makoto Kobayashi (1961) remaining in his post also is high 
. 
  Should Tanaka resign, Kobayashi is likely to succeed him, 
thus making Kobayashi the first official from the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry in eight years to become the 
Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] vice minister. In addition, 
Planning Bureau chief Atsushi Yoshikawa (1962) will succeed 
Kobayashi as Coordination Bureau chief, and Shinpei Nukaya 
(1963), the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination 
Bureau chief, will be appointed to the post of the EPA's 
Planning Bureau chief. Yoji Wakui (1964), director of the 
Secretariat and who was from the Ministry of Finance [MOF], is 
expected to also remain in his post. 
<H5>  Defense Agency </H5>
  Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama (1961), who 
was from the MOF, is certain to remain in his post, and the 
personnel changes in the Defense Agency as a whole will be 
minor. Naoaki Murata (1962), Bureau of Defense Policy chief, 
and Noboru Hoshuyama (1963), director of the Secretariat, are 
the candidates to succeed Ichiro Yoneyama (1961), director 
general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, who is 
going to retire voluntarily. 
  If Hoshuyama becomes director general of the Defense 
Facilities Administration Agency, Yasutomo Mitsui (1964), Bureau 
of Personnel chief, or Masahiro Akiyama (1964), Bureau of 
Finance chief, will be appointed to the post of director of the 
Secretariat. Then, Defense Councillor Ken Sato (1966), who was 
from the MOF, is talked about to replace either Mitsui or 
Akiyama. 
Ministry of Home Affairs [subhead] 
  Shigeichi Mori (1959), administrative vice minister of home 
affairs, will retire voluntarily, and Local Finance Bureau chief 
Toshio Yuasa, who entered the ministry in the same year as Mori, 
is certain to succeed him and push forward with the tasks, such 
as decentralization, which Mori has been dealing with. Yasuhiko 
Endo (1963), director of the Secretariat, is likely to become 
the next chief of the Local Finance Bureau. However, because 
his appointment to the post would shorten the record of the 
number of years required to climb to that position by as much as 
four years, there is a possibility that Hiromasa Yoshida (1962), 
chief of the Local Administration Bureau, will be appointed to 
the post instead. Also, Takahiro Kiuchi (1961), director 
general of the Fire Defense Agency, is expected to retire 
voluntarily. Makoto Taki (1962), chief of the Local Tax Bureau, 
is the person most likely to succeed Kiuchi as director general. 
  Ministry of Health and Welfare 
  Many people believe that Administrative Vice Minister 
Teijiro 
Furukawa (1960) is going to retire voluntarily and that he will 
be succeeded by Akira Suetsugu, director general of the Social 
Insurance Agency, who is a year younger than Furukawa but who 
entered the ministry in the same year. Hiroshi Tada (1962), 
chief of the Health Insurance Bureau, is likely to become the 
next director general of the Social Insurance Agency. Also, 
Nobuharu Okamitsu (1963), director of the Secretariat, will 
probably take over the post of Health Insurance Bureau chief. 
In order to rejuvenate the post of director of the Secretariat, 
Pension Bureau Chief Takehiko Yamaguchi (1965) has been named as 
a candidate, among others, for the job. Moreover, the 
possibility remains of Tada jumping to the post of 
administrative vice minister. Furthermore, Furukawa is a 
candidate for the post of the next deputy chief cabinet 
secretary (administrative). 
<H5>  Ministry of Labor </H5>
  In accordance with the Labor Ministry's practice in recent 
years, there is a strong possibility of Administrative Vice 
Minister Yukinori Wakabayashi (1960) retiring voluntarily, and 
Labor Relations Bureau Chief Kunihiko Saito (1961) succeeding 
the vice minister. If [the Labor Ministry's personnel 
appointments] follow their usual pattern -- director of the 
Secretariat to Employment Security Bureau chief to Labor 
Relations Bureau chief -- then Employment Security Bureau chief 
Tokio Nanase (1964) will be appointed to the position of Labor 
Relations Bureau chief, which is the post for 
vice-minister-to-be officials, and Noriomi Soya (1965), director 
of the Secretariat, will be appointed to the post of Employment 
Security Bureau chief. However, there is still a possibility of 
Labor Standards Bureau chief Shintaro Ishioka (1962) being 
appointed as Labor Relations Bureau chief. In this case, the 
Employment Security Bureau chief and others beneath him will 
remain in their posts. 
<H5>  Ministry of Transportation </H5>
  Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo (1960) is 
certain to remain in his post, and the reshuffle of the ministry 
will be a minor one in connection with the retirement of Tsuguo 
Iyama (1961), director general of the Maritime Safety Agency, 
who has held his post for two years. Either Civil Aviation 
Bureau chief Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka (1963) or Railways Bureau 
chief Yutaka Hatano (1963), who is a contemporary of Tsuchisaka, 
is likely to succeed Iyama. Transportation Policy Bureau chief 
Minoru Toyoda (1962), who is at the top of the bureau chiefs, 
will probably remain in his current post and wait for the 
promotion to the post of administrative vice minister next year. 
<H5>  Environment Agency </H5>
  The office of administrative vice minister of the 
environment 
is customarily held by officials from the MOF and the Health 
Ministry. Administrative Vice Minister Atsuo Yagihashi (1961), 
who was from the MOF, is likely to retire voluntarily with the 
passage last November of the Basic Environmental Law adorning 
the last days of his career. In that case, Planning and 
Coordination Bureau chief Hitomi Mori (1962), who was from the 
Health Ministry, is likely to succeed Yagihashi as 
administrative vice minister.

<F P=106> [Article in five installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, </F>
Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, Yomei Tsuji: 
"Undercurrent of Political Realignment"] 
<H5>  [28 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] On the late afternoon of 2 February Mr. Gaishi 
Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power), chairman of Keidanren 
[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], and Mr. Shoichiro 
Toyoda (chairman at Toyota Motor), who has been selected as the 
next chairman of Keidanren, grabbed Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] on the corridor of 
the National Diet. They went into a small room. 
  "I want you to repeal the special corporate tax that you 
introduced during the Gulf war when you were secretary general 
of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]" (Mr. Hiraiwa). "I want 
you to reduce the extra consumption tax on automobiles from 4.5 
percent to 3 percent as promised" (Mr. Toyoda). 
  "I don't know, [if I can...]" replied Mr. Ozawa curtly to 
the 
current and the next leader of the economic circle. The meeting 
lasted only three minutes. 
  Repeal of both the special corporate tax and the extra tax 
on 
automobiles was incorporated in the "public welfare tax" plan, 
which was announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the 
early morning of the following day, 3 February [1994]. 
Therefore, the government policy on these issues had already 
been set quite a while ago. 
<H5>  Condemn the LDP on Its Attitude Toward Political Reform </H5>
  Six months or so have passed since the birth of the 
coalition 
government. There has been a big change in direction of the 
economic circle's influence peddling -- away from the LDP toward 
the governing coalition parties. Such was the case also in 
behind-the-scene activities to pass the Political Reform Law. 
  On the morning of 26 January, five days after the rejection 
of a political reform bill by the House of Councilors, Mr. Eiji 
Suzuki (adviser at Mitsubishi Chemical Industries), former 
chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' 
Associations], contacted the leaders of four associations in the 
economic circle and said, "We must speak up to promote political 
reform." He also telephoned the prime minister. 
  [Mr. Suzuki] You should have a top-level meeting with Mr. 
Yohei Kono, president of the LDP, and reach some kind of an 
agreement. 
  [Prime Minister] Would you in the economic circle also try 
to 
stir up public opinion? 
  In the afternoon of the same day Mr. Ken Nagano (chairman at 
Mitsubishi Materials) of the Nikkeiren sent a fax to the LDP's 
headquarters, expressing his contempt for the party: "It seems 
odd that people who oppose the reform bill are the majority." 
  On the evening of the same day Mr. Hiraiwa telephoned the 
prime minister and told him: "Unless the political reform bill 
is passed, we won't be able to advance our economic measures or 
Japan-U.S. talks. We must avoid a political vacuum." Also, Mr. 
Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries) 
of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said to the prime 
minister over the telephone, "We want you to yield when 
necessary." 
  Clearly the objective of the economic circle was to 
compromise with the LDP and to avoid dissolution [of the Diet] 
and general election. The prime minister asked Mr. Inaba, 
"Please convey your message to the LDP, also." 
<H5>  Hiraiwa Refused To Be Interviewed </H5>
  The LDP interpreted the offensive from the economic circle 
as 
"pressure" (per a person close to Mr. Kono). Especially offended 
were the people in the LDP's "anti-corruption" group. Between 25 
and 26 January Mr. Taro Nakayama, former minister of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and a leading advocate of the 
group, tried to communicate with Mr. Hiraiwa and others to 
express their thought: "Even if political reform is postponed, 
we will not attack the Hosokawa administration. We will go 
forward with economic measures and the budget." 
  However, Mr. Hiraiwa and others didn't even offer to be 
interviewed. Mr. Nakayama was angered by this and said, "The 
economic circle refuses to listen." The LDP's promoters of 
reform, however, also contributed to the behind-the-scene 
maneuver of the economic circle. 
  The reason Mr. Suzuki telephoned the prime minister was that 
he was prompted to do so by a telephone call in that morning 
from former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who said, "We must set 
up a top-level meeting." Former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu 
Gotoda asked Mr. Hiraiwa, "Please tell Mr. Hosokawa that if the 
bill doesn't get passed, he will have to assume political 
responsibility as prime minister." 
<H5>  "They Are the Permanent Governing Party" </H5>
  The relationship between the LDP's executive branch and the 
economic circle had cooled even before then. On 30 November 1993 
the leaders of four associations visited the LDP headquarters 
with a document calling for quick implementation of political 
reform. Mr. Kono snubbed this and said, "I don't understand why 
you don't ask for economic measures by suspending your call for 
political reform? We are much more knowledgeable on the issue of 
political reform than you are." 
  Secretary General Yoshiro Mori was more adamant and said, 
"If 
you were told to do this by the Prime Minister's Office, it's 
disgraceful." To Mr. Nagano and others who began to rebut, he 
proclaimed, pounding on his desk, "The Nikkeiren should focus 
its attention only on wages and labor issues." A person who was 
at the meeting remembers that Mr. Hirawa's hands were trembling. 
The meeting generated a ripple effect: "I don't want to see the 
LDP executives any more" (per a vice chairman of Keidanren). 
  There was no contact between the leaders of the economic 
circle and Mr. Kono even during the last stage of political 
reform. 
  "People in the economic circle do what they are told to do 
by 
the Prime Minister's Office. After all, they are the permanent 
governing party," says a person who used to hold one of the 
LDP's three top executive positions. The close relationship of 
the past no longer exists between the LDP and the economic 
circle. 
  We will follow the "current relationship between the 
political and economic circles" that began to oscillate after 
the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government. 
<H5>  [1 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Last summer the LDP borrowed 10 billion yen from 
nine city banks for its election campaigns. Repayment schedules 
have not been worked out yet, as an executive of a big steel 
company says, "Probably, they won't be able to repay the loan. 
They will probably have to arrange for repayment in installments 
over 10 years or so." 
  An executive of a big city bank says, "If collection on the 
loan becomes doubtful, Sumitomo Bank, which is going to be the 
next presiding bank (of the Federation of Bankers Association of 
Japan), will have to negotiate for mortgage." 
<H5>  Keidanren Issues a Document to City Banks </H5>
  Four individuals made a decision to request the city banks 
to 
lend 10 billion yen to the LDP, which played havoc with party 
breakups, and to have Keidanren support its repayments. They 
were Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power) 
and four vice chairmen, who used to work for the automobile, 
steel, electric, and banking industries, respectively. 
  But, the city banks strongly demanded a "guarantee" of 
repayment from Keidanren. 
  This was due partly to the fact that the LDP had not repaid 
4.5 billion yen of the total 15 billion yen it borrowed for its 
campaigns for the 1990 general election. Also, there were rumors 
that the LDP might slip from power after the election and be at 
risk of further breakups. 
  "If the party breaks up again, we will be wondering which 
splintered party will be the LDP (to repay the loan)" (per a 
person in charge of the loan at a city bank). 
  According to several people involved in lending at these 
city 
banks, it was finally agreed that Keidanren would deliver to 
each bank a "letter of de facto guaranty of repayment of the 
loan" signed by Managing Director Natsuaki Fusano, who had been 
in charge of [political] contributions. It was the first time 
that Keidanren had been asked for such a guarantee ever since it 
started to play the role of middleman for campaign contributions 
to the LDP. 
  This is why the Keidanren declared that it would "continue 
to 
play the role of a middleman for repayment of this 10 billion 
yen loan" at the same time when it decided last September to 
discontinue its arrangement for annual contributions of about 12 
billion yen to the LDP. 
  Keidanren's discontinuance of its role as a middleman, 
however, had more than a little impact. 
  Keidanren used to convene executives of its member companies 
in charge of funds in January each year. Following greetings 
from the LDP secretary general and others, the chairman of the 
Keidanren used to request cooperation from each of its member 
companies. 
<H5>  Continuing, Stopping, or Reducing Contributions </H5>
  Keidanren gave its "official go-ahead" for subsequent 
"collection of money" from its member companies by the LDP's 
Treasury Bureau and persons on duty from the Kokumin Seiji 
Kyokai [National Political Association]. Because of the 
discontinuance of such arrangement, this kind of meeting will no 
longer be held. 
  "With this recession, and as the LDP has become an 
opposition 
party, we can't give them money as we used to" (per Hajime 
Murata, chairman of Japan Petrochemical Industry Association). 
  "There is no longer such a justification like defending the 
free market economy. It will be awful if somebody brings about a 
class action lawsuit of stockholders [against us], the filing 
fee of which is now only 8,200 yen" (per Ryuzaburo Kaku, 
chairman of Canon). 
  There were some industries that made contributions according 
the LDP's request late last year. But all steel companies 
curtailed contributions; the banking industry including city 
banks and Japan Petroleum Industry Association cut their 
contributions by 20 percent; and the Japan Camera Industry 
Association discontinued contribution all together. 
  It became known in October that the electric power and gas 
industries, which were supposed to have discontinued political 
contributions as public utilities corporations, continued to 
make de facto contributions to the LDP as advertisement expenses. 
  The electric power industry is called one of "five regent 
families" along with the banking, automobile, electric 
appliances, steel industries. It had been playing a leading role 
in making contributions billed as "advertisements." Along with 
the gas industry, however, it was pressured to "discontinue 
advertisements," and the estimated advertisement cost of 1.1 
billion yen for the LDP was cut in half last year. 
<H5>  The Pipeline Is on the Brink of Collapse </H5>
  Repayment of the 10 billion yen lent to the LDP means that 
each industry must increase its political contribution 
accordingly. Last fall's talks at Keidanren over the method of 
repayment didn't produce any results because of the diversity of 
proposals, ranging from "five-year installments" rather than 
"three-year installments" to a suggestion saying, "Instead of 
increasing the amount of contribution, we must handle this 
within the normal amount of contributions." Since that time, 
there has not been any discussion on this issue. 
  Now, Mr. Hiroshi Saito (chairman at Nippon Steel), vice 
chairman of Keidanren, who objected to Mr. Hiraiwa's decision 
to back the 10 billion yen loan, says coolly, "Before asking 
others to pay, the electric power industry should pay for it 
first." 
  On the evening of 10 December [1993] Mr. Hiraiwa and other 
Keidanren officials were planning to have a meeting at a 
restaurant in Tokyo with the LDP executives, including President 
Yohei Kono. However, the LDP cancelled the meeting on the very 
morning, saying, "The atmosphere [of the meeting] is likely to 
become uncomfortable" (per Mr. Kono). 
  The largest pipeline for funds -- the "Keidanren route" -- 
is 
on the brink of collapse. 
<H5>  [2 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] A caption next to a child holding a teddy bear says, 
"Give me dreams." A girl running with a balloon in her hand is 
accompanied by a caption saying, "Give me a season." These are 
part of a full-page advertisement placed by Japan Federation of 
Construction Contractors, Inc. in the LDP bulletin JIYU SHIMPO. 
Report on a thermal power plant in Hokkaido was paid by the 
Federation of Electric Power Companies [FEPCO]. The Federation 
of Bankers Associations of Japan paid for an interview between 
its chairman and the chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research 
Council. 
  Leading industries, such as automobiles, electricity, and 
banking have made a substantial increase in their advertisement 
expenses for the LDP since 1990 so as to help the party repay 
its 15 billion yen loan from the banks for the general election 
of 1990. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, for example, 
placed full-page ads, such as an advertisement calling for the 
use of seat belts, in 32 of the total 48 issues published in 
1991. 
<H5>  Warning for Increased Unit Cost </H5>
  "After all, how many ways are there to gather funds? We make 
contributions to the party, its factions, and individual Diet 
members. Are we going to pay for advertisements, also?" 
  "Jiyu Kikaku-sha," an advertising agency for the LDP, began 
to handle advertisements in earnest for the bulletin in the late 
1970's. The above prediction conveyed by a businessman to a 
salesman from the agency became the reality in two to three 
years. 
  In 1980 the agency received a request for advertisements 
valued at more than 300 million yen from FEPCO, which had 
supposedly discontinued political contributions. 
  A former executive at Jiyu Kikaku-sha confides: "It was 
unusual, because up until then an ad at the bottom of a page on 
JIYU SHIMPO had sold for 300,000 yen to 500,000 yen. The amount 
of the fee had been determined first, so we were told by the LDP 
to make things appear reasonable for that amount of money." 
  From the autumn of that year on, a report on nuclear power 
generation appeared in the bulletin almost every week. A person 
who was in charge of such advertisements at the LDP remembers 
the warning by the tax office: "If you increase the unit cost of 
an advertisement further, we will have to consider it as a 
political contribution." 
  Jiyu Shimpo-sha's annual sales revenue stood at around 1.7 
billion yen to 1.8 billion yen until 1989. Then, it jumped to 
about 48 billion yen in 1990 and 69 billion yen in 1991. "It has 
become inexplicable" even by the sponsors themselves (per a 
businessman in charge of general affairs). 
  Adviser Jinpachiro Hanamura, who established the Keidanren 
route, points out that repayment of the loans for campaign 
financing prior to 1990 were made from funds obtained through 
the National Political Association. He adds, "If the LDP doesn't 
pinch and scrape, there is no other way to repay the loans than 
through advertising expenses." 
<H5>  To Dietmen Through the Party </H5>
  Among contributions made through the National Political 
Association, it was reported recently that Mr. Hideo Watanabe, 
former minister at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
[MPT], had received "contributions with strings attached" in the 
amount of 40 million yen from a large general contractor over 
four years from 1988. A former chief of the LDP Treasury Bureau 
says, "Such contributions became widespread for zoku-Dietmen 
linked to particular industries. During my days, the party 
charged a 20-percent commission." 
  Contributions through advertisements have also some 
"strings" 
attached to them. In 1984 a large mail-order company paid about 
10 million yen to Jiyu Kikaku-sha for an ad in the LDP's monthly 
journal, RIBURU. Most of this advertisement fee was distributed 
to local Dietmen as organizational activity expenses and so on 
through the LDP's Treasury Bureau. This was done according to a 
prior agreement reached between the company and the Dietmen with 
an LDP official as a go-between. 
  The "Keidanren route," which had been regarded as a pipeline 
for "clean money" that has no linkage of vested interests 
between politicians and particular corporations, also generated 
various forms of "exterior" and "interior" worlds. 
  How much money in total is flowing from where to where? Many 
people involved in this within the LDP and the economic circle 
say that only Mr. Natsuaki Fusano, managing director of 
Keidanren, and Mr. Jin Motojuku, chief of the LDP Treasury 
Bureau, know the entire spectrum. 
  Mr. Motojuku has been specialized in the accounting field 
throughout his work life and is also an executive of Jiyu 
Kikaku-sha. He is quite "influential," as one staff member of 
the LDP says, "Neither the general secretary nor the chief of 
the Treasury Bureau knows the total picture, and they both just 
rubber-stamp according to what the chief of the Accounting 
Department says." 
  On the other hand, Mr. Fusano, a successor to Mr. Hanamura, 
handles the entire aspect of contributions at Keidanren. Right 
after Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa decided to discontinue the role of 
a middleman for contributions in August 1993, Mr. Fusano 
gathered people in charge of political funds from leading 
industries and told them that "I'm different from the chairman," 
suggesting that he would continue to play the role of middleman, 
albeit unofficially. 
<H5>  Unsatisfied Over the Prospect of No Rewards </H5>
  Upon discontinuance of the Keidanren's role as a middleman, 
criticism from the business sector erupted over contributions 
through the Keidanren route: "They are like rent fees for a 
gambling house. No rewards" (per an executive from the 
securities industry). This is because a practical calculation 
that rewards to corporations are uncertain and also because of 
mounting dissatisfaction over putting money into a "black box" 
(per an official at Keidanren). 
<H5>  [3 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] "I visited the vice chairman of Keidanren, but I 
couldn't accomplish anything." 
  On 15 February [1994] Mr. Asahiko Mihara, chief of the 
Treasury Bureau of Sakigake [Harbinger], visited Keidanren to 
see Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi and Managing Director 
Natsuaki Fusano. Ever since Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, chief representative of party, paid a visit to 
Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa last year, the party officials have 
continued to request contributions from major industries. But 
these visits have not generated any results yet. 
  Mr. Miyoshi and others advised Mr. Mihara: "You must be 
patient and should make frequent visits to the presiding company 
of each industry association." 
<H5>  Looking at the Maximum Limit on Contribution </H5>
  About 10 days before Mr. Mihara's visit, Mr. Muneaki 
Samejima, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Japan New 
Party, had a meeting with Mr. Shoji Okuda (president of Daiichi 
Kangyo Bank), chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations 
of Japan. "If city banks make a decision, other industries will 
follow. I sincerely beg your cooperation." Mr. Samejima believes 
that February is the best time to request companies whose 
acconting year ends in March to appropriate money for 
contributions to his party for the 1994 fiscal year. 
  It was February last year when Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, chief 
representative of Japan New Party [JNP] before becoming prime 
minister, visited Keidanren to see Mr. Fusano and bowed to him, 
saying, "I beg your support." After launching his party, he 
sought advice from his close friends in the economic circle on 
how to raise funds. "He seems to have been thinking of some ways 
to gather money in small amounts and on a general basis from the 
citizens. But his ideas were all impractical" (per a young 
financier). Eventually Mr. Hosokawa gave up on his idea of 
gathering money "in small amounts and on a general basis," and 
visited Keidanren. 
  One reason new parties are hurrying to gather contributions 
is that on 1 March [1994] the House of Representatives passed a 
bill on contributions to political parties, which would set the 
"upper limit at two-thirds of the prior year's revenues" for 
contributions for the next year. The amount of contributions to 
Sakigake is estimated to be about 600 million yen. But, if it 
doesn't approach 1 billion within this year, it will be cut 
down. JNP has also set its target of contributions at 3 billion 
yen. 
  On 25 June, two days after launching Shinseito, Mr. Tsutomu 
Hata, head of the party, requested support from Mr. Hiraiwa and 
other leading businessmen: "Several of us have borrowed money, 
but there is a limit. I beg your consideration and support for 
our new candidates." 
<H5>  Steadily "Organizing Their System" </H5>
  However, Shinseito, which "tided over the general election 
with funds provided by its executives, largely by Mr. Ozawa 
(Ichiro, head of the party)" (per an executive), has not made 
any requests publicly so far for contributions from leading 
industries. People in the economic circle are quite apprehensive 
about "how the party is going to raise funds." 
  Having learned well the know-how of gathering contributions 
during their days in the LDP, however, members of Shinseito have 
been steadily "organizing their system." 
  On the morning of 3 March [1994] a meeting is going to be 
held at Shinseito headquarters for the "yutakana jidosha-shakai 
o suishinsuru giin renmei" [coalition of Dietmen to promote an 
affluent automobile society]. It is to hear from representatives 
from three industries -- taxi, trucking, and automobile repair 
services -- on their "political wishes." The coalition is 
composed of 68 members of reform-minded Shinseito Dietmen from 
the upper and lower houses. Its chairman is Mr. Keiwa Okuda, 
former minister of the Ministry of Transport [MOT], and its 
secretary general is Mr. Shinya Izumi, a member of the upper 
house and former MOT official. 
  People in the automobile industry predicts: "First, they are 
trying to cement their relationship with the MOT-related 
industries. Next will be us, in relation to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI]." As this industry is 
closely related to the LDP's Obuchi faction, the LDP can't 
conceal its apprehension: "Shinseito is trying to squeeze in" 
(per an executive of the LDP). 
  Between November and December last year, Shinseito had 10 or 
so breakfast meetings at a city hotel, gathering each time the 
chairman and other officials of each of various industry 
associations. Various opinions and wishes on budget and tax 
policies were communicated to Deputy General Secretary Kozo 
Watanabe, former minister of MITI, and Mr. Moriyoshi Sato, 
former chief of the National Land Agency, who is in charge of 
finance and tax policies. 
  People in the economic circle still remember 1990 vividly 
when Mr. Ozawa was the LDP general secretary and made strong 
requests for support on general election campaigns to leading 
industries, including the automobile industry, by-passing 
Keidanren. One of Keidanren's vice chairmen says, "If he starts 
doing that on an individual company basis, it will be 
horrifying." 
<H5>  Corporations Want To Avoid Sticking Out </H5>
  The "umbrella of Keidanren as a middleman" (per Mr. Hiroshi 
Goto, managing director of Japan Petrochemical Industry 
Association) is gone. As the LDP requests the same amount of 
contributions as before and three new parties enter the scene, 
industries and corporations are unable to decide on "how much 
money should be contributed to which party." 
  "Keidanren is not making a decision, so our association 
can't 
make a decision on allocation. We decided to let each company 
decide" (per Mr. Higashi Tsuboi, chairman of the Fudosan Kyokai 
[Real Estate Industry Association]). 
"We are waiting for the next restructuring [of parties]. Even 
if we make some contribution now, we don't know what will happen 
in the future" (per Mr. Haruo Ito, managing director of Japan 
Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc.). 
  Businesses want to avoid sticking out and are conscious of 
the lateral unity. "They will feel more comfortable if Keidanren 
makes decisions" (per one of the vice chairmen). The atmosphere 
seems conducive to generating voices for reviving the 
Keidanren's role as a middleman. 
<H5>  [4 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] On his flight on 11 February [1994] to Washington, 
D.C., to attend a Japan-U.S. businessmen's conference, Mr. Ken 
Nagano (chairman of Mitsubishi Materials) of Nikkeiren sat next 
to Mr. Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries), chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. 
<H5>  Renew a Meeting With the Prime Minister </H5>
  Mr. Nagano: "How about having a monthly meeting between the 
prime minister and the leaders of four economic associations? 
The information the prime minister gets tends to be from 
government offices only." 
  Mr. Inaba: "That seems like a good idea. Let's do it." 
  A meeting will begin after May when Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda, 
chairman of Toyota Motor, becomes the chairman of Keidanren. 
  When the LDP was in power, the leaders of the four 
associations used to have a breakfast meeting every month with 
the party's four executives, including the secretary general, to 
convey their wishes. After the change of administration, such 
meetings were discontinued. There has been no regular meeting 
with the executives of the coalition government. 
  "We don't have time to visit each of the coalition parties 
individually. Although we are not quite sure how much power the 
prime minister has in making policy decisions, we must rely on 
him" (per a top business executive). Holding a regular meeting 
with the prime minister is one way for the economic circle to 
rebuild its relationship with the government. 
<H5>  Mr. Ozawa Criticizes Top Executives </H5>
  However, there is no unified way the parties in the 
coalition 
government look at the economic circle. When Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, 
chief representative of Shinseito, had a study meeting with 
executives from the financial sector on 17 February [1994], he 
made a reference to the Japan-U.S. economic summit, which had 
ended without any agreement on new economic framework talks, and 
criticized strongly the attitude of leaders in the economic 
circle toward Japan's current account surplus. 
  "(Reduction of the surplus) can be achieved by either using 
numerical targets or strengthening the value of the yen. But 
they don't like either of these approaches. If we don't start 
working on restructuring the economic system, we will keep 
having the same problems. Nothing will be solved. Current 
leaders don't understand this at all." The executives gave him a 
big nod. 
  Themes that the economic circle focuses on have gradually 
shifted from "benefits for the entire economic circle" to 
"reduction of corporate taxes" and "economic buoyancy." 
Depending on industries, there seems to be much more conflict of 
interests. 
  Among management in the steel, chemical, and textile 
industries, some began to call for establishment of an 
organization other than Keidanren to represent the interest of 
the materials industry. 
  At a meeting of managing directors of four economic 
associations on 6 February, Mr. Masaji Shinagawa (adviser at 
Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Company) of the Japanese 
Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] said, "If 
the people in the economic circle want deregulation, they should 
be saying, `We will give up on special tax treatment if 
corporate tax rates are reduced accordingly.'" Other attendants 
were shocked, saying, "Not to that extent." 
  Under the LDP's reign, the economic circle contributed funds 
to zoku-Dietmen through Keidanren as a pipeline, and obtained 
such rewards as reduction of corporate tax and restriction on 
tightening the Antimonopoly Law and environmental protection 
regulations. At the core was "special tax treatment," and 
contributions were like "entry fees" to participate in this 
system (per a member of Keidanren). 
<H5>  Uneasy About Independent Allocations </H5>
  A person in charge of political funding at a large 
manufacturing company seems worried. He says, "The reason why we 
continued to make contributions is that we had absolution -- the 
Keidanren was a middleman. Now that this absolution is gone, it 
seems too much for a salaried man to use his judgment in 
allocating funds to each party and to accept responsibility for 
the consequences." 
  The uneasiness of corporations is also multiplied by a 
possible class-action lawsuit by stockholders that can be 
brought forth with only 8,200 yen and by the strengthening of 
investigation by the National Tax Agency on unspecified expense 
accounts. 
  Contributions through the Keidanren route were also 
"membership dues" in the corporate society called "Japan, Inc." 
that was structured like a pyramid. 
  The essential feature of the managed contribution was the 
balance among the industries -- half of the total was 
contributed by the five leading industries, such as electric 
power and steel, and the remainder by other industries. 
Maintenance of the order in such a corporate society was the 
reason that the electric power industry, which received 
criticism from the consumers and declared "discontinuance of 
political contributions," began to pay contributions as 
advertising expenses. 
  According to a top executive in the electric power industry, 
Mr. Gaishi Hiraiwa was the chairman at the time when FEPCO began 
"advertising contributions" around 1980. As chairman of the 
Keidanren last year, he decided to stop playing the role of a 
middleman for campaign contributions. It seems that he had to 
close the curtain for the old system by himself, as corporate 
managers saw the era of rapid economic growth ending, and had to 
review the market share-oriented approach of their lateral 
thinking. 
  The political circle is heading for restructuring at a rapid 
pace. Unreversable crustal movements have also begun to be felt 
by the economic circle

<F P=106> [By Michael Vatikiotis in Kuala Lumpur] </F>
  [Text] In a short story titled Piem published last 
December, Malaysian writer Shahnon Ahmad parodied the national 
political scene as a long play in which there were many roles, 
but none of any significance except for the central figure of 
Piem. "There were those," Shahnon wrote, "who criticised the 
play for being a one-man show -- meaning that the drama was 
acted by only one person -- even though there were many other 
parts." Using direct and sometimes coarse language, the story 
ends with the demise of "Piem" at the hands of the other actors, 
who finally realise that they, rather than "Piem," have the most 
important role in the drama. 
  It isn't hard to detect the object of Shahnon's parody; 
Malaysia's premier, Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamad, is popularly 
known as "PM," short for prime minister. But for Mahathir, the 
story could not have been published at a more sensitive time. 
In February, Abdul Ahmad, the editor of DEWAN SASTERA magazine 
which carried the story, was moved to another position at 
Mahathir's request. 
  The story has raised eyebrows in political circles because 
Mahathir's style of leadership is increasingly being compared to 
that of his new deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, at times less 
than favourably. After four months in the job, Anwar's 
energetic style and high profile have generated another focus of 
attention on a political stage long-dominated by Mahathir, and 
some observers wonder how much longer the 47-year-old former 
student activist will be content as Mahathir's understudy. 
  The conventional view has it that Anwar is Mahathir's 
creation and chosen heir. "Make no mistake, Mahathir wants 
Anwar to succeed him. That's why he is giving him everything," 
said a former newspaper editor who is close to the prime 
minister. But Mahathir has also hinted that he is in no hurry 
to step down. 
  For many Malaysians there is a contradiction between Anwar's 
position as heir apparent and Mahathir's stated intention of 
retaining the premiership for an unspecified period, 
particularly in a political culture which stresses total loyalty 
to strong leadership. Some are convinced that Anwar's 
conspicuous visibility and contrasting approach on some issues 
foreshadows a power struggle. "It's not part of our culture... 
Anwar should know his place and be patient," commented local 
writer Karim Raslan. 
  Anwar has certainly not steered away from the limelight 
since 
his promotion last December. In January and February, he made a 
series of visits to Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore that 
diplomats described as conspicuously successful. After the 
Jakarta visit, Indonesian diplomats detected an improvement in 
bilateral ties. A senior Singaporean official said that since 
Anwar's visit to the island republic, "I have received requests 
for Anwar to speak in Singapore almost every day." 
  At home, Anwar managed a campaign to bring down the 
opposition state government in Sabah. A cabinet source told the 
REVIEW that Mahathir hadn't expected the ruling National Front 
coalition to win more than 13 seats in February's state 
election; Anwar brought home 23 seats, just two short of a 
majority. 
  A job well done; perhaps too well done. "Mahathir doesn't 
appear to be in the centre of things, it's all Anwar," commented 
Rustam Sani of the Institute of Strategic and International 
Studies. Mahathir denies any backstage bickering. "I don't 
think there are any problems. The problems are imagined by 
other people, it is wishful thinking on the part of those who 
want to see problems," he told journalists in the first week of 
April. 
  Such denials are not likely to dampen speculation of a 
brewing rift. Mahathir also claimed he was on the best of terms 
with his former Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Musa Hitam before 
quarrelling with him in the mid-1980s. Musa assumed a high 
political profile and was popular on the ground. The sense of 
power and popularity, he once admitted in an interview, went to 
his head. Anwar has often said he won't make the same mistake. 
  But the danger signals are there. As well as maintaining a 
high profile, Anwar is also seen by some analysts as putting a 
small but perceptible distance between himself and Mahathir on 
certain policy issues. Mahathir's refusal to attend the meeting 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) caucus last 
November signalled his unhappiness with moves towards 
formalising Apec as an institution. Yet in March, Anwar seemed 
to send a different signal by attending a meeting of Apec 
finance ministers in Hawaii where he was one of two Asian 
representatives to hold a bilateral meeting with United States 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
  "Anwar could not have gone without the prime minister's 
blessing," suggests Datuk Abdullah Ahmad, a former minister, 
adding that "maybe he gave it reluctantly." Those who know 
Anwar say he is less inclined to quarrel with the West that 
Mahathir, preferring a softer approach. Western governments 
have not been slow to exploit this characteristic. While 
Mahathir was lambasting the West at the United Nations General 
Assembly last year, Anwar was given red-carpet treatment in 
Washington by congressmen and administration officials. 
  In a more glaring departure from the shadow of his 
political master, Anwar was quick to distance himself from an 
official ban on the award-winning U.S. film Schindler's 
List. The film, which portrays the suffering of Jews 
during World War II, was initially banned by the National Censor 
Board, which answers to Mahathir as home minister. But Anwar 
unequivocally supported lifting the ban, which he later 
announced after a cabinet decision taken in Mahathir's absence 
at the end of March. 
  No one considers that Anwar acted without referring to 
Mahathir, who initially leaned towards supporting the ban. 
But--despite the fact that subsequent demands by censors that 
scenes of sex and violence be cut mean the film will not be 
screened in Malaysia--observers said the effect of Anwar's 
decision to lift the initial ban was to send conflicting signals 
on a matter of policy. Anwar supporters attest to a difference 
of approach between the two leaders, but they insist it is part 
of a constructive partnership. According to Khalid Jaffar, 
Anwar's press secretary: "They do differ, but they also confer 
a lot. At least Anwar does not disagree with Mahathir behind 
his back." 
  But while Mahathir himself may not be uncomfortable with 
Anwar's assertive style, the rest of the political hierarchy is 
unused to dealing with a plurality of opinion at the top. "They 
don't like disagreement, it's unsettling and bad for business," 
suggested one political analyst. 
  But what if the source of friction does not stem from the 
top? Some observers consider that the large body of supporters 
Anwar attracted in the run-up to his election as deputy 
president of the ruling United Malays National Organisation 
(Umno) last year--a run initially opposed by Mahathir--is 
putting pressure on him to speed up the succession process. 
They are seen as eager to hasten the day Anwar takes over so 
that they can accelerate their own political careers. They 
favour holding the next general election sooner rather than 
later, expecting the new cabinet to reflect Anwar's strength in 
Umno. 
  Some of Anwar's aides also blame the business community for 
fuelling rumours of a split. They blame this on the intense 
competition for contracts stemming from the prospective 
privatisation of government holdings. "Some businessmen who 
were accustomed to favours before Anwar became finance minister 
are deliberately spreading rumours that he has fallen out with 
Mahathir," said an Anwar aide. 
  Those who feel left out of Anwar's circle may regard their 
interests best served by encouraging Mahathir to feel upstaged 
by his deputy, but they could be mistaken to assume that Anwar 
can be swept aside the same way Musa was. Anwar's support in 
Umno is strong, having won over most of the party hierarchy in 
his bid for the deputy presidency of Umno. 
  For Mahathir this means that Anwar could mount a challenge 
to 
his Umno presidency at the next party elections scheduled for 
1996. For some observers, the balance of power is beginning to 
look precarious even within Umno. 
  Every influential politician has his followers, but some 
observers regard the attention Anwar has attracted as 
symptomatic of changes in Umno. Factionalism is not new to the 
party, argues political analyst Abdul Razak Baginda, but the 
shift towards more corporate involvement in the party has raised 
the stakes. "That's not part of our tradition," he says, "and 
the competition is more intense."

  [Text] Ho Chi Mihn City April 18 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec said today that after his three-day 
stay in Vietnam he was convinced of the possibility for the 
Czech Republic to return to the Vietnamese market. 
  Zieleniec told the journalists, who accompany him on his 
current 7-day tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia, that 
Vietnamese partners had made it quite clear during the talks 
that in the future Vietnam did not intend to unambiguously 
orient itself towards standard Western countries. Provided 
Czech companies maintain a certain level of competitiveness, 
Vietnamese state bodies were ready to assist them in entering 
the Vietnamese market with the aim to diversify the country' 
foreign policy contacts, Zieleniec said. He said his Vietnamese 
partners had pointed many a time to the traditional relations 
existing between the two countries and even used the proverb 
that "one old friend is better than two new ones." 
  Zieleniec said the main goal of his visit -- adapting the 
old 
contacts to the new conditions -- had been achieved. 
  Zieleniec said that two Czech-Vietnamese agreements were 
currently under preparation. One is a new trade agreement and 
the Czech Republic would like to link its completion to finding 
a scheme for repaying Vietnamese debts to the Czech Republic. 
The other one is an agreement on the employment of the other 
country's citizens which, although balanced, mostly concerned 
Vietnamese. It would be signed soon during Czech Minister of 
Labour and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's visit to Vietnam, 
Zieleniec said. 
  Regarding agreements on the prevention of double taxation 
and 
investment protection, Zieleniec said that it was important that 
work on them started. Although such agreements are standard, 
they are not a matter of course in the event of such countries 
as Vietnam with predominantly centrally-managed economy and a 
non-convertible currency. 
  Asked whether the Czech Government was considering the 
establishment of a free trade zone with Vietnam, Zieleniec said 
that this would be difficult in case of a country whose economy 
was not based on the private ownership principle, and which was 
lacking a united taxation system and a market economy. 
  On the last day of his stay in Vietnam, Zieleniec visited 
the 
Viet Tien textile factory here. He was accompanied by Czech 
entrepreneurs and businessmen whose presence Zieleniec considers 
one of the most important aspects of his visit. 
  Vietnamese guests acquainted Zieleniec with the current way 
of industrial management in the situation when Vietnam has been 
switching over to a market economy for several years. 
  A seminar to provide Vietnamese partners with information on 
the current economic situation in the Czech Republic and exports 
possibilities of Czech companies was organised today here by 
Czech entrepreneurs and representatives of the Czech Ministry of 
Industry and Trade and the Czech National Bank. On Saturday [16 
April] a similar seminar was also held in Hanoi.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman 
of the Federation of Economic Organizations, Wednesday [20 
April] welcomed the prospect of Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
becoming Japan's new prime minister, saying he could provide 
stable leadership. 
  "Agreement has almost been reached on the principal 
policies. 
The new government will probably have more stability," Hiraiwa 
said. 
  The business leader said it is "not a bad thing" that the 
new 
government is taking time to form. "The coalition parties are 
trying to bring their views together. This implies that a firm 
framework will be established," Hiraiwa said. 
  Some differences in opinion may appear, however, when 
important policies are actually put into effect, he warned. 
  Commenting on fledgling signs of economic pickup, Hiraiwa 
noted that although consumer spending is improving, businesses 
are still taking time to recover. "But I don't think the 
economy will be like last year," he said, pointing to the lack 
of economic comeback in 1993. 
  He said the appreciation of the yen against the dollar will 
be central to judging corporate performance in the future.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties remained at loggerheads with one another during talks to 
narrow policy gaps over crucial elements of tax system reform 
and Japan's response to the suspected North Korean nuclear arms 
development program, coalition sources said Wednesday. 
  The coalition parties are trying to close their gaps before 
picking a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, whose eight-month administration faced repeated 
difficulties due to an intracoalition rift over policies. As a 
result, a meeting of coalition chiefs to nominate Hosokawa's 
successor was not held Wednesday, and the Diet is expected to 
hold the prime ministerial election Friday or later, the sources 
said. 
  The prospect emerged after the House of Representatives 
Steering Committee agreed to postpone the vote-taking session 
scheduled for Thursday to Friday or later. 
  Representatives of the coalition partners held on-and-off 
bargaining Wednesday to reconcile their differences over 
proposed tax system reform and how to ensure Japan's safety in 
the face of alleged North Korean efforts to develop nuclear arms. 
  The secretaries general of the coalition parties banded 
together shortly after 7 P.M. [1000 GMT] in the latest bid to 
close the differences but adjourned only nine minutes later. 
  The deputy chiefs of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, Japan New Party, the 
Democratic Socialist Party, the Democratic Reform Party and 
Kaikaku no Kai, a parliamentary group of LDP defectors in the 
House of Representatives, decided to call another meeting 
Thursday morning. 
  The process needs to be completed before the group can 
select 
a replacement for Hosokawa, who said April 8 that he will resign 
due to the paralysis of Diet business over alleged improprieties 
regarding his personal finances. 
  The SDP, the alliance's largest group, and the coalition's 
core party, Shinseito, are continuing to wrangle over a proposed 
hike in the consumption tax rate and Japan's response to a 
possible U.N. Security Council resolution to slap sanctions on 
North Korea. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's 
top 
strategist, has demanded the wording indicating a plan to 
approve a hike in indirect taxes be inserted into the 
coalition's policy platform document. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, however, balked at the 
stand and proposed alternative wording that calls for the 
abolition of the current consumption tax and for making up 
resultant revenue shortfalls with "the introduction of a new 
tax." 
  Kubo also called for inserting a further tough condition 
that 
mandates securing "public consent" before bringing in the new 
tax. 
  Ozawa blasted the SDP assertion for carrying a hidden 
intention to scuttle the proposed new tax later, saying, "a Diet 
member acts on the basis of public mandate." If public consent 
is mandated, they will have to conduct opinion polls for every 
policy proposal, he said. 
  Kubo said Shinseito's counterproposal to "hike the rate of 
an 
indirect tax" would open the way for raising the rate of the 
consumption tax from the current 3 percent, a move which has 
drawn the ire of the SDP, the sources said. 
  Shinseito also proposed drawing tax reform to a conclusion 
by 
the end of June and legislating a tax reform bill featuring the 
indirect tax hike by the end of this year. The SDP did not balk 
at the proposed timetable, but stuck to its condition calling 
for public consent. 
  In February, Hosokawa was forced to rescind a plan to 
replace 
the consumption tax with a new 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" 
because of strong opposition from the SDP, which threatened to 
pull out of the coalition. 
  Hosokawa proposed the imposition of the new tax partly to 
offset a 6 trillion yen tax cut and to secure budgetary revenues 
to finance growing government welfare spending for the elderly. 
  The SDP also withdrew its support for the agreed-upon 
wording 
on Japan's possible response to contingencies on the Korean 
peninsula if the United Nations moved to penalize Pyongyang for 
its continued refusal of full international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities. 
  The previous wording -- agreed upon Tuesday -- called for 
authorizing Japan to join the U.N.-approved "collective security 
measures." The SDP, concerned that such wording might obligate 
Japan to join collective security measures in the event of U.N. 
sanctions, proposed removing the wording "collective security 
measures." 
  The SDP also urged the coalition partners to approve its 
proposal to insert a condition that Japan be obligated to hold 
consultations not only with the United States and South Korea 
but with China if contingencies struck the Korean peninsula. 
  If the coalition representatives can forge agreement on the 
remaining policy gaps, their leaders will select Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata as their candidate for an upcoming Diet 
election to name a successor to Hosokawa.

  [Text] Thailand yesterday invited Burmese Foreign Minister 
Ohn Gyaw on an official visit to Bangkok as guest of the Foreign 
Ministry. The visit is separate to that for the ASEAN meeting 
in July. 
  "We extended the invitation to Burmese Foreign Minister U 
Ohn 
Gyaw to visit Thailand, and hope to meet him in July at the 
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers," said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Suwit Simasakun after hour-long talks between Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Burmese counterpart. 
  Thailand also informed Burma members of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations were considering its status at the ASEAN 
foreign ministers meeting due to take place in Bangkok, he said. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said his visit was not intended simply to 
extend an invitation to Rangoon but was aimed at explaining the 
whole ASEAN process and to assess the situation in Burma. 
  He said Burma had given a "very" positive response to his 
approach for Rangoon's participation at the July meeting. 
  It not has not been decided what status Burma should be 
offered in joining the meeting since Thailand has to consult 
further with other ASEAN members, the Foreign Minister said. 
  ASEAN senior officials last month raised no objections to 
Thailand inviting Burma as a "guest of the host country". 
  Burma also expressed interest in Thailand's initiative to 
organise a 10-nation meeting which would not be under the 
framework of ASEAN, said Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
  The meeting plans to bring together the six ASEAN countries, 
three Indochinese states--Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam--and Burma. 
The idea was raised by Sqn Ldr Prasong in an attempt to speed up 
the integration of the 10 Southeast Asian nations. 
  The Foreign Minister arrived in Rangoon yesterday for a 
two-day visit in the capacity of chairman of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee and Thailand's foreign minister. 
  On bilateral issues, the two sides agreed to hold a second 
meeting of the Thai-Burmese Joint Commission in September in 
Bangkok, the spokesman said. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said Thailand and Burma also agreed to 
discuss in detail the construction, use and management of a 
bridge across the Moei River from Mae Sot in Tak province to 
Burma's Myawaddy. 
  A technical team will be discussed as soon as possible to 
settle all details to facilitate construction, he said. 
  The Cabinet early this year approved construction of the 
bridge. 
  Burma has agreed to reconsider Thailand's request to reduce 
the sentences of Thai prisoners, said Mr Suwit. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday also held talks with Gen Than 
Shwe, 
chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and 
SLORC secretary Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
met visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci at Chongwadae [presidential 
office] Wednesday afternoon to exchange opinions on the North 
Korean nuclear question and the latest military movement in 
North Korea. 
  During the meeting, President Kim said the nuclear issue 
ought to be resolved through dialogue. "But, if dialogue efforts 
fail to bring about any tangible result, there would be no way 
but to use the last card,' namely, a U.N. sanction," Chongwadae 
spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted Kim as saying. Chu said the 
presidential position was readily agreed to by Secretary Perry. 
  President Kim and Secretary Perry shared the view that the 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear question requires solid 
and close cooperative system between South Korea and the United 
States and that presently bilateral cooperation is in a 
satisfactory state. 
  Secretary Perry said in particular that if the U.N. Security 
Council takes a sanction, it would apparently offend North 
Korea, adding his country is prepared to take full defensive 
steps in such a circumstance. 
  A number of Korean and American officials were present at 
the 
Chongwadae meeting. They included Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Yi Yang-ho and Chief Presidential 
Secretary Pak Kwan-yong from Korea. Among the U.S. officials 
present were Ambassador James Laney and U.S. Forces in Korea 
Commander Gen. Gary Luck.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on 
Wednesday agreed on the importance of additional nuclear 
inspection of North Korea. Ministers Han and Perry shared the 
view that what is most important at this stage is for North 
Korea to accept additional inspection of their nuclear 
facilities, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. 
  Chang said the two ministers agreed that only after North 
Korea underwent additional inspection can third-round U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks be held to discuss comprehensively the 
nuclear question and the issue of improving Washington-Pyongyang 
relations. 
  During the meeting, Perry stressed the importance of 
resolving the nuclear issue through diplomatic efforts as far as 
possible, the spokesman said. 
  The two ministers also observed that if North Korea fails to 
accept additional inspections within a given period, it would be 
unavoidable to promote a sanction against Pyongyang by the U.N. 
Security Council. In this connection, the spokesman said, Han 
and Perry decided to build up the joint defense ability of South 
Korea and the United States to prepare against any contingency. 
  The two ministers, however, ruled that the Korean peninsula 
is not in a critical state at the moment because there is no 
unusual military movement on the part of North Korea. They 
further reaffirmed the principle that the inter-Korean dialogue 
and U.S.-North Korea talks should be promoted in a complementary 
way, spokesman Chang said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has revealed that the 
South-North dialogue is not a precondition for the third round 
of U.S.-DPRK talks. He clearly stated that if North Korea 
accepts the additional International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will begin. 
  In a news conference with foreign reporters at the Press 
Center on 20 April, Foreign Minister Han said that South-North 
dialogue is very important for a comprehensive and complete 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, but the 
South-North dialogue can be a long-term precondition to solve it. 
  Minister Han also said that what is important under the 
current situation is for North Korea to accept the IAEA's 
inspection so that it can prove that it is not developing 
nuclear weapons. In addition, he stated that if North Korea 
shows the will to comply with the UN Security Council's 
president statement, the U.S.-DPRK contact can resume.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States decided Wednesday to conduct this year's "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercise in November if North Korea 
continues to refuse additional nuclear inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and does not show 
sincerity in resuming inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The decision came at an hour-long meeting between South 
Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his U.S. counterpart 
William Perry at the Defense Ministry. They evaluated the 
current situation concerning the North Korean nuclear dispute 
before arriving at their position. 
  The top defense officials decided to consider suspending the 
joint military exercise in case North Korea meets such 
conditions for a third round of Washington-Pyongyang high-level 
talks. 
  Accordingly, the governments of the two countries will hold 
the Team Spirit exercise should they find no progress in talks 
over the North Korean nuclear issue after watching the 
developments of the end of October. 
  Yi and Perry discussed ways to maintain the kind of 
deterrent 
force which has defended peace on the Korean peninsula for the 
past four decades in preparation for eventualities in the future. 
  The two defense ministers shared the view that the 
deployment 
of such advanced defensive weapons as Patriot missiles at 
American military bases in Korea would help beef up anti-air 
raid and anti-ballistic missile defense capability and 
contribute to joint Korea-U.S. deterrence of war. 
  In the meeting, Minister Yi said the Korean military is 
seeking to increase anti-artillery and night combat capabilities. 
  Perry said that the United States is persistently pushing 
for 
the modernization of its forces in Korea. 
  The ministers, however, agreed that there are no particular 
signs of North Korea moving to militarily provoke for the 
present. 
  The U.S. defense secretary, who arrived here Tuesday, 
conferred with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and senior 
presidential secretary for foreign and national security 
affairs, Chong Chong-uk. 
  The defense secretary is scheduled to visit the Second U.S. 
Infantry Division Thursday before leaving Seoul for Japan.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States are still willing to suspend this year's joint 
military exercise "Team Spirit" if North Korea allow 
satisfactory nuclear inspections, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
said Wednesday. 
  "Whether Team Spirit will resume this year depends entirely 
upon North Korea," he told a press conference with foreign 
correspondents, "whether North Korea allows necessary 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or 
not." 
  The remarks came immediately after defense ministers of the 
two countries agreed to go ahead with the annual maneuver in 
November if the inspection issue is not settled by then. 
  Seoul and Washington had announced last month Team Spirit 
suspension for 1994 on condition that the IAEA inspection on 
North Korea concludes in satisfaction. But IAEA inspectors 
reported they were hindered from full monitoring activities and 
were denied access to critical sites necessary in guaranteeing 
nuclear safeguards. 
  Han held Pyongyang responsible for the delayed North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks, blaming the Stalinist state for not 
keeping its end of the bargain. 
  "The meeting with the United States on North Korea's part is 
not simply a right it has but a favor U.S. can give," said Han, 
"IAEA inspection obligation is a basic obligation." 
  Pyongyang cannot expect the favor without fulfilling this 
basic obligation, he told the correspondents. 
  There are two types of necessary inspections, one necessary 
for maintaining the monitoring equipment such as cameras in 
operation, and the other for guaranteeing continuity in 
safeguards, the part that was left incomplete in March. 
  "One of the key conditions not met for the 3rd round (of 
North Korea-U.S.Talks) is the completion of the March inspection 
necessary for continuity of safeguards," he said. 
  "Inspection itself or promise of inspection will have to 
take 
place before any discussion between United States and North 
Korea." But despite all the frustrations, the international 
community still insists on diplomatic settlement of the crisis, 
he noted. 
  "...Despite our frustration caused by Pyongyang's 
intransigence, we must continue our on-going efforts to settle 
the issue through dialogue," said Han. 
  Asked about any guarantee of China's consent when the matter 
is referred to strong action by the U.N. Security Council, the 
foreign minister emphasized that the North Korean ally has 
played a positive role in the past through the process of 
diplomatic efforts. 
  "If such efforts all fail, then China will cooperate with 
the 
rest of the international community in trying to pursue whatever 
means possible to make North Korea comply," he said.

  [Text] William Taylor, deputy chief of the U.S. Institute 
for Strategy and International Affairs, said on 19 April that 
"North Korea would likely accept additional nuclear inspections 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as possible." 
He also said that "countries concerned should first take steps 
to provide economic support to North Korea, to recognize it as 
state, and to normalize relations with it." 
  Deputy Chief Taylor arrived in Beijing on 19 April after 
visiting North Korea on 12 April at the invitation of the North 
Korean authorities for the participation in President Kim 
Il-song's 82d birthday festival. In an interview with YONHAP 
News Agency, he said that "although he is carrying a letter 
signed by Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification and Policy 
Committee of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly to a 
South Korean high-level authority, he cannot disclose its 
contents right now." He has strongly expressed the intention to 
convey North Korea's formal position to the South Korean 
Government regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, North-South 
summit talks, and the resumption of North-South dialogue.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is 
expected to permit additional IAEA (International Atomic Energy 
Agency) inspections of its nuclear facilities soon, an American 
researcher on Korean affairs, said here Tuesday upon arriving 
from Pyongyang. 
  William Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies, told YONHAP in an exclusive interview 
that he expects North Korea to allow further IAEA checks in the 
near future, though he cannot tell exactly when. 
  Taylor visited Pyongyang from April 12-19 at the North 
Korean 
Government's invitation for President Kim Il-song's 82nd 
birthday and met with Kim for three and a half hours. 
  He said that during the meeting he got the impression that 
an 
inter-Korean summit would take place if the North and South 
relaxed their bureaucratic rigidity, though Kim did not make any 
direct mention of a summit. 
  Facing the United States, Japan and South Korea which he 
said 
have "strong hands," North Korea has only one card to use, 
staking everything on its nuclear program; to spur the North 
Koreans toward settlement of the dispute, the United States, 
Japan and South Korea should first prepare to offer economic 
assistance and diplomatic recognition, observed Taylor, who has 
visited Pyongyang four times. 
  He revealed that he is carrying a message from Kim Yong-sun, 
chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Unification Policy 
Committee, which he will personally deliver to a ranking South 
Korean Government official on or after Thursday, but he declined 
to comment on the message's content. 
  Taylor thus suggested he will convey Pyongyang's official 
position on resuming inter-Korean dialogue ahead of a summit and 
the nuclear dispute to Seoul later this week. 
  Taylor said North Korea would announce "very soon" a set of 
opening measures exceeding the existing joint-venture law in 
scope. 
  Chinese, Japanese and German companies already sell products 
to North Korea and its trade with third world countries is 
brisk; should this situation continue, South Korea and the 
United States would be the last in line for North Korea, he 
observed. 
  Denying western reports that North Koreans lead a miserable 
life, Taylor said the people looked healthy and happy despite 
President Kim's admission of food, clothing and energy shortages. 
  He said he had not conveyed a message from President Bill 
Clinton to Kim during his stay in Pyongyang nor was he carrying 
a message from Kim to either Clinton or South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam. 
  Taylor leaves for Seoul on Thursday and will stay there 
until 
next Tuesday.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Wednesday allowed a local shipping line to run a 
freighter directly to a North Korean harbor. Samsun Shipping 
Corp. will haul 250 tons of Remicon facilities and equipment to 
Yanji in northeastern China via Chongjin, a northern east coast 
harbor of North Korea. 
  An official at Samsun Shipping said one of its vessels, 
"Halibut," would leave Pusan at 8 P.M. Wednesday and enter 
Chongjin on April 22. After unloading its cargo, the vessel of 
St. Vincent registry will leave Chongjin on April 25 and return 
to Pusan around April 27, he said. The direct shipping from 
South Korea to the North will be the first of its kind in two 
years and eight months after the same line shipped 5,000 tons of 
South Korean rice from Mokpo to Najin in July 1991. 
  Samsun Shipping is learned to have set up a joint-venture 
firm with the Xianhu business group in China's Yanbian area last 
month and agreed to open a sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin. 
"We have approved the Pusan-Chongjin shipping because North 
Korea allowed the Xianhu business group to use the Chongjin 
harbor for cargoes from anywhere in the world," a National 
Unification Board official said. 
  Xianhu concluded a joint-venture contract with North Korea 
last June for the development of the Chongjin harbor, under 
which the Chinese group possesses the exclusive right to use the 
North Korean harbor for 50 years, the official explained.

  [Text] North Korea sent a telephone message today to our 
side in the name of Paek In-chun, chairman of the North Side's 
Headquarters of the Pannational Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomminyon], informing us that it will send a 
delegation to the 100-day memorial services for late Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan slated for 27 April. The telephone message proposed that 
a working-level contact be held to discuss this matter on 22 
April in Panmunjom. 
  The National Unification Board announced that it will not 
respond to this proposal, claiming that Pomminyon has not only 
been described in the domestic laws as a pro-enemy organization 
but the proposal will not be conducive to alleviating today's 
tense North-South relations created by the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has sought 
cooperation from the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) through formal diplomatic channels on 
relocating North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps, a 
Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. 
  Seoul's mission in Geneva explained about the human rights 
conditions at the Pyongyang-run logging camps and about those 
escapees reportedly seeking defection to South Korea to the U.N. 
body, requesting its support for their resettlement in the 
South, the official said. 
  The government told the UNHCR that it was willing to accept 
all logging refugees wishing to live in the South as well as 
others in the future after discussions with the Russian 
Government. 
  Out of an estimated 25,000 loggers, some 170 escapees are 
said to want to settle in the South. 
  The government also instructed its embassy in Russia to 
protect North Korean loggers seeking help and to assist them in 
coming to the South after confirming their identification and 
choice of future residence together with the Russian Government 
and the UNHCR, the official said. 
  The Ministry, meeting on the matter Friday, decided to 
support the loggers' resettlement according to the protection 
law for North Korean defectors if the number is low. 
  But if too many wish to live in the South, the government 
will revise the law and reduce the available funding for them. 
  A team comprising officials from the Economic Planning 
Board, 
the Labor Ministry, the Agency for National Security Planning, 
the Health and Social Affairs Ministry and the National Police 
Agency will be formed to assist the loggers.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- More than 300 North 
Koreans who escaped from Siberian logging yards are hiding in 
Russia, besides the 200 or so who have already sought refuge in 
the South, a senior government official said Sunday. 
  The official said, "the government has investigated the 
number of escapees from Siberian logging camps and found that 
there are still 300 more North Korean escapees who have not 
sought refuge in the South." 
  However, he said, once the government actually allows the 
North Koreans to settle here, more escapees are expected to seek 
refuge in South Korea. 
  "It seems that they have not visited the South Korean 
Embassy 
to seek refuge for fear that it would harm their families in 
North Korea," he said. 
  The government has also discovered that some escapees want 
to 
settle in Russia rather than in South Korea. 
  "If they wish to live in Russia, the government will support 
their settlement there through consultation with the Russian 
Government." 
  North Korea operates logging yards in Siberia under a 
contract with the Russian Government, with hundreds of North 
Korean loggers reportedly having escaped due to poor working 
conditions and alleged infringement of human rights. 
  The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to 
expire at the end of last year and the two sides are now 
negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded an improvement in 
human rights conditions at the camps.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The government has begun 
negotiations to bring to South Korea escapees from North 
Korea-run logging camps in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, Foreign 
Ministry officials said Monday. 
  Eight North Koreans have asked to be brought here through 
the 
South Korean Embassy in Kazakhstan and five more at the Embassy 
in Uzbekistan, the officials said. 
  "The government will seek cooperation with these countries 
as 
well as with Russia to resettle them here," said one official. 
"Negotiations are under way and we have asked for support from 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees." 
  Seoul announced last week that it would accept all camp 
escapees as long as they are not serious criminal offenders. 
  The number of those in flight is estimated to be as high as 
500.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- There is no plan to 
bring North Korean escapees currently sheltering in China, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday. "Right now, the 
most urgent issue is with those who have escaped from logging 
camps in Siberia," Han said in a press conference with foreign 
correspondents. 
  Seoul announced this week it will accept all North Koreans 
who fled the logging camps in Siberia and seek resettlement in 
South Korea. The number is estimated at as many as 500. 
  The decision focused new attention of another group of North 
Koreans who have fled the home government and are in flight 
throughout China, seeking a way to the South. "We have no 
particular plans to actively seek return, coming of those in 
China, simply because we don't have the kind of requests that 
were made in connection with the loggers in Siberia," Han told 
reporters. 
  Pyongyang and Beijing have an agreement that says the two 
sides will repatriate any illegal entrants from the other side. 
Officials here have said they are concerned any exposure of 
such North Koreans in hiding in China will risk their personal 
safety.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- Commemorating the 34th 
anniversary of the "April 19 Revolution," the student uprising 
in 1960 that toppled the Syngman Rhee regime, President Kim 
Yong-sam visited the April 19 cemetery in Suyuri Tuesday and 
paid his respects at the newly built and relocated shrine of the 
fallen demonstrators. 
  Kim labeled the student uprising a "revolution" once he 
became president last year and began work to make the cemetery 
holy precincts. 
  Noting the spirit of April 19 had been newly enhanced since 
the birth of his civilian government last year, Kim called for 
further efforts to develop the uprising's legacy. 
  He ordered the commemorative service and events be held in 
the cemetery from next year once the refurbishment is finished. 
  He spoke with representatives of the bereaved families and 
then leaders of the student movement while walking around the 
grounds. 
  Kim became the first incumbent president to visit the 
cemetery last year. 
  Other government and political leaders, together with 
students and bereaved families, lined up to pay homage to those 
who died during clashes with the police. 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, government leaders and nearly 
500 representatives of the uprising held a commemorative 
ceremony, sponsored by the Patriots and Veterans Affairs 
Ministry, at the Sejong Cultural Center in downtown Seoul. 
  "The basic idea behind the April 19 (Revolution) is to 
create 
a constitutional nation where people's rights are guaranteed and 
individual freedom is allowed," Yi said in a keynote speech. 
  "We should not forget that we were able to open up a real 
democratic era today because of the firm faith in democracy 
implanted through the April 19 (event)," he said. 
  He declared that the government was hastening to carry out 
legal revisions to reappraise the democratic revolution. 
  Similiar ceremonies were held in other cities and provinces. 
  The uprising, designated as a revolution from this year, was 
marked not only by dissident parties and students but by 
political leaders from both the ruling and opposition camps. 
  Opposition Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek and 200 party 
members visited the cemetery early in the morning, followed 
immediately by ruling Democratic Liberal Party members led by 
Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil. 
  Cemetery managers expect more than 10,000 visitors during 
the 
day. 
  Nearly 7,000 university students in Seoul gathered for 
ceremonies at their respective campuses to hold various events 
including a marathon, street march and cycling games. 
  An opera on the subject will be performed in the evening at 
the Seoul Opera Theater.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19, IRNA -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamed and visiting Iranian Majlis speaker 
Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri discussed Tehran-Kuala 
Lumpur ties and major regional and international issues in a 
meeting here Tuesday. 
  Nateq-Nuri underscored the need for promotion of political 
and economic cooperation between the two Muslim countries. He 
also condemned the UN secretary general's indifference towards 
the rights of the Bosnian Muslims and suggested that Muslim 
countries should mobilize their forces to defend them. 
  Mohamed termed as "successful" the visit to Malaysia of 
Nateq-Nuri and said that such visits provide most suitable 
opportunities for making decision on broadening bilateral ties. 
  He said that his country was interested in enhancing 
relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and that he had 
issued necessary orders in this regards after he returned from a 
recent official visit to Tehran. 
  Touching on the status quo in Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H], he 
said the UN opposed despatch of the Iranian forces to that 
country under the pretext of their siding with the Bosnian 
Muslims, while it allowed pro-Serb Russians to be present there. 
  "The UN is responsible in this connection and we condem the 
UN secretary general for his action," Malaysian prime minister 
said. 
  He called on Muslims to patch up their differences and 
instead adopt a unified decision to solve the problems of the 
Muslim world. 
  The two sides also discussed exports of the Iranian non-oil 
commodities to Malaysia, and implementation of joint projects.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 20, IRNA -- Majles Speaker 'Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nuri Tuesday termed the fall of Gorazde as an 
"intolerable crime" and said that the tragic catastrophe was 
indicative of a conspiracy masterminded by the U.S. and its 
Western allies. 
  Speaking at a press conference here the speaker reiterated 
that the fall of Gorazde proved the futility of all U.N., 
Security Council and NATO agreements. 
  Nateq-Nuri said that the world free nations, especially 
Muslims, should help and support the oppressed people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with all their might. 
  Nateq-Nuri blamed the U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for his ineptitude and weakness in dealing with 
Bosnian issue. He also said that Butrus-Ghali's resignation 
prior to the fall of Gorazde would have been to his benefit 
because it would have assured him of a good reputation in 
history as "an honest and truthful man." 
  Referring to the outcome of his discussions with Malaysian 
officials including his counterpart Mohamed Zahir bin Haji 
Ismail and the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed as positive and 
constructive, the speaker said that decisions on promotion of 
economic and trade relations as well as on the expansion of 
political relations have been made by the two sides. 
  On bilateral economic cooperation, he commented that the 
joint economic commission would soon pave the way for a more 
active participation of private sector and Iran will also 
increase its purchase of palm oil from Malaysia. 
  On Iran-Iraq relations, Nateq-Nuri stressed that discussions 
at foreign ministry level have been held. 
  He expressed hope that agreements would be reached in this 
regard and added that Iran for its part has no reluctance to 
cooperate with Iraq.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The wait still wages on whether or not to lift 
sanctions imposed on Iraq following the Gulf war. The UN 
Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1991 until the country 
met all demands of Resolution 687. To date, Iraq has entered 
into the last phase of its destruction program. If by initial 
difficulties it has cooperated with the UN inspectors over its 
nuclear arsenal site. The majority of the Security Council 
members and nonmembers are in favor of lifting sanctions. These 
countries are satisfied that Iraq had met all the conditions. 
But the United States and Britain want to impose political 
conditions before the sanctions were lifted. This is beyond what 
was agreed to originally under Resolution 687. It is unfair to 
impose new conditions. After all, the sanctions were imposed to 
punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in August 1990. By now, the 
Iraqis would have learned their lesson. They know very well 
that having designs of future invasions would be met with tough 
retaliatory military measures. 
  Therefore, those obstructing the lifting of sanctions are 
not 
being fair to Iraq. Questions are being raised over the 
discrimination and policy selectivity with regards to Iraq's 
vis-a-vis UN's policies on Bosnia, Somalia, and the Israeli 
occupation of Palestine. So, is the Security Council fair in 
continuing to impose the trade and arms embargo on Iraq? Also, 
are the council's decisions dominated by the one or two 
countries and not the majority? 
  By now, the sanctions will have served their purpose. 
Continuing to punish Iraq will merely cause further hardship on 
its people. Through the sanctions, the people of Iraq have been 
facing an acute shortage of food and medicine. Although the 
sanctions do not include food and medicine, the inability to 
trade means the lack of financial resources. So, it does not 
have enough money to buy the much required supplies. The 
country is also lacking humanitarian aid. Thousands of people 
will die if the sanctions are not lifted. Besides this, the 
country plunged into an economic doom since the Gulf war for 
which it finds difficulty to recover. 
  It is about time some of the permanent members realize that 
the embargo is no longer justified. Only then will Iraq be able 
to put back its economy on the road to recovery. 
  However, for Iraq, the lifting of the sanctions must not 
mean 
going back to old ways. Malaysia, along with the majority of 
the UN members, did not condone its invasion of Kuwait. This is 
more so since Iraq along with Kuwait and Malaysia are Muslim 
countries and members of the Organization of Islamic Countries, 
OIC. At the same time, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and certain Arab 
countries say that Iraq is still a threat to region's security. 
  Three years after the Gulf war, Iraq still does not 
recognize 
the borders with Kuwait and refuses to free Kuwaitis it holds. 
Iraq, therefore, needs to be more forthcoming in meeting the 
demands of Resolution 687. It also needs to show sincere 
peaceful gestures to its neighbors in the Gulf. This is because 
Iraq's good ties with the OIC members will be crucial to ensure 
its survival in world trade. Also, Arab countries do not want a 
repeat of the invasion of Kuwait.

  [Text] Malaysia considers the development of defense among 
the ASEAN member countries a contribution toward the maintenance 
of the region's security. Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun 
Razak said Malaysia does not feel threatened by such a 
development and the ASEAN member countries increased their 
purchase of defense equipment. Malaysia considers the purchase 
of defense equipment by ASEAN member countries a part of the 
armed forces modernization process. Datuk Najib told this to 
newsmen after opening the fourth Asian Defense Services Expo and 
Conference in Kuala Lumpur. 
  He said Malaysia also is planning to upgrade its armed 
forces 
capabilities in an effort to maintain peace and security along 
with its neighbors in this region. Malaysia was of the opinion 
that the ASEAN member countries need to further upgrade their 
bilateral ties, particularly in the defense sector.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Authorities 
seized 12 firearms, including a machine gun and two grenade 
launchers, from Vietnamese fishermen who encroached into 
Malaysian waters since 1990. Fisheries Department Marine 
Division Chief Abdul Hamid Shukor said among the weapons seized 
were two AK-44 assault rifles, five AK-47s, four M-16s, one Uzi 
sub-machine gun with 656 rounds of M-16 ammunition, 13 rounds on 
40mm ammunition, 493 rounds of AK-47 ammunition and 35 grenades. 
  He said 339 fishermen and 32 boats were detained since 1990. 
  Abdul Hamid said two AK-44 assault rifles and a grenade 
launcher was found hidden in a Vietnamese fishing boat last 
month. 
  From now onwards all foreign fishing boats will be 
thoroughly 
checked, he said at a press conference here Tuesday. 
  Abdul Hamid said local fishermen should not be worried 
because the seizures showed that the authorities were always 
conducting patrols. He reminded local fishermen who came across 
foreign fishing boats to contact the authorities immediately.

  [Text] Singapore, April 19 (AFP) -- The Singapore 
Government Tuesday denied US media reports that an American 
teenager was tortured and forced to confess to acts of vandalism 
for which he has been ordered caned by a Singapore court. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs said that a probe by a special 
police unit carried out in October last year found no evidence 
to substantiate the claim that 18-year-old Michael Fay from 
Dayton, Ohio, was abused during interrogation. 
  "The IIS [Internal Investigation Section] investigation 
revealed no evidence of police abuse," a ministry spokesman 
said, responding to queries from AFP. The IIS, or Internal 
Investigation unit, is charged with probing public complaints 
against the police. 
  The Home Ministry's denial came in the face of escalating 
media attention on a US demand that Singapore cancel the court 
order that Fay be given six strokes of a rattan cane, which 
could leave him permanently scarred. 
  "Michael Fay was examined in hospital and also by doctors 
who 
had been examining him daily during his remand. No injury was 
detected," the spokesman said. 
  The spokesman said that the probe was ordered after the US 
embassy here lodged a verbal complaint that Fay and two other 
American boys being similarly investigated for vandalism 
suffered severe abuse. 
  The US Embassy was given a full account of the probe's 
findings but "did not respond nor pursue the matter further," 
the spokesman said. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES said Monday that Fay had insisted to 
family and friends that he was forced to confess to 
spray-painting cars during a police beating, claiming that he 
was innocent. 
  Fay is serving a four-month jail term at Queenstown Prison 
while lawyers prepare an appeal for clemency in a bid to get the 
authorities to drop the painful, potentially skin-splitting 
lashing. 
  The appeal is expected to reach Singapore President Ong Teng 
Cheong on Wednesday. 
  The spokesman said that Fay's conviction was based on a 
guilty plea he entered to charges of spray-painting two cars, 
pelting the vehicles with eggs and keeping stolen property, not 
on his confession statement. 
  "In short, the statement had no bearing on Michael Fay's 
conviction," he said. 
  The spokesman said that allegations that Fay was being 
singled out for punishment because the government wanted to send 
a message to Singaporeans about "decadent Western ways" were 
also unfounded. 
  He said that 14 others, among them two foreigners, were 
caned 
for vandalism between 1989 and last year. 
  Another American, a Hongkonger and two Malaysians arrested 
along with Fay were also facing charges of vandalism. 
  "It is therefore absurd to say that Michael Fay is being 
singled out, and then concoct some theory to support this 
allegation," the spokesman said. 
  Fay has drawn extensive publicity since his conviction last 
month, and Singapore has received appeals urging it to spare the 
rod from President Bill Clinton, several US senators and human 
rights groups like Amnesty International. 
  US newspapers have described caning as barbaric, and THE NEW 
YORK TIMES has urged American multinationals operating here to 
pressure Singapore to drop the caning.

  [Text] Cambodia has promised to stop publicly accusing 
Thailand of continuing to aid the Khmer Rouge [KR] according to 
Sakthip Krairiksh, Thailand's Ambassador to Cambodia. 
  "(Cambodian Foreign Minister) Prince (Norodom) Sirivudh 
assured me that Cambodia will no longer speak of such things to 
the press so that the situation gets better," Sakthip said in a 
telephone interview. 
  Sakthip visited Sirivudh on Monday to lodge a formal protest 
over Cambodia's allegations that Thailand provided refuge to a 
Khmer Rouge leader and allowed the Maoist faction's troops into 
its territory. 
  According to the Ambassador, the six-point protest tells of 
Thailand's stance on the intemal affairs of Cambodia and its 
dissatisfaction over allegations made by some Cambodian leaders 
that Thailand assisted the faction in fighting against Phnom 
Penh government troops. 
  It also urged Cambodia to take measures to ensure that 
fighting there will not seriously affect Thais living along the 
border. 
  The protest also called for evidence for every allegation 
made by Cambodia, Sakthip said. 
  "I informed the (foreign) minister that he could call me any 
time for explanation and discussion when questions of such kind 
arose. It is better to solve this sort of problem through 
diplomatic channels." Sakthip said, adding that the situation 
could return to normal as soon as the two parties stopped 
speaking through the media. 
  Sakthip said that Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen had 
been due to visit Thailand after Cambodia's traditional New Year 
day (April 13) but said no official contact over the trip had 
been made between the two governments. 
  "Therefore, this cannot be called a cancellation since we 
never had it officially confirmed," he said. 
  "Besides, we will not be ready to receive Hun Sen since 
Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai will be in Malaysia and Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri in Burma at the time (of the visit)," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak said the 
military was ready to protect the country from future attacks by 
Cambodian government forces. "The Army is prepared to maintain 
security along the border," he told reporters. 
  Vijit insisted that Thailand has been sincere in dealing 
with 
Cambodia and the Army has followed government policy of not 
getting involved in the internal affairs of the war-torn country. 
  He also said that as neighbours the two countries should 
solve this problem as soon as possible. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday said 
Thailand and Cambodia are becoming aware that public slanging 
matches concerning the Khmer Rouge are counter-productive and 
should stop forthwith. 
  Surin said civilians of both countries living along the 
border have to shoulder the effects of misunderstanding between 
both countries. The effects include fighting spilling over from 
western Cambodia. 
  "Thai Ambassador to Phnom Penh Sakthip Krairiksh has 
submitted a protest note to Prince Norodom Sirivudh, the foreign 
minister. So far Cambodia has not responded, which indicates 
that Cambodia doesn't want to prolong the issue," he said. 
  According to Surin, the country is still waiting for 
evidence 
from Cambodia to support Prince Ranariddh's claim that he has 
photographic evidence proving Thailand's support for the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  The dispute should be a good lesson for both countries that 
criticism made publicly cannot solve bilateral 
misunderstandings, he said. 
  An informed source said U.S. Ambassador Designate to 
Cambodia 
Charles Twining, recently informed a hearing organized by the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Thai government 
genuinely wants to support the legitimate government of Cambodia.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 19 (AFP) -- A force of three 
thousand Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrillas stormed back into the 
northwest town of Pailin on Tuesday, a month after losing the 
stronghold to government troops, a spokesman for the radical 
faction said. 
  "We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight 
government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the 
Khmer Rouge spokesman in the capital told AFP. 
  Casualty figures were not yet confirmed, he said. 
  The spokesman said the 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced 
back some 7,000 government troops. 
  "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he 
said. 
  The Khmer Rouge need to clear mines around the town, "then 
we 
can bring back the people who lived there before," the spokesman 
said. 
  Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh, speaking from Battambang, 
admitted that the Khmer Rouge had recaptured part of Pailin. 
  "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said. "Some of 
our troops are countering the attack and there is fighting going 
on there." 
  Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation 
at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15 
tanks. 
  Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was 
not 
yet clear. 
  "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said. 
  "The nature of military (operations) is like that, there is 
pushing up and down," he said. Co-premier Hun Sen also went to 
Battambang Province Tuesday, a government official said. 
  The region's military headquarters is based in the city of 
Battambang, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Pailin. 
  Military officials, confirmed there was shelling in Pailin 
early Tuesday and increased fighting in the area was been 
reported during the past week. 
  A Western diplomat, however, cautioned there was "no hard 
evidence" to confirm the fall of Pailin. 
  "The government was pouring all sorts of resources into the 
area. So even if they were knocked out of Pailin town, they 
could be in a good position to take it back," the diplomat said. 
  The government forces captured Pailin March 19 and the Khmer 
Rouge, rather than face them in a conventional battle, retreated 
from the town and melted into the hills to the west along the 
Thai border. 
  Generals said the capture of the resource-rich area was a 
major blow to the notorious guerrilla faction opposing the 
government that emerged from the UN-sponsored elections last May. 
  The Khmer Rouge financed their organisation by selling 
gem-mining and logging concessions, primarily to Thai business 
consortia, many of which were reported to have links with the 
Thai military. 
  The government commanders said at the time that if they 
could 
not hold Pailin "they did not deserve to be called the Royal 
Cambodian Armed Forces." 
  The commanders swore that they would not let Pailin suffer 
the same fate as Anlung Veng, another major guerrilla base which 
the government forces seized -- only to be routed several weeks 
later when the guerrillas launched a major counter-attack. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk expressed his support for the 
government's seizure of Pailin, and described the offensive as 
"legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable." 
  But the king warned the victory could be a "double-edged 
sword" and the army could be entering a situation akin to Dien 
Bien Phu, where a static French force fell to a nimble force of 
Vietnamese guerrillas. 
  If the guerrillas recaptured Pailin, it would seriously 
undermine government's and the army's credibility and morale and 
"hypothetically could threaten the very future of our new 
regime," the king said. 
  Western military analysts had predicted that the guerrillas 
might try to recapture their base when the rainy season started 
in May-June. 
  The rains would turn the already difficult supply routes 
into 
almost impassable, treacherous trails of mud, they said.

  [Text] Recently Samdech Son Sann, dean of the National 
Assembly, issued a four-point statement on behalf of the 
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP] affirming his party's 
position and appealing to all parties with seats in the National 
Assembly to work together for a solution to the Khmer Rouge 
problem. 
  This statement was made as His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
and his queen were returning to the country and after government 
forces had captured the Khmer Rouge's important region of Pailin 
and other positions along the western border. 
  Samdech Son Sann gave the following as reason: "The conflict 
in Cambodia has caused untold sufffering to the people. Of all 
the major problems that they have faced over the past two 
decades, the serious Khmer Rouge problem is yet to be solved." 
  In point one, Samdech Son Sann explained that "the 
settlement 
of the Khmer Rouge problem must be achieved through peaceful 
means..." because any military solution would only bring 
tragedies and deaths to the people and cause shortages of food, 
medicine, and so on. 
  Samdech Son Sann said: "We believe that solving the Khmer 
Rouge problem militarily can only delay Cambodia's 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. It can only frighten away 
foreign investments to neighboring countries." He pointed out 
the eventuality that "such an action would instead help the 
neighboring countries suck up all the economic advantages and 
would plunge Cambodia into a state of insecurity." 
  In the second point of his statement, Samdech Son Sann 
proposed that to solve the Khmer Rouge problem and put an end to 
the tragedies, "the Royal Government and all parties in the 
National Assembly must make sacrifices and concessions." 
  Samdech Son Sann urged the parties to consider not just 
their 
own interests but also those of the nation and to reconcile with 
one another in accordance with the peace proposal of King 
Norodom Sihanouk, the architect of national reconciliation. 
  Samdech Son Sann stated: "The Constitution is the work of 
the 
National Assembly. Therefore, the National Assembly has the 
right to amend it" for the sake of national unity and national 
concord. He made this remark in reference to certain provisions 
in the Constitution that do not agree with the king's proposal 
to give cabinet positions to some persons within the Khmer Rouge 
leadership. 
  In the third point of the statement Samdech Son Sann 
declared 
on behalf of the BLDP: "The party supports the king's five-point 
peoposal made on 23 November 1993" and "we appeal to the Royal 
Government to agree to solve the Khmer Rouge problem on the 
basis of this five-point proposal." 
  In the fourth point of the statement Samdech Son Sann also 
voiced support for the king's communique dated 7 March 1994 
concerning the dangerous consequences of a war between the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces and the forces of the Khmer Rouge. He went 
on to say: "We would like to emphasize that without national 
reconciliation there can be no peace, there can be no 
reconstruction, and the question of territorial integrity cannot 
be settled." 
  Some analysts noted that the timing of Samdech Son Sann's 
appeal seems to be wrong because, first of all, the Royal 
Government has already controlled the Khmer Rouge areas at 
Anlung Veng and Pailin, thus bringing changes to the situation 
although the door to negotiations is said to remain open. 
  They think that there is now a tendency to use military 
means 
rather than talks. On the chessboard, the government side has 
the upper hand as it is winning one Khmer Rouge "pawn" after 
another, and it is even on the verge of checkmating the Khmer 
Rouge "king."

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto says it is 
unlikely that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, after only eight months in power, will affect 
the strong relations between the two countries. 
  Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters on Saturday 
that the President viewed Hosokawa's resignation as relating 
solely to the domestic affairs of Japan and that it should not 
have any repercussions on bilateral ties with Indonesia. 
  Suharto, according to Murdiono, expressed his wish that 
Japan 
would soon overcome its domestic political problems and elect a 
new prime minister. 
  "The leadership change in Japan is not going to affect the 
politics and government of that country," Murdiono said, echoing 
the President. 
  Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas, also voicing 
confidence that Indonesian-Japanese ties will remain unaffected, 
stressed on Saturday that it is only the prime minister who has 
resigned, and that the government will remain. 
  Japan is Indonesia's main trading partner and also its 
largest source of foreign aid. 
  The two countries in recent years have tried to expand their 
bilateral ties to include other aspects, most notably culture.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Soviet block in Eastern Europe 
may have collapsed but according to a senior Army officer, 
Indonesia must be vigilant against a communist revival. 
  "Communism remains a latent danger in Indonesia now and in 
the future," Brigadier General Agum Gumelar, the chief of the 
Army's elite force Kopassus [Special Forces Command], told 
reporters yesterday. 
  "Communism will return if the condition of society becomes 
chaotic," Agum said during a rare press conference given by him 
at the command's headquarters in Cijantung, East Jakarta, in 
connection with Kopassus' upcoming 42nd anniversary. 
  The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) has been outlawed since 
1966. 
  Kopassus spearheaded the Army's move to quash the communist 
forces immediately after the failed coup attempt by PKI in 1965. 
  The highly disciplined force has also been prominent in most 
major military operations in Indonesia, including putting down 
separatist rebellions in Aceh, East Timor and Irian Jaya. 
  Agum said leftist and rightist elements are constantly 
trying 
to replace the political system in Indonesia which has been 
painstakingly built since 1966, by criticizing and attacking the 
system at every opportune moment. 
  He felt that they immediately blame the system for any 
mishaps, adding that the right elements would also exploit 
religious issues to further their cause. 
  He also warned against other elements, particularly from 
Western- educated liberal-minded intellectuals, who constantly 
demand political and economic reforms. 
  "They focus on labor and land conflicts to attack the 
government. Such movements, if not controlled, will worsen the 
social, political and economic conditions," he said. 
  He accused non-governmental organizations [NGOs] of using 
such issues as democratization, political openness, 
environmental protection and human rights to discredit the 
government and the Armed Forces (ABRI). 
  "We know many NGOs have become vocal, both at home and 
overseas, on human rights and environmental issues in their 
efforts to discredit the government and ABRI. They are also 
against the constitution and Pancasila [The ideological basis of 
the Indonesian state]," he said. 
  "What do Princen and Adnan Buyung Nasution really hope to 
achieve by advocating the human rights of criminals?" he asked, 
referring two of Indonesia's most outspoken human rights 
campaigners. "Tell me which is more important. Protecting the 
human rights of criminals or those of the good guys?" He said 
ABRI and the government were open to criticism, provided they 
were aired with the intention to help the government improve the 
people welfare and not to replace the system. 
  "What would become of this nation if there was a revolution 
to overturn the Pancasila democracy?," he asked. "We will go 
back to square one after people have been waiting for a long 
time to enjoy a good standard of living. " 
  Despite many shortcomings and weaknesses, people should give 
credit to the present government for improving their welfare, he 
said.

  [Text] Jakarta, 19 Apr (ANTARA) -- Minister for Agriculture 
Syarifudin Baharsyah has said that he is confident the national 
rice production in 1994 will be the same as last year's, he told 
journalists here Monday. 
  He said that in anticipation of floods and rice field pests, 
the Pest Control Agency of the agricultural mass guidance 
(BIMAS) have already made necessary control measures in 
production centers of the country. 
  Activities to safeguard production in 1994 planting season 
include intensive planting, quality improvement, use of the urea 
pills and the proper chanelling of the farmers business loans 
(kut). 
  Syarifudin said that the forecast made by the Central Bureau 
of Statistics for 1994 rice production will be 8 million tons of 
milled dry and unhulled paddy (gkg) for over 10.7 ha of harvest 
area, actually the same as last year's rice production. 
  He noted, however, that the long drawn-out rainy season has 
led the late planting season and difficulties for farmers to 
harvest rice of superior quality.

<F P=106> [Article by Ellen Tordesillas: "Cooperation Not </F>
Confrontation] 
  [Text] One of the topics to be discussed in the third 
national security meeting under the Ramos administration on 
Thursday is the president's proposal to demilitarize the South 
China Sea made during his visit to Vietnam two weeks ago. 
  The president's Spratly initiative has activated the South 
China Sea problem in a positive way. From merely a pledge of 
all claimants to solve the conflict in a peaceful manner, the 
president challenged all claimant estates and other Southeast 
Asian nations to jointly study the possible demilitarization of 
the area and a freeze on all destabilizing activities related to 
the Spratlys conflict. 
  Although all claimant countries have been a model of 
rationality, at the back of everybody's mind is the fear that 
something might spark a violent confrontation that will make the 
Spratlys the "flashpoint" that it has been described by the 
region's military and political analysts. 
  Of the 104 islands in the Spratlys covering a stretch of 
some 
1,000 kilometers, 45 are occupied by the claimants' armed 
forces. Vietnam occupies 25, China eight ; Philippines eight; 
Malaysia three, and Taiwan, one (Itu Aba, the largest island and 
confirmed to contain all deposits). 
  The oil-rich, tiny kingdom of Brunei is the only claimant 
that does not maintain a military presence in the Spratlys 
because the island it is claiming, the Luisa Reef, is nearly 
completely submerged at high tide. 
  Vietnam, which knows more than anybody else the destructive 
effect of engaging in hostilities with other countries, has 
responded positively to the proposal of President Ramos. 
  China, whom everybody is wary about because of reports of 
its 
military buildup in the area, merely reiterated its line to the 
effect that although Chinese sovereignty over the whole South 
China Sea is a fact and not a matter of negotiations, they are 
willing to talk about joint projects. 
  The question in many people's mind is: in case of 
hostilities 
in the Spratlys, will the self-proclaimed policeman of the 
world, the United States, come in? 
  Vietnamese officials said there's very little at stake for 
the United States in Southeast Asia for the United States to 
warrant its involvement in hostilities in South China Sea. 
  Philippine officials, however, think otherwise. 
  A paper presented in 1990 by Jorge R. Coquia, former legal 
adviser of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in the first 
workshop in the management of conflict in the South China Sea 
held in Bali, pointed out: "In the case of the United States, 
the South China Sea is one of the four alternate eastbound 
routes used by tankers sailing for the West Coast from the U.S. 
from the Persian Gulf. [as published] The South China Sea region 
is the nexus for energy material transportation between the 
Middle East and East Asia and the United States. More than 90 
per cent of Japan's oil imports move through this region as does 
most of the oil supply of the Republic of Korea." 
  The Coquia paper further said: "A break in the subtle chain 
of some two hundred tankers en route would mean a fatal clot in 
Japan's "life blood." The oil embargo of 1973-1974 revealed 
Japan's vulnerability and its dependence on the lanes in the 
South China Sea." 
  Despite categorical statements from U.S. officials that 
conflict in the Spratlys is not covered by the Mutual Defense 
Treaty (MDT) which binds both parties to come to each other's 
help in case of an armed attack in any of the areas of either 
party, an NSC [National Security Council] official believes that 
the United States can be enticed to get involved if its 
interests in the region is threatened. 
  That's why, the official said, it is best to let the MDT 
remain ambiguous as far as U.S. commitment to the defense of the 
Philippines is concerned. 
  He said ambiguity gives room for "creative imagination." 
  The official said the MDT could provide the United States an 
excuse to intervene militarily in a South China Sea conflict, in 
case the China threat becomes real. 
  The official also said unlike during the Gulf War when the 
United States had to get U.N. approval to intervene in the 
Iraq-Kuwait conflict, the U.S. can invoke the MDT to intervene 
in a Spratly hostilities. 
  But that is one of the extreme scenarios. The more 
attractive one is the president's call for demilitarization and 
freeze to all destabilizing activities activists in the area 
with the end in view of transforming the South China Sea "from 
the waters of contention to an area of cooperation."

  [Excerpt] Chinese nationals will now find it easier to 
enter the country as President Ramos yesterday granted them 
easier access to multiple entry visas. 
  Executive Order 168 authorizes the issuance of multiple 
entry 
visas valid for six months to Chinese nationals coming to the 
Philippines for business or pleasure. 
  Under the law, Chinese nationals are defined as persons who 
hold passports from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Macao. 
  The president said granting this type of visa to Chinese 
nationals is in line with government's policy to attract and 
promote trade, investment and tourism as instruments of the 
country's economic growth and national development. 
  The new law allows the issuance of multi-entry visas to 
Chinese nationals by Philippine Foreign Service establishments 
without prior authorization from the DFA [Department of Foreign 
Affairs], provided the applicant meets the following requirement: 
-- duly accomplished visa application form; 
  -- passport valid for six months beyond the period of 
authorized stay in the Philippines; 
  -- valid entry visa to the next port of destination or 
reentry to the country of origin; 
  -- confirmed return or onward package ticket; and, 
  -- proof of bona fide status as tourist or businessman. 
  The visa fees are $1OO for a multiple entry visa valid for 
six months; $50 for multiple entry visas valid for three months 
and $25 for single entry visas valid for three months. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] New initiatives to accelerate the implementation of 
the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) were pushed in the recent ASEAN 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASEAN-CCI) series of meetings 
in Brunei. 
  The AFTA, which took effect last 1 January, requires the six 
ASEAN countries to reduce intra-regional tariffs on all 
manufactured goods to between 0 percent to 5 percent within 15 
years through the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) 
scheme. 
  Its primary objective is to create a single ASEAN market of 
330 million people and a combined GNP exceeding $300 billion. 
  In the said meetings, it was proposed that the harmonization 
of tariff codes be accelerated with priority accorded to 
products enjoying high volume of intra-ASEAN trade and products 
that fall under the 15 fast-track product groups in the Common 
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) agreement. Product groups 
under the fast-track program are vegetable oil, cement, 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastic, rubber 
products, pulp, leather products, textiles, ceramic and glass 
products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, wooden 
and rattan furniture. 
  Other proposals adopted by the council are: 
-- to improve the frequency and availability of shipping between 
ASEAN countries; 
  -- identify, through regional industry clubs, industry 
specific non-tariff barriers (NTBs) that should be eliminated; 
  -- upgrade the efficiency of trade procedures including 
the possibility of implementing an electronic data interchange; 
  -- facilitate product certification and acceptance; 
  -- raise the capability of the services sector such as 
banking, insurance, and telecommunications to support trade; and, 
  -- address the issue concerning developments in global 
trade such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Other recommendations are being pushed by working groups of 
ASEAN-CCI. 
  These include: 
  -- the establishment of joint promotion of ASEAN 
agricultural products; 
  -- the development of infrastructure such as the 
establishment of a pan-ASEAN land bridge; 
  -- pursuing open skies policy; and, 
  -- the development of ASEAN optic fiber network and the 
expansion of cellular phone network beyond country borders.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday 
said that a "growing interest" in expanding links between the 
Philippines and Myanmar (formerly Burma) should be explored by 
encouraging an intensified exchange of private sector 
representatives from both countries. 
  "There is an enormous potential still waiting to be tapped 
in 
this area," Mr. Romulo said during a meeting with officials of 
the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). 
  He pointed out private sector representatives are best 
positioned to develop meaningful cooperation among themselves in 
order to pave the way for more significant economic ties between 
Manila and Rangoon. 
  "Let me add that in my position, I will do my best to 
stimulate more trade and business contacts for the mutual 
benefits of our two countries," he said. 
  Mr. Romulo told SLORC officials government is "encouraged by 
the moves taken by Myanmar to work closely with ASEAN 
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and individual ASEAN 
(members), in the spirit of good neighborliness and friendship." 
  He likewise assured the Burmese government of Manila's 
continued support for the one-Southeast Asia concept which will 
include the six ASEAN states of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand plus Myanmar and the three 
Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. 
  "You may be assured that in every forum, the Philippines has 
always supported the concept of one Southeast Asia which will no 
longer be divided by ideological boundaries of the Cold War, but 
working together towards greater cooperation for the common 
welfare of all the peoples of the Southeast Asian region," he 
said. 
  He noted ASEAN at the moment is facing the "exciting 
challenge" of enhancing regional cooperation among its members 
and its dialogue partners. 
  "In this effort, we more than welcome the valuable 
contributions that Myanmar can make in the interest of promoting 
regional peace, progress and harmony. Let us join hands and 
forge a more dynamic and progressive Southeast Asia," he said.

  [Text] Baler, Aurora -- The New People's Army (NPA) in 
North Quezon province claimed here yesterday that it has broken 
several campaigns by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 
to annihilate it, expanding its forces and establishing units 
and mass organizations in island towns and the upper 
municipalities of this province. 
  The rebel army however was silent on the gunslaying Sunday 
of 
one of its former commander, Leopoldo Mabilangan alias Comrade 
Hector, formerly head of the Mt. Banahaw Command in 
Quezon-Batangas area, and a government surrenderer. 
  In a fax statement sent to the MANILA BULLETIN, Labrador 
Luminoso, spokesman of the NPA command in Northern Quezon 
province, said that the NPA gains started in the early 1980's 
and engaged the military in several confrontations. 
  They claimed that the NPA North Quezon were supported by 
5,000 organized masses in the armed struggle. 
  Last year, he said that the NPA North Quezon was able to 
"punish enemy agents, bandits, and military operatives engaged 
in espionage and counter-insurgency operations." 
  Luminoso also said that people who are using the NPA's name 
to promote their criminal activities were likewise arrested and 
told to reform under pain of severe punishment. 
  The NPA leader attributed the people's army gains after it 
launched a rectification campaign to strengthen its ties with 
the masses and organize them for revolutionary work in response 
to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
the Philippines. 
  The NPA Quezon, he said, also launched campaigns to treat 
thousands of people on Pollilo island and the coastal town of 
General Nakar and firmed up its relations with thousands more 
scattered in remote barangays [villages] of the island town and 
the nearby municipalities. 
  Today, Luminoso said, the group is vigorously campaigning to 
stop illegal logging in its jurisdiction. Pollilo, he said, is 
noted to be a shipment point for illegally cut logs bound for 
Japan and Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] Government will temporarily suspend talks with the 
National Democratic Front (NDF) if hostilities within the 
communist party are not put to an end, a government negotiator 
said yesterday. 
  The decision was reportedly made after the New People's Army 
(NPA) claimed responsibility for the death of former leader 
Leopoldo Mabilangan and after Luis Jalandoni NDF representative 
to the talks and vice-chairman for international affairs, failed 
to condemn the killing which was claimed by the NPA [New 
People's Army] Melito Glor Command. 
  The negotiator, who requested anonymity, said the government 
panel considered the killing of Mr. Mabilangan as a "step 
backward" for the peace process. 
  In a statement, [former] Ambassador Howard Dee, chairman of 
the government panel traced Mr. Mabilangan's death to the rift 
within the communist movement and appealed to all factions "to 
allow the spirit of The Hague Declaration to prevail within 
their own movement and to commit themselves to a just and 
peaceful resolution of the armed conflict." 
  The government negotiator said the panel believes violence 
within the movement will affect the peace process in a negative 
manner. 
  Another source disclosed the strong possibility the NDF will 
further delay the resumption of the second round of exploratory 
talks with government. The NDF's attempt to consolidate its 
forces in the past had become even more impossible with the 
death of the NPA Banahaw Command's former leader, he said, 
adding the killing had also dampened the image of the movement, 
while the government benefited from it. 
  He added, however, that the incident might affect the 
success 
of the government's amnesty program. "The NPA might have 
finished Comrade Hector off in order to show others who are 
planning to avail of the amnesty what the NPA can do to them," 
he said. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramos said Mr. Mabilangan's killers are 
not qualified to apply for the government's amnesty program as 
the act was plain "murder" and not done in furtherance of a 
political goal. 
  Satur Ocampo, former chief NDF spokesman, defended the 
military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, saying 
the Melito Glor Command, which operates in Southern Tagalog and 
is headed by Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal, had found Comrade 
Hector guilty of crimes punishable by death. 
  The command has the right to dispense justice to the crimes 
he committed against many people and the Ramos administration 
has failed in this respect," he said. 
  Mr. Ocampo added the "people's court" has evidence of his 
involvement in activities against the CPP, showing he was killed 
in order to preserve the movement. 
  Mr. Ocampo said he was not surprised by the president's 
pronouncement because "it has been a policy of government to 
file common criminal charges to our brothers in the movement, 
rather than charge them for political offenses. Government has 
made members of the CPP suffer multiple layers of injustice 
because of this practice." 
  He also revealed the decision of the "people's court" who 
found Mabilangan guilty of crimes such as involvement in 
kidnapping and other "anti-revolutionary activities" will be 
reviewed by a higher court. 
  Mr. Ocampo said a CPP national court will be tasked to study 
the decision of the NPA Southern Tagalog Regional Command. 
  "We will see to it that all the requirements for death 
penalty were fulfilled. The leadership will check if the order 
came with authority and if there was a failure in 
implementation," Mr. Ocampo said. 
  Mabilangan's punishment will also have to be within the 
standards of the International Humanitarian Law, he said. 
  "The NDF is a responsible political organization. We will 
not tolerate injustice in our movement," he said.

  [Text] The cabinet during its meeting yesterday approved a 
draft protocol on the Malaysia-Thailand joint authority which 
was earlier worked out by Thai and Malaysian governments. The 
protocol is designed to solve the problems concerning petroleum 
concessions in the joint development area lying on both 
countries' territorial claims in the South China Sea. The 
delegations of both countries late last month held talks on the 
avoidance of double taxation in Kuala Lumpur. They agreed that 
technical fees and petroleum income tax collected by both 
countries be reduced by half. The protocol will be part of the 
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation between Thailand 
and Malaysia. The two countries to equally share bebenfit 
reaped from the joint development area. They are expected to 
sign an agreement to start their petroleum exploration in the 
area this week when Prime Minister Chuan Liphai visits Malaysia.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai threw strong support 
behind the Thai military yesterday in its increasingly angry 
response to Cambodian allegations that Thai soldiers are still 
backing the Khmer Rouge. 
  Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday 
accused 
Cambodian leaders of lying and threatened to reduce humanitarian 
assistance for Cambodia if Phnom Penh continues to accuse 
Thailand of supporting the radical faction. 
  The Army chief said if pushed to the limit, Thailand may 
have 
to respond with "an eye for an eye... there are limits to our 
patience." 
  Gen Wimon charged that a "third country" was behind the 
smear 
campaign against Thailand. "A third country is trying to drive a 
wedge between Thailand and Cambodia," he said, without naming 
names. 
  Prime Minister Chuan said in a separate interview it was 
necessary for Thailand to launch a diplomatic offensive against 
Cambodia. 
  "We are forced to hit back at Cambodia because we have to 
clear ourselves of such allegations. Thailand's image has been 
badly damaged," Chuan said. 
  He also said there might be a misunderstanding on the part 
of 
Phnom Penh. He noted that Cambodian soldiers who lost battles 
against the Khmer Rouge might put the blame on Thailand and 
unaware Phnom Penh leaders subsequently picked up the 
accusations. 
  "It may be that Cambodian leaders are listening to their 
army 
too much. The government's troops have been unsuccessful in 
suppressing the Khmer Rouge and have then accused others 
[Thailand] of helping the faction," he said. 
  "It's the govemment's policy to allow the Foreign Ministry 
and other agencies involved [in Cambodian affairs] to explain 
facts to the intemational community." 
  Gen Wimon said Cambodian leaders' unsubstantiated claims 
that 
Thailand still supported the Khmer Rouge had damaged Thailand's 
reputation. "The damage was much more severe than that caused 
by a bomb," he said. 
  First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh claimed the Khmer 
Rouge had been allowed to use Thailand as a sanctuary during the 
battle for the Cambodian town of Pailin. He also threatened to 
attack Khmer Rouge tanks even if they were on Thai territory. 
  Reiterating the Army's denial that it still assists the 
Khmer 
Rouge, Gen Wimon said the Cambodians lied when they claimed 
there were foreign tanks inside Thailand. "It (the accusation) 
is an insult to Thailand. The Army cannot tolerate it," he said. 
  The Army said if the Phnom Penh government continued to 
"misunderstand" Thailand's position "humanitarian assistance 
might have to be cut back." 
  Gen Wimon said while Thailand consistently provided 
humanitarian assistance to Cambodians fleeing fighting in 
Cambodia, Thai villagers had to suffer from battle spill-overs.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director 
of the Supreme Command Information Office, has clarified the 
assertion by the Cambodian Government about support for the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] by the Thai Armed Forces. He said this issue 
has already been clarified in detail and urged all sides not to 
give credence to rumors because doing so could cause a 
misunderstanding between Thailand and Cambodia. 
  Regarding the report that Thai tanks were dispatched to 
support the Khmer Rouge, Anuson said it is false. Such support 
is impossible and Thailand certainly would not commit such an 
act. This is because the world would know if Thai tanks were 
really sent to Cambodia, and Thailand would have been condemned 
by the world already. Therefore, he assured that Thailand would 
never have committed such an act because it is a fact that 
nothing can escape scrutiny. 
  Regarding the report that the Khmer Rouge recaptured Pailin, 
Anuson said it has been verified that the report is false and 
that he did not know the motive of the report.

  [Text] The prime minister endorsed the Thai armed forces 
response to Cambodia's accusation that Thailand is helping the 
Khmer Rouge. He said we have to respond to and correct the 
misunderstanding, otherwise it could damage Thailand. He said 
the Foreign Ministry and concerned agencies had been told to 
make clarifications on the matter. Asked whether it is time for 
Thailand to adjust its policy on Cambodia, the prime minister 
said Thailand's policy is to see peace in Cambodia. If there 
were no peace in Cambodia, Thailand's border areas would be 
plagued by the activities of Cambodian bandits. As for the 
current situation, the prime minister believed it was a result 
of a misunderstanding. Asked why the service of the joint 
Thai-Cambodian committee had not been used to settle the 
problem, the prime minister said there had been only an 
agreement to set up a joint committee. 
  The prime minister however said we should not fall prey to 
the news media. He said that, instead of making charges, 
Cambodia should seek information from the Thai Foreign Ministry. 
It should ask Thailand to clarify the matter if there is any 
doubt about Thailand's behavior or if there is any impact on 
Cambodia coming from Thailand. Likewise, Thailand would seek 
information from Cambodia if it had any doubts about Cambodia. 
The prime minister said that Thailand must find out whether the 
report is correct and whether there was evidence substantiating 
the complaints made by Cambodian leaders. He said the foreign 
minister had been instructed to seek clarifications. 
  Commenting on the same issue, Army Commander General Wimon 
Wongwanit said there was no tension in relations between 
Thailand and Cambodia; relations remain good. He said there is 
no use getting angry with one another. He said words uttered by 
leaders of a country or government have great significance for 
international relations. One has to be careful when making 
statements because the country stands at risk of suffering 
damages. He said the army is unhappy with efforts by certain 
countries to create conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia. 
Besides, inaccurate news reports by the media will also have to 
be taken into account. The army chief said the Cambodian 
Government should seek clarifications from the Thai Government 
if it has doubts about Thailand's attitude instead of making 
accusations which are an insult to Thailand. He said the army 
cannot accept that. He stressed that the army will not support 
any faction, noting that the peace and happiness of the Thai 
people is most important. Thailand will resort to tougher 
measures if Cambodia's attitude remains unchanged and the two 
countries are unable to clear up the misunderstanding. Thailand 
might have to cut its assistance to Cambodia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Reminder to Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] It is a pity that there is a resurgence of the old 
attitude Thailand once had toward Cambodia in history. This 
should not be allowed to happen; it is the duty of both the Thai 
and Cambodian people to prevent a repeat of history. A feeling 
of rift is re-emerging between Thailand and Cambodia because 
Cambodian Government leaders have kept on, unfairly and without 
substantiation, accusing Thailand of giving help to the Khmer 
Rouge and its leaders. 
  The Thai Government, through its Foreign Ministry, has done 
the right thing in denying the charges and rejecting the 
condemnations by the Cambodian Government. It has thus given an 
assurance to the Thai people that neither the government nor the 
military has in any way committed an improper act, as alleged by 
the Cambodian Government. Without any clarification from the 
government, the Thai people could become perplexed by the 
negative information from the Cambodian Government and doubt the 
integrity of their own government and military authorities. 
  Before announcing the statement denying the accusations by 
the Cambodian leaders, concerned cabinet ministers and security 
officers -- the foreign, defense, and interior ministers, and 
high-ranking security officers -- held a joint meeting at the 
Foreign Ministry. Although such a joint meeting should have 
taken place a long time ago, it was a prompt and commendable 
action taken by the administration, which had an effective 
psychological impact on the people. The government should 
display more of this kind of coordination in its work. 
  The government's statement made clear that Thailand had not 
helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to escape into Thailand, or had 
given support in any form to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks 
against the Cambodian Government troops. It stated that the 
accusation made by the Cambodian Government was unfounded. The 
Thai foreign minister called upon the Cambodian Government to 
show the evidence to Thailand since the Cambodian prime minister 
claimed that he had pictures to substantiate his accusations. 
  It is now the responsibility of the Cambodian Government -- 
either First Prime Minister Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh 
or Second Prime Minister Hun Sen -- to produce the evidence of 
Thailand giving help to the Khmer Rouge. If there is no proof 
for the accusation, the Cambodian Government will be 
discredited. Through his condemnations of Thailand, Prince 
Ranariddh has stirred up in the Thai people a negative feeling 
toward the Cambodian leaders. Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh 
should not forget that Thailand once served as a refuge for him 
when his own country was ravaged by war.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai Military Has Credibility Problem on KR </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] Since 1962, when the World Court awarded the border- 
straddling temple of Preah Vihear to Cambodia, it has become as 
much a symbol of strained Thai-Khmer relations as a monument to 
a once great culture. 
  Today, the hill-top temple is under the control of the Khmer 
Rouge and along with patches of other Cambodian territory will 
remain so, Phnom Penh charges, as long as elements within the 
Thai military continue to provide the reviled rebel group with 
support. 
  The controversy surrounding Thai assistance to the Khmer 
Rouge goes back some 15 years. But what started as a 
justifiable, if nakedly self serving, national security policy 
in the wake of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, is now rapidly 
spiralling into a dangerous bilateral issue. 
  In the past week, Phnom Penh has threatened to launch 
crossborder attacks against Khmer Rouge armoured units it says 
are hiding in Thai territory and Thai and Cambodian gunners 
exchanged shellfire. Cambodia is also threatening to take its 
charges to the UN security council. 
  When Phnom Penh launched its military drive to recapture 
Khmer Rouge held territory late last year, it also opened a 
scrappy diplomatic campaign to focus international attention on 
allegations that the guerrillas are still receiving support from 
across the border. 
  While the military offensive has born mixed results, the 
diplomatic push has been a stunning success. Many of the 
allegations emanating from Phnom Penh have been wild and 
unsubstantiated -- such as Ranariddh's claim he had photos of 
guerrilla leader Pol Pot escaping from the besieged Khmer Rouge 
base of Pailin into Thailand -- but, nevertheless, Thailand has 
been forced on the defensive. The US ambassador called on 
Thailand to clarify its relations with the Khmer Rouge. 
Visiting Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said he had 
no doubts Bangkok's expressions of support for Phnom Penh were 
sincere but then, echoing almost every other diplomat and 
international observer of the border situation, said, "There may 
be some individuals who continue to play some kind of supporting 
role in the Thai business community and some areas of the Thai 
military." 
  In the spotlight of international scrutiny that surrounded 
the attack on Pailin, Thai authorities did not react well. 
After hurriedly pushing refugees back across the border, and in 
some cases into Khmer Rouge-held areas, Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai callously answered a rebuke from the UN High Commission 
for Refugees by saying, "We didn't invite them to come here." 
Army chief Wimon Wongwanit told Geneva to look after the 
refugees in Switzerland if they were so worried about their 
welfare. 
  The responses were unbecoming of the country's highest 
officials and only served to enhance an international perception 
that Thailand was indifferent to the suffering of the Cambodian 
people. 
  After Cambodian soldiers seized Pailin, photos surfaced of 
Thai military officers embracing Khmer Rouge cadres. Worse, 
Thai Rangers admitted that the 838 unit, which was set up to 
handle covert shipments of arms to the Khmer Rouge during the 
resistance war against the Vietnamese was still up and running. 
Military officials had claimed earlier this year that the unit 
had been disbanded. 
  Belatedly the government embarked on a course of damage 
control. The foreign press corps in Phnom Penh, the main 
mouthpiece for Cambodia's accusations were invited on a border 
tour. But the journalists were denied access to areas of 
contention. Returning from the all-expenses-paid trip, the 
reporters said the only thing they noted of any interest was 
that the Thai military was still using maps marked Democratic 
Kampuchea, the name the Khmer Rouge used for the country during 
their violent rule. 
  Accusations of Thai support have continued to flow from 
Phnom 
Penh this week. On Friday, Bangkok officially protested what it 
said were "continued groundless accusations". 
  Earlier in the day, Armed Forces spokesman Lt-Gen 
[Lieutenant- General] Anuson Krisnaserani denied the tank 
charges saying: 
  "Tanks are big, it's impossible to hide them in Thailand and 
send them to Cambodia. If we were to do that, we would be 
condemned by the international community," he said. 
  But Anuson's remarks reflect a failure to understand that as 
long as this controversy rages Thailand is being condemned -- 
even if silently. 
  It is not enough for Thailand to merely issue verbal denial 
after denial. On the issue of support of the Khmer Rouge, the 
Thai military needs to understand it has a major credibility 
problem. Why should the rest of the world believe it is not 
possible for the Khmer Rouge to keep tanks in Thailand when only 
five months ago 1,500 tonnes of war weapons were found on the 
Thai side of the border under Cambodian guard? If the Thai 
government wants this damaging affair to go away it must do more 
to refute Phnom Penh's charges. Unfair though it may be, the 
way the world's sympathies lie, the onus is on Thailand to prove 
it is innocent, not on Phnom Penh to prove its charges have any 
real foundation. 
  If there is nothing to hide, why not open the border areas 
to 
the local and international press and disprove the widely held 
belief that Pol Pot maintains a residence in Trat, that Khmer 
Rouge general Ta Mok runs a service station in Sisaket and that 
some segments of the Thai military along the frontier continue 
to maintain close links with the group.

  [Text] Hanoi, April 19 KYODO -- A consortium of three 
Japanese firms and a U.S. company Tuesday [19 April] signed a 
contract with the Vietnamese state-run oil corporation to 
develop oil deposits off Vietnam, company officials said. 
  The 408 square kilometer deposit, named Blue Dragon, located 
beneath the ocean floor 400 kilometers off Ho Chi Minh City, is 
estimated to hold 600 million barrels, the officials said. 
  The three Japanese firms involved are Japan Petroleum 
Exploration Corp., Indonesia Petroleum Ltd. and Nissho Iwai 
Corp., while the American firm is Mobil Corp. 
  The Japan-U.S. consortium is expected to begin two years of 
trial drilling in August for prospecting and development, they 
said. 
  Under the contract, crude oil produced from the deposits 
will 
be divided among the partners, with the Japan-U.S. firms taking 
72.5 percent and the Vietnamese company, Petrovietnam, 15 
percent, according to the officials. 
  Of the foreign share, 50 percent will go to Mobil, 25 
percent 
to Japan Petroleum Exploration, 15 percent to Indonesia 
Petroleum and 10 percent to Nissho Iwai, they said.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 16 -- President Le Duc Anh paid a 
visit to and had working sessions with leading officials of the 
port city of Haiphong from April 12-14. 
  During the visit, President Le Duc Anh affirmed the 
important 
position and great potentials of Haiphong in making it an 
open-door port city, an industrial, commercial, tourist and 
service centre, an important transport conjunction in the north 
and the entire country as a whole, and a key area for the 
economic development in the region covering Hanoi-Haiphong and 
the northern coastal of Quang Ninh. The average increase of 
Haiphong's gross domestic production in the past three years was 
10.5 percent. The industrial output annually increased by 13.5 
per cent, of which the local figure (made by the local 
industrial section) was 18.2 per cent. The production of the 
local traditional products such as cement, woollen carpet, 
footwear, garment, sea products and ship building and repairing 
have been restored and developed remarkably. In 1993, some 2.7 
million tonnes of goods, were unloaded in the port of Haiphong, 
four times higher than that of the previous year. So far, 
Haiphong has entered into 27 joint venture projects with 
foreigners which were capitalized totally at some USD [U.S. 
dollars] 650 million. It has also exerted sustained efforts to 
improve its education, and job training work with the aim to 
alleviate the unemployment in the city and its suburban areas. 
President Le Duc Anh urged the party and people of Haiphong to 
exert more effort to, together with the entire people of 
Vietnam, step up the renovation process for a wealthy people, 
strong country and a fair and civilized society.

<F P=106> [Article by Tuan Minh: "Something About the Freedom of the </F>
Press"] 
  [Text] With the explosion of communication technology and 
the increasing number of newspapers under variable forms with 
their diversified, informative, speedy, and attractive 
presentation, the Western press has created an impression of 
unlimited freedom for the press. There are many people who 
think that in the West, from professional journalists to every 
citizen, anybody can say and write anything through newspapers 
and other mass media, and that the public always receives all 
the information. 
  We recognize the reality that in the West democracy has had 
a 
history of development for more than 200 years, that the 
laboring people have continuously fought for the rights to 
freedom and democracy, and that the development of the press can 
not be detached from the result of that fight. There was a time 
when the laboring people seized an important part of the press 
for their own forum to voice their just cause and the truth. 
There have been many genuine journalists who have fought side 
by side with the laboring people for social progress. 
  The prominent movements calling for peace in Vietnam; the 
ending of the French war of invasion in Indochina, as seen in 
the French press in 1953-1954; and the stopping of the U.S. war 
of invasion in Vietnam, as seen in the U.S. newspapers have been 
a source of great strength for the press. And these movements 
incurred without the approval of the ruling authorities. In his 
memoirs, Mr. Kissinger expressed his resentment towards the 
anti-war press and charged American progressive journalists with 
abetting "North Vietnamese" and "Vietnamese Communists". So, 
the chairman of the U.S. National Security Council did not 
encourage the freedom of the press. 
  At present, the Western press has been reporting daily on 
the 
struggles of the laboring people as they demand better living 
conditions and democracy. The latter is a true reflection of 
the profound contradictions in Western society, something the 
press cannot overlook if it still wants public support. 
  But the Western press has another significant side. First of 
all, newspapers and other means of propaganda do not belong to 
the laboring people. They are in the hands of companies which 
monopolize the publication and the press. These companies 
control nearly all the systems of publication and press not only 
in one nation but also in many countries. They represent or at 
least have relations in one way or the other with multinational 
companies, political and economic institutions, and prominent 
political parties. Here, the press as well as television and 
radio are in fact centers for production and manipulation of 
information and public opinion for certain purposes. 
Information on the Gulf war, which excessively exaggerated the 
strength of the U.S. Army; and reports on the "crimes" committed 
by leaders of Eastern European countries and the USSR are now 
discovered by the public as cheap psychological warfare hidden 
behind the motto of "objective information." 
  Meanwhile, the leftist press, especially the communist 
press, 
must go through all forms of coercion, ranging from political to 
economic coercion. And it has to face unbalanced fighting 
against plentiful anti-communist information. 
  Approval has been voiced of the fact that the Western press 
enjoys the right to attack any individual and any organization 
on any matter it wishes, and that public opinion has been 
shocked by major scandals and cases of corruption discovered by 
the press. This tactic of exposing one another's wrongdoings is 
just a reflection of profound and irreconcilable contradictions 
in the power struggle of different political institutions and 
parties. Therefore, we rarely see -- and we can say that we have 
never seen -- any newspapers which belong to a certain party and 
institution expose the mistakes, condemn the wrongdoings, and 
report the crimes committed by their leader and sponsors. 
  And the world public can not neglect this "Freedom" of the 
Western press: "Freedom" to libel, attack, and intervene in 
other countries' internal affairs. Some radio stations and 
newspapers, especially the former Radio "Free Europe" and the 
current Radio "Free Asia," are energetic information agencies 
which execute this no-need-to-ask-for-permission "Freedom". 
  When we thoroughly assess the Western press, it is 
impossible 
for us not to conclude that it does have the right not to follow 
any direction; it can say and write whatever it likes. However, 
it cannot move too far away from the target of praising 
capitalism -- its superiority, eternity, and invincible 
strength. It can say and write whatever it likes, but it 
cannnot be out of tune with the musical composition against 
Communism, Marxism-Leninism, and the "prediction" of the 
inevitable collapse of socialism. 
  For many decades, Vietnamese revolutionaries have 
consistently struggled for true freedom of the press, opposed 
the propaganda tactics of imperialism and colonialism, while 
combining the struggle for freedom of the press with that for 
national independence and the people's fundamental rights. 
During the colonialist and feudalist period, we had to organize 
the "illegal" secret press network to voice our just cause. 
Only after the victory of the 1945 August Revolution, would we 
be able to set up the people's press system that could represent 
the impetus and aspiration of the people and promote the freedom 
of expression of the laboring people. 
  We do not hold freedom of the press as an absolute freedom 
of 
individuals as in the case of anarchy. We contend, however, 
that true freedom of the press is the freedom to express 
viewpoints aimed at serving national defense and construction, 
strengthening the people's happiness, liberating mankind and 
making them dynamic and creative. Through the press, the people 
are informed of various issues, and are thus enabled to discuss 
their own interests and that of the nation. Also through the 
press, the people can voice their protests and opposition 
against the aggressive and enslaving forces, with all their 
forms and tactics, and fight against all bad practices, 
bureaucratism, embezzlement, corruption, and prerogative so as 
to build a healthy society. However, we cannot take freedom of 
the press as a mean to distort the truth, create fabrications, 
or turn nonexistence into existence, nor can we take it as a 
mean to smear history or bias our protracted brilliant struggle 
for national independence and the people's happiness. As in 
many other countries, including those in the West, Vietnamese 
laws do not accept the practice of using the press as a means of 
inciting public opinion to create unrest and disturb social 
order and political security. And as in other nations, Vietnam 
does not tolerate the kind of freedom of the press that demands 
publication of national secrets. 
  In the West, some people say that as long as the Vietnamese 
press cannot strongly promote privatization and ownership of 
assets and effectively encourage change in the political system, 
there is no freedom of the press in Vietnam! If this is their 
concept, it will never happen in our country. This is because 
the Vietnamese people resolutely reject damaging their 
revolutionary achievements, which were achieved through 
sacrifices in blood and bone. They also reject efforts to block 
their objectives in making the people prosperous, the country 
powerful, and society just and civilized. 
  After overcoming numerous inevitable difficulties during the 
war as well as the limitations caused by the rigid one-way 
communications system during the bureaucratic, centralized, 
socioeconomic management system in the past, the Vietnamese 
press has been consistently changed along with the nation's 
renovation process. Indeed, changes in the Vietnamese press 
have greatly contributed to the nation's renovation process, and 
the latter serves as a basis for changes to and progress of the 
press. Everyone now can see that news and information are 
diversified and abundant in the Vietnamese press and that the 
people now can exercise their freedom of expression through mass 
media channels. 
  The law on the press, promulgated in late 1990, is the 
product of a compilation of ideas concerning freedom of the 
press and stipulations in various orders of the State President 
in 1946. It is also the concretization of the citizen's various 
fundamental rights which have been stipulated in the SRV 
Constitution. 
  Naturally, we cannot claim that changes in the Vietnamese 
press have reached their peak. There are yet many tasks to be 
fulfilled to overcome the prevailing shortcomings and weaknesses 
so as to create conditions for the press to better carry out its 
function as an apparatus to provide news and information to the 
people and to serve as a forum for the people to express their 
viewpoints.

  [Text] On 15 and 16 of April, the party organization of 
the Vietnam Civil Aviation Department held their party 
representatives midterm conference. 
  Comrade Nguyen Hong Nhi, secretary of the party committee, 
delivered the report of the party standing committee, in which 
he pointed out that in the past two years the Vietnam civil 
aviation sector has recorded new progress in its effective 
operations and has enhanced its prestige both domestically and 
internationally. The sector has started to reform its 
technology, means of transportation, and equipment, and has 
upgraded many of its facilities, thus effecting a change for the 
better in the air transport business. 
  The Vietnam civil aviation sector has stood firm despite 
fierce competition. It has developed its network of air routes 
covering purely neighboring markets to include some more complex 
routes further afield. 
  The conference set up targets for the next few years, which 
include overcoming the risk of lagging further behind compared 
with world and regional aviation services, further developing 
the level of transport services, constructing and upgrading the 
infrastructure, and stepping up training in parallel with 
ensuring safety and efficiency for flights.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 17 -- The efficiency of Vietnamese 
investors has played a decisive role in the successful 
implementation of joint ventures with foreign partners in 
Vietnam, the chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investment (SCCI) told a two-day conference last week. 
  Cabinet Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan was addressing the conference 
aimed at reviewing the implementation of the law on foreign 
investment. 
  Now, there are about 3,000 Vietnamese entrepreneurs working 
in foreign-invested enterprises, especially in joint venture 
enterprises. 
  According to SCCI, over the past six years the Vietnamese 
investors had done their best to overcome difficulties and 
accumulated much experience in investment management. 
Vietnamese investors drew many foreign partners with a volume 
of high investment capital aimed at promoting production and 
commerce, thus creating effective cooperation for mutual 
benefits, Xuan told the conference. 
  Over the past six years, the foreign investment enterprises 
earned USD 780 million through their goods production and 
service, Xuan said. 
  However, some of Vietnamese investors involved in management 
had poor knowledge of the investment law and business practices. 
Foreign partners, on the other hand, were very experienced and 
able to overcome difficulties as they arose. 
  Up to March 1994, SCCI has granted licenses to 900 foreign- 
invested projects with a total registered capital of USD 8.5 
million. 
  Vietnamese investors said one of the greatest difficulties 
in 
executing foreign investment projects was the small contribution 
of the Vietnamese partner compared with the foreign party. 
  On average, the Vietnam's contribution to the total capital 
usually amounts to no more than 30 per cent. 
  SCCI made known that Vietnamese investors will be granted 
training courses covering basic knowledge of investment 
cooperation. In the future the joint venture enterprises expect 
to receive officially-educated cadres. 
  SCCI will issue management policies, thus creating better 
conditions for the Vietnamese investors to become involved in 
running foreign-invested enterprises. It intends to set up a 
club for the Vietnamese investors. 
  Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan said that in the past six years, 
Vietnam had established a foothold in foreign markets by drawing 
on the capital of the 500 foreign investor companies from 40 
countries. 
  The government is determined in 1994 to make investment 
procedures simple, clear-cut and strict so as to make the 
investment environment in Vietnam more attractive, Minister Dau 
Ngoc Xuan added.

  [Text] The Statistics General Department reveals that the 
industrial production output countrywide in the first quarter of 
1994 increased by over 11 percent compared with that in the 
first quarter of 1993. The centrally managed industry recorded 
an increase of nearly 13 percent, and the local industry nearly 
10 percent. 
  The main reason for the sizeable increase in industrial 
output in the last few months is that more and more business 
establishments of all economic sectors now are adjusting 
themselves better to the new economic management structure, thus 
helping their production activities to settle and develop 
quickly. 
  The sectors that achieved a healthy development rate are: 
the 
electricity sector with an increase rate of 9 percent, coal 
production with an increase rate of 7 percent, crude oil with 17 
percent, and cement with 12 percent.

  [Text] New York, April 20 KYODO -- North Korea has 
indicated it is willing to permit further inspections of its 
nuclear facilities if the United States simultaneously announces 
the postponement of joint military exercises with South Korea 
and reopens a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang. 
  A special envoy of North Korean President Kim Il-song 
earlier 
this month also reportedly told Indonesian President Suharto 
that North Korea also wants a postponement to the deployment of 
U.S. patriot antimissile batteries in South Korea. 
  Pyongyang's conditions for resuming inspections of its 
nuclear facilities were revealed in a copy of an April 7 letter 
from Suharto, head of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), to U.N. 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made public Wednesday. 
  In the letter, Suharto said North Korean Vice Foreign 
Minister Kim Chang-kyu told him Pyongyang is willing to permit 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections but 
emphasized the conditions that should be applied simultaneously. 
  Suharto said the envoy mentioned the "postponement" of the 
Team Spirit military exercises and the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, but dispatches from Pyongyang in the past have firmly 
demanded the suspension of the exercises and a halt to the 
missile deployment. 
  Suharto suggested to Butrus-Ghali that North Korea is 
seeking 
the simultaneous commencement of all the steps to avoid any 
impression that it has capitulated to the demands of the IAEA, 
the U.S. and others. 
  Suharto also told North Korea that only way to resolve the 
nuclear issue peacefully would appear to be through "a 
comprehensive and thorough implementation of inspections by the 
IAEA." 
  Suharto said, "We conveyed to (North Korea) our considered 
view that it was crucial for the cause of peace in the region 
that it resolve the issue of nuclear inspection with the IAEA 
and that (North Korea's) withdrawal from the (Nuclear) 
Nonproliferation Treaty would only intensify suspicion of its 
nuclear intentions."

  [Text] The Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee issued a 
statement denouncing the U.S. imperialists and South Korean 
puppets for leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the 
brink of war by deploying Patriot missiles. The statement reads: 
  Statement by the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee. 
  The entire nation and the world's peace-loving people are 
strongly protesting and denouncing the maneuvers of the rulers 
of the U.S. imperialist and South Korea to introduce Patriot 
missiles. 
  In particular, South Korean students and youths, and people 
from all walks of life are courageously waging anti-America, 
antiwar, and antinuclear struggles day after day shouting the 
slogans "We protest with our lives the deployment of Patriot 
missiles which intensifies tension on the Korean peninsula" and 
"Yankee go home." 
  This shows South Korean people's firm will that they would 
never tolerate the maneuver to introduce Patriot missiles. This 
is also a genuine, just, patriotic struggle to prevent the risk 
of the approaching reality of a nuclear war, and defend the 
country's peace and safety. 
  As has been exposed, the introduction of new missiles in 
South Korea is one of the premeditated aggressive arms build-up 
maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean war maniac 
elements to make a preemptive attack on our Republic. The 
Patriots missiles being deployed to South Korea are the most 
advanced, highly dangerous, war devices [chonjaeng sudan] which 
can strike any place and object depending on the type of 
warheads installed. 
  Branding the Patriot missile deployment maneuver of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of 
the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the North-South joint 
declaration on denuclearization, which were intended to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, 
the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee resolutely denounces the 
undisguised military provocation aimed at unleashing at any 
cost, another war -- a thermonuclear war in Korea. 
  The introduction of Patriot missiles that were constantly 
rejected in many regions of the world is an inevitable product 
of the despicable flunkyist and treacherous policy pursued by 
the Kim Yong-sam group, which has turned South Korea into an 
exhibition ground for new and old U.S. weapons and into an arms 
market. 
  Following the collapse of the Cold-War system and the break 
in the balance of power in the international arena, the monopoly 
companies of the U.S. defense industry have faced difficulties 
in selling weapons. Representing the interests of monopolies, 
the Pentagon and the U.S. Administration are trying every means 
to develop markets that stockpile various war equipment, 
including already-produced mass destructive weapons by putting 
pressure on the so-called allies and puppets under their 
subjugation. 
  Kim Yong-sam the treacherous traitor, who has emerged as a 
vanguard in carrying out the U.S. aggressive policy, already 
vowed loyalty to his master during his U.S. junket at the end of 
last year and promised to fill the stomachs of U.S. agricultural 
capitalists and defense companies by opening the weapons market 
along with the rice market. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working 
contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and 
the South which had been arranged with so much effort and, 
later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about 
someone's scheme to provoke a war against the South, and made 
public even an aggressive war plan dubbed "new operation plan 
No. 5027" against the North which had been secret. All this was 
motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a legal pretext 
for the massive shipment of U.S.-made destructive weapons to 
South Korea, thus furthering the interests of the United States, 
its master. 
  Not satisfied with selling out the rice market on which the 
lives of South Korean farmers depend, the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
gave out South Korea as a market for U.S.-made weapons, thus 
showing that the rascals are treacherous traitors worse than the 
five traitors of Ulsa. 
  It has become clear to everybody that as long as treachery 
exists with the traitor Kim Yong-sam in power in South Korea, 
the nation's interests cannot be defended and our nation cannot 
avoid a nuclear war calamity. South Korean youths, students, 
and people must invigorate the anti-America, antiwar, 
antinuclear and antigovernment struggle to oust the Kim Yong-sam 
group from power and establish an independent and democratic 
government to block and thwart the introduction of the Patriot 
missile by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique. 
  History shows how tragic the end is for traitors who run 
counter to the general trend. If the United States and the 
South Korean puppets ignore the aspiration of the times and the 
demand of the nation and steadily reinforce the aggression 
forces to finally start the fire of a nuclear war on the Korean 
peninsula, the provokers will never get off safe. 
  The U.S. and South Korean rulers must clearly see the strong 
spirit and iron will of the our people, who never pardon those 
who infringe upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty 
of the country, promptly stop the aggressive arms buildup 
including the deployment of Patriot missiles and discontinue the 
reckless war provocation moves at once. 
  [Dated] 19 April, 1994, Pyongyang.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- We will neither be 
frightened by the resumption of the "Team Spirit" war gamble by 
the warmaniacs nor be afraid of any threat posed by them with 
something bigger than Patriot missiles, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary hitting out at the shipment of the Patriot missiles 
in South Korea by the United States and the South Korean 
authorities on April 18. 
  The U.S. introduction of a new missile unit into South Korea 
means an escalation of its belligerent moves to provoke a 
nuclear war against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula, the news 
analyst says, and goes on: 
  The United States and the South Korean warlikers 
ridiculously 
say the deployment of Patriot missiles is intended to 
"supplement the anti-aircraft defence capabilities" and it is an 
"effective means of defence" to counter someone's "surprise 
attack". This is a clumsy excuse for covering up their 
aggresive design. 
  The argument of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
warmaniacs that Patriot missiles entail no danger because they 
are for "defence" only revealed once again their shameless 
nature as cunning and wicked aggressor and provoker. 
  It is a daydream if they think they can threaten us and 
bring 
us to our knees with the introduction of sophisticated weapons 
of mass destruction and nuclear war gambles. 
  We love peace. But we are fully prepared to mete out a 
thousand-fold retaliatory punishment to the enemies if they dare 
provoke us. 
  MINJU CHOSON in its commentary says "we have the 
singlehearted unity of the whole party, entire people and whole 
Army several hundred times stronger than the A-bombs and H-bombs 
of the United States and invincible self-reliant defence 
forces." If the enemies dare provoke us, we will deal a decisive 
counter-blow at them, it warns.

  [Text] According to reports from Seoul, two U.S. Navy 
transport ships loaded with U.S. Patriot missiles to be deployed 
to South Korea arrived in Pusan port on 18 April. 
  Forty-eight launchers, 192 Patriot missiles, and 84 Stinger 
missiles on the two ships are being unloaded. They will be put 
in actual deployment by 29 April. 
  Following the first shipment of Patriot missiles which 
arrived on 18 April, the second shipment is expected to arrive 
soon and to be ready for deployment by 29 April. 
  The introduction of Patriot missiles to South Korea by the 
United States and the South Korean puppet clique is a very 
dangerous development of the situation which drives the military 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This 
shows that the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim 
Yong-sam traitor clique to militarily win supremacy over 
[kunsajoguro cheap] our Republic has already been put into 
practice.

<F P=106> ["Intentional Move of Warlikers" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
these days aggravating the situation in Korea by spreading the 
fiction of "nuclear threat" from North Korea, making quite a 
noise as if a war were impending. Lurking behind this is a 
sinister intention of the United States, says a MINJU CHOSON 
analyst today. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The mounting tension on the Korean peninsula is attributable 
to the United States' policy hostile to the DPRK, not to the 
latter's "nuclear threat". 
  The U.S. authorities, particularly the military quarters 
closely connected with warmongers, are seeking to intentionally 
aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and make money 
through arms sales by taking advantage of it. 
  This is borne out by the fact that in November last year 
when 
Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, went to the United States, the U.S. 
authorities vociferated about "North's nuclear threat" and 
forced him to open the South Korean rice market, any more for 
the maintenance of the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea and 
buy more weapons including Patriot missiles in return for their 
"commitment" to the "security" of South Korea. 
  In aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula they 
also seek to find a way out of the crisis at home. The U.S. 
Administration is now floundering under great condemnations and 
criticisms from the American people for its anti-popular 
policies and snowballing trade deficits. The recent "White 
Water" scandal has made its position all the more difficult, and 
the U.S. political crisis is worsening daily. 
  Hence, the U.S. authorities are aggravating the situation on 
the Korean peninsula, crying themselves hoarse over the "North's 
nuclear threat" to divert public attention elsewhere with the 
aim of defusing the domestic crisis. 
  Whatever petty tricks they may play, they cannot conceal the 
stark fact. 
  They must refrain from such despicable, anachronistic acts 
as 
selling off lethal weapons by spreading a lie and aggravating 
the situation and withdraw all their destructive weapons and 
troops from South Korea. That will do them good.

<F P=106> ["'UN Security Council Must Retract `Presidential Statement' </F>
at Once' " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The anti-DPRK moves of 
the United States has been denounced by political parties and 
organisations of different countries. 
  The Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist) in a 
statement April 3 said that the United States is egging the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on to demand an 
unwarrantable "inspection" of the nuclear sites of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "This is contradictory 
to the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact in 
New York for a package solution to the nuclear issue and is a 
crafty artifice to deploy its 'Patriot' missiles in South 
Korea," it noted. 
  It said current developments showed that the United States 
does not have the slightest intention to solve the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way but still schemes to 
stifle the DPRK by the policy of strength. 
  The Arab Progressive Baath Party in a statement on April 5 
denounced the anti-DPRK moves of the United States in creating a 
grave crisis on the Korean peninsula and urged the United States 
and South Korea to stop the "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercises for good and all. 
  The Luxemburg Committee for Support to Korea's reunification 
in a communique pointed out that the socalled "nuclear issue" of 
North Korea must be solved through dialogue and negotiation 
between the parties concerned. The Burundi-Korea Friendship 
Association and the Burundi Group for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea in a joint message of protest said that the United States 
and its followers were motivated by an intention to stifle the 
DPRK in bringing the "nuclear issue" of the Korean peninsula to 
the international rostrum and demanded that the UN Security 
Council retract the "presidential statement" at once. 
  A statement of the all-India trade union congress warned 
that 
the United States must bear full responsibility for the 
consequences of its acts of threat to the peace and security of 
the Korean peninsula.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Students in Seoul and 
Kwangju, South Korea, staged fierce demonstrations Tuesday in 
protest against the arrival of Patriot missiles at Pusan port 
and U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry's Seoul trip. 
  The demonstrators in Seoul marched to the U.S. Embassy, 
breaking through the close encirclement of the police, and 
shouted anti-American slogans with a placard reading "We Hate 
The Patriot. We Hate Perry." 
  Some 500 students affiliated with the Kwangju-South Cholla 
Province Federation of General Student Councils demonstrated in 
front of "the American Cultural Centre" in Kwangju. They threw 
more than 200 paint bottles at the building, branding Perry's 
Seoul trip and the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
as criminal acts increasing the danger of war. 
  The puppet clique mobilized a large force of riot police to 
harshly suppress the protesters. The students, however, 
continued the demonstration, chanting slogans urging the 
withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from South 
Korea.

chanting slogans opposing Defense Secretary Perry's visit. 
  In groups, the students demonstrators broke through a guard 
post at the front gate of the building around 11:30 AM and 
stormed into it. The students staged a demonstration, lying on 
the ground with placards reading "We oppose the United States 
and Perry's visit!" "We do not want a war!" and "Yankee, Go 
Home!" The students lifted up the placards protesting the U.S. 
demand on the opening of South Korea's rice market and the 
purchase of U.S. weapons. 
  The puppet clique, dismayed by the students' breaking into 
the Defense Ministry building, mobilized some 300 armed 
policemen into the spot and committed fascist suppression by 
taking all the student protesters to the police station.

<F P=106> ["Greenpeace Called Upon To Bring Action Against Nuclear </F>
Waste Dumping by South Korean Authorities" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a 
letter to the headquarters of the Greenpeace, an international 
environmental movement organisation, on April 13 said the South 
Korean people who are exposed to radioactive substances from 
atomic reactors used for development of nuclear weapons and 
exposed to constant nuclear threats by a nuclear powder magazine 
of the United States, hope that the Greenpeace will make a 
thorough probe into the nuclear waste dumping by the South 
Korean authorities and their nuclear arms development and bring 
an action against them before the world, the Seoul-based Radio 
Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  Recalling that the South Korean authorities dumped into the 
East Sea of Korea nuclear wastes amounting to 11,000 trillion 
becquerels in the period from 1986 to 1992, the letter says: 
  "When their such criminal dumping began to be called in 
question, arousing world public opinion, the South Korean 
authorities started a socalled `joint survey' in the East Sea of 
Korea with Russia and Japan, accomplices in nuclear waste 
dumping, and will reportedly notify the International Atomic 
Energy Agency of its results. 
  "This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to 
conceal their nuclear waste dumping with the backing of some 
biased officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency who 
have already conspired with them in their nuclear racket against 
the North, shunning the observation of the Greenpeace. 
  "The board of governors of the IAEA, while taking issue with 
the North over its pilot reactor, branding it as one intended 
for the development of nuclear weapons, is overlooking heavy 
water reactors and multi-purpose research reactors for military 
purposes of the South, and has never published even any results 
of its inspection to speak of. 
  "Amidst of such biased clamor for nuclear inspection by the 
IAEA board of governors, the South Korean authorities have 
accelerated nuclear arms development and are now openly claiming 
`nuclear sovereignty' to justify their nuclear armament. 
  "If such nuclear development is overlooked, it will not only 
destroy the natural ecology but may inflict a grave nuclear 
calamity upon our people and nation. 
  "Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, notify the 
Greenpeace 
about data on the criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear 
arms development by the South Korean authorities."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, chairman 
of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification [Pomminyon], sent a telephone message 
today to Yi Yong-tok, "unification minister" of South Korea, 
proposing to the South side a working-level contact between the 
North and South at Panmunjom on April 22 to discuss technical 
matters for a Seoul trip of the North side's delegation which 
has been invited to a memorial service on the hundredth day 
after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
  The telephone message said: 
  The pan-national funeral committee for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan 
invited the North side's delegation after proposing to hold the 
memorial service on the hundredth day after the death of Rev. 
Mun slated for April 27 with the participation of people in the 
North, South and overseas. This is good for the great unity of 
the nation. In response to this invitation, we have decided to 
send a four-member delegation of the North side including me, 
accompanied by some support personnel and journalists, to Seoul. 
  Recalling that when Rev. Mun died in January, the South side 
blocked a mourners' group of the North side from visiting Seoul, 
the message said: I hope no such unsavory thing would happen 
again. I ask your side to guarantee personal safety and 
convenience to our delegation on its Seoul trip. We will send 
two liaison delegates of the North side of the North-South 
liaison office to the contact and I wish you to take an 
appropriate measure. 
  In a telephone message today to the pan-national funeral 
committee for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, Paek In-chun notified the 
committee that four delegates including himself and some support 
personnel and journalists would pass through Panmunjom at eight 
A.M. April 26 to attend the memorial service and leave Seoul for 
home on the afternoon of April 28.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song received a letter from the participants in 
the international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and 
friendship held in New Delhi. 
  The letter dated April 10 says: 
  "The seminar stressed that the idea of independence, peace 
and friendship elucidated by the chuche idea is a universal idea 
embodying the intrinsic nature of independent people and the 
common desire of the people in our time to live a happy life, 
loving and helping each other in a free and peaceful world 
without domination and subjugation, aggression and war. 
  "The participants in the seminar called for strengthening 
the 
unity of the people and actively mobilizing them in the building 
of a new society on the principle of the chuche idea that to 
strengthen the driving force of the revolution and enhance its 
role is a fundamental guarantee for the building of an 
independent new society." 
  The letter says they are greatly encouraged by the proud 
looks and indomitable spirit of the Korean people who are firmly 
defending the man-centred socialism with the might of 
singlehearted unity under the wise guidance of President Kim 
Il-song, under the difficult conditions created by the 
intensified anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaign of the 
imperialists and reactionaries. 
  It stresses that they, together with the progressive people 
of the world advocating independence, express firm solidarity 
with the Korean people in the struggle to defend the dignity of 
the nation and the gains of socialism and extend full support to 
the Korean people in the noble cause of reunifying the country 
independently and peacefully on the basis of the ten-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country put forward by President Kim 
Il-song. 
  The letter sincerely wishes President Kim Il-song good 
health 
and a long life.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Magnesia clinker of 
Korea is popular at the international market. 
  It is exported to more than 10 countries and the needs for 
it 
are on a steady increase. 
  Korea is one of the biggest magnesia clinker producers in 
the 
world. 
  The country abounds in magnesite minerals needed for the 
production of magnesia clinker. 
  Its deposits and quality rank first in the world. 
  Magnesite is widely used not only as a fire-proof material 
resisting the temperature of more than 2,800 degrees centigrades 
but in the industrial domains for the production of metal 
magnesium, cement, rubber, paper, porcelain, etc. 
  Its major producer is Tanchon in South Hamgyong Province. 
  Deposits of magnesite in this area are estimated at several 
billion tons and its mining conditions are very favourable. 
  The Yongyang mine called "white gold mountain" is mainly 
engaged in opencast mining. It was developed 50 years past. 
  The Taehung general mining enterprise developed extensively 
in the 70s annually produces several hundred thousand tons of 
magnesia clinker, or nearly a half of the magnesite ore 
production of the country. Its production capacity is being 
expanded. 
  There are modernly-equipped magnesite mineral processing 
bases in Tanchon, Kim Chaek, Chongjin and other areas. 
  The state is increasing investment in the production of 
magnesia clinker.

slogans on trees by methods of newly-developed fluorescent 
light projection and exposure of letter. 
  They contrived simple devices to see slogans on trees in the 
open air and generalized them across the country. They also 
successfully solved scientific and technical questions in 
permanently preserving revolutionary relics including 
slogan-bearing trees. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il sent thanks to the working people who

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The fossil of a frog 
which lived about 150 million years ago was recently unearthed 
in Sinuiju, a northwestern city of Korea. 
  Last year the fossil of Korean archaeopteryx of the early 
Jurassic period of the Mesozonic era was discovered there, which 
shows the course of the evolution of birds from primitive 
reptiles, a higher land vertebrate. This convincingly proved 
Korea being a cradle of human civilisation where extinct animals 
and plants evolved systematically. 
  The discovery of the fossil frog in the same stratum is an 
irrefutable proof that a fast evolution of the frog was in 
progress in the Mesozonic era on the globe and the northwestern 
part of Korea was the central arena of that evolution. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song named the oldest 
known 
fossil frog discovered this time "archaeofrog." 
  The fossil unearthed and ascertained by authoritative 
natural 
scientists clearly preserves part of the vertebra, foreleg bone, 
hindleg bone, and the pelvis. 
  Fossil frogs in the world had so far been discovered in the 
stratum belonging to the period of and after the third Cenozoic 
era, or about 60 million years ago. The frog fossil recently 
unearthed in Korea belong to a time 90 million years earlier. 
  With the discovery of the fossil of archaeofrog which helps 
establish a new academic view on the evolution of the frog and 
its phylogeny and classification system, the long history of the 
land of Korea has become ever clearer.

<F P=106> [KYODO embargoes following item for release at 2200 GMT on </F>
20 April] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan is unlikely to 
respond to fresh prodding from the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) for more steps to boost its sluggish economy, sources said 
Thursday [21 April]. 
  "It's hard to think of what we might do," a government 
source 
said. An international financial source said no new steps are 
likely as the effects of measures taken thus far are likely to 
be enough. 
  Coming in a report just days before a gathering Sunday of 
finance leaders from seven major industrial nations, the nudge 
from the IMF is sure to be a topic at the Washington meeting. 
  The report sees a mere 0.7 percent real economic growth for 
Japan this year, the weakest of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations 
and 2.3 percent in 1995. "For the upswing to gain sufficient 
momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of 
monetary conditions may well be required," it says. 
  Those steps include a record 15 trillion yen stimulus 
package 
in March and a series of official discount rate cuts to bring 
the key lending rate to a record low 1.75 percent a year. 
  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied Tuesday that he 
is considering cutting the discount rate again and warned about 
inflation and overheating from "an over-ambitious macroeconomic 
policy to rectify the internal imbalances." 
  A Finance Ministry official noted that the IMF report says 
"bilateral trade and current account positions are clearly not 
an appropriate focus for trade policy" and that trade disputes 
should be solved "in a manner that is consistent with 
multilateral principles."

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- More than 100 university 
students protesting U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's 
visit stormed into the Defense Ministry compound on Wednesday. 
The protest occurred around 1:20 PM, when Perry entered a 
second-floor conference room in the main building for talks with 
his Korean counterpart, Yi Pyong-tae, after reviewing an honor 
guard in the ministry compound. 
  Perry arrived here Tuesday to discuss problems related to 
beefing up Seoul's defense against possible North Korean attack 
with South Korean Government leaders. 
  The students, shouting anti-American slogans, demonstrated 
in 
front of the ministry's main building for about 30 minutes 
before they were forcibly dispersed by riot police. 
  It was the first time that student protesters have entered 
the Defense Ministry compound. Military police guarding were 
unable to stop the students when they moved into the compound 
through the vehicle gate, witnesses said.

  [Text] Iran has urged UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali to 
immediately submit his resignation from the world body. Iranian 
Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, who is currently on an 
official visit to Malaysia, stated that Mr. Butrus is incapable 
and has failed in his duty to end the massacre of Bosnian 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur at the end of 
his three-day visit, he said the secretary general of the world 
organization should immediately tender his resignation. Mr. 
'Ali also condemned the United Nations for its failure to play 
its role as a peace mediator in an effort to end the Serbian 
atrocities on Bosnian Muslims. He urged all Muslim nations to 
unite and strongly pressure the international community to act 
against the Serbian atrocities and massacres, particularly in 
Gorazde. He also expressed regret over the world organization's 
attitude of rejecting Iran's offer to send 10,000 of its troops 
to Bosnia while at the same time accepting Russia's offer.

  [Text] Jakarta, 19 Apr (INA)--Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, 
personal envoy of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn and 
foreign minister, has relayed a message from his excellency the 
president to Indonesian President Suharto on recent developments 
in the relationship between Iraq and the UN Security Council, as 
well as on bilateral ties. 
  The message was conveyed during a meeting in Jakarta today 
between President Suharto and Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. During 
the meeting, the foreign minister said Iraq has honored all its 
commitments. Consequently, the UN Security Council must fulfill 
its commitments per Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 by lifting 
the economic embargo clamped on the Iraqi people. 
  For his part, President Suharto said he was happy to meet a 
personal envoy of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn. He 
said: It is only natural for Indonesia to play a significant 
role in promoting the just Iraqi demand to lift the unfair 
embargo clamped on it. 
  President Suharto said Indonesia's role in this is dictated 
by the strong bilateral ties and by the fact that Indonesia is 
the current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM]. 
Indonesia can play this role through its efforts at the NAM 
Coordination Bureau, the NAM Liaison Office in New York, and the 
NAM group at the UN Security Council, President Suharto said. 
  At the end of the meeting with the Indonesian president, the 
foreign minister and his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas held 
a news conference in a Presidential Palace hall.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 19 (ANTARA) -- Concern over a drastic 
drop in the rupiah's value against the US dollar is unfounded, 
head of money market and checking account affairs at the Central 
Bank, Bank Indonesia, Dahlan Sutalaksana, said to journalists 
here Monday. "Therefore, the rush to purchase US dollars in 
large quantities is only an act of speculation spurred by 
irresponsible rumours," he said. 
  Economic observers have said that 500 million US dollars 
worth of rupiahs have been exchanged into US currency recently 
due to a statement made by a government official saying that 
although the rupiah will not be devalued, its depreciation will 
accelerate to 6 percent in 1994/95 as against the expected 3 to 
4 percent. 
  In previous years, the depreciation of the rupiah against 
the 
US dollar never rose above 6 percent, in 1990 the depreciation 
was 5.9 percent, in 1991 4.8 percent, in 1992 3.5 percent and in 
1993 3.8 percent. 
  Sutalaksana, who is now in charge of the development of the 
capital market at the Ministry of Finance, said that both 
domestically and overseas the rupiah's exchange rate against the 
US dollar has been stable and is likely to remain so. 
  He also pointed out that the domestic real interest rate is 
stable in comparison with countries like the United States, 
Western Europe and Japan, ruling out the likelihood of capital 
flight overseas. 
  It is expected that declining oil prices will not cause an 
accelerated depreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar, he 
said. 
  "The role of oil in our state's budget is only 30 percent, 
so 
if the oil prices drop the effect is insignificant, unlike in 
1986 when the role of oil in the state's budget reached 80 
percent," he said. 
  Regarding export value, he said that although the percentage 
dropped, the nominal value increased. 
  In 1992 export value grew by 23 billion US dollars, an 
increase of 28 percent over 1991, and in 1993 it rose by 28 
billion US dollars, up by 20 percent over 1992. 
  The government has also successfully cut down on imports 
which grew by 8 percent in 1992 and by only 7 percent in 1993. 
  "Our foreign exchange reserves are sufficient for 5 months 
worth of imports, so there is no reason for the value of the 
rupiah to be depreciated against US dollar at present," he added. 
  Sutalaksana attributed the present purchase of large 
quantities of US dollars to the current hajj pilgrimage. 
  "We have some 157,000 hajj pilgrims. If one hajj pilgrim 
requires 1,000 US dollars, then the quantities of US dollar 
purchases will certainly be big," he said.,

  [Text] Government yesterday expressed "serious concern" 
over Washington's request to have its military personnel in the 
country agranted diplomatic status. Foreign Affairs 
Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino yesterday confirmed Washington's 
request, adding that "this issue are already being discussed at 
the lower levels." 
  Mr. Severino said government is "exploring all the 
possibilities" with regard to the request although he declined 
to expound further. "We'll talk to you about it when the right 
time comes," he said. 
  The request was made in view of the joint Philippines-United 
States Balikatan [Shoulder to Shoulder] exercises in which 
American military personnel will be participating. The 
Balikatan is scheduled to be held here sometime this year. 
  The request was said to be related to government's 
disregarding the status of forces agreement -- where rules 
regarding the safety of American military personnel in the 
country are included -- following the abolition of the bases 
treaty. Sources said granting diplomatic status to American 
military personnel will have serious political consequences.

  [Text] Skilled Thai workers are welcome in Israel, Israeli 
Ambassador to Thailand 'Uzi Manor said yesterday, as part of an 
Israeli government campaign to recruit an international 
workforce to replace Palestinian workers. 
  "We [Israel] would be glad to have more Thai workers in our 
country," the ambassador told The Nation during a telephone 
interview. 
  According to the ambassador Israel has experience with Thai 
workers and considers them skilled and reliable. 
  Earlier this month Israel said it was looking for more than 
20,000 foreigners to work in place of Palestinian workers, 
following attacks by militant Palestinians which left 8 Israelis 
dead and 50 wounded in a 24 hour period. 
  Under a proposal put to the Israeli cabinet, some 15,000 
foreign construction workers, and 3,250 to be employed in the 
agricultural sector would join 3,000 others whose arrival has 
already been scheduled. 
  The occupied territories, inhabited largely by Palestinians, 
have been officially sealed since the end of March 1993 
following a wave of killings, but the restrictions were greatly 
relaxed in the months before the Hebron massacre. 
  Authorities tightened the ban after the February 25 
massacre, 
in which 30 Arab worshippers were gunned down by a Jewish 
settler, in a bid to prevent revenge attacks. 
  Before the March, 1993 ban 100,000 Palestinians worked in 
Israel, many in farming and construction. 
  The total ban on Palestinians entering Israel is believed to 
throw thousands out of work. 
  The ambassador said his country would welconne skilled 
workers from any nation. 
  Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official hailed the 
Israel decision as good for Thai workers. 
  He said security would have to be taken into consideration 
before sending Thais there, however. 
  "First, we have to know where they (the workers) will be 
sent, and if these areas are safe enough for our people," the 
anonymous official said. 
  He said Thailand would not risk the safety of Thai labourers 
by allowing them to work in areas considered insecure. 
  "We don't want Thai workers to be kept hostage should 
anything happen there," he told The Nation.

<F P=106> ["Respect for DPRK's Unique Status, Key Factor of Fair </F>
Solution to Nuclear Issue; Memorandum of DPRK Foreign Ministry" 
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today published a memorandum throwing light on the major 
obstacles to a solution to the nuclear issue and the truth 
behind them in view of the current situation. 
  Follows the full text of the memorandum: 
  Memorandum 
  of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
  The current international relations evolving over the 
nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula have assumed dimensions of serious 
confrontation. The situation has presented much greater 
complexity particularly after March 31 when the United Nations 
Security Council announced its "presidential statement" imposing 
unreasonable follow-on inspections on the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  The United States and its satellite forces have resorted to 
the one-track course of pressure by enjoining the safeguards 
agreement-bound fullscope inspections on the DPRK with disregard 
to the unique status of the DPRK which has temporarily suspended 
the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the treaty on 
the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT/the treaty), and 
such action has placed grave difficulties in the way of efforts 
for resolving the nuclear issue. 
  The nuclear issue today stands at the crossroad where the 
issue can be resolved through dialogue and negotiations in 
keeping with the DPRK's unique NPT status or the issue will 
remain unresolved permanently because of strong-arm actions and 
confrontation. 
  In view of the current situation, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issues this 
memorandum in order to shed light on the major obstacles 
blocking a resolution of the nuclear issue and the truth behind 
them. 
<H5>  1. The Origination of the DPRK's Unique NPT Status and Its </H5>
Essence 
  The key factor in resolving the nuclear issue includes 
acceptance of the DPRK's unique status based on its temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of the announced withdrawal from 
the NPT and adoption of a step-by-step process toward a fair 
solution befitting the unique status. 
  The DPRK finds itself in a unique status of having 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of its announced 
withdrawal from the NPT. 
  As is known already, the DPRK Government announced its 
decision on March 12, 1993 to withdraw from the NPT in order to 
safeguard the supreme state interests in accordance with 
Paragraph 1 of Article X of the treaty. The DPRK's decision to 
temporarily suspend the effectuation of its withdrawal from the 
NPT, as contained in the June 11 1993 DPRK-USA joint statement, 
was a provisional measure which the DPRK undertook unilaterally 
on the premise that the DPRK-USA negotiations for a peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear issue will continue on an equal and 
unprejudiced basis. This bespeaks that the legal parties 
responsible for the suspension of the effectuation of the DPRK's 
withdrawal from the treaty are clearly the DPRK and the United 
States. 
  As far as the safeguards agreement is concerned, the 
agreement was concluded pursuant to Paragraph 4 of Article III 
of the NPT, and therefore the legal validity of this agreement 
has been as good as suspended since June 12, 1993 when the 
DPRK's withdrawal from the treaty was to come into force because 
of absence of any subsequent particular agreement thereof 
between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA/the agency). This notwithstanding, the DPRK and the IAEA 
have so far managed to reach bilateral agreement on the limited 
scope inspection activities which have been carried out 
accordingly. This was possible entirely thanks to the voluntary 
and well-intentioned steps taken by the DPRK in order to 
demonstrate the transparency of its nuclear activities. 
  The United States and the IAEA Secretariat, too, have 
recognized the DPRK's unique NPT status. 
  At the DPRK-USA working-level contact in New York on 
December 
10 1993, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia 
and Pacific Affairs Thomas Hubbard said that "the United States 
understands the DPRK's unique status resulting from its 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of the declared 
withdrawal from the NPT," and that "we want the DPRK to accept 
technical requirements for maintaining the continuity of 
safeguards, not the agency's legal requirements." Assistant 
Secretary of State for Political-military Affairs Robert L. 
Gallucci, head of the USA delegation to the DPRK-USA talks, 
addressed a message on February 2, 1994 to his DPRK counterpart, 
in which he said that "We understand that inspections sought by 
the IAEA for the continuity of safeguards are designed to ensure 
non-diversion of nuclear material since the previous full 
inspection." This is a de facto acceptance by the United States 
that the inspection needed for the continuity of safeguards is 
not routine or ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement, 
but an inspection limited only to the purpose of verifying that 
there has been no diversion of nuclear material in the DPRK 
since February 1993 when the inspections required by the 
safeguards agreement were suspended. At the same time, this 
also serves as a clear evidence that the United States has 
accepted and respects the DPRK's current unique NPT status. 
  The IAEA, too, has recognized the DPRK's unique status in 
the 
practice of its inspection activities. In his March 24 1994 
report to the United Nations Security Council on the results of 
the agency's March inspection activities in the DPRK, the IAEA 
Director-General Hans Blix said that the DPRK says it needs only 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards because of its unique 
status, and in this sense the DPRK accepted the agency's 
inspections in May and August 1993 for the servicing and 
reloading of the surveillance equipment. This is none other 
than an acceptance by the IAEA itself of the DPRK's unique 
status. Had the IAEA Secretariat had any competent reasons or 
grounds to urge the DPRK to fulfill its obligations under the 
safeguards agreement, it would never have agreed to such an 
extremely limited inspection aimed only at servicing and 
reloading the surveillance equipment as the agency's 
director-general referred to. 
  The same is the case with the March 1994 inspection of which 
the agency has made an "issue." In his above-mentioned report, 
the agency's director-general said that in reaching the 
DPRK-IAEA agreement on 15 February 1994, which became the basis 
for the latest inspection, "We discussed only the contents of 
the inspection needed, at the present juncture, for maintaining 
the continuity of safeguards, not the legal grounds for the 
inspection." In the final analysis, the IAEA Secretariat has 
proved by itself that it could not deny the DPRK's unique status 
in relations to the safeguards agreement but accepted and 
tolerated its unique status and, on this basis, has performed 
its inspection activities. 
  Despite these facts, the United States and the agency 
Secretariat are still talking about the "non-compliance with the 
safeguards agreement" and "full inspection," stressing that the 
DPRK should yet fully live up to its obligations under the 
safeguards agreement. Such action clearly shows that they are 
using the safeguards agreement as a leverage for attaining their 
dishonest political objectives of strangling the DPRK's 
political system. 
  Masterminded by the United States, the IAEA Secretariat 
convened the meeting of the agency's Board of Governors on March 
21, 1994 to deal with the DPRK's so-called "nuclear issue" and 
engineered the adoption by the board of a "resolution," which 
says that the DPRK "is in further non-compliance with its 
safeguards agreement by not allowing IAEA inspectors to conduct 
indispensable inspection activities to verify that there has 
been no diversion of nuclear material." 
  In its "Presidential Statement" dated March 31, 1994, the 
United Nations Security Council "calls upon the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea to allow the IAEA inspectors to 
complete the inspection activities as a step in fulfilling its 
obligations under the safeguards agreement and in honouring 
non-proliferation obligations of the treaty." This is also 
clearly nothing but simply a demand that the DPRK agree to full 
implementation of the safeguards agreement. 
  The persistency with which the United States and the IAEA 
have called for the DPRK's full implementation of the safeguards 
agreement is based on their intention to categorically negate 
the legality of the DPRK's current unique status and to justify 
their machinations of strangling the DPRK. 
  Even in the light of the premise on which the safeguards 
agreement was approved, the legal effect of the agreement is, in 
fact, as good as suspended. On April 9, 1992, the third 
session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK 
deliberated on the safeguards agreement to be concluded between 
the DPRK and the IAEA and adopted and announced its resolution 
on "approving this agreement on the premise that none of the 
depositaries of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons will either deploy nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula or resort to nuclear threat against us." 
  But, the elimination of the nuclear threat by a depositary 
of 
the treaty against the DPRK -- which is included in the 
above-stated premise -- remains yet to be achieved, and the 
United States, one of the depositaries, is on the contrary 
further increasing its nuclear threat against the DPRK 
particularly by openly disclosing its intention to resume the 
"Team Spirit `94" joint military exercises, a nuclear test war 
targeting the DPRK, and massing its Armed Forces on and around 
the Korean peninsula. Such actions on the part of the United 
States destroy the legal basis of the DPRK's approval of the 
safeguards agreement and create circumstances that prevent the 
DPRK from implementing the safeguards agreement. 
  The IAEA Secretariat is a party to the safeguards agreement, 
but the partiality and injustice in its actions give the DPRK 
unambiguous grounds to withhold full implementation of the 
safeguards agreement. The "Vienna Convention on the Law of 
Treaties" provides in Paragraph 1 of Article 60 that "a material 
breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the 
other to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the 
treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part." 
  The IAEA Secretariat has fundamentally breached the 
safeguards agreement when it artificially fabricated the 
so-called "inconsistencies" and, on the basis of the 
intelligence information forged by the United States, triggered 
an agency "resolution" calling for "special inspection" aimed at 
opening up the "two military sites" of the DPRK, another party 
to the safeguards agreement. Therefore, it follows, as a matter 
of course, that the DPRK, as another party to the agreement, is 
entitled to the legitimate rights to suspend the effect of this 
agreement in whole or in part. 
<H5>  II. The Consistent Efforts by the DPRK Government for the </H5>
Continuity of Safeguards 
  Despite the extraordinary situation characterized by its 
unilateral decision to suspend temporarily the effectuation of 
the announced withdrawal from the NPT, the DPRK Government has 
provided its sincere cooperation in the IAEA inspection 
activities needed for the continuity of safeguards at its 
nuclear facilities, as an expression of its good will to 
demonstrate the transparency of the DPRK's peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  In keeping with its promise to the United States, the DPRK 
Government has placed the nuclear activities within the DPRK's 
territory strictly under the IAEA's surveillance. 
  At present, the IAEA-installed containment devices at the 
DPRK's five-megawatt experimental atomic power plant and the 
radiochemical laboratory alone include over 40 metal seals and 
more than 10 paper seals, gamma mappings at 20 points, over 50 
sheets of status change identification photographs and the spike 
liquid for freezing processes at five vessels, and the agency's 
surveillance devices installed at these facilities are six 
surveillance cameras, one spent fuel rod counter and three 
thermal luminescence detectors. This is an unquestionable 
evidence that the DPRK's nuclear facilities remain under the 
double and triple system of the IAEA's strict containment and 
surveillance. 
  In early December 1993, an IAEA spokesman admitted that the 
continuity of safeguards is maintained at the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities, saying that "the surveillance system is in operation 
with double and triple backup system of complementary facility 
containment and surveillance devices, and its unique character 
is that any malfunction of certain device falls short of 
determining the interruption of the continuity. Therefore, 
absence of inspection cannot lead to a total impossibility of 
safeguards surveillance." Even at present, the surveillance 
cameras and containment devices installed by the IAEA still 
remain in place at the DPRK's nuclear facilities. 
  Whenever the IAEA Secretariat proposed to send inspection 
teams for the purpose of maintaining the continuity of 
safeguards, the DPRK agreed to receive the inspection teams and 
allowed them to replace the tapes and accessories of the 
surveillance equipment, to identify the seals and to conduct the 
physical inventory verification activities required for the 
continuity of safeguards surveillance. Such sincere efforts by 
the DPRK resulted in successful inspections by the agency for 
the continuity of safeguards in May and August of 1993 when the 
agency inspectors serviced and reloaded containment and 
surveillance equipment at the five-megawatt experimental atomic 
power plant and the radiochemical laboratory, the two facilities 
to which the IAEA attach importance. 
  In view of the size and present conditions of the DPRK's 
nuclear facilities, the containment and surveillance devices 
installed at these major facilities alone are enough to fully 
verify non-diversion of nuclear material to other purposes in 
the DPRK. 
  In his telex dated September 14, 1993 to the director of the 
General Department of Atomic Energy of the DPRK, the IAEA 
director-general pointed out that the inspection activities in 
May and August of 1993 helped to maintain the continuity of 
safeguards knowledge. 
  Even in the extraordinary circumstances following its 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from 
the NPT, the DPRK Government took goodwill steps of accepting 
the IAEA inspections necessary for the continuity of safeguards 
of its nuclear facilities. 
  Motivated by its desire to fulfil in good faith both the 
DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement, the 
DPRK received the agency inspection team on schedule in March of 
1994 and allowed the inspection team to perform its inspection 
activities sufficient for maintaining the continuity of 
safeguards at the declared seven facilities. These activities 
include the servicing and reloading of the containment and 
surveillance devices as well as the "verification of physical 
inventory" of nuclear material. Such inspection activities have 
helped to fully verify non-diversion of nuclear material from 
the DPRK's nuclear facilities and to provide firm assurances of 
the continuity of safeguards. 
  The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA," dated March 29, 1994, said 
that the "IAEA has no evidence that North Korea has breached the 
international rules in the field of nuclear technology" and 
commented that "the inspectors did not find out anything to 
prove their blame for an alleged military orientation of the 
research work there." 
  South Korea's "Radio No. 1" quoted on March 16, 1994 the 
IAEA 
inspection team as reporting that during the just concluded 
inspection in North Korea... They carried out inspection 
activities including the reloading of the surveillance equipment 
on a more progressive scale than the previous inspections. 
  On February 28, 1994, a U.S. Government official told a 
press 
interview that "the infrared photographs from the American 
reconnaissance satellite have revealed mostly that North Korea 
did not extract plutonium over the past one year." 
  Leonard Specter, senior researcher at the U.S. "Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace," said that "as for my 
understanding, there has been no problem at the reactor. After 
the inspection was complete, there has been no indication that 
the fuel was removed," and added that "they would not have this 
plant opened up for the world to see, if they wanted first and 
foremost to try to build up their nuclear weapons program." 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific 
Affairs Winston Lord and other American officials concerned also 
said that "Through the agency's inspection, it is almost certain 
that North Korea has not engaged in any further reprocessing 
activities since it announced its decision to pull out of the 
treaty." 
  The restriction of the inspection of the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities to a limited inspection only for the continuity of 
safeguards is an inevitable case befitting the DPRK's unique 
status. 
  During the March 1-15, 1994 period when the inspection 
activities took place, the DPRK did not allow smear-taking in 
the glove-box area and gamma mapping for the filtering device at 
the radiochemical laboratory requested by the inspection team 
because it was an inordinate demand going beyond the scope of 
maintaining the continuity of safeguards. 
  If, at this point of time, the DPRK allowed the requested 
samplings and measurements unrelated to the continuity of 
safeguards, then the IAEA Secretariat would play on it to frame 
up "inconsistencies" again, as it did previously, and would 
complicate the matter by talking about "special inspections" and 
so forth. In reality, the IAEA Secretariat is now raising a hue 
and cry, as if the DPRK's alleged restriction of the scope of 
the recent inspection activities were responsible for a 
so-called non-implementation of the February 15, 1994 DPRK-IAEA 
agreement. This shows that the agency Secretariat continues 
seeking its dishonest political purposes by distorting the truth 
in an attempt to impute all the responsibilities to the DPRK. 
  The agency Secretariat's unwarranted demand for samplings 
and 
measurements at the radiochemical laboratory during the recent 
inspection constitutes a clear violation of the February 15, 
1994 agreement designed exclusively for maintaining the 
continuity of safeguards. And, as for the disputed smear-taking 
in the glove-box area of the radiochemical laboratory, for which 
the agency Secretariat insists on the "completion of 
inspection," the smear-taking has no relevance at all to the 
continuity of safeguards but falls into the category of the 
verification of correctness and completeness of the initial 
report on nuclear material. The smear-taking in this area is 
directly related with the so-called "inconsistencies" which 
still stand unresolved between the two sides, and this is what 
the agency already knows well. However, the DPRK side showed 
highly cooperative spirit by recommending a sample-taking of the 
spike liquid for the inspectors to conduct an effective 
verification in the glove-box area and assisting them in 
sampling the spike liquid. Analysis of this sampled liquid 
alone is more than enough to determine non-diversion of nuclear 
material. 
  Despite these facts, the agency Secretariat made an unjust 
and unilateral conclusion that it "remains unable to verify that 
there has been no reprocessing activities at the radiochemical 
laboratory" and referred the DPRK's "nuclear issue" to the 
United Nations Security Council, an action which cannot be 
viewed otherwise but clearly as a calculated anti-DPRK 
stratagem. Any inspections under the safeguards agreement will 
never be allowed, as long as the current situation continues 
with the DPRK's unique status based on its temporary suspension 
of the effectuation of the declared withdrawal from the NPT. 
  The inspection activities that befit the DPRK's current 
unique status are only the inspection activities necessary for 
maintaining the continuity of safeguards. The case is the same 
with an inspection of the DPRK's normal peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  How long the DPRK's unique status will last depends entirely 
on when the United States renounces its nuclear threat against 
the DPRK and its policy of antagonizing and strangling the DPRK 
and, at the same time, when the agency redresses its partiality 
and injustice to the DPRK. The DPRK's unique status would 
naturally terminate if further round of DPRK-USA talks take 
place and the simultaneous action steps are carried into 
practice with a view to resolving the nuclear issue once and for 
all on the principle of the proposed package solution. 
<H5>  III. The Injustice of Applying the Double Standards to the </H5>
DPRK's "Nuclear Issue" 
  At present, the IAEA Secretariat and the United Nations 
Security Council, both in support of the U.S. policy of 
antagonizing and strangling the DPRK, are openly applying their 
extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standards to the 
DPRK's "nuclear issue." 
  Under the U.S. manipulation, some officials of the IAEA 
Secretariat manoeuvred the adoption of the unjust anti-DPRK 
"resolutions" one after another charging the DPRK with the 
so-called "non-compliance with the safeguards agreement" and 
systematically tried to bring the DPRK's "nuclear issue" to the 
United Nations. 
  The United Nations Security Council, also under the U.S. 
behind-the-scenes manipulation, is used as forum for an 
unwarranted discussion of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" against the 
purposes and principles of its charter. 
  International law must be applied without any prejudice to 
all the states, irrespective of the size of their territories or 
the number of their population. The international organization 
connives at the United States posing nuclear threat against the 
DPRK and instead brings unilateral pressure to bear upon the 
victimized DPRK. This is a clear example of application of the 
double standards. 
  Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat are unreasonably 
provoking the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities, while 
conniving at the U.S.-patronized countries developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  In the practice of its inspection activities, the IAEA 
defends some countries using their nuclear facilities for the 
military purposes, saying "those are undeclared facilities," or 
"they are the buildings about which there is no other available 
information related to the existence of nuclear materials." Some 
officials of the IAEA Secretariat have conducted more than 100 
rounds of inspections in other countries but never made an issue 
of the telltale nuclear weapons development programme in some of 
these countries. But, after six rounds of inspections only in 
the DPRK, they fomented suspicions about alleged "nuclear 
weapons development" in the DPRK and pushed through a Board of 
Governors' resolution calling for "special inspection." This is 
a graphic illustration of how far their double standards policy 
has gone against the DPRK. 
  On April 1, 1993 the editor of the Tanzanian newspaper 
"MOTOMOTO" said that the United States feigns ignorance of the 
nuclear development programme in some countries, but on the 
other hand it "persists in its efforts to fault North Korea's 
alleged `nuclear development' and its declared intention to 
withdraw from the NPT despite its faithful implementation of the 
NPT obligations because, in a nutshell, that nation is regarded 
as a cancerous entity hampering the U.S. attempts to establish a 
new global order." 
  The Thai newspaper "BANGKOK POST," dated April 15, 1993 
carried an article entitled "Why Nuclear Arms Race Is Based on 
Racial Discrimination?" which says the double standards are now 
applied clearly toward the attitude of North Korea that has 
expressed its displeasure over the NPT's discriminatory nature 
and announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty on the 
one hand and toward the attitude of certain countries that have 
acknowledged having produced nuclear bombs with equivalent fire 
power to that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima of Japan during 
World War II on the other. 
  The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA" dated March 30, 1993 also 
reported that "many observers are highly suspicious of the 
nuclear programmes of a number of countries, which remain out of 
sight of the United States and the IAEA," and deplored "the U.S. 
demand for North Korea to accept inspections of its military 
sites to be astonishing." 
  The abnormal situation is such that the nations on which 
sanctions should be imposed go unchallenged while pressure is 
imposed on an innocent nation. 
  Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat connived at the 
nuclear weapons development programme by the U.S.-patronized 
countries, but in case of the DPRK, they did not hesitate to use 
openly the forged intelligence information and satellite 
photographs from a third country which are forbidden to be used 
for inspection activities, in a desperate attempt to create a 
"suspicion about the nuclear development" in the DPRK. 
  None of provisions in the IAEA statute and the safeguards 
agreement stipulate usability of a third country's intelligence 
information to the agency's inspection activities. However, 
some officials of the IAEA Secretariat have breached the IAEA 
statute and the safeguards agreement by systematically using the 
falsified intelligence information from a third country for 
their inspections at the DPRK's nuclear facilities. On November 
16, 1990, the Japanese "JIJI" news service disclosed that, in a 
bid to arouse suspicion about the DPRK's nuclear activities, the 
United States "adventurously faked up reconnaissance satellite 
photographs and circulated them among the IAEA Secretariat and 
the Western countries" to peddle around the "suspected nuclear 
arms development programme" in the DPRK. 
  The American newspaper "WASHINGTON POST," dated April 27, 
1993 acknowledged that "the Clinton administration provided the 
IAEA with photographs from the U.S. reconnaissance satellite as 
evidence of `North Korea's nuclear weapons development 
programme.'" 
  A British newspaper "DAILY AFFAIRS INTERNATIONAL," dated 
April 4, 1994, carried an article by its Deputy Editor Keith 
Bennett, entitled "Why Should the Third World Nations Defend 
North Korea?" which says "The International Atomic Energy Agency 
has conducted inspections in this country and given it a `clean 
bill of health' that the nuclear facilities in the country are 
used only for peaceful purposes. But, when the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency presented photographs from its 
eye-in-the-sky satellites, the IAEA made a surprise move by 
pressing North Korea to accept `special inspection,' in wanton 
violation of the IAEA statute providing against the use of 
information from extraneous sources to the purpose of its 
inspection activities. This is an example of the double 
standards applied by the IAEA." 
  In reality, during the February 1993 meeting of the agency's 
Board of Governors, the IAEA director-general screened the slide 
films of the forged satellite picture provided by the United 
States in an attempt to create a suspicion that certain military 
site in the DPRK is a "nuclear waste storage". In his address 
on April 14, 1993 to a conference on atomic industry in Yokohama 
of Japan, the IAEA director-general even stated openly that he 
would "continue using the U.S. intelligence information about 
the two locations around Yongbyon for the agency's inspections 
and go on obtaining North Korea's nuclear-related information 
from third countries even if North Korea may protest." 
  As seen in the above, the previous routine and ad hoc 
inspections conducted by the IAEA were not inspections aimed at 
verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial 
report on nuclear material but they were, from the outset, the 
IAEA-coated U.S. inspections to fabricate pretence for 
strangling the DPRK on the basis of the intelligence information 
forged by the United States. 
  Moreover, some officials in the IAEA Secretariat have 
systematically dished out to the United States and other hostile 
forces the confidential information to which they had obtained 
access in the course of the inspections at the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities. These actions constitute a gross violation of the 
provision of the safeguards agreement on protecting secrets and 
other confidential information coming to their knowledge during 
inspections. After all, the inspections at the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities were, in the true sense of the word, "no-secret 
inspections" and "open inspections," and they were "joint 
inspections" and "cooperative inspections" under the 
"quadripartite system of coordination" of the United States, 
Japan, South Korea and the IAEA. 
  All the above-cited facts show that the double standards 
policy pursued by the United States and the IAEA with respect to 
the DPRK's nuclear issue has reached its culmination and such 
policy has topped the height of injustice. 
  As can be seen in the above, the attempts to force the DPRK 
to fully implement the safeguards agreement-bound obligations at 
the present stage are motivated by the malevolent purposes to 
destroy the basis of the DPRK's declaration of its decision to 
withdraw from the treaty in the long run, by stretching the 
truth to make an impression that the DPRK still remains a full 
state party of the NPT. 
  As the DPRK has stated in no uncertain terms the reasons for 
declaring its decision to withdraw from the NPT, unless the 
United States renounces its policy of hostility and nuclear 
threat campaign against the DPRK and unless the IAEA Secretariat 
redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK, the DPRK's 
reinstatement in the treaty will remain absolutely inconceivable 
and, therefore, full implementation of the safeguards agreement 
will have no sense of word at the present stage. 
  Inspection limited strictly to maintaining the continuity of 
safeguards alone is what the DPRK can accept in keeping with its 
unique status based on the temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the NPT and 
contingent on the progress of the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The DPRK's unique status was not of its own making intended 
for its selfish purposes, but it was imposed on the DPRK, 
against its will, by the United States and the IAEA Secretariat 
due to the abnormal situation resulting from their unjust 
actions. The DPRK sincerely wants such an extraordinary 
situation to be straightened out as soon as possible and the 
nuclear issue to be resolved impartially. To this end, the 
United States and the IAEA Secretariat must clearly realize 
their responsibility for the origination of the nuclear issue 
and for its current complexity, stop resorting to the 
unreasonable and contradictory method of the double standards 
and pressure, and must seek unprejudiced and substantial ways to 
resolve the nuclear issue once and for all. 
  The current developments give serious lessons that dialogue 
and negotiations are the only way to attain an early resolution 
of the nuclear issue and to achieve detente and peace and that 
pressure and "sanctions" are the path of unpardonable notorious 
crimes of whipping up conflict and confrontation and thus 
blocking permanently the possibility of resolving the nuclear 
issue. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat continue to 
resort to unreasonable pressure campaign ignoring such lessons 
of history, the nuclear issue will remain unresolved 
indefinitely and it will only entail irretrievable consequences 
jeopardizing peace and security in Asia and the rest of the 
world. 
  All the facts show that if they try at the present stage to 
restore confidence on a step-by-step basis through inspection 
designed for the continuity of safeguards in line with the 
DPRK's current unique status and at the same time take a serious 
approach to the DPRK-USA talks, the matters related to the 
implementation of the safeguards agreement will be sorted out in 
due course, and eventually the nuclear issue will be resolved 
once and for all.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan should alter its 
tactics in stalled trade talks with the United States to 
persuade Washington it is serious about rectifying the bilateral 
trade gap, a chief Japanese trade envoy said Wednesday. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, the Japanese Government's representative 
for 
external economic affairs, said in a speech in Tokyo that Japan 
should avoid reaching agreement under the threat of trade 
sanctions, as in the case of a mobile phone trade agreement last 
month. 
  Matsunaga, a former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., met 
U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington earlier this 
month in an effort to break an impasse in the so-called 
bilateral framework talks. 
  Matsunaga said Kantor told him there will be no chance of 
improving bilateral economic relations unless Japan takes 
measures, such as tax cuts, to maintain economic growth led by 
domestic demand. 
  Matsunaga said a new Japanese Government has to hammer out 
tax and other pump-priming measures by June before the summit of 
the Group of Seven industrial nations in July in Naples, where 
the new Japanese prime minister will meet U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. But Matsunaga expressed concern that things will not 
go smoothly because the new government would first be required 
to deal with the overdue fiscal 1994 budget. 
  The new Tokyo government is expected to be inaugurated as 
early as Thursday following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
announcement April 8 that he would step down over shady 
financial deals involving his office.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's ambassador to the 
United Nations Yoshio Hatano expressed support Wednesday [20 
April] for a request by U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
to give him the authority to order air strikes against Bosnian 
Serb forces. 
  Hatano said, "The U.N. has neither sufficient military 
capability nor financial means, so it is quite natural that it 
asked NATO to cooperate in making up for its limited military 
capability." Hatano made the remark at the Japan National Press 
Club two days after Butrus-Ghali requested that NATO authorize 
him to order air strikes by NATO planes against Bosnian Serb war 
machines. 
  Nato's 16-member decision-making meeting, the North Atlantic 
Council, is to decide on Butrus-Ghali's request later Wednesday. 
  Hatano, who has served at the U.N. Headquarters in New York 
for four years, is to be replaced by former Vice Foreign 
Minister Hisashi Owada soon. 
  U.S. bombers under NATO command destroyed a Serbian tank and 
other military machines as the Serbs pushed into the 
U.N.-designated safe area of Gorazde last week. NATO and U.N. 
officials said the strikes were conducted not to deter the Serbs 
from taking territory but to comply with the U.N. request to do 
so in order to protect peacekeepers from the U.N. protection 
forces. 
  However, after the limited NATO action was suspended, 
Serbian 
forces stormed into Gorazde and threatened to attack the 
northern Bosnian corridor around the town of Brcko as their next 
target. 
  Butrus-Ghali's request was for NATO to authorize him to 
order 
air strikes to prevent the Serbs from killing more Bosnian 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Serbian forces may initiate a large-scale offensive as soon 
as they hear NATO say it is not going to intervene militarily," 
Hatano said. "Although decisive military intervention may not 
be desirable...the U.N. could deter Serbian aggression 
effectively by threatening that NATO planes might make other 
strikes," he said. 
  Hatano called on NATO to comply with Butrus-Ghali's plea, 
saying, "Mr. Butrus-Ghali said during his official visit to 
Japan in February last year the most crucial need for the United 
Nations is how to secure and maintain cooperation from regional 
security organizations" like NATO. 
  Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has balked at the 
further use of NATO warplanes, saying it might involve the U.N. 
in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Meanwhile, Hatano urged the Japanese to accept the notion of 
"peace with justice," saying the international community "has 
questioned the Japanese attitude that peace is equivalent to 
justice." 
  "The international community believes it should intervene 
even with military force to restore justice, as in Yugoslavia 
and Somalia," he said. 
  Hatano asked the Japanese to give more thought to the plight 
of people in faraway countries, noting that European and U.S. 
television and newspapers often devote their top news slots to 
"the agony of starving Somalis or Yugoslavian children being 
evacuated from Sarajevo with their mothers left behind." 
  "The Japanese have to learn to develop an interest in events 
all over the world," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Six defectors from the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and an independent formed a new 
parliamentary group Wednesday [20 April], while three others 
from the Japan New Party (JNP) also launched a new group. 
  The bigger group that combines seven members of the House of 
Representatives announced the inauguration of "Jiyuto" (Liberal 
Party) at a news conference. 
  Six members -- Koji Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, 
Shizuo Sato, Taku Yamamoto and Kenzo Yoneda -- left the main 
opposition party earlier this week expressing support for former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's bid for premiership. The 
seventh person, Sanae Takaichi, was an independent. 
  Kakizawa, a former parliamentary vice foreign minister, 
heads 
the new party. 
  Meanwhile, the three JNP defectors, all House of 
Representatives members, launched "Group Seiun [Blue Cloud]." 
  The members are Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and Akio 
Nakajima, who tendered their resignations Sunday to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the JNP. The three men, in 
quitting the JNP, issued a statement critical of moves toward a 
realignment of political parties, as led by Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  Jiyuto was inaugurated two days after five other LDP 
defectors launched a new party named New Party Mirai (Future) on 
Monday. In the upcoming Diet election to select a successor to 
Hosokawa, Jiyuto is expected to field its own candidate. 
  Since last Friday, 12 LDP lower house members have seceded 
from the party.

proposed legislation to deal with emergencies that could stem 
from North Korea's refusal to fully open its nuclear facilities 
for inspection. 
  "We have to make utmost efforts within the constraints of 
the 
pacifist Constitution," said Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party, who spoke to reporters at a Tokyo hotel. 
  Murayama's remarks followed disagreement Monday during talks 
among representatives of the coalition parties over Japan's 
stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
development program. 
  During the talks, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of core 
coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], proposed 
establishing domestic legislation in preparation for a possible 
naval blockade of North Korea. 
  Ozawa reportedly told the meeting, "Unless Japan prepares 
its 
domestic laws beforehand for a quick response to the situation 
such as a naval blockade, Japan would not be able to do anything 
at a time of contingency." 
  The SDP opposed the legislation, saying it would contravene 
Japan's longtime constitutional interpretation that it is not 
allowed to commit its military for collective military action, 
even to defend its security. 
  Murayama also told reporters, "It is a prerequisite to make 
utmost efforts through negotiations (with North Korea) to 
prevent such a contingency from breaking out." 
  Meanwhile, Murayama called on other coalition partners to 
speed up the process of naming a successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "We have to launch a new government as quickly as possible 
and we must conduct preparations to call a parliamentary 
election to name the new head of government tomorrow," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of Shinseito, has 
emerged as the most likely replacement for Hosokawa, who 
announced on April 8 that he will step down over an alleged 
financial scandal and delays in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 
1994 budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Japan Red Army members 
living in Pyongyang since their 1970 hijacking of a Japan 
Airlines (JAL) airliner have slammed Tokyo's policies toward 
North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  In a letter obtained Saturday [16 April] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE, the Red Army members remarked, "As a neighboring 
nation, Japan should not be conspiring with the United States 
but making efforts for dialogue and peace (with North Korea)." 
  The letter indicated that a declaration with the same 
content 
was sent to an influential member of the government's ruling 
coalition. 
  The U.S., along with Seoul and Tokyo, has been urging 
Pyongyang to comply with international nuclear safeguards 
accords and permit inspections of its nuclear facilities 
suspected of being part of an arms development program. 
  The U.S. has lobbied for a U.N. resolution calling for North 
Korea's compliance with the inspections, but at China's urging 
last month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a nonbinding 
presidential statement asking Pyongyang to be more open with its 
program. 
  With discussion about possibly imposing economic sanctions 
on 
North Korea under way in the United Nations, Japanese national 
security authorities suggested the letter was part of a 
propaganda campaign against Japan in connection with last 
Friday's 82nd birthday of North Korean leader Kim Il-song. 
  In 1970, nine Japan Red Army members commandeered a JAL 
Boeing 727, known as "Yodo," to Pyongyang. One of the hijackers 
has since died in North Korea and another was arrested in 1988 
while trying to return to Japan.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Keiji Urakami] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- A multilateral trade body 
that will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) is expected to exercise more enforcing power as a 
policeman to crack down on global protectionism. 
  The World Trade Organization (WTO) will be formed next 
January at the earliest as a new multilateral trade framework in 
place of the 46-year-old GATT. The WTO was adopted Friday [15 
April] by more than 120 GATT countries during their Marrakech 
ministerial conference. 
  When dispute settlement efforts between two countries go out 
of control, the WTO will step in, seeking a solution basically 
on the basis of consensus, the same dispute settlement mechanism 
as employed under GATT. 
  But procedures used by the WTO provide stronger and clearer 
rules for a wide range of trade areas that will newly include 
services and intellectual property rights in line with the 
just-signed final accord of the Uruguay Round of the 
multilateral trade talks. 
  The biggest difference with the system under GATT is that 
the 
WTO rules will be enforced by a judicial mechanism that will no 
longer allow countries to block findings against them. 
  Under the so-called "negative consensus system," findings 
prepared by a dispute settlement panel will be automatically 
formalized unless there is a unanimous consensus to reject them, 
meaning that only a single vote in favor of a finding is needed 
for the WTO to adopt it. 
  The new mechanism is designed to answer increasing 
frustrations by trading countries about the GATT system in which 
one member can deny a panel recommendation. 
  Under the new system, countries which fail to comply with 
panel recommendations will face trade sanctions under strict 
time limits. 
  The new trade framework's strong spirit against global 
protectionism is well reflected in part of the Marrakech 
Declaration that confirmed a "determination to resist 
protectionist pressures of all kinds." 
  The United States has officially supported the new dispute 
settlement mechanism under the WTO, with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor recently saying, "the new system... 
will work and it will work fast." 
  But countries like Japan, which has often come under the 
threat of trade sanctions, want the mechanism to work as a 
deterrent against Washington's inclination to resort to 
unilateral and retaliatory trade measures such as the recently 
reinstated "Super 301" trade clause. 
  Ministers from Malaysia, India, Thailand and other countries 
joined Japan's stance in ministerial speeches made during the 
four- day Marrakech conference that began Tuesday. 
  Ministers from the countries blasted a growing unilateral 
approach among superpowers as a tool to settle trade rows, 
describing the stance as destabilizing the world trade order. 
  A barrage of such criticism was made in an apparent 
reference 
to Washington, which has appeared to be threatening to use 
retaliatory weapons in its intellectual property trade with 
Asian countries. 
  Although supporting the overall mechanism under the WTO, 
Kantor said action under Washington's domestic trade provisions 
such as Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act would not be affected 
by the WTO rules.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Sanzo Nosaka, the former 
leader of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), acted as a spy for 
the former Soviet Union's intelligence agency ever since his 
return from Moscow in 1946, according to a book released 
Saturday [16 April] by the JCP. 
  Nosaka, who served as the party's first secretary and then 
Central Committee chairman between 1955 and 1982, died last 
November after being expelled from the party in 1992 for his 
involvement in a spy scandal. 
  The book, titled "70 Years of the Japanese Communist Party," 
depicts major events in the party's history since its foundation 
in 1922. 
  The book says, "Nosaka had been working as a spy affiliated 
with the Soviet intelligence agency ever since he returned to 
Japan in January 1946." 
  It also accuses former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of having 
tried to control the JCP by taking advantage of Nosaka, who had 
climbed up the party echelons to gain its leadership. 
  "Nosaka showed his loyalty to Stalin by helping him 
interfere 
with the Japanese Communist Party due to Nosaka's tie with the 
Soviet intelligence agency," the book says. 
  It accuses Nosaka of falsely reporting to the Soviet 
authorities his prewar colleague Kenzo Yamamoto, another JCP 
member, as a Western spy, resulting in the 1939 execution by 
shooting of Yamamoto. 
  In 1931, Nosaka fled the repression of the prewar Japanese 
Government to the Soviet Union. 
  Yamamoto also fled to the Soviet Union in 1928 and continued 
his political activities in Moscow until 1939, when Nosaka wrote 
a letter to the Soviet authorities identifying him as a spy. 
  The truth surrounding Yamamoto's death was exposed only in 
August 1992, when a Japanese news magazine reported Nosaka's 
letter which had been kept at the Soviet Communist Party 
archives in Moscow. 
  The JCP subsequently sent an investigative mission to Moscow 
and stripped him of his membership.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren) called on the government on 
Monday [18 April] to promote deregulation, including phased 
abolition of the law regulating the opening of large-scale 
retail stores. 
  The federation also sought an easing of regulations on rice 
and liquor sales and railway fares. 
  The government maintains tight controls on licensing rice 
retailers. 
  The federation expressed hope that its appeal will be 
reflected in a deregulation program to be formulated by the 
government by the end of fiscal 1994. 
  It said deregulation in the retail business will help narrow 
the price gap between domestic and imported goods. 
  The federation said passenger and freight fares should be 
decontrolled while the existing regulation on shipbuilding 
should also be reviewed to allow newcomers to enter the coastal 
shipping market.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, a front-runner to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, said Sunday [17 April] that he will formally express 
his decision after ruling coalition partners fine-tune their 
policies and pick him to run in the race for premier. 
  Hata, head of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), made the remarks to reporters on a plane while 
returning to Japan from Marrakech, Morocco. 
  Hata was in Morocco to attend a four-day ministerial meeting 
of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations 
to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks. 
  Regarding prospects that the coalition parties will endorse 
him as a replacement to Hosokawa, Hata, who is also deputy 
premier, declined to directly express any intention to be a 
candidate, only saying, "I will hear the views of other 
(coalition) partners...I'm not in a position to speak about 
specific matters." 
  On changing the framework of the current coalition, Hata 
said, "There are many moves within the (primary opposition) 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). A big move has not yet emerged. 
It will get clearer from tomorrow on what kind of framework 
(we) will establish." 
  The remark was apparently in reference to former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP veteran, who is eyeing forming 
ties with coalition parties, possibly Shinseito and Komeito, the 
alliance's other key party, to achieve his ambition of 
succeeding Hosokawa, political sources said. 
  The present seven-party coalition is made up of parties 
ranging from socialists to conservatives. 
  "In order to employ politics with responsibility, it is 
desirable that a force or a framework be formed capable of 
rivaling the LDP," Hata said. 
  Hata hinted at a possible tie-up with Watanabe, who has 
expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for 
the premiership to replace Hosokawa. Hosokawa announced his 
resignation on April 8 over questions regarding his personal 
finances. 
  Watanabe said Sunday he will leave the party to run in the 
prime ministerial election. 
  Hata told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport, "I would like 
to respect his determination. He is fit to be leader." 
  Five ruling coalition parties Monday are expected to 
fine-tune agreement on such key policies as tax reform and their 
stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program. 
  The meeting will precede coalition leaders' talks on 
cementing the accords and then picking a successor to Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, who is certain to become Japan's next prime minister, said 
Monday [18 April] that cabinet changes must be minimal after the 
establishment of a new government. 
  Hata, 58, head of key coalition party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], told reporters late Monday night, "I think it's 
difficult to replace many cabinet members who worked out the 
fiscal 1994 budget if the present coalition agrees to establish 
a new government." 
  Hata, who is also deputy prime minister in the cabinet of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said the new government must 
be a full- fledged one and not a provisional government, because 
Japan needs to meet expectations from the rest of the world. 
  On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to 
Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe 
indicated to have second thoughts about his plan to leave the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run 
in a Diet election for the premiership. 
  Watanabe, who declared Sunday that he will quit the LDP, met 
LDP President Yohei Kono on Monday and conveyed his desire to 
run for the premiership. 
  But Watanabe told reporters later that he has found major 
differences with coalition parties over security policies, 
indicating that he was having second thoughts about his bid for 
premiership. 
  Kono and Watanabe are scheduled to hold another round of 
talks Tuesday, LDP officials said. 
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the House of Representatives 
steering committee said Monday he wants to convene a plenary 
session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the premiership. 
  Keiwa Okuda told reporters that the lower house will convene 
the vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the 
coalition parties pick the coalition's nominee for the next 
prime minister. 
  Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to 
resume discussions Tuesday on policies for a new cabinet. 
  In Monday's two rounds of talks, they failed to reach 
agreement on two issues of immediate concern, Japan's stance 
toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program and tax system reform. 
  The forum comprised representatives at the secretaries 
general level of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito, 
Komeito [Clean Government Party], Japan New Party (JNP), 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Democratic Reform Party and 
Kaikaku No Kai [Reform Party]. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that 
it 
will not take posts in a new government, stayed away from the 
session. 
  The coalition executives confirmed Monday that the ruling 
parties will stick to a policy accord reached before the 
formation of the Hosokawa administration last August, said SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo, chairman of the forum. 
  They also shared the view that early Diet approval of the 
overdue 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 is the top 
priority for the next government and that the new administration 
should formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring spending for 
improving living standards, Kubo told a news conference. 
  On basic policies, the coalition representatives ironed out 
differences on such key issues as political reform, economic 
reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. ties and 
administrative reform and decentralization, he said. 
  Hosokawa, who declared on April 8 that he is resigning as 
prime minister, will stay in office until the Diet picks a new 
prime minister.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Representatives of the 
ruling coalition parties are close Tuesday [19 April] to forging 
agreement on key policies such as national security prior to 
picking a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The representatives, who resumed discussion on Tuesday 
morning, are expected to reach agreement during the day if they 
can hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern, 
Japan's stand on North Korea's suspected nuclear development 
program and tax system rehabilitation, coalition sources said. 
  The two issues have blocked the coalition from cementing 
ties 
on policies for a new government to replace the administration 
of Hosokawa, who declared his resignation April 8 over scandals 
involving his finances. 
  Clearing these obstacles could lead to a meeting as early as 
Tuesday of coalition party leaders, who will formally sign into 
accords key policy coordination and then select Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as their candidate in the prime ministerial 
election in the Diet, the sources said. 
  On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to 
Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe 
indicated second thoughts about his plan to leave the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run in the 
Diet election for the premiership. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [Clean 
Government Party], the coalition's key party, told reporters 
after the representatives' session went into recess that they 
agreed on all policies but tax reform. 
  Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, the alliance 
partners agreed that Japan will abide by the United Nations, 
prepare for emergency under the framework of the Constitution 
and cooperate with the United States and South Korea, the 
sources said. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the leading coalition the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [as received], told reporters that 
if the representatives forge an agreement, a meeting of 
government leaders will be held to confirm the agreement and 
then party chiefs will discuss picking a prime ministerial 
candidate and forming a new cabinet after confirming the policy 
accords. 
  The session will resume at 3:00 P.M., coalition officials 
said. 
  The representatives are made up of persons at secretaries 
general level of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), 
Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP), the Social Democratic Party 
(DSP), the Democratic Reform Party and Kaikaku No Kai [Reform 
Party]. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that 
it 
will not take a post in the new cabinet, stayed away from the 
session. 
  Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the House of Representatives 
Steering Committee, meanwhile, said Monday he wants to convene a 
plenary session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the 
premiership. 
  He told reporters that the lower house will hold the 
vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the 
coalition parties pick their official nominee for the next prime 
minister. 
  Hata said Monday that cabinet changes must be minimal after 
the establishment of a new government. 
  Hata, 58, head of Shinseito, the coalition's core party, 
told 
reporters late Monday night, "I think it's difficult to replace 
many of the cabinet members who worked out the fiscal 1994 
budget if the present coalition agrees to establish a new 
government." 
  Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, said the new 
government must be a full-fledged rather than provisional 
government because Japan needs to meet the expectations of the 
rest of the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Representatives of the 
ruling coalition parties failed to agree on a policy platform 
Tuesday [19 April] for forming a new government to replace the 
cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The representatives resumed discussions on Tuesday morning 
to 
hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern -- 
Japan's stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development program and tax system reform -- before nominating a 
candidate for the premiership, party officials said. 
  They reached an accord on the North Korean nuclear issue but 
failed to narrow differences over tax reform, the officials said. 
  It now seems that Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is a virtual certainty to be 
elected the next prime minister. Michio Watanabe, an 
influential figure in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), formally gave up his notion Tuesday to leave the party in 
a bid to seek the premiership, hoping to gain the support of the 
coalition. 
  Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with 
LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet 
election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56, who abruptly 
announced his resignation on April 8 on account of his financial 
improprieties. 
  The coalition representatives will resume talks Wednesday 
and 
the selection of Hata as a prime ministerial candidate by the 
coalition chiefs was postponed to as early as Wednesday, they 
said. 
  As a result, a Diet election to nominate Hosokawa's 
successor 
will take place as early as Thursday, parliamentary sources said. 
  Hata said Monday cabinet changes must be minimal after the 
establishment of a new government. 
  On the North Korean nuclear problem, the representatives 
agreed Japan should be prepared under the framework of the 
Constitution for an emergency situation. 
  The agreement reached said Japan would adhere to the 
policies 
of the United Nations, and "the government should be prepared 
under the framework of the Constitution for an emergency 
situation." 
  It also said Japan should cooperate closely with the United 
States and South Korea. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is led by Hata, has 
called for a tougher stance against North Korea and urged a 
revision of current laws, if necessary, to implement possible 
economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the 
seven-party coalition, has voiced its opposition to sanctions. 
Japan's Constitution renounces the use of force to settle 
international disputes. 
  As for tax reform, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, 
the chief strategist in the eight-month-old coalition, proposed 
a sweeping tax reform centered on an indirect tax hike. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo rejected the proposal, 
party officials said. The SDP has opposed the current 3 percent 
consumption tax on almost all goods and services. 
  Hosokawa was forced to withdraw his plan in early February 
to 
introduce a fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace 
the consumption tax after facing stiff opposition from the SDP, 
which threatened to withdraw from the coalition. 
  The representatives were from the level of secretary general 
of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Japan 
New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the 
Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the 
House of Councillors, and Kaikaku no Kai (Reform Society), a 
small parliamentary group of LDP defectors in the House of 
Representatives. 
  New party Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component in the 
coalition, which declared Friday that it will not take a post in 
the new cabinet because of disappointment over the issue of 
picking a successor to Hosokawa, did not attend the session. 
  Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
has said it will support the candidate agreed upon by the 
coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Michio Watanabe, former 
foreign minister of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), said Tuesday he has decided not to leave the party to be 
a prime ministerial candidate in an election to choose a 
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with 
LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet 
election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56. 
  Hosokawa announced his resignation on April 8 over a 
financial scandal and a Diet stalemate. 
  Watanabe made the decision against a backdrop of ruling 
coalition partners coming close to agreeing on key policies such 
as national security and tax system rehabilitation, and picking 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the alliance's core party 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) as its candidate for prime 
minister, political sources said. 
  Watanabe's change of heart over quitting the LDP paved the 
way for the party to field Kono as its official candidate for 
the premiership election, party sources said. 
  Kono met with Watanabe on Friday and Monday hoping to 
persuade him not to run in the premiership race to keep party 
unity but the efforts proved fruitless then. 
  Watanabe, an LDP veteran who has held various ministerial 
posts under LDP governments, declared Sunday he will quit the 
party to be a candidate for the election, saying a cabinet 
capable of rescuing the country from the current difficult 
situation should be formed. 
  As a crack grew among coalition parties over the process of 
picking a successor to Hosokawa, Shinseito and Komeito, the 
coalition's other key party, briefly considered Watanabe to be 
new leader of a post-Hosokawa coalition. 
  The LDP's 38-year-long grip on power ended last summer as 
seven parties ranging from socialists to conservatives formed 
the current coalition following the July general elections, in 
which the LDP failed to retain a majority. 
  Watanabe told reporters after the face-to-face meeting with 
Kono that he will not help the coalition and will remain in the 
LDP to promote reform. 
  Watanabe also said that he will vote for Kono in the prime 
ministerial election in the Diet. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, meanwhile, told 
reporters 
that Watanabe decided not to leave but to remain in the party 
because the coalition has not yet forged agreement on crucial 
policies such as national security and its stand on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development project. 
  Diet balloting for a new prime minister is likely to take 
place on Thursday [21 April] or after, parliamentary sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Kenzo Yoneda, a House of 
Representatives member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), quit the party Tuesday [19 April] making him the 
12th defector from the LDP since last Friday. 
  Yoneda, who belonged to the faction led by former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe, said he "cannot act freely inside the 
faction." 
  Yoneda said he plans to team up with a group of five LDP 
defectors who quit the party Monday. 
  The five defectors backed Watanabe in his bid for the 
premiership. Watanabe formally gave up the bid Tuesday. 
  Another five LDP lower house legislators quit the party last 
Friday and formed a new party called New Party Mirai (Future) on 
Monday. 
  Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, left the party 
Monday. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the coalition's core party 
formed by LDP defectors last summer and led by Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, agreed in an executive meeting Tuesday to the 
entry of Kosaka, independent lower house member Shigeru Ishiba 
and House of Councillors member Hiroko Hayashi, a former LDP 
member, party officials said. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, is regarded as a most 
likely successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who has 
announced he is resigning to take responsibility for his 
controversial personal finance deals. 
  The LDP had been in power for 38 years until last August 
when 
it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition after a general election 
the previous month.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Justice Minister Akira 
Mikazuki on Tuesday [19 April] described as "very ironic" the 
money scandal-induced resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who has championed the cause of political reform. 
  Mikazuki made the comment at a news conference after 20 
cabinet ministers wrapped up a meeting that is expected to be 
their last get-together under the short-lived Hosokawa 
administration prior to the imminent selection of a new prime 
minister. 
  Mikazuki said Hosokawa's fall from grace is due to mounting 
parliamentary criticism over Hosokawa's "money scandal," in 
which Hosokawa was blasted by the opposition for receiving 100 
million yen as an unreported political donation from a 
mob-linked trucking group. 
  "It is a very ironic thing" that Hosokawa, who had swept to 
power on the strength of his public image as an anti-graft 
crusader, was forced to quit over a string of money scandals, 
the justice minister said. 
  However, Mikazuki, who is expected to retain his justice 
post 
under a new coalition government, vowed to bring to a successful 
conclusion the ongoing investigation into a spate of bribery 
scandals involving the nation's top construction firms and 
politicians. 
  "My mandate is to crack down on money-related political 
corruption on the basis of laws and evidence, namely to settle 
the general contractors' bribery scandals in a manner that could 
win public understanding," he said. 
  Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura is under 
indictment on a charge of accepting a bribe in exchange for 
using his influence to deter the Fair Trade Commission from 
filing a criminal accusation against an alleged bid-rigger. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
encouraged the ruling coalition to wage a successful "restart" 
on the basis of "reflections" over some blunders committed over 
the past eight months. 
  He criticized some political forces in the coalition for 
pushing a proposal to amalgamate all coalition parties into a 
unified large party or parliamentary group to win an upcoming 
general election "with an eye to single-seat constituencies." 
  "Momentum to keep the unity of the coalition parties had 
been 
in place until the (common) goal of accomplishing political 
reform was attained," he said at a news conference. 
  Takemura noted that such momentum dissipated quickly as 
"momentum to disintegrate the coalition rapidly came to the 
surface" following the enactment of the political reform bills. 
  Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told 
a 
separate news conference the Social Democratic Party is chiefly 
responsible for the squabbles that provisionally threatened to 
blow up the unity of the coalition. 
  "The solidarity of coalition parties was undercut as the 
Social Democratic Party started a race without any training and 
became short of breath midway," Kanzaki, of Komeito [Clean 
Government Party], said. 
  The minister was apparently referring to gaps in the 
coalition between the socialist-led camp and the Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative camp over such key 
policies as tax system reform and Japan's stand on the proposed 
economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its suspected nuclear 
development program.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- An influential business 
leader expressed hope Tuesday [19 April] that political 
stability will be restored with the likely selection of Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata as successor to departing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), was commenting on news 
reports the ruling coalition is expected to choose Hata as 
Hosokawa's successor. 
  The new administration is expected to pursue the line 
followed by the Hosokawa government, and its foundations will be 
more stable than present ones, he said. 
  The government will do its utmost to enact the 1994 fiscal 
budget, up for parliamentary approval, as soon as possible, 
Nagano said. 
  He said the yen's appreciation has hampered economic 
recovery, and its value should be lowered to a level matching 
its purchasing power to help ease the impact on domestic 
industry. 
  There are bright signs of recovery but they have yet to 
cover 
all industries, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Additional macroeconomic 
measures will not help Japan curb its huge trade surplus and may 
even lead to inflation and overheating of an economy already 
poised to recover, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said 
Tuesday. 
  "The supportive efforts of the monetary and fiscal policies 
taken so far are gradually putting in place a foundation for 
economic recovery," Mieno said during a speech at a luncheon 
sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. 
  With the economic decline coming to a halt, he said the most 
important thing now is to "carefully monitor" those measures and 
flatly reject any further cuts in the official discount rate. 
"I'm not thinking of reducing the discount rate." 
  Noting that the current-account surplus "also reflects the 
underlying trend of excess savings," Mieno said, "if we neglect 
this and adopt an over-ambitious macroeconomic policy to rectify 
the external imbalances, this may well result in inflation and 
overheated economic activity." 
  In this respect, the central bank head emphasized the 
measures included in Japan's March market-opening package, 
saying "appropriate macroeconomic policy measures, improvement 
of market access, deregulation and consolidation of sound 
infrastructure would contribute to diminishing the imbalances." 
  Meanwhile, Mieno said he is not trying to justify Japan's 
trade gap, apparently referring to mounting U.S. pressure on 
Japan to take fresh and bolder actions ahead of Sunday's meeting 
in Washington of finance ministers and central bankers from the 
Group of Seven (G-7) nations. 
  Mieno said Japan is doing its best on macroeconomic measures 
although they have not yet fully materialized to put the economy 
on a "well-balanced" recovery path. 
  "However, it is expected to come about in the near future, 
and in the process, the current-account surplus should 
decrease," he added. 
  Analyzing the historical trend of trade surpluses moving 
from 
developed to developing nations, Mieno said it is natural in 
economics and noted that the issue has become too politically 
sensitive. 
  Expressing regrets over the still deep-rooted view that 
trade 
surpluses are a virtue and trade deficits a vice, Mieno said, 
"an international transaction is not a zero-sum game...rather it 
should be recognized as a plus-sum game." 
  Under the current global trend, he cited the "East Asian 
miracle," the shifting of high development to East Asian nations 
from Japan. 
  In fact, Japan's merchandise trade surplus for fiscal 1993 
released Monday showed that its gap with other Asian nations 
topped that with the U.S. for the first time on record. 
  Mieno reiterated that the "decline in economic activity has 
come to a halt" with some improvements seen led by consumption 
and business sentiment which was nothing but pessimistic in the 
latter half of last year regaining some equanimity. 
  He painted a brighter picture than his recent comments by 
saying that conditions for inventory adjustments to improve are 
"gradually falling into place" and that write-offs of banks' 
nonperforming loans are set to peak and are manageable. 
  Mieno gave high credits to a recent positive stance by 
financial institutions to clear bad loans, noting that 
completion is already in sight at "money center banks" and 
increases in fresh bad loans are slowing. 
  Banks are taking positive steps to make sound lending, he 
said, and noted the U.S. experience suggests that banks' 
attitudes change when a clear outlook for write-offs is obtained. 
  Mieno remained cautious, however, and said, "we still need 
to 
analyze some forthcoming economic indicators before reaching a 
definite conclusion." 
  He also repeated "we must still bear in mind the various 
future possibilities" of downward pressures, citing ongoing 
corporate restructuring, particularly in face of competition 
from Asian nations, triggered by the yen's appreciation. 
  He also cited persistent inventory adjustments and "still 
midway" overall write-offs of nonperforming loans by financial 
institutions. 
  Regarding questions by reporters on currency rates, he 
declined to comment, only mentioning the G-7 accord "to 
cooperate to keep stable exchange rates reflecting economic 
fundamentals." 
  On Japan's political turmoil, Mieno said political certainty 
is necessary for economic stability, and called for a settlement 
as early as possible. 
  But he said the current "political vacuum" is unlikely to 
drag down the economy with sufficient public works being carried 
over from February's 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The recent uptrend in 
long-term interest rates will top the agenda at a spate of 
international meetings later this month in Washington, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday. 
  Fujii, speaking at a regular news conference after a morning 
cabinet meeting, declined to comment on the overnight tightening 
of U.S. credit policy, however. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 
Seven 
(G-7) major industrialized nations are slated to meet Sunday in 
Washington for twice-yearly gatherings through Tuesday of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 
  "I presume interest rates will become one of the major 
issues," Fujii said, noting that sustainable growth without 
inflation is what G-7 nations want to attain. 
  Fujii acknowledged there were various views concerning the 
tighter U.S. credit stance, such as increasing hopes for an 
economic recovery and spreading fears of inflation. 
  But he said, "I shouldn't be commenting on another nation's 
credit policy." 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced overnight a slight 
tightening of its credit policy, lifting the target rate for the 
federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. 
  The third tightening since the Fed changed its credit stance 
for the first time in five years in February contrasts with 
Germany's move last week to cut its key rates to allow other 
European nations to follow suit. 
  The U.S. credit stance has sent long-term market rates 
sharply higher, exporting the uptrend to other G-7 nations. 
  With a credit policy gap surfacing between the U.S., which 
is 
on the road to recovery, and Japan and some European nations 
which are still struggling with sluggish economies, coordination 
is expected to become a tough issue for the G-7 meeting. 
  Concerning Japan's huge trade surplus that is certain to be 
another major topic, Fujii declined to suggest remedies, saying 
it depends on the coming new cabinet. 
  Japan is set to choose a new prime minister, with the most 
likely candidate being Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa who offered to resign earlier this month. 
  Fujii said he does not know whether Japan will be 
represented 
at the Washington meetings by its finance minister in view of 
the uncertain political situation and the expected start of Diet 
debate on the fiscal 1994 budget as soon as a new cabinet is 
formed. 
  Referring to the fiscal 1993 trade surplus released Monday, 
Fujii said exports are decreasing and imports are increasing in 
terms of volume. The trend shows the effectiveness of the Trade 
Ministry's measures, he said. 
  Japan's trade surplus for the year ended March 31 hit a 
record high for the second year in a row, reaching 121.99 
billion dollars, up 10.0 percent from the year before. 
  Fujii said Japan will continue taking action to boost 
domestic demand and deregulatory steps to facilitate market 
access as included in the February stimulus package and the 
March market-opening plan.

  [Text] Osaka, April 13 KYODO -- The Asia-Pacific trade 
center, the first comprehensive wholesale facility for imported 
goods in Japan, will open in Osaka Thursday [14 April]. The 
12-story center, with a total floor space of 335,000 square 
meters, was completed by business groups and enterprises at a 
cost of about 150 billion yen. 
  Center officials said they plan to develop the facility into 
a major distribution center in Asia, which will contribute to 
reducing Japan's huge trade surplus. 
  A total of 108 companies from Asian countries have rented 
space for business outlets at the center, which can accommodate 
as many as 400 stores, the officials said. 
  Foreign firms will be offered sales outlets at a discount 
rate and have access to various services to facilitate their 
entry into the Japanese market, they said. 
  The officials said only 58 Japanese companies will maintain 
offices at the center because more than 200 firms have canceled 
contracts to rent office space because of the protracted 
recession.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mytri Ungphakon] </F>
  [Text] Marrakech -- Thailand and other members of ASEAN 
have agreed to play a substantially more active role in the new 
world trade system that will emerge from the Uruguay Round 
agreements that are due to be signed tomorrow. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says he is 
going to propose that Thailand chairs the agricultural committee 
of the new World Trade Organisation [WTO] due to be established 
on January 1. This would put Thailand and its allies in the 
14-nation Cairns Group in a position to influence the agenda of 
a committee handling one of the more contentious issues facing 
the new organisation. 
  And at an informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers on 
Tuesday, Singapore received support from fellow-members in its 
bid to host the first WTO ministerial meeting. These 
ministerial meetings, to be held every two years, will be the 
forum for ultimate control of the new organisation created by 
the Uruguay Round of world trade talks that concludes formally 
in Marrakech this week. 
  Both bids are still at a formative stage and in Thailand's 
case no formal discussions have yet taken place with any other 
country. So there has been no reaction so far from others among 
the more than 100 countries attending this week's Uruguay Round 
meeting. 
  The process of setting up the WTO will only begin today when 
a preparatory committee is due to be appointed. 
  So far, the only ministerial meetings of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the forerunner of the 
WTO -- that have been held outside Switzerland have been those 
that are part of a round of trade negotiations. All other 
routine GATT ministerial meetings have been held in Geneva. 
  Singapore's bid to hold the 1996 WTO meeting would therefore 
set a new precedent. 
  Unconfirmed reports say China also wants to host the 1996 
meeting. It hopes also to be granted readmission to the GATT 
system so that it can be a founding member of the WTO. China 
helped to found GATT, but its membership lapsed following the 
communist takeover. 
  The WTO agricultural committee that Thailand hopes to chair 
will initially be responsible for monitoring how the Uruguay 
Round's 125 participants implement the round's agreement on 
reducing subsidies and lowering trade barriers in farm trade. 
  This is an issue that has caused some of the biggest 
controversies throughout the seven years of the Uruguay Round. 
  Dr Suphachai said the idea of Thailand's candidature came 
from two meetings on Tuesday: the informal meeting of ASEAN 
economic ministers where he proposed that Thailand should be 
ASEAN's spokesman on agriculture in the WTO, and a bilateral 
meeting with Australian trade minister Bob McMullen who said the 
committee's chairman should come from the Cairns Group. 
  Thai officials say that out of the Cairns Group's 14 
members, 
one from ASEAN could prove to be the most acceptable to the 
major participants in the sometimes bitter agricultural 
negotiations. And among the four ASEAN countries that are also 
in the Cairns Group -- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines -- Thailand has been by far the most active in the 
farm trade talks. 
  The United States, which has been pressing for sharp cuts in 
subsidies and protectionist trade barriers, is likely to support 
anyone from the Cairns Group because the group shares that 
objective, the officials say. 
  The European Union has resisted radical reform and could 
find 
a country from ASEAN, which has tended to take a more moderate 
position in the Cairns Group, more acceptable, they say. 
  The officials believe that Australia, chairman of the Cairns 
Group, will not want simultaneously to chair the WTO committee, 
and that the group's five Latin American countries could be too 
aggressively critical of agricultural protectionism to be 
acceptable to the European Union. 
  The five -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay 
-- 
twice walked out of Uruguay Round ministerial meetings in 
protest against the failure of the United States and European 
Union to reach agreement on agriculture. 
  Dr Suphachai said he had not yet put forward the idea to any 
other country. But he has already shown a keenness for Thailand 
to assert itself in this issue, himself playing a particularly 
active part in Cairns Group affairs since his appointment as 
deputy prime minister in 1992. 
  Chairing a WTO committee could require a substantial 
bureaucratic change for Thailand since the country's 
representative would have to be senior, probably with the rank 
of ambassador. The choice facing the Government would be to 
have a diplomat take the position, or a trade specialist. 
  At present Thailand's ambassador to Geneva is a Foreign 
Ministry diplomat whose duties cover a wide range of subjects 
handled by the various UN agencies there, ranging from human 
rights and disarmament to labour and trade. 
  Thai trade officials are discussing the possibility of 
appointing an experienced trade negotiator as ambassador either 
in place of the present diplomat, or preferably as a second 
ambassador assigned specifically to GATT or the WTO. They point 
out that more than half the countries represented in Geneva have 
ambassadors from economic ministries, some as their countries' 
sole envoys in the city. 
  The question of whether the new WTO should link trade 
concessions with the observance of international standards of 
labour rights has turned out to be one of the most controversial 
issues in the main Marrakech meeting, with virtually all 
ministers referring to it in their formal statements. 
  Broadly, developing countries opposed the move which is 
proposed by the United States and France, and is largely 
supported by developed countries. Dr Suphachai said that in 
discussions with the Australians, he was told that Canberra 
would not actively promote the idea, but that Canberra would not 
oppose it either because the Australian governing party is Labor. 
  But the bulk of attention in Marrakech this week has turned 
to the many issues being discussed in side meetings. In the 
main conference room, more than 100 ministers are scheduled to 
plough through their formal statements over a scheduled period 
of almost four days, culminating in tomorrow's signing 
ceremonies. 
  In addition to discussions with ASEAN and Australia, Dr 
Suphachai has also been involved in breakfast and lunch meetings 
yesterday of ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) group and the Cairns Group. 
  Members of the Cairns Group agree that the group should 
continue in existence so that the implementation of the Uruguay 
Round agricultural deal can be monitored. 
  But differences are emerging within the group over a Latin 
American proposal that the group be reorganised so that the 
chairmanship rotates instead of remaining with Australia. The 
Latin Americans also want to expand the group's membership to 
other agricultural exporting countries. 
  Brazil and Argentina in particular are thought to be 
sufficiently dissatisfied with the Uruguay Round's compromise on 
agriculture to seek a more aggressive chairmanship. 
  However, Dr Suphachai said Thailand preferred to keep 
Australia as chairman. 
  The group is due to meet formally in Uruguay next month. 
Discussions here in Marrakech this week have served as 
preparation. 
  Dr Suphachai was also scheduled to meet delegation heads 
from 
Italy, China, Hungary and the Czech Republic during this week. 
  Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon, who is also in the 
Thai 
delegation, has been meeting counterparts from Hong Kong and 
India. 
  Bigger players on the world trade scene have been discussing 
more serious issues. The United States and European Union have 
been trying to narrow their differences on commitments related 
to a new deal on government purchases due to be signed tomorrow 
by 20-30 countries; and the United States and Japan have been 
tackling the US demand for greater access to the Japanese market.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The top UN official for 
refugees called Monday [18 April] for "political will" to 
effectively tackle the humanitarian crises resulting from 
increasing flows of refugees worldwide. 
  "There is no substitute for the political will to find a 
solution," UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako 
Ogata told participants at a symposium at the UN University in 
Tokyo. 
  The number of people fleeing from poverty, natural 
disasters, 
civil war and oppression has jumped 10-fold over the last 20 
years to some 20 million worldwide, she said. Another 25 
million are displaced within their own countries. 
  According to UN estimates, conflicts and disasters will have 
driven some 100 million people from their homes by the turn of 
the century. 
  "A humanitarian strategy of preparedness, prevention and 
solution demands a greater commitment to preventive diplomacy 
and mediation efforts within countries to diffuse political 
violence and ethnic tensions," Ogata said. 
  She noted, though, that prevention is the "most important, 
but also most difficult" measure, as the United Nations has only 
limited powers to interfere in the domestic affairs of member 
states. 
  "International monitoring of national human rights is 
extremely difficult and we are still at a very, very limited 
scale today," Ogata said. 
  Large-scale UN operations like in Mozambique and Cambodia, 
where tens of thousands of peacekeepers and humanitarian staff 
were involved in settling the legacy of civil wars, will remain 
the exception, Ogata said. 
  "More attention should be given to smaller, but carefully 
balanced operations combining humanitarian, political and 
military components such as in Tajikistan," she said. 
  Given that most refugees do not want to stay in their host 
countries, while host countries for their part cannot absorb 
large numbers of refugees, Ogata said that the concept of 
"temporary protection" as practiced with refugees from former 
Yugoslavia should be promoted. 
  Such temporary refuge is "still at the developing stage of 
refugee law" and takes the form of different arrangements in 
various countries, but could help overcome many governments' 
reluctance to accept refugees. 
  Those returning to their countries must be given security 
guarantees and be offered opportunities to make a living, if 
repatriation is to prove successful, she said. 
  Ogata said she expects that extensive media coverage of 
humanitarian crises will further increase public pressure on 
governments to provide humanitarian aid, adding that the UNHCR 
is short of funds "all the time." 
  She warned, however, of the risk "that humanitarian action 
could become a camouflage for political inaction."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The United Nations' top 
official for refugees said Thursday that Bosnian Serbs must be 
included in ongoing peace negotiations to entice them to halt 
their shelling of Muslim towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said, "I think 
the real peace (in Bosnia-Herzegovina) will come only after the 
Serbs are brought into the peace process." 
  She was referring to UN-brokered negotations between 
Bosnia's 
Muslim government and Bosnian Croats. "The Serbs have been left 
out of the peace process and this is why the difficulties still 
exist," said Ogata, who is a former professor of international 
politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. 
  Neither UN-authorized NATO air strikes nor warnings and 
pleas 
from the West have deterred the Serbs from further encroaching 
on Muslim-dominated territory in the former Yugoslavia. 
  "The situation is very, very serious and the United Nations 
is facing a very critical point," Ogata said. 
  In their latest offensive Bosnian Serbian forces attacked 
and 
almost overran the town of Gorazde, one of the six UN-designated 
safety zones. 
  Ogata said the last UN convoy with food and other 
humanitarian aid has reached the town, where some 60,000 
refugees have been trapped on March 22. 
  She said Gorazde-based UN staff is "crying for help" for the 
besieged town, which sustained one of the worst poundings by 
Serbian artillery Wednesday that damaged a hospital and a red 
cross refugee center. However, she said the UNHCR will not ask 
for air drops of relief goods because the casualty toll would 
increase as people leave their shelters to gather the goods. 
  Nearly 350 people have died and more than 1,000 have been 
wounded in the three-week assault on Gorazde. 
  Ogata said there might be a slight chance for "a little 
cease-fire" if the Serbian forces stick to their promise to let 
through to Gorazde a UN convoy with 100 peacekeepers and 41 
doctors delivering medical supplies Thursday. She said she was 
not able to confirm whether the convoy was on its way. 
  Noting that cease-fire agreements have "come and gone," 
Ogata 
said at the moment, "there is nothing that would make me feel 
optimistic" about reaching a lasting armistice. 
  Ogata was in Tokyo to attend a three-day meeting, ended 
Thursday, of the Commission on Global Governance, an independent 
think tank preparing proposals for strengthening the UN.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 18 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Mongolian 
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat has appealed to the activists 
of the Mongolian Democratic Party and the Mongolian 
Socialist-Democratic Party who are taking part in a hunger 
strike on a central square in the capital to abandon extreme 
measures in the political struggle. Receiving representatives of 
participants in the action, the president spoke of his readiness 
to submit their demands to parliament for examination in order 
to settle the alarming situation as quickly as possible. 
  Opposition forces are insisting on the prime minister's 
resignation, accusing the government of corruption and inability 
to fulfill its promises to bring the country out of crisis. 
  P. Ochirbat has held consultations with the leaders of 
various parties and with the head of the Council of Ministers.

  [Excerpts] Ulaanbaatar, 19 Apr -- The political 
confrontation in Mongolia is heating up. Hunger strikes under 
way on two of the squares in the capital, and people are getting 
up on soap boxes, one group demanding the government should 
resign, and the other defending it. 
  Opposition forces accuse the cabinet of ministers of 
conducting an ineffective economic policy, and also accuse the 
premier of corruption. The hunger strikers among the opposition 
forces include Former Vice-President R. Gonchigdorj, leader of 
the Mongolian Socialist Democratic Party. He deemed it 
impossible to continue taking part in the work of the People's 
Great Hural session, believing that parliament is delaying a 
decision on a no-confidence vote in the government. Ts. 
Elbegdorj, leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party, also gave 
up his deputy mandate and left the parliament session for the 
same reason. 
  Supporters of the present government, however, think it has 
made important strides to stabilize the economy and implement 
the transition to market relations, and that it should be given 
the opportunity of working its full term according to the 
Constitution. They have announced a mass rally for today in 
support of the government. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray and President Punsalmaagiyn 
Ochirbat are expected to address the parliamentary session today.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Mongolian 
Democratic Union and a number of other opposition forces held a 
rally here today demanding the government's resignation. In 
their view, the cabinet's socioeconomic program is not in any 
state to extricate the country from crisis. The opposition also 
called on the law and order agencies to urgently start an 
investigation into facts relating to accusations that 
high-ranking officials are involved in corruption and abuse of 
their official position. 
  The hunger strike on Ulaanbaatar's main square by activists 
of the opposition forces has been going on for seven days now, 
in spite of the fact that the president and parliament have 
spoken in favor of this extreme political action being ended. 
The hunger strike on Freedom Square, organized by supporters of 
the government, has already been going on for five days now. 
They have stated that they will only stop it after the 
opposition does the same. 
  "Free microphones" have been set up in both squares which 
anyone can use who wants to talk about the problems worrying him. 
  Today, according to a report from a source in parliament, 
members of the Great Hural discussed the political situation in 
the country. The draft decision on this issue was handed over to 
the leaders of the political parties.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri, and his delegation are paying an official visit to the 
Union of Burma at the invitation of His Excellency Burmese 
Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw from 19 to 20 April. During his 
visit, the foreign minister met and held talks with Burmese 
leaders such as Senior General [Sr. Gen.] Than Shwe, chairman of 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]; Lieutenant 
General [Lt. Gen.] Khin Nyunt, SLORC secretary-1; and Burmese 
Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri is visiting Burma not only 
as 
the foreign minister of Thailand, but also as chairman of the 
ASEAN Standing Committee. Thailand will host and chair the 
annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers to be held in Bangkok 
in July. 
  The objectives of his visit are to hold discussions with 
Burmese leaders on bilateral relations between Thailand and 
Burma as well as cooperation in the Southeast Asian region. 
  Other major issues of discussion between the Thai foreign 
minister and the Burmese leaders were as follows: 
  Touching on relations between Burma and ASEAN, Sr. Gen. Than 
Shwe, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, and U Ohn Gyaw were pleased to hear 
from the Thai foreign minister that after his informal 
approaches other ASEAN member countries have shown no objection 
to Burma's participation as a guest of Thailand in the upcoming 
annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok. Sr. Gen. 
Than Shwe said that Burma wants to learn new experiences by 
participating in ASEAN activities and is willing to comply with 
correct ASEAN procedures. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and Lt. Gen. Khin 
Nyunt reaffirmed that Burma will accept Thailand's invitation to 
participate in the ASEAN foreign ministers' annual meeting and 
will assign U Ohn Gyaw, foreign minister, to attend the 
gathering. 
  The Thai foreign minister informed the Burmese leaders that 
Burma's participation in the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok will bring 
representatives of the ten Southeast Asian countries -- the six 
ASEAN members, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Burma -- face to 
face for the first time in history, which is an important event 
and a good omen for the Southeast Asian region to move toward 
peace, stability, and economic prosperity. When that time 
comes, the next step is to highlight the significance of the 
Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia or the Bali 
Treaty. With the participation of the two remaining nations -- 
Burma and Cambodia -- the treaty will become a noble symbol of 
regional cooperation. Burmese leaders have agreed to consider 
this matter further. 
  Regarding Thai-Burmese bilateral relations, the foreign 
minister said he has been following up all related developments 
since the meeting of the joint commission of the two countries 
in September 1993. He thanked Sr. Gen. Than Shwe for his 
cooperation in moving Thai inmates from various places to 
Rangoon so it is easier for Thai Embassy officials in Rangoon to 
visit them. He also asked the Burmese leaders to consider 
giving parole to Thai inmates on special occasions such as 
Burmese National Day or the Thai king's birthday. Sr. Gen. Than 
Shwe accepted his request in principle. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt 
disclosed that parole will be considered for Thai inmates after 
they are transferred to Rangoon prison. The foreign minister 
has instructed the Thai Embassy to follow up this matter closely. 
  Touching on the Salween River basin development project, the 
Burmese leaders informed the foreign minister that Burmese 
technical officials are still studying the Thai memorandum. As 
for the project to build a bridge across the Moei River, the 
Burmese side was informed that the Thai Government has set aside 
a budget for the construction of the bridge. The Burmese side 
accepted the foreign minister's proposal to have technicians of 
the two countries jointly consider the details of the project. 
  Regarding cooperation in narcotics suppression, the foreign 
minister and Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt agreed that Thailand and Burma 
should work together closely and make serious efforts in the 
suppression of narcotics. 
  Briefing the foreign minister on the situation in Burma, the 
Burmese leader said that the principle duties of the SLORC are 
to create national reconciliation and draft a constitution. 
They said the Burmese Government has made much progress in its 
endeavors to achieve national reconciliation and successfully 
encouraged 10 out of the 14 minority groups in Burma to 
participate in the drafting of the constitution. Three 
additional minority groups have agreed to take part in writing 
the charter. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt himself went to talk with the 
Karen. The Burmese Government attaches highest significance to 
the tasks of creating national reconciliation and drafting the 
constitution and will be ready for other undertakings after 
these two targets have been achieved. 
  In addition to making personal acquaintances, the meetings 
between the foreign minister and the Burmese leaders have helped 
increase mutual trust which will benefit peace and stability. 
These are the basic conditions for social and economic 
development in Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the 
successful launch of Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority [MTJA], 
marks another milestone in the bonds of traditional friendship 
between the two neighboring countries. The arrangement for 
cooperation in exploration and exploitation of the resources of 
the seabed in the joint development area is one of the few of 
its kind in the world. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said this in a 
message in conjunction with the launching of the MTJA in Kuala 
Lumpur this afternoon by the prime ministers of the two 
countries. 
  Datuk Mahathir said good neighborly relations and 
understanding had been the prime mover in resolving the 
overlapping claims made by Malaysia and Thailand. He was 
confident that the activities to be undertaken by MTJA would 
contribute towards the development of the petroleum industry in 
Malaysia and Thailand.

  [Text] Malaysia hopes that countries sending soldiers to 
the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be invited to an international summit on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was proposed by Russia. Foreign 
Minister Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said it would be 
improper for the summit to be attended only by certain 
countries. He also called for the summit to be immediately 
convened because time is running out. He said Malaysia may show 
a positive attitude and hopes that a settlement will be achieved 
although it is not so sure about the matter. He was commenting 
on reports that U.S. President Bill Clinton had welcomed 
President Boris Yeltsin's proposal that a summit on Bosnia- 
Herzegovina be held. 
  Meanwhile, the International Parliamentary Group on Bosnia- 
Herzegovina [IPGB] has urged Muslim nations and the Third World 
to consider immediate concrete steps to protect that country and 
its people. Mr. Kassim Ahmad, member of the IPGB Secretariat, 
said the latest developments -- the attack by Serbian terrorists 
on the town of Gorazde -- proves that the United Nations no 
longer serves as an effective and authoritative international 
organization that can maintain the security of its member 
nations. In a statement in Penang today, he said the IPGB fully 
supported Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's 
statement that the United Nations had failed and colluded with 
the Serbian terrorists in their efforts to capture Gorazde and 
impose a partial and unfair peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  The request was presented by a delegation of Iraqi 
parliamentarians led by its speaker, Sa'di Mahdi, to President 
Suharto at the Merdeka Palace this morning. During the meeting, 
the Iraqi speaker was accompanied by his Indonesian counterpart,

  The talks dealt with ways to bolster bilateral relations in

peoples. Salih asserted that Iraq had implemented all 
resolutions imposed by the Security Council, particularly 
Resolution 687. This should prompt the Security Council to 
fulfill its commitments toward Iraq, according to Paragraph 22 
of this resolution. This paragraph provides for lifting the 
embargo on Iraqi exports, Salih added. [words indistinct] 
reviewed the [words indistinct] imposed on Iraq and the Iraqi 
people's suffering as a result of denying them food and medicine. 
  The head of the Indonesian side to the talks voiced the 
Indonesian people's support for the Iraqi people in facing the 
unfair blockade imposed on them. He also expressed hope that 
the blockade will be lifted as soon as possible.

official visit to Indonesia lasting several days at the 
invitation of the Indonesian Parliament.

  [Text] After analyzing available data on the violent riots 
in Medan, North Sumatra, authorities have reached the conclusion 
that the rioters tended to employ tactics used by former PKI 
[Indonesian Communist Party] members and that the riots were 
masterminded by a group of individuals who called themselves 
SBSI [Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union]. 
  Lieutenant General Mantiri, chief of general staff of the 
Indonesian Armed Forces [ABRI], said ABRI has never recognized 
the SBSI because its legal existence is not recognized by the 
government. Therefore, ABRI will take strong action against 
anyone involved in the destruction and looting of property 
without fear or favor and in accordance with existing laws. 
  Commenting on rumors that racist violence and riots also 
took 
place in various parts of Jakarta, Lt. Gen. Mantiri said the 
rumors were not true. The rumors may have been deliberately 
spread by irresponsible elements to create anxiety among the 
public.

  [Text] JAKARTA, April 20 (AFP) -- Sporadic strikes 
continued outside the Sumatran city of Medan on Wednesday, but 
emotions in the city appeared calmer as it remained quiet into 
the afternoon following a day of anti-ethnic Chinese rioting. 
  Potential trouble-makers may have been discouraged by what 
witnesses said was an extremely heavy security presence 
throughout the city. 
  "Security in Medan appears to be under control (but) many 
laborers are still refusing to return to work," said Alamsyah 
Hamdani, a lawyer for the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid 
Institute (LBH). 
  Hamdani, speaking by telephone from Medan, said his office 
had received reports that hundreds of workers were still 
refusing to return to work and had gathered outside their 
factory in nearby Binjai town despite efforts by local security 
personnel to disperse them. 
  He said many workers at the Industrial Zone of Medan, north 
of the city, had also refused to work, idling their factories. 
  "It seems like most of the factories there have not reopen@d 
yet," Hamdani said. 
  Another LBH lawyer, Hasbi Ansori, said strikes were also 
continuing to the east of Medan in Tanjung Morawa town, although 
shops were reopening under tight security after violent protests 
there Tuesday. 
  Witnesses said the strikes outside Medan did not appear to 
have an anti-Chinese element, and were aimed only at backing 
continued demands for better pay and working conditions [word 
indistinct] right to organize independent trade unions. 
  In Medan, a retailer confirmed that many shopping centers, 
independent shops and supermarkets in the downtown area had 
reopened under tight security after hurriedly closing down 
Tuesday when a mob looted a major shopping mall owned by a 
prominent ethnic-Chinese businessman, Tanoto Sukanto. 
  Hamdani said that there had been several other incidents 
Tuesday besides the attack on Sukanto's downtown Thamrin Plaza, 
which involved between 1,000 and 2,000 people armed with 
machetes, iron picks and other weapons. 
  Witnesses said the riot was contained only after security 
forces sealed off the area. Other shops and offices throughout 
the area closed. 
  Medan had just quieted down from anti-Chinese riots which 
followed a mass workers' demonstrations Thursday and Friday and 
degenerated into violence, leaving one ethnic Chinese 
businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses sacked. 
  There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia against 
the country's wealthy ethnic Chinese minority, which constitutes 
only three percent of the population but controls a 
disproportionate share of economic activity. 
  Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's 
mass protest alleged that ethnic Chinese were accumulating 
wealth to the detriment of other Indonesians, and were still in 
circulation, witnesses said.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 20 KYODO -- Economic activity in the 
north Sumatra provincial capital of Medan returned to normal 
Wednesday [20 April] after nearly a week of anti-Chinese and 
labor-related riots, a police source told KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  The spokesman for North Sumatra's Police Headquarters, Lt. 
Col. Leo Sukardi, said in Medan, 1400 kilometers northwest of 
Jakarta, that shops and supermarkets closed during the riots 
have reopened, and no further protests have occurred. 
  The situation is calm and residents are not afraid to go out 
any more, Leo said. 
  Students have already gone back to school, although many 
rumors have been spread by parties that there will be other 
protest rallies. 
  Meanwhile in Jakarta, rumors have spread that there were 
demonstrations, following those in Medan, in some areas of 
Jakarta such as Glodok, Tanjung Priok, Pasar Baru and Tomang, 
where many Chinese descendants live. 
  But Jakarta's military commander, Maj. Gen. Hendro Priyono, 
called on Jakarta's residents to remain calm and not react to 
mere rumors. 
  "Jakarta is safe," Hendro told reporters.

Mantiri reiterated that there is no curfew being imposed in 
Jakarta. He also denied news reports which say Jakarta is under 
curfew. 
  He said that the commander of the Greater Jakarta Military 
Region Command did not issue any statement declaring Jakarta 
under curfew. Lt. Gen. Mantiri calls on the people not to be 
trapped by unfounded rumors, which are spreading in several 
towns throughout the country. 
  The Information unit of the Greater Jakarta Military Region 
Command also reiterated that there is no curfew in Jakarta. In 
a telephone conversation to RRI [Radio Republik Indonesia] this 
evening, the information official said that the military region 
command did not declare Jakarta and its surrounding area to be 
under curfew. 
  He said that the Jakarta Coordinating Agency for National 
Stability only is carrying out an anticrime operation against 
youths who are gathering without any purpose and consuming 
liquor. The 1994 anticrime operation, launched on 11 April, also 
allows for searches of those people carrying firearms and sharp 
objects that may scare the people. The anticrime operation is 
not only carried out at night, but also in the morning and at 
noon.

diplomatic relations between Laos and Malaysia. The visit is 
crowded with success. The prime ministers of the two countries 
discussed various issues. The two sides agreed to increase the 
exchanges of delegations at all levels and of all branches of 
service. The Malaysian side is pleased to render assistance to 
Laos in training our Lao officials. Part of the training 
assistance is directly provided by the Malaysian Government and 
the other is given in the form of funds from a third country.

investment. A seminar on investment in Laos was also organized 
during the visit. In addition, an agreement on repayment was 
signed between the national banks of Laos and Malaysia. A 
memorandum of understanding was signed between the electrical

aviation and tourism. They agreed to assign the economic, 
scientific, and technical cooperation committees of the two 
countries to hold consultations and study possible means of 
cooperation. The two prime ministers are of the view that we 
have maintained sufficient conditions to promote and expand 
cooperation in all fields.

  [Text] The Pambansang Ugnayan ng Mamamayan Laban sa GATT 
[National Association of Citizens Against GATT] (PUMALAG) 
yesterday vowed to actively lobby against the GATT (General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) treaty which will be submitted 
to the Senate for ratification. 
  Rafael Mariano, Kilusang Magbubukid sa Pilipinas [Peasants 
Movement of the Philippines] (KMP) chair, and spokesman of 
PUMALAG, which has 45 member organizations nationwide, said the 
group will hold an anti-GATT summit to hear crystallize public 
opinion on the effects of GATT. 
  Mariano said millions of small peasants and fisherfolk 
nationwide will mark this coming 15 April, when representatives 
from various governments around the world convene in Marrakesh, 
Morocco for the GATT signing, as an "International Day of 
Protest." 
  The ratification of GATT, Mariano said, would cut across 
such 
issues as social equity, food security, agricultural production, 
trading and pricing, and environmental protection and 
development. 
  "The Ramos Government's Medium Term Agricultural Program is 
attuned with the GATT in its thrust to liberalize agricultural 
imports which will put Filipino farm produce in an unfair 
competition with relatively cheaper imports," he said.

<F P=106> [By Joem H. Macaspac] </F>
  [Text] The country is now officially bound by two tax 
treaties with India and Spain, Executive Secretary Teofisto 
Guingona Jr. said. 
  Guingona said the Philippine Senate, the country's treaty- 
ratifying body, has already given its concurrence to two 
conventions entered into by the Ramos government with the two 
countries. 
  The agreements involve the avoidance of double taxation and 
the prevention of "fiscal evasion" with respect to taxes and 
income. 
  The Senate's concurrence was contained in Resolution Nos. 69 
and 70, which were passed by the Senate before it adjourned for 
the Lenten season, Guingona said. 
  The RP [Republic of the Philippines]-Spain Convention and 
the 
RP-India Convention were entered into and signed by the 
respective representatives of the two governments in Manila on 
14 March 1989 and 12 February 1990, respectively. 
  Then President Corazon C. Aquino signed the Instrument of 
Ratification and forwarded the Conventions to the Senate 
pursuant to Section 21 of Article VII of the Constitution 
requiring the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the Senate 
before any international agreement or treaty becomes valid. 
  Among the salient features of the RP-Spain Convention are: 
-- In the Philippines, only income tax applies, whereas in 
Spain, the coverage includes income tax on individuals and 
corporate tax; 
  -- Provisions of taxation of income from dividends, 
interests and royalties given preferential rates of tax which 
are designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the 
country; 
  -- With respect to personal service income, the Convention 
gives the country of residence the primary right to tax the same 
while giving the country where the services are rendered mere 
shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and 
  -- Provision of a mutual agreement procedure on 
administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the 
interpretation of the tax provisions; an exchange of 
information provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between 
the two countries in the assessment or collection of, 
enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination 
of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which the Convention 
applies. 
  On the other hand, the RP-India Convention's highlights 
include: 
  -- In the Philippines, only income tax applies while in 
India, the coverage includes income tax, wage tax, company tax 
and dividend tax; 
  -- Provisions on taxation of income from dividends, 
interests and royalties give preferential rates of tax which are 
designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the country; 
  -- With respect to personal services income, the country 
of residence is given the primary right to tax the same while 
the country where the services were rendered are given mere 
shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and 
  -- It stipulates a mutual agreement procedure on 
administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the 
interpretation of tax provisions; and an exchange program 
provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between the two 
countries in the assessment and collection of, enforcement or 
prosecution in respect of, or determination of appeals in 
relation to, the taxes to which the Convention applies.

  [Text] Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services, 
and investments is a key to keeping the Asia-Pacific region 
economically strong. 
  This, reported Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo to 
President Ramos, was one of the conclusions reached at the 
recent Asia-Pacific Finance Ministers' meeting in Honolulu, 
Hawaii. 
  In a two-page report, Mr. de Ocampo said he told his APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] colleagues, the Philippines 
is ready to contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific region, 
even as it is currently "positioned for a takeoff." The finance 
chief likewise reported he had "most enlightening" discussions 
with representatives of Chile, Mexico, and Thailand. Among the 
items discussed was the implementation of the value added tax. 
These countries, Mr. de Ocampo noted, benefited from an 
expanded coverage of the said taxation scheme. 
  "All these countries have reaped the benefits of tax reform 
and the broadening of their respective value-added tax systems," 
he said. 
  Other points discussed in the meeting and agreed upon were 
the need to maintain sound economic policies and stability as a 
foundation for sustained, low inflation growth in the region; 
the importance of having the private sector continue to be the 
primary engine of growth; the need to further develop capital 
markets for effective mobilization and allocation of capital; 
and, the necessity of improving the capacity to finance 
infrastructure development in order to address current shortages 
and inefficiencies. 
  Moreover, during the meeting, the Philippine panel -- 
composed of Mr. de Ocampo, Finance Undersecretary Juanita 
Amatong, Philippine Consul General in Honolulu Solita Aguirre, 
and special assistant Gabriel Lim stressed the urgency of 
arriving at an early conclusion to the ongoing discussions on a 
100 percent capital increase for the Asian Development Bank, and 
the need to look more closely at and to accommodate other models 
of development particularly those reflected in the recent World 
Bank study on East Asia. 
  He also stressed on the need to continue supporting small 
and 
medium-scale enterprises.

  [Text] The Philippines and South Korea yesterday signed an 
investment guarantee agreement aimed at bolstering the entry of 
more Korean investors into the country. 
  The agreement, concluded after 13 years of negotiations, 
seeks to address the concerns of Koreans investing for the first 
time in the Philippines. It contains provisions on the settling 
of commercial disputes, the right of investors to remit 
investments or profits, and protection from expropriation. 
  Officials of the Board of Investments said the accord also 
grants national treatment status to Korean investments, but 
within the bounds of existing Philippine laws, such as, foreign 
ownership restriction on land and exploitation of natural 
resources. 
  The officials said that this status means that whatever laws 
or policies on local investors will also be applicable to Korean 
businessmen. 
  Although substantial investments from South Korea had been 
coming in even without the investment agreement, Trade and 
Industry Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro said the pact is still 
important particularly for new Korean investors. 
  "Many brand-name Korean companies relocated their 
export-oriented plants here without the agreement, but the small 
and medium Korean companies who are investing overseas for the 
first time need this because they are unfamiliar with operations 
abroad," Navarro pointed out. 
  The Koreans are ranked sixth biggest foreign investors in 
the 
Philippines during the past five years, accounting for P4.34 
billion [Philippine pesos] or 5 percent of the total foreign 
equity of P94 billion infused during the period. 
  Among the biggest Korean companies already operating here 
are 
STC Corp., Amkor/Anam, Pohang Steel, Ssangyong Corp., Dong 
Corp., Lucky- Goldstar, Samsung Corp., Kia Motor, Hyundai, and 
Daewoo Corp.

  [Text] The Eastern Telecommunications Philippines Inc. 
(ETPI) has announced its participation in the strategic 
Fiber-optic Link Around the Globe (Flag) cable system. 
  The digital fiber-optic cable system will span the Pacific 
Rim, the Middle East, and Europe. 
  Construction and maintenance of the major cable system will 
begin in June 1994 and will be completed by the end of 1996. It 
will cost $1 billion. 
  ETPI General Manager Antonio M. Urera said the firm's 
participation in the global cable system will enhance its 
capabilities to bring state-of-the-art telecommunications to the 
country . 
  It will also expand its international gateway facility 
(IGF), 
the country's second which started operations in 1990. ETPI's 
IGF is the subject of a Supreme Court case filed by Philippine 
Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT), which is opposing the firm's 
entry into the lucrative gateway service. 
  Talks of an out-of-court pact between the two parties have 
been initiated, but these have stalled as PLDT has taken a 
contrary position. 
  ETPI also operates one of the world's largest cable stations 
-- the Currimao Cable Landing Station in Ilocos Norte -- as well 
as cable systems to Okinawa, Singapore, and Hong Kong. 
  Flag will link Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Thailand, India, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, 
Italy, Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom. 
  Participants in Flag have been nominated as the key 
representatives of the telecommunications industry in their 
countries. 
  Other members of the Flag cable consortium include 
International Digital Corp. of Japan, Korea Telecoms, Hong Kong 
Telecom, Telekom Malaysia, Communications Authority of Thailand, 
PT Indosat of Indonesia, VTN of India, SaudiTel, ETISALAT of 
UAE, GenTel Cairo of Egypt, ItalCable of Italy, and MCL of the 
UK.

  [Text] Security officials in the Ramos administration 
yesterday expressed serious concern and alarm over the emergence 
of radical Muslim extremist groups in Mindanao that are involved 
in various criminal activities. 
  Acting Defense Secretary Feliciano Gacis, who briefed the 
29-member National Security Council (NSC) on the internal 
security and peace and order situation, said the radical Muslim 
extremist groups "pose and immediate threat" to the security and 
stability in southern Philippines. [sentence as published] 
  These groups, like the Abu Sayaff group, are giving military 
and police authorities more problems than the Muslim 
secessionist guerrillas because of their propensity to violence, 
terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal activities in pursuit 
of their objectives." 
  Several international Islamic organizations, particularly 
those based in Libya and Pakistan are suspected to be providing 
financial support to these groups which are attempting to 
establish an Islamic society in the country. 
  Apart from these radical Muslim extremist groups, Gacis also 
pointed out the rising criminality in southern Philippines which 
is largely fueled by Muslim separatist guerrillas who are 
turning themselves into bandits. 
  Commonly called "lost commands," Gacis said these groups are 
also classified as threat to the peace and order in 
predominantly Muslim areas in Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu and 
Tawi-tawi. 
  These groups carry out various lawless activities, like 
piracy, hold-up, robberies, extortion, illegal logging, and 
kidnap-for-ransom. 
  Apart from internal security threats, which Gacis claimed to 
be fast diminishing because of government's efforts to address 
the root causes of rebellion, crime and other lawlessness, 
members of the Ramos Cabinet also briefed the NSC about the 
status of the government's reform programs in both political and 
economic fields, the assessment of the impact of the oil price 
increase, and the country's security concerns in East Asia, 
particularly on the South China Sea area and the Korean 
peninsula. 
  On the political and economic reforms, Executive Secretary 
Teofisto Guingona claimed "the country is now poised for 
take-off" because most of the economic and political reforms 
have been put in place. 
  The economic reforms, Guingona explained, are designed to 
level the playing field, promote global competitiveness and make 
opportunities available to everyone in a fair and equitable 
manner. 
  Among the major measures the government has done to 
implement 
these economic reforms were liberalizing the financial sector, 
deregulating the transport and communications sector, and 
reforming fiscal management, power sector, investment and trade, 
agriculture, infrastructure, and environmental and natural 
resources. 
  In the political field, Guingona enumerated the government's 
gains in the peace process, peace and order, devolution and 
implementation of the local government code and the redirection 
of the foreign policy toward economic diplomacy. 
  Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, for his part, 
outlined the country's position on the growing tension in the 
Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development.

  [Text] The admission of the killing of former rebel 
official Leopoldo Mabilangan alias "Ka [Comrade] Hector," by a 
leader of the Melito Glor Command of the New People's Army (NPA) 
confirmed that the Netherlands-based National Democratic Front 
(NDF) has lost its control over the communist movement in the 
Philippines, political analysts said. 
  They added that not only did the pronouncement by NPA leader 
Gregorio "Ka Roger" Rosal clear the government of any 
involvement in the killing, but also showed that the Ramos 
Administration is serious and sincere in pursuing a lasting 
peace in the country. 
  The Melito Glor Command under "Ka Roger" claimed 
responsibility for the assassination of "Ka Hector" over the 
weekend, saying that the former NPA leader had "sinned against 
the people." 
  But former NDF leader Satur Ocampo said the admission of the 
killing must be checked first "before pointing an accusing 
finger to the NPA." 
  At the same time, Senate President Edgardo Angara urged the 
government to continue the investigation of the death of "Ka 
Hector" to find the truth behind the assassination of Mabilangan. 
  Lawyer Jose Malvar Villegas, spokesman for Region 4 
(Southern 
Tagalog) of the Lakas-NUCD-UMDP [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the 
Nation-National Union of Christian Democrats; UMDP -- expansion 
unknown], said the success of Ka Hector in bringing back his 
former comrades' confidence in the government through the 
putting up of cooperatives showed the NPA's support is waning 
among the people in Southern Tagalog region. 
  "The growth of cooperatives in Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon 
through Ka Hector's initiative was a big blow to the communist 
movement in those provinces," Villegas said. 
  He contended that if Mabilangan was killed because of his 
"crimes against the people," he should have been slain even 
before he surrendered to the government. 
  "But the fact that he was killed just now, indicated that Ka 
Hector was assassinated because the NPA was alarmed by the 
successful inroads he was making among the people and rebel 
comrades through his cooperative movement in the provinces," 
Villegas said.

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa-Soldiers 
of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) 
yesterday voiced support for newly appointed Armed Forces Chief 
of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, saying he is "better than most" 
officials. 
  Cashiered Army Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, Capt. Danilo Lim, 
Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, and Navy Capt. Proceso Maligalig said 
Mr. Enrile was a good replacement for Gen. Lisandro Abadia. 
  The former army chief assumed the post the other day in a 
turnover ceremony attended by President Ramos, Vice President 
Joseph Estrada, and former President Corazon Aquino. At the 
command conference held immediately after the formal turnover of 
duties, Mr. Enrile said he gave orders on how to enhance 
"professionalism and unity" in the military ranks. 
  With a new batch of promoted officers set to assume roles in 
the armed forces following the retirement of 19 generals this 
year and the attrition of at least 42 younger officers, the 
RAM-SFP-YOU urged soldiers to "reinvent themselves by going to 
the lower rank and file and make unpopular decisions that could 
make a difference in the future." 
  "If Mr. Enrile can make unpopular decisions, then we will be 
very happy," Mr. Honasan said. 
  The reform group also said it was "beyond Mr. Abadia" to 
determine if factionalism still exists in the military 
organization. 
  Last Tuesday, Mr. Abadia included the unification of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as one of his achievements 
as chief of staff for the last three years. 
  The president also said the military is now more unified and 
professional because of Mr. Abadia's efforts. 
  Mr. Lim, spokesperson of the RAM-SFP-YOU, said Mr. Ramos 
might be referring to other groups when he said the age of 
"adventurism" is over. "We are not mere adventurists, that is 
why we are still here. Maybe the president was not referring to 
us." he said. 
  At the same time, Mr. Maligalig said the government panel 
headed by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar is "in constant touch with the 
group (RAM)." He added, both panels are now in the process of 
exchanging position papers. The committees on electoral 
reforms, military reforms, economic reforms, social justice, and 
good government maintain open communication, he said. 
  In another development, Jose Maria Sison, head of the 
central 
committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has 
expressed support to the decision of the Melito Glor Command 
headed by Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal to execute 
Leopoldo Mabilangan, as the former leader of the Banahaw Command 
was "afforded due process under the justice system of the 
people's revolutionary government." 
  Mr. Rosal recently said a "people's court" found Mr. 
Mabilangan guilty of crimes punishable by death and that he was 
invited to attend proceedings several times last year. 
  In a faxed statement, Mr. Sison also said the Melito Glor 
Command has the authority to "take the necessary action when 
confronted with any hostile subject who is armed and dangerous." 
  "Mabilangan was clearly an armed agent of the Ramos regime 
and the reactionary armed forces," Mr. Sison said, in an attempt 
to justify the killing of the former NPA [New People's Army] 
leader who openly voiced out support to the government's amnesty 
program. 
  Mr. Mabilangan was killed noon of Easter Sunday in front of 
Sto. Tomas Church in Batangas. He was buried yesterday by 
thousands of followers. No untoward incident occurred even as 
police investigators have yet to make concrete progress in 
arresting his assailants.

  [Text] Cotabato City -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front 
(MILF) had been implicated in the abduction of an engineer from 
Manila who was kidnapped two weeks ago while lodging at a 
government-run hotel inside the campus of the Mindanao State 
University [MSU] in Marawi City. 
  As this developed, the Cotabato City Peace and Order Council 
(CCPOC) had urged higher authorities to investigate on the 
alleged involvement of some policemen and military personnel in 
the spate of the "unabated" kidnappings here since 1990. 
  Reports reaching here said, in Marawi City, authorities on 
Wednesday received a letter purportedly coming from the 
abductors of Arceo Cruz, 66, who was snatched last 29 March by 
armed men in his cottage at the Ayala Resort, a hotel located 
inside the 2,500 hectare MSU campus. 
  The letter, written in an MILF official stationery, stated a 
P50 million [Philippine pesos] ransom demand in exchange for the 
freedom of Cruz, who is supervising the implementation of a road 
project linking two towns in Lanao del Sur. 
  Among those who signed the same letter were known criminals 
facing warrants of arrest: Commander Dimas, the group's leader; 
Sulaiman Marohombsar; Ibra "Brix" Cabugatan; Omar Usman; Linog 
Sultan; Michael Capal; Saide Caya, and Commander Mujahid. 
  The kidnappers also included in their demands the 
implementation of regular infrastructure projects under the 1993 
"seed money" of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao 
[ARMM]; a performance audit of the ARMM particularly in Lanao 
del Sur; the "enforcement" of a standing truce between the 
government and Moro rebels; and the placement of qualified 
Muslims in the government. 
  Police reports said the letter was personally handed by 
Assemblyman Benasing Macarambon of ARMM to Brig. Gen. Samuel 
Dunque, chief of the Army's 102d Brigade in Marawi City. 
  It was not however, specified how Macarambon got hold of the 
ransom letter. Cruz is believed kept by his captors at Unayan 
area, a remote place bordering the towns of Ganasi, Malabang, 
and Kalanugas, all in Lanao del Sur's 2d district. 
  "Even if we sell our souls together, still we cannot raise 
the P50 million," said Ernesto Chinjen, 55, brother-in-law of 
Cruz, who he said was not even a well-known contractor until the 
time of his abduction. 
  "We cannot do something either with their (kidnappers) 
political demands," he said. "Only the national leaders and the 
ARMM authorities can do something about it." 
  Mayor Macacna Pangandaman, who is among those negotiating 
for 
the safe release of Cruz, said the kidnappers' demand is 
equivalent to the total cost of the road project the victim was 
constructing. 
  Chief Supt. Mangigin Magomnang, ARMM regional police 
director, said the police and the military have issued 
instructions not to give the kidnappers anything as it would set 
a bad precedent and would encourage more kidnappings in the area.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday charged 
that "inaccurate reports" from the French news agency Agence 
France Presse (AFP) on the fighting in Cambodia were a "danger" 
to Thailand. 
  He also warned Thai media which subscribe to the agency to 
be 
careful about publishing AFP reports from Phnom Penh, saying 
they might contain "inaccurate" information. 
  Speaking after attending a meeting of the National Security 
Council (NSC), Chuan said he had checked with the Thai military 
and the Cambodian government in Phnom Penh about the fighting 
around Pailin. 
  The information he received reconfirmed Thailand's 
neutrality 
on the conflict, Chuan said, adding that Thailand wants to see 
peace in Cambodia and did not want to involve itself in the 
country's affairs. 
  He said Cambodia's accusations of Thai support of the Khmer 
Rouge were not true. 
  Chuan said the National Security Council has cautioned the 
Thai media about publishing reports by AFP from Phnom Penh. He 
said the French news agency has been repeatedly warned that its 
reports often contained "inaccurate" information which could 
pose a "danger" to Thailand. 
  Thai media sometimes publish information from AFP without 
crediting the source and include it in news reports as if it 
were fact, thus hurting the country, he said. 
  Phnom Penh leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of 
abetting the Khmer Rouge forces in their military offensives 
against the Cambodian government. 
  Prime Minister Chuan said the National Security Council is 
considering measures to be taken, as Thailand has never 
retaliated against accusations by Phnom Penh regarding its 
losses in the fighting. He said the Thai Foreign Ministry is 
gathering information and will report to the United Nations. 
  Meanwhile, NSC Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has warned Phnom 
Penh that Thailand's patience is running out on the Cambodian 
allegations. He said Phnom Penh should communicate with the 
Thai government directly and not use other people to pass on 
messages. 
  He said he was surprised that Cambodia did not use the Thai 
Embassy in Phnom Penh to communicate with the Thai government. 
  "We can communicate through the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh 
as 
we are both sovereign states. I am very surprised that the 
Cambodian government has never contacted the Thai government 
through that channel, but always used other people's mouths in 
sending messages. I can't believe it, because the government of 
a sovereign state should speak directly to us," said Charan. 
  He said Thailand had always been very patient about events 
along the Thai-Cambodian border despite the fact that local 
people and schools were badly affected by the fighting.

  [Text] Burma will attend the 27th Asean Meeting to be 
held in Bangkok in July as the guest of Thailand, the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  A ministry press release said Burmese military junta leaders 
Gen Than Shwe and Lt Gen Khin Nyunt had informed Thai Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri that Burma would attend the meeting. 
  Prasong yesterday completed an official two-day visit to 
Rangoon in his capacity as Thai foreign minister and chairman of 
Asean's standing committee. 
  During the visit, Prasong paid a courtesy call on the two 
generals. Gen Than Shwe is chairman and Lt Gen Khin Nyunt is 
secretary general of Burma's State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (Slorc). 
  According to the press release, Gen Than Shwe informed 
Prasong that Burma was willing to join the activities of the 
six-member Asean grouping but it would require a period of time 
to become familiar with how the organization works. 
  "Burma's participation in Asean will certainly be good for 
the country," he said Burmese Foreign Minister U Ong Gyaw will 
represent Rangoon in the annual meeting during which Asean 
members will hold discussions with their dialogue partners, 
including the United States, Canada and South Korea. 
  On his return to Bangkok, Prasong said he told the Burmese 
leaders their country's participation in the meeting would mark 
the first time all ten countries in the Southeast Asia region 
had joined the forum. Laos and Vietnam will join as observers 
and Cambodia as the guest of Asean. 
  Prasong told reporters in Bangkok that Burma had agreed to 
show leniency to Thais jailed there by allowing those jailed in 
other provinces to be transferred to a Rangoon prison. The 
consolidation of the Thais into one central prison will 
facilitate visits and care provided by Thai embassy officials. 
  "Khin Nyunt informed me that Burmese authorities would 
consider sentence reductions and provide pardons on a 
case-by-case basis. At present there are about 3,000 Thais in 
Burmese prisons," Prasong said. 
  The two countries also agreed to cooperate more closely in 
the suppression of drug trafficking, he said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today chaired a meeting 
of the National Security Council (NSC) during which the 
Cambodian problem was discussed. The prime minister questioned 
officials concerned about the accusations that Thailand supports 
the Khmer Rouge. Representatives of the Armed Forces reaffirmed 
that the Armed Forces has a policy of not giving any support to 
the Khmer Rouge. Investigations showed that the accusations were 
relayed by AFP in Phnom Penh, which often carries news against 
Thailand. The prime minister said that the Thai Government's 
policy toward Cambodia remains unchanged and Thailand will 
continue to provide humanitarian aid for Cambodia. Thailand, 
however, will explain all the facts to the UN. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will we 
inform 
the UN about Thailand's difficult position? 
  [Chuan] If they cause us damage, the Foreign Ministry will 
be 
instructed to collect information and give an explanation to the 
UN. [end recording] 
  General Charan Kunlawanit, secretary general of the National 
Security Council, said that it is strange that the Cambodian 
Government made accusations against Thailand without first 
seeking clarification since both governments maintain good 
relations. General Charan is also not sure whether the 
accusations were really made by the Cambodian prime minister. 
He said that the limit for the Thai Government's patience is 
determined by the people and the mass media.

  [Text] About 500 Cambodian traders were forced to return 
to Poipet township by Thai authorities yesterday after they 
tried to get to the Thai market in the Klongluek-Poipet area of 
this border town. 
  Klongluek-Poipet border point, inside Thailand, where 
thousands of traders from both countries meet to trade mostly 
Thai goods to Cambodia--was closed by Thai authorities two weeks 
ago after artillery shells from Cambodia landed on Thai 
territory. 
  None of the Cambodian warring factions has claimed 
responsibility or paid damages. 
  The Cambodian traders told Thai authorities they were 
informed by Cambodian officials that the border was open and 
they were allowed to trade in Thailand. 
  They said they had paid a fee of 10 baht each to Cambodian 
officials to get a border pass. 
  The 500 Cambodian traders, after being told of the 
situation, 
decided to return after two hours, according to the report. 
  One trader, Linda Ree, 18, who trades in silverware along 
the 
border, said she had been happy with the news the border was 
open. 
  She has rented a small stall at the border point in Thailand 
where Thai people still owe her about 4,000 baht. She wants to 
get the money, said Miss Linda. 
  She said that following the border closure, the Poipet 
market 
place had been quiet. All kinds of goods from Thailand have 
been soaring in price and the people are suffering. 
  In a related report, the Committee for Controlling Trade 
along the Thai-Cambodian border said they would meet on April 25 
to discuss the border opening. 
  Measures to protect Thai people along the border and their 
property need to be discussed with the Cambodian Government 
before the border is opened, said the report. 
  There is also a need to discuss the two countries' trading 
systems at the local level before the border can be reopened, 
expected early next month.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The preparatory 
committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification released a 
statement on April 15 denouncing the South Korean trip of the 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. 
  Noting that the United States is the very one responsible 
for 
the division of the Korean nation and is still blocking its 
independent and peaceful reunification, the statement says: 
  "We cannot overlook the fact that the U.S. defense 
secretary, 
William Perry, threatened the lives of our 70 million fellow 
countrymen with the bellicose remarks that the U.S. would not 
rule out a war on the Korean peninsula. 
  "We are convinced that the South Korean trip of Perry who is 
the most stubborn hard-liner in executing the U.S. policy of 
increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and perpetuating 
national division will not be helpful at all to peace on the 
Korean peninsula and its independent and peaceful reunification, 
the cherished desire of our fellow countrymen. On the contrary, 
it will heighten tensions and further wreck reconciliation and 
unity of our nation. 
  "Therefore, we resolutely oppose Perry's jackboots treading 
on this land where our fellow countrymen desirous of independent 
and peaceful reunification live. 
  "We denounce the threat of war provocation by outside forces 
and declare to the world that we will fight against it."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Rallies protesting the 
U.S. pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 
the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea were held on 
April 10 in front of the embassies of the United States and 
Japan and the South Korean "embassy" in-Moscow, according to a 
report. 
  Participating in the rallies were a secretary of the central 
committee, and the first organisational secretary of the Moscow 
committee, of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, and 
people from different walks of life. 
  The speakers at the rallies sharply denounced the United 
States and its followers, Japan and the South Korean 
authorities, for carrying the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to the brink of war on the pretext of the DPRK's "nuclear 
development", and demanded that the United States stop at once 
its interference in the internal affairs of Korea and new war 
provocation manoeuvres. 
  They demanded an immediate withdrawal of the U.S. troops and 
nuclear weapons from South Korea and expressed full support to 
the Korean people in their struggle for peace of the country and 
its peaceful reunification. 
  Statements and appeals denouncing the anti-DPRK moves of the 
United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities were 
published at the rallies.

  [Text] According to military sources, U.S. imperialists 
and South Korean puppets conducted provocative joint aerial war 
exercise aimed at a northward invasion on 17 and 18 April by 
drawing in various military planes from overseas bases. 
  On 17 April, fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, VTOL 
[vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes, and electronic 
intercept planes took off from U.S. bases in the Pacific area 
and were deployed to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South 
Korea for this war exercise. On 18 April, combat planes of the 
Air Force and the Marine Corps, and an RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane flew in from bases in Kadena and Yokosuka, 
Japan to South Korean bases. 
  Prior to this frenzied war exercise, EA-6 electronic 
intercept planes created an electronic jam mainly in the skies 
above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Pyongtaek. An EH-60 electronic 
warfare helicopter guaranteed a strike air corps' surprise 
attack by creating an electronic jam while repeatedly circling 
around in the skies above Kapyong, Pochon, and Kanghwa Island. 
Various fighter-bombers, assault planes, and observation planes 
mobilized in the skies above this area were madly engaged in an 
intensive striking exercise against targets in the electric jam. 
  This fire game commotion [pulchangnan sodong], for which as 
many as 500 military planes of various types were mobilized, was 
aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of a surprise 
attack and the consecutive bombing capability of air corps of 
each type of plane with electronic jamming. 
  While the joint aerial war exercise was frantically 
conducted 
on 18 April, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew from 
Kadena base in Japan to South Korea, and madly carried out 
electronic reconnaissance and aerial photographing of important 
strategic areas of the northern half of the Republic while 
making round flights in the skies above Yangyang, Hongchon, and 
Tokchok Island. 
  On 17 and 18 April, a U-2 high-altitude strategic 
reconnaissance plane and an RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane 
were madly engaged in aerial reconnaissance on the overall area 
of the northern half of the Republic while flying in day and 
night in the skies above the area near the military demarcation 
line. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets conducted firing 
[chongpo 
sagyok] near the DMZ, in front of us. A tank group of the 
puppet Army was moved and deployed in an area near Kumpa-ri, 
Paju county on 17 April and fired some 170 tank shells on the 
banks of the Imjin River. An artillery unit of the puppet 
Army's occupied a firing position in Yonsan-ri, Kachon county 
and wielded a war frenzy by randomly shooting some 80 bombshells 
at areas near the DMZ. 
  On 18 April, after occupying a combat position at Konsol-ri, 
Yanggu county and at Kojanha-ri, Yonchon county, the puppet 
armed rascals stirred up a war atmosphere by arbitrarily firing 
some 1,000 large-caliber gunshots. 
  The war commotion by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean 
puppets is becoming all the more unscrupulous with the U.S. 
military leaders' repeated conspiracy with the puppets to plot a 
war scheme and their dragging in and deploying slaughtering 
equipments, such as Patriot missiles, to South Korea. It is 
driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a grave phase.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets staged a war game against the North 
on April 17 and 18 in the sky above an area near the northern 
half of Korea with the mobilisation of more than 500 warplanes 
after creating electronic jamming, according to military sources. 
  Synchronising with this, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance 
plane, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane and an 
RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane committed aerial espionage on 
the whole area of the northern half of Korea, making flights 
above areas adjacent to the demilitarized zone along the 
military demarcation line. 
  On April 17, the South Korean puppet army fired more than 
250 
shells into spots opposite the River Imjin and near the 
demilitarized zone. On April 18, the puppet army who took 
combat positions in Yangju and Yonchon Counties fired more than 
1,000 large-calibre machine-gun bullets.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of 
South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Reunification, the 
League of South Korean Youth in Japan and the Democratic 
Association of South Korean Women in Japan recently issued a 
joint appeal calling on the 70 million Koreans at home and 
abroad to unite firmly and rise up courageously in the 
anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle in order to defend 
the country and the nation from a scourge of war and achieve 
peace on the Korean peninsula and national reunification. 
  "The Koreans at home and abroad should lift up critical 
voices and hold higher the banner of struggle in order to oppose 
the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers, 
check the shipment of Patriot missiles and frustrate all the 
military provocations," said the appeal. "All the Koreans who 
love the country and the nation should join hands and kindle the 
flames of the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) will lead 
the struggle for national reunification and the struggle against 
rice market opening, the action programme of Hanchongnyon for 
this year, representing the faith and confidence of fellow 
students confirmed at the congress of representatives," a South 
Korean newspaper quoted Kim Hyon-chun, chairman of the General 
Student Council of Pusan National University, as saying. 
  "The congress of representatives attended by more students 
than ever before was a meeting of unity in which differences in 
opinion and political view within Hanchongnyon were overcome for 
the sake of unity," said Kim Hyon-chun who was elected new 
chairman of Hanchongnyon at its congress of second-term 
representatives of held in Pusan early this month. 
  He declared, "Hanchongnyon will fight to overthrow the 
present `government' which fooled and deceived the people 
through a secret concession at the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations." 
  He said Hanchongnyon would concentrate on the struggle 
against rice market opening and the expansion of the movement 
for reunification through confederation and, at the same time, 
wage campus struggles including a solidarity struggle for 
securing educational finances this year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The youth and student 
department of the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon) called on the youth and students to 
invigorate the anti-U.S., anti-fascist nation-saving struggle 
for independence, democracy and reunification on the 34th 
anniversary of the April 19 resistance, the Seoul-based radio 
Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  In a letter titled "Let Us Effect a New Leap in the Movement 
of Youth and Students" Hanminjon said for the present the South 
Korean youth and students must draw the masses into the movement 
"To Defend Our Rice," activate the struggle for a stop to the 
introduction of Patriot missiles and against the pressure on the 
North over nuclear inspection and against nuclear war exercises 
and expand this struggle to a struggle for the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons and U.S. troops. 
  "The youth and students must attach primary importance to 
the 
struggle for the abolition of the `National Security Law' and 
disbandment of repressive tools and, at the same time, staunchly 
wage the anti-fascist, anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle to frustrate 
parliamentary approval of the enforcement schedule of the 
Uruguay Round accord," said the letter.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Some 7,000 students of 
Korea University in Seoul held a rally on the campus playground 
on April 18 before going over to an anti-"government" 
demonstration on the lapse of 34 years since the April 19 
popular uprising that led to the overthrow of the Syngman Rhee 
puppet regime, according to the South Korean KYONGHYANG daily 
news. 
  After the rally, the students burnt an effigy of the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam at the university gate and marched to the Suyu-tong 
cemetery where the April 19 martyrs lie buried, shouting 
"Renegotiate Uruguay Round Agreement!" 
  On the same day, the university students ran to and from the 
April 19 monument, 16 kilometres both ways, engraving on their 
minds the will of the students who died a heroic death on the 
streets of the April 19 resistance.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Foreign public 
demanded the release of An Hak-sop, a prisoner of war, who was a 
soldier of the Korean People's Army during the Korean war. 
  The Amnesty International recently called on the world 
people 
and human rights organisations to launch a campaign for his 
release. 
  The Central Committee of the Malian Red Cross in a statement 
of March 25 noted that though An Hak-sop was arrested while 
discharging his military duty, he was kept in South Korean 
prison for more than 40 years on a "spy" charge. The statement 
strongly urged the South Korean authorities to immediately 
release An Hak-sop and other prisoners of war and political 
prisoners. 
  The Senegalese organisation for friendship with the 
fraternal 
Korean people in a statement of April 6 branded the persecution 
of An Hak-sop as a wanton violation of human rights and 
affirmatively appraised the appeal of the Amnesty International 
for his release.

<F P=106> ["South Side Must Show Positive Response Without Delay" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean Red 
Cross must show an affirmative response without delay to our 
just demand for an immediate repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan, prisoners of war, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today. 
  Recalling that the acting chairman of the Central Committee 
of the DPRK Red Cross society sent a letter to the president of 
the South Korean Red Cross on April 19 once again urging an 
immediate repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
unconverted long-term prisoners now in detention in South Korea, 
the news analyst says: 
  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were taken prisoners by the South 
side during the Korean war. They, therefore, should have been 
treated as pows under provisions of the Geneva conventions 
adopted on August 12, 1949, and repatriated to the northern half 
of the country at the time of the exchange of POWs right after 
the ceasefire. 
  As far as their "acceptance of citizenship" is concerned, it 
was against their will. They had no other choice but to do so 
for the sake of their existence since the South Korean puppet 
regime detained them, not returning them. They still do not 
want to live in South Korea, and they themselves have already 
requested the international committee of the Red Cross to help 
them return to the North. Their families and relatives in the 
northern half of the country are waiting on tiptoe for their 
return. 
  The misfortunes of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must no 
more be prolonged, and their repatriation must be realized 
without delay and unconditionally.

assemblyman" from the opposition Democratic Party of South Korea 
exposed the fact that the puppet police had installed watch 
posts around universities and was using them by stealth, 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  He said 29 posts around Kyonggi, Songkyunkwan and seven 
other 
universities in Seoul and other universities had so far been 
discovered. 
  These posts are disguised as "dwelling house," "store," 
"tong 
office" and "tentative building," the "National Assemblyman" 
said.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Lambastes Surveillance on Campus in S. </F>
Korea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
condemns the surveillance on campus by the Kim Yong-sam regime 
styling itself a civilian "government." 
  The analyst says: 
  Recently, a democratic "national assemblyman" exposed at 
"the 
Home Affairs Committee of the National Assembly" the fact that 
"secret houses" for intelligence surveillance had been installed 
and operated around main universities and colleges throughout 
South Korea under the disguise of dwelling houses, tong offices, 
stores, etc. Even after the "civilian" regime made its 
appearance. 
  The surveillance on campus has been made in nasty ways such 
as watch from the "secret houses," the grasping of students' 
movement through agents of special intelligence rings planted at 
campus, watch and wire-tapping. 
  While talking about "civilian administration," "respect for 
human rights" and "halt to intelligence surveillance," the Kim 
Yong-sam group is still resorting to surveillance on campus. 
This indicates that they are a group of fascist dictators 
little different from former rulers. 
  Surveillance on campus, intelligence surveillance, is a 
product of the crisis of rule. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must know clearly that though it is 
trying to save the crisis of its rule at the point of the 
bayonet, relying on surveillance on campus, intelligence 
surveillance, it will result only in precipitating its 
destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A meeting held here 
today marked the 46th anniversary of the historic joint 
conference of representatives of political parties and public 
organisations in North and South Korea. 
  The conference convened in Pyongyang in April 1948 discussed 
measures to frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists and the 
traitors for a permanent split of the nation and establish a 
unified democratic government with concerted efforts of the 
patriotic forces in North and South Korea. 
  In his historic report "The Political Situation in North 
Korea" at the conference, President Kim Il-song laid bare the 
sinister intention and true color of the U.S. imperialists and 
the traitors in South Korea seeking the division of Korea and 
indicated epoch- making nation-saving measures for all patriotic 
forces in North and South Korea to unite and fight a nationwide 
struggle with a common fighting goal to oppose the separate 
"elections" in South Korea and establish a unified democratic 
government. 
  Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central 
Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland, in his report at the meeting said the joint 
conference was a brilliant example of a political consultative 
conference in which representatives of political parties, 
groupings and strata in the North and South with different 
ideologies and political views sat together and discussed 
measures of a joint struggle. 
  "The conference convinced people that when the patriotic 
forces in the North and South united and waged a joint struggle, 
they could frustrate the nation-splitting moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and traitors and reunify the country," the reporter 
said. 
  He described "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the 
Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" put forward 
by the respected leader President Kim Il-song last year as a 
banner of national unity calling for the great unity of the 
whole nation based on patriotism and the spirit of national 
independence and as a brilliant embodiment of the great 
all-embracing policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on 
magnanimously embracing even those who once committed crimes 
against the nation and achieving broad unity. 
  He said, "The South Korean rulers have ignored our sincere 
efforts for he great unity of the whole nation, turned 
North-South relations into hostile relations of confrontation, 
totally blocked North-South dialogues and staged hysteric war 
exercises against the North, follwing outside forces." 
  "If the entire nation is to unite into one," he continued, 
"The principle of national independence must be observed. The 
Koreans at home and abroad must reject the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique's policy of depending on outside forces and vigorously 
fight to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from 
South Korea and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, 
peace zone." 
  The reporter said the South Korean authorities, though 
belatedly, must discard the foolish dream of realising their 
sinister intention in reliance on outside forces, join hands 
with fellow countrymen from the position of national 
independence, accept the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation and respond to the historic proposal for a 
national conference.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party in a statement 
April 19 called upon all the political parties, organisations 
and public figures in South Korea to make singlehearted efforts 
for the convocation of a national conference in order to arrange 
a new occasion of national unity and open a favourable phase for 
peaceful reunification. 
  He said that the proposal for convening a national 
conference 
which was made by a joint meeting of the government, political 
parties and public organisations of the DPRK on April 11 
represents the desire of the entire fellow countrymen for the 
reunification of the country. 
  The conference will be a very significant meeting which 
makes 
it possible for the entire fellow countrymen in the North, the 
South and overseas to promote the great national unity and open 
a new phase of reunification by pooling their efforts and 
wisdom, irrespective of differences in ideology and idea, 
political view and religious belief, he said, and continued: 
  Those who do not want our nation to fall victims to big 
powers and who hope it will defend its dignity and live a happy 
life together in a reunified country must take the road of 
national unity, irrespective of their residence and occupation, 
and prove their patriotic will by unhesitatingly rushing out to 
the plaza of the national conference which will unfold a new 
chapter of reconciliation and unity. 
  We cannot tolerate the anti-national crimes of the South 
Korean authorities who dislike to shake hands with the fellow 
countrymen for national reconciliation and unity and are 
hatching up a plot to unleash a reckless nuclear war at the 
sacrifice of the interests of the nation in conspiracy with the 
outside forces. 
  The South Korean authorities must stop betraying the 
expectation of the whole nation for the convocation of the 
national conference and refrain from obstructing the 
participation of political parties, organisations and individual 
public figures of South Korea in a nationwide dialogue. 
  All the members of the Chondoist Chongu Party and Chondoists 
in the northern half of Korea will make every possible effort to 
hold the national conference to accelerate the reunification in 
the 90s by achieving the great unity of the nation in the 
intrinsic idea of Chondoism intended to promote welfare of the 
country and the nation, declared the spokesman.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The April issue of the 
South Korean magazine MAL carried an article by its contributing 
journalist Yim Su-kyong known as the "Flower of Reunification" 
under the title "Lonely Struggle of Kim Chi-hyon, a Guerrilla's 
Daughter, Against Disease". 
  According to the article, Kim Chi-hyon is a daughter of Kim 
Pyong-chu, a soldier of the Korean People's Army who was engaged 
in guerrilla activities in Mt. Chiri during the fatherland 
liberation war. 
  Kim Pyong-chu was born in Musan County, North Hamgyong 
Province, in the northern half of the country. While serving in 
the People's Army during the Korean war, he was active in Mt. 
Chiri together with Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the 
Korean People's Army who is now widely known as the incarnation 
of faith and will. He was arrested in 1954 and should have been 
returned home as a prisoner of war already long ago. But he was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison in South Korea for the reason of 
his guerrilla activity. After being released from prison, he 
was married to a lonely woman and they came to have two sons and 
two daughters. 
  Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is their first-born daughter. 
  When Yi In-mo was at death's door as an inpatient of the 
Pusan University Hospital after a cerebral haemorrhage, Kim 
Chi-hyon got a leave and attended on him with utmost care for 
two months. 
  Now, the fragile girl is unhappy with a disease. She was 
hospitalized in June, 1992, her illness diagnosed as lymphatic 
tuberculosis. Last year, she had her ribs cut off in an 
operation, attacked with costal tuberculosis, and the 
inflammation has spread to the region of the vertebra. She 
cannot get on without the help of painkiller. 
  She has no relatives to support her in South Korea. Yet, she 
is more concerned for her family, for the living of her brothers 
and sister than her own pain. 
  Her father's friends, long-term prisoners who spent scores 
of 
years in prison, sympathizing with her, formed a "Society for 
Saving Kim Chi-hyon" and has been helping her. 
  In her article Yim Su-kyong says attention of many people is 
needed to save the girl who had to feel keenly the sufferings 
from division and the cold treatment for the mere reason that 
her father was a guerrilla who dedicated his youth to the cause 
of national reunification, the girl who is now fighting against 
a disease, being little different from a lonely orphan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Senior officials of 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) 
issued statements recently, supporting the March 29 appeal of 
the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] calling on all Koreans at 
home and abroad to turn out in a nationwide struggle to remove 
the danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and pave the 
way for peace and reunification of the country. 
  Pae Pyong-tu, vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee 
of Chongnyon and chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters 
of Chongnyon, resolutely demanded that the Japanese Government 
authorities immediately stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon acts 
they are committing in conspiracy with the South Korean puppets 
and that they sincerely apologize for the past crimes against 
Korea. 
  Om Chang-pom, director general of the Federation of Korean 
Traders and Industrialists in Japan, strongly urged the United 
States and the Japanese Government authorities to stop 
antagonising the DPRK and instigating the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique to anti- national crimes. 
  He vowed to mobilize all the Korean businessmen in Japan in 
a 
vigorous struggle to pave the way for peace and reunification of 
the country through great unity of the entire fellow countrymen. 
  So Cha-nyon, chairwoman of the Central Standing Committee of 
the Democratic Union of Korean Women in Japan, expressed her 
firm determination to powerfully arouse all Korean women in 
Japan in the noble struggle under the banner of the ten-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Kim Yu-ui, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of 
the League of Korean Youth in Japan, Chon Se-kwon, chairman of 
the Central Standing Committee of the Union of Korean Students 
studying at Japanese schools, and Chi Man-pok, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Aichi Prefectural Headquarters of 
Chongnyon, sharply denounced the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK 
campaign over the "nuclear issue" and the traitor Kim Yong-sam's 
anti-national crimes and expressed their resolve to more 
vigorously wage the patriotic struggle in solidarity with all 
Koreans at home and abroad and Japanese people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- More than 70 members 
of 20 organisations under the "Kanto Council of the Great Japan 
Patriots Union", a rightwing organisation in Japan, on April 19 
kicked up a row against the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in front of the Korean hall where 
the central headquarters of Chongnyon is housed, and the Tokyo 
head office of the Korean Bank and the Tonghae Trading Company, 
Ltd., according to a KNS report from Tokyo. 
  The rightwing gangsters riding in 30 loudspeaker cars 
committed rowdyism, letting loose an ugly torrent of words such 
as "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and "North Korea, immediately 
stop nuclear threat to Japan". 
  This provocation came at a time when the Japanese 
reactionary 
authorities were zealously joining the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppet clique in the anti-DPRK nuclear rackets. It 
can never be considered to be an accidental or isolated incident. 
  Chongnyon and the Korean residents in Japan are sternly 
denouncing this exceptional provocation, regarding it as an 
offspring of the Japanese authorities' hostile policy toward the 
DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon moves, not a self-determined act of 
rightwing gangsters.

<F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified commentator: "Riots Caused by </F>
Behind-the-Scenes Instigation"] 
  [Text] On 19 April, approximately 70 members of the Kanto 
Council under the League of the Great Japanese Patriots, Japan's 
right-wing organization, committed provocative riots in front of 
the Korea Hall of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan [Chongnyon] Headquarters, the Korea Bank's main Tokyo 
office, and the Tonghae Corporation building, after getting off 
of 30 propaganda cars. 
  During the riots, they did not hesitate to make foolish, 
absurd, and violent remarks, saying that Chongnyon should leave 
Japan, that North Korea should suspend the nuclear threat to 
Japan, and that the Tonghae corporation should be dissolved. 
This is unprecedented and is very grave and provocative 
commotion against the republic and the Chongnyon, arousing our 
indignation. 
  Needless to say, these riots are the results of the Japanese 
authorities' policy of regarding Korea as an enemy, as well as 
their plots against Chongnyon, not the mere violence committed 
by right-wing Japanese gangsters. 
  As is well known, the Japanese authorities' enthusiasm about 
fabricated propaganda, as well as a commotion of pressure 
against the republic under the pretext of our nonexistent 
nuclear issue in collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets is unprecedented. They have not hesitated 
in making such hostile remarks, saying that they will deal 
sternly with our republic, which is being threatened by nuclear 
weapons, under the pretext of the so-called nuclear threat, 
while talking in favor of the mastermind who creates the nuclear 
threat. Also, they have desperately attempted to achieve their 
goal of imposing sanctions on us. 
  The contents of the violent remarks made by the Japanese 
right-wing gangsters during their riots are the same as those of 
the Japanese authorities' hostile and vicious propaganda. 
Therefore, there is no doubt that the riots themselves are 
being committed by the Japanese authorities' behind-the-scenes 
instigation. 
  The issue of Japan's nuclear armaments, not the suspicion of 
our nonexistent nuclear weapon development, is the issue that 
has emerged as an important one in the international community 
today, and has reached a dangerous point. Much valid data has 
proven the above-mentioned facts. At the same time, impartial 
public opinion in the world has also sounded an alarm 
[kyongjong]. 
  We do not pose a nuclear threat to Japan, but rather Japan's 
nuclear armaments have created a grave nuclear threat on the 
Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, the Japanese right-wing 
reactionaries have kicked up nuclear commotions against the 
republic as a thief turns on the victim with a club. 
Furthermore, they have committed acts of violence against 
Chongnyon and its other subsidiary organizations. Therefore, 
their such acts are aimed at distorting public opinion, as well 
as at justifying themselves for openly carrying out Japan's 
nuclear armaments, and thus propagate the nuclear threat on our 
republic. 
  As shown by the violent remarks made by the Japanese 
right-wing gangsters during the riots, this also aims at finding 
an excuse to suppress our patriotic compatriot organizations 
that are related to our republic, including Chongnyon. 
  Such criminal acts can never be forgiven, nor affect us. The 
patriotic activities by Chongnyon, a prestigious overseas 
organization of our republic, and its subsidiary organizations, 
should be guaranteed. If something happens to Chongnyon and its 
subsidiary organizations, this can be regarded as an act of 
doing harm to the republic [konghwagugedaehan chimhae haengwi]. 
The Japanese authorities should correctly assess the situation 
and should forge plans to prevent riots from occurring again in 
the future. Also, they should abandon their plots of nuclear 
armament and immediately stop engineering the anti-republic and 
anti-Chongnyon plots.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate signed articles to the 33rd anniversary of the victory 
in the Playa Giron battle. 
  The Cuban people's victory in the Playa Giron battle showed 
that any formidable imperialist enemy can never bring to their 
knees the people who have risen as one, rallied close around 
their leader, convinced of the justness of their cause, stresses 
MINJU CHOSON. 
  Recalling that after the battle the fraternal Cuban people 
have defended the gains of revolution and stepped up socialist 
construction, valiantly smashing the never-ceasing aggression 
and intervention, subversive activities and sabotages of the 
U.S. imperialists and their stooges, the paper says: 
  The Cuban people under the correct guidance of the Communist 
Party of Cuba headed by Comrade Fidel Castro are notching up 
success in different sectors of the national economy including 
industry, agriculture, education and health service, and working 
hard to stabilize and improve the people's living. 
  They are striving to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from 
Guantanamo and to preserve peace in Central America and 
Caribbean region. 
  The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the 
achievements gained by the fraternal Cuban people in their 
struggle for the defence of the country, revolution and 
socialism and for the independent development and prosperity of 
the country and extend militant solidarity to them in their 
righteous struggle. 
  They are happy to have such courageous and honest friends as 
the Cuban people in Latin America. 
  They wish the Cuban people greater success in their efforts 
to build socialism, believing that the traditional relations of 
friendship and cooperation between the two peoples will grow 
stronger and develop in conformity with the aspirations and 
desire of the Korean and Cuban peoples. 
  NODONG SINMUN in a signed article says that the Cuban people 
are now pressing forward the revolution and construction with 
redoubled efforts under the difficult conditions of the "special 
period of peace time". It stresses that no one can stop the 
Cuban people from advancing in an indomitable revolutionary 
spirit.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today 
dedicate signed articles to the 30th anniversary of the opening 
of diplomatic relations between Korea and Indonesia. 
  Over the past 30 years after the establishment of diplomatic 
relations the friendly relations between the two countries have 
developed favourably, NODONG SINMUN notes, and says: 
  The two countries, member nations of the non-aligned 
movement 
in Asia have supported each other politically and cooperated 
with each other economically. The friendly relations between 
Korea and Indonesia are conducive to building a new society in 
the two countries as well as an independent and peaceful, new 
Asia. 
  The Indonesian Government is steadfastly keeping to an 
independent stand, rejecting the imperialists' intervention in 
its internal affairs. 
  Indonesia, the chairman state of the non-alignment, is 
playing a positive role in broadening and developing this 
movement, and, together with Asean nations, are working hard to 
ensure Asean prosperity and security in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The Korean people fully support the principle and stand 
maintained by the Indonesian people in building a new society. 
  MINJU CHOSON says the Korean people express the belief that 
the friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and 
Indonesia would further develop and wish the Indonesian people 
greater success in their future work for national prosperity.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- P.V. Svoik, 
co-chairman of the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan, told KCNA that 
the concrete wall artificially blocking the travel of fellow 
countrymen and bisecting the country must be pulled down at once. 
  Saying he had seen the West Sea barrage and the concrete 
wall 
during his visit to Korea, he noted: 
  "The wonderful West Sea barrage is a peaceful structure 
while 
the concrete wall built in the area south of the military 
demarcation line is a military setup for division. They 
represent a sharp contrast. 
  "The gigantic barrage was built by the Korean people with 
their own design, technology and labour. This shows how 
powerful the economic potential of Korea is. The successful 
completion of this vast nature-harnessing project is a result of 
the wise guidance of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of 
the Korean people, and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader. 
  "While seeing the West Sea barrage built under the 
far-reaching plan to completely free the people from the fetters 
of nature and the concrete wall, a military setup bisecting the 
territory and the nation, we could know clearly who truly wants 
peace and reunification."

  To achieve this it was imperative to have the presence not

nation has made through self-reliance, rebuilding itself out of 
the ashes of war. The reports we have heard from around the 
world are that everyone is absolutely happy with the

misinformation and distortion. 
  We feel very happy and satisfied with our work. We leave

resolution of the difficulties on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Members of the 
Pyongyang-visiting group consisting of former heads of state and 
government and politicians of different countries gave their 
impressions of Korea after their 8-day visit to Korea. 
Ex-president of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio, heading the 
group, said beautiful Korea and its industrious and valiant 
people gave them great inspiration and strength. He said he 
would make sustained efforts in the future for the peace and 
reunification of the Korean peninsula. 
  Former Egyptian Prime Minister Aziz Sedky stressed all the 
functions held in Korea this time on the occasion of the 82nd 
birthday of His Excellency President Kim Il-song well showed how 
high the international position of Korea is. 
  "The Western clamour about your country's war preparations 
is 
a lie," he said, adding that the people of Korea are expediting 
peaceful construction, not war preparations. 
  Senior Vice-president of the CNN International Eason Jordan 
said he was deeply concerned for the situation on the Korean 
peninsula when he was coming to Korea, but, his feelings of 
strain and apprehensions have evaporated while witnessing the 
life of the Korean people. 
  Executive director of the summit council for World Peace 
Antonio Betancourt said he expresses deep thanks to the great 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
for the warm hospitality accorded them. The Korean people are 
well aware of wherein their life lies, he said, and added that 
their life lies only in defending the ideology of the great 
leader and the dear leader and upholding their leadership.

parliament of France and member of the European Parliament 
Pierro Ceyrac and president of the Summit Council for World 
Strategy of Japan Hirogatsu Ota, who were members of the 
Pyongyang-visiting group of former heads of state and government 
and politicians of various countries, were interviewed by KCNA 
before leaving Korea. 
  Saying he was deeply impressed during his Korea visit, 
Pierro 
Ceyrac noted: 
  "What I want to stress is that socialism of Korea is 
fundamentally different from the social systems in other 
countries. I mean that socialism of Korea is based on 
deep-rooted love between the leaders and the people, and love of 
the people for their country. Korea is the only country of this 
kind, I think. "Such unity and such patriotism of the Korean 
people strike me with admiration. As she has such unity and 
patriotism, Korea is very strong and afraid of nothing." 
  Hirogatsu Ota said he witnessed the looks of the working 
people joyfully spending the auspicious April holiday. He said: 
  "The sight of the people of whole country significantly 
celebrating the birthday of the great leader gave me the 
impression that the whole country which is one family was 
spending the holiday together with the father. In a word, Korea 
can be said to be a large harmonious family. 
  "Witnessing all this, I gained a better knowledge of the 
healthy social and moral ethos and the peaceful and harmonious 
social atmosphere of Korea."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Workers and trade 
union members in Pyongyang held a meeting at the Pyongyang 
textile machine factory on April 20 to pledge their loyalty on 
the lapse of 33 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
left undying footprints at the factory. 
  In the spring of 1961, the dear leader stayed at the 
Pyongyang textile machine factory for nearly 20 days, working 
with workers as an operator of lathe No. 26 and rousing them to 
implement the three revolutions, ideological, technical and 
cultural, and set a noble example of equipment management and 
kindled the first torch of the model machine movement. 
  The speakers at the meeting said this opened up a new 
history 
of the communistic mass movement for loving and managing 
machines in Korea. 
  For its great vitality the "loyal model machine movement for 
emulating lathe No. 26" has been rapidly expanded and developed 
in all domains and units of the national economy, gripping the 
hearts of the masses, they said. They called for glorifying the 
exploits performed by the dear leader in the management of 
equipment. 
  A resolution was adopted at the meeting.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Korean People's 
Army [KPA] is never afraid of any formidable imperialist enemy, 
confident that it will always emerge victorious as Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il is leading the revolutionary 
Armed Forces with his outstanding intelligence and ever- 
victorious commandership and the whole Army is filled with 
loyalty to the party and the leader. 
  The People's Army does not waver at all although the 
imperialists and reactionaries are trying their hardest to 
stifle the DPRK and destroy the Korean-style socialist system. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this in an article headlined "Our 
People's Army is Invincible Revolutionary Armed Forces 
Unfailingly Loyal to Comrade Supreme Commander". 
  The article goes on: 
  It is a great honour and pride of the Korean people that 
they 
have the invincible revolutionary Armed Forces the whole of 
which is pervaded by intense loyalty to respected comrade 
supreme commander and whose entire officers and men are fighting 
vigorously, firmly rallied around comrade supreme commander. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said: 
  "It is a greatest honour and pride of our party to have the 
People's Army that resolutely defends the party and the leader 
and implements to the end the party's orders and instructions at 
whatever cost". 
  The invincible might of the KPA lies in that the whole Army 
has the unshakable faith and will to become a gun and bomb 
decisively defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and 
a revolutionary Army trait of implementing his orders and 
instructions to the end even by going through thick and thin 
without hesitation has been thoroughly established in the whole 
Army. 
  All men of the KPA from generals to soldiers become a fort 
and shield to defend respected comrade supreme commander. 
  The officers and men of the People's Army are now taking to 
their hearts the motto of loyalty "We serve comrade supreme 
commander!". 
  The KPA does not know the slightest deviation or vacillation 
in upholding the leadership of Supreme Commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with loyalty and is resolute and valiant like an angry 
lion in defending the authority of its leader. 
  The pledge of faith made by Pak Yong-chol and his seven 
brothers to become eight rifles and eight bombs decisively 
defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and the 
resolve of the seven brothers and sisters of Yi Chang-ung to be 
genuine revolutionaries like Yi In-mo defending General Kim 
Chong-il with rifles in the van eloquently show how warm and 
resolute the faith of the officers and men of the KPA in 
upholding the leader is. 
  The revolutionary Army moral of the KPA represents the 
spirit 
of soldiers to unconditionally carry out the orders and 
instructions of Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il even by 
dedicating their bodies as human bullets. 
  Proud looks of the KPA lie in the unity in one ideology and 
will and the oneness of action whereby the entire Army moves as 
one on orders from Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and 
the well-regulated order of action in which it follows his 
orders and instructions even if the sky sank to the ground and 
the ground collapsed. 
  The KPA's revolutionary moral is being displayed to the full 
not only in performing military duties but also in upholding the 
grand plan of socialist construction and guidance of comrade 
supreme commander. 
  The invincible might of the KPA also lies in the beautiful 
tradition of Army-civilian unity highly displayed among the 
entire officers and men who take a warm care of and love the 
people and unhesitatingly lay down their lives for them. 
  All the officers and men of the KPA are devoting their all 
to 
crystallizing the idea of Army-civilian unity set forth by 
Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and are becoming an 
integrated whole with the people. 
  Holding in high esteem Supreme Commander General Kim 
Chong-il 
and upholding his leadership with loyalty is an inseparable 
noble ideological and moral trait of the officers and men of the 
People's Army, a revolutionary trait prevailing in the whole 
Army. 
  As they have invincible ranks, the heroic Korean People's 
Army capable of defeating any formidable enemy, the Korean 
people are always confident and convinced that they can 
accomplish the socialist cause of chuche.

  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il takes a warm care of

  Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a centennial birthday table to her

  Born into a poor peasant family in April 1894, she could 
enjoy a worthy life only after the people became masters of the 
country. 
  She expressed deep thanks to the dear leader, saying poor 
people had to die when they fell ill, feeling bitter against the 
society, during the colonial rule of the aapanese 
imperialists, but after the liberation of the country old 
people enjoy a long life in good health without paying even a 
penny benefitting by the health policy of the Workers' Party of 
Korea.

<F P=106> ["Work Indicating Way of Rearing Chuche-type </F>
Revolutionaries" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
observes the 20th anniversary of the publication of the famous 
work "Let Us Cherish Loyalty to the Party and the Leader as Our 
Revolutionary Faith and Obligation" by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il. 
  In the work published on April 20, 1974, Comrade Kim 
Chong-il 
emphasized the need to invigorate the efforts for establishing 
the monolithic ideological system of the party in keeping with 
the developing reality in which the whole society was being 
modelled on the chuche idea. He said what was essential in this 
was to rear the officials, party members and working people to 
be chuche-type revolutionaries unfailingly loyal to the party 
and the leader. 
  The work gives a comprehensive exposition of the reason why 
loyalty to the party and the leader is the main trait of the 
chuche-type revolutionaries, the basic characteristics of 
loyalty to the party and the leader, concrete tasks and ways of 
cherishing it as the revolutionary faith and obligation and all 
other theoretical and practical matters arising in rearing 
revolutionaries of chuche type. 
  In a by-lined article titled "Immortal Work Guiding People 
To 
Cherish Loyalty to the Leader as Their Faith and Obligation" the 
paper says: 
  The work serves as a revolutionary textbook of our people in 
struggle and life because it fully reflects the noble aspiration 
and demand of the chuche-type revolutionaries to absolutely 
trust and follow the party and the leader. 
  It is the main point of the work that only those who cherish 
loyalty to the party and the leader as their revolutionary faith 
and obligation can remain infinitely faithful to them through 
generations in any adversities. 
  The validity and vitality of the idea expounded by the work 
have been clearly proved through our revolutionary practice over 
the past two decades. 
  Today our people are staunchly advancing along the road of 
socialism indicated by the leader, regarding loyalty to the 
party and the leader as their life and blood. Their loyalty to 
the party and the leader is underlined by their faith, 
conscience, morality and everyday life. It is also their purest 
ideological feelings and something undisputable which remains 
unchanged in any circumstances. There is no such a people in the 
world as the Korean people, who remain loyal to the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and the illustrious leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with their faith and obligation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Coal mines of Korea 
are effecting innovations in production. 
  The Sunchon District coal mining complex has produced 
100,000 
more tons of coal in the first three or so months of this year 
than in the like period last year, and is overfulfilling its 
daily production quotas, having set itself a goal of carrying 
out its assignments for this month ahead of the set time. 
  The Tokchon District coal mining complex has increased the 
tunnelling speed 1.3 times as against the same period of the 
previous month and is putting out more coal than planned by 
actively introducing new technical innovation proposals. 
  The Pukchang District coal mining complex is effecting 
innovations in tunnelling and coal production by securing 
several thousand cubic metres of wooden props and more blasting 
materials by its own efforts. 
  Coal mines under the Kaechon District coal mining complex 
including Namjon, Pongchon and Choyang coal mines are producing 
more coal by scrupulously organising and commanding production.

  [Text] Paris, April 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea sent a 
message to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 
Wednesday [20 April] proposing that IAEA inspectors witness the 
upcoming change of fuel bars at their 5-megawatt atomic reactor 
in Yonbyon. 
  The message said the fuel bars of the atomic reactor would 
be 
changed in a few weeks. 
  Sources in Vienna said the proposal was North Korea's first 
response toward the demand by the world community for additional 
international inspections of their nuclear facilities. 
  In the message, North Korea did not say whether they would 
accept additional inspections of six other nuclear facilities. 
  North Korea claims that the atomic reactor has been in 
operation since 1986 and that they never changed its fuel bars 
after 1989 when some fuel bars were changed due to a mechanical 
trouble, during which they said they extracted 90 grams of 
plutonium on an experimental basis. 
  A YONHAP report from Berlin said IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer 
confirmed that a contact of some sort was going on with North 
Korea. 
  He said that IAEA Director-General Hans Blix would decide 
whether to accept the North Korean proposal probably Thursday 
afternoon. 
  The IAEA had an emergency meeting Thursday morning to review 
the North Korean overture, the report said.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sum from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] With North Korea's positive reaction to the 
resumption of inspections, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] is having contacts with North Korea to smooth the 
way for inspections of North Korea, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer 
disclosed on 21 April. 
  The spokesman, however, declined to disclose whether the 
North side's letter hinting of the resumption of inspections 
implies additional overall inspections [chuga chonmyon sachal] 
of the radiochemical laboratory or the replacement of the 
surveillance equipment -- as has been insisted by North Korea. 
  The IAEA is closely examining to what level North Korea 
would accept inspections and the real intention behind its hint 
of resumption of inspections. 
  The IAEA, while delivering the resolution adopted at the 
special Governors meeting held last March, had strongly called 
on the North side to accept additional inspections of the 
radiochemical laboratory and stressed the necessity of replacing 
the surveillance equipment, including the reloading of film in 
surveillance cameras.

  [Text] North Korea stressed that in preparation for 
economic sanctions against the North as a result of its refusal 
of nuclear inspections, it will strengthen independence in its 
economy so that its economy can be self-reliant in the future 
under any situation. 
  In yesterday's special article [nonsol], North Korean 
Central

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea will soon 
have access to enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear 
bombs once it removes spent fuel from one of its nuclear 
reactors, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Thursday. 
  The communist country will have to remove fuel from its 
5-megawatt reactor "within weeks," Perry said at a news 
conference here. "The fuel will provide sufficient plutonium to 
make four to five nuclear bombs." 
  "We believe it's critical that this operation is supervised 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he said. 
  Emphasizing that Patriot missiles are purely a defensive 
system against conventional weapons, Perry made clear the 
anti-missile missiles will not be withdrawn from South Korea 
even if the tension over North Korea's nuclear program subsides. 
  The IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, first estimated that 
North 
Korea would have to change the nuclear fuel rods at its reactor 
last summer. 
  It is believed that North Korea has yet to change the rods, 
and the IAEA says it must be present when the procedure takes 
place to verify whether the Stalinist state extracted more 
plutonium from the fuel than it reported to the agency in the 
past. 
  While Pyongyang's secretive nature rules out an exact 
assessment of its nuclear status, Washington can say "with 
confidence" that "North Korea has a major nuclear weapons 
program under way," Perry said when asked to comment on how 
advanced the program is. 
  Pyongyang has the 25-megawatt reactor, a 200-megawatt 
reactor 
under construction, a radiochemical laboratory and a 
high-explosives testing facility, according to the secretary. 
  "The only possible explanation for these facilities is a 
major nuclear weapons program," said Perry. 
  The United States can only guess how much nuclear fuel was 
diverted in the past, he said. "We estimate that there was 
enough plutonium in that fuel to make one or two bombs. We 
estimate they probably have the capability to convert that 
plutonium into bombs. We estimate they have had enough time by 
now to succeed in doing that." 
  Perry flew into Seoul Tuesday for a visit centering on 
analyzing, planning and preparing for future developments 
following North Korea's refusal to allow full IAEA inspections 
last month. 
  Just a day earlier, Perry and his South Korean counterpart 
Yi 
Pyong-tae announced they would go ahead with the annual "Team 
Spirit" military exercise in November unless the inspections 
were concluded successfully. 
  Calling the joint maneuvers a defensive exercise, Perry said 
the two countries still hope that diplomatic persuasion can 
bring North Korea to comply with the inspections. 
  "We plan to pursue diplomacy firmly and patiently unless 
there is no hope for success in diplomacy anymore," he said. "If 
that happens, we go together to the UN to impose sanctions on 
North Korea." 
  Perry also defended the Patriot deployment, describing the 
system as purely defensive which "has no offensive capability at 
all." 
  "... It is part of a regular modernization program that has 
been planned actually for several years, and there is no reason 
to withdraw," he said. 
  "It's not here because of the nuclear weapons program. It is 
designed to defend against conventional Scud attacks."

  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who is visiting our 
country, held a new conference at Hotel Shilla this morning and 
said that the U.S. commitment to security in the ROK remains 
firm, and stressed that the war risk on the Korean peninsula is 
not so high as the general public fears. 
  Here is reporter Pak Chan-uk on the telephone in front of 
Hotel Shilla: 
  [Pak] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said at a news conference 
which just ended a while ago that although political tension is 
rising on the Korean peninsula, there is no military tension. 
Secretary Perry also stressed that the U.S. commitment to the 
defense of the ROK remains firm and that the United States would 
never make a mistake of provoking or igniting a war on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  As announced by the ROK Defense Ministry on 20 April, 
Secretary Perry said the ROK and the United States agreed to 
conduct the Team Spirit exercise in November and continue to 
make related plans and preparations for the exercise. 
  Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, Secretary Perry 
stressed that it is certain that North Korea is pursuing the 
development of nuclear weapons but that the basic stance of the 
ROK and the United States is that the issue should be resolved 
through diplomatic and peaceful efforts. 
  Secretary Perry said an emergency communications network 
between the defense ministers of the ROK and the United States 
will be installed for close coordination on preparations against 
any tension or military threat on the Korean peninsula. 
  Secretary Perry said he invited ROK Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae to visit the United States in the near future to 
discuss ROK-U.S. cooperation once again. 
  After the news conference, Secretary Perry will visit ROK 
and 
U.S. Army units to check the military readiness posture. He is 
scheduled to leave for Japan at 5 PM [8:00 GMT] today.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 21 April 
reacting to the decision to resume the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "North Korea Should Understand the 
Significance of the Decision on Team Spirit." Asserting that 
the most effective means to counter the North Korean nuclear 
issue is firm coordination between the ROK and the United 
States, the editorial writes military cooperation between the 
two countries is imperative in the current situation. 
  The editorial welcomes the decision of ROK and U.S. defense 
ministers to strengthen combined war preparedness writing that 
it is a very timely tuning of strategy as suspicions surrounding 
North Korea's nuclear development have not been cleared. 
  Defining the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise as an 
"inevitable decision," the editorial stresses that "such a 
security coordination system should remain firm until it is 
confirmed that North Korea has no nuclear weapons," and that 
"North Korea should stop trying to avoid nuclear inspections 
with various excuses." 
  The editorial shows concern over foreign reports that the 
United States asked the ROK to be armed with modern weapons as 
the selection of weapons should be decided by the ROK, not the 
United States. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Reinforcement of Defense Posture is 
Fundamental." 
  The editorial welcomes the decision of the ROK and U.S. 
defense ministers to resume the Team Spirit exercise and to 
reinforce the combined forces saying that it was a "natural," 
"inevitable," and "appropriate" decision. 
  Regarding the issue of purchasing more modern arms, the 
editorial writes the decision should be made according to ROK's 
conditions and abilities, adding that the Yulgok project may be 
adjusted but should not be influenced by the U.S. defense 
industry's demands. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Unlimited Armament Competition Is 
Not Appropriate." 
  Consenting to the theory that military superiority deters 
war, the editorial writes, however, making the Korean peninsula 
an unlimited exhibition place of modern arms cannot be tolerated. 
  Noting the remarks of Edward Warner, U.S. assistant 
secretary 
of defense, that modern heavy arms will be deployed to the ROK 
by the end of the summer, the editorial writes the United States 
is trying to deploy another new weapon after safely deploying 
Patriot missiles as a result of the "sea of fire" remarks by 
North Korea. 
  The editorial writes the current situation cannot be 
described as a crisis, citing Kim Il-song's recent appeasement 
remarks and the fact that South Koreans were not threatened by 
the "sea of fire" remarks. The editorial notes that it is the 
United States that more frequently talks about the possibility 
of war on the Korean peninsula. 
  The editorial concludes by warning that "excessive 
deployment 
of modern arms might stimulate North Korea's desire to develop 
nuclear weapons to overcome the gap in military capacity in a 
single blow."

  [Text] Korea is threatened with trade retaliations from 
the United States over its decision to destroy sausage imported 
from there in February. 
  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries and the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday, the 
U.S. Meat Industry Trade Policy Council has recently filed a 
formal complaint with the U.S. Trade Representative calling for 
trade retaliations for Korea in connection with the sausage 
controversy. 
  EPB officials said the USTR will likely launch a full-scale 
probe into what American officials said are Korea's unfair trade 
practices. 
  Trade officials here expressed concern that the sausage 
issue 
may develop into a fresh trade dispute between Korea and the 
United States at a time when their bilateral trade relationship 
is liable to turn sour as a result of its growing 
dissatisfaction with Korea's closed automobile market. 
  If the USTR reaches a conclusion that Korea's action was 
unfair, it can take retaliatory action against Korea under the 
"Super 301" section reinstated last month. 
  The newest trade issue was prompted by Korea's Ministry of 
Health and Social Affairs, which ordered a halt to customs 
clearance of American sausage with the illegally-extended term 
of validity in early February this year. 
  The ministry also ordered 24 importers of American sausage, 
mostly chicken and turkey franks, to retrieve the 
already-marketed products from distribution outlets. 
  The ministry insisted that the American products had been 
heated and refrigerated and therefore they should be allowed 
only 30 days to be sold. 
  Under Korea's food sanitation rules, frozen sausage has an 
expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas 
heated and refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days. 
  But American meat processing firms as well as local 
importers 
reacted strongly to the ministry's decision, saying it is the 
Korean government's "arbitrary" application of their rules. 
  About 4,800 tons of American sausage worth 25 million 
dollars 
had been shipped in since 1990, having been allowed an 
expiration date of 90 days, before the ministry's February 
decision, which put on hold some one billion won worth of 
sausage at the port of Pusan. 
  EPB officials said the U.S. looks particularly unhappy with 
the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs' sudden change in its 
application of rules without prior notice. 
  They said some USTR working-level officials have already 
visited Korea to lodge a formal protest, expressing concern that 
the incident may aggravate already-worsened trade relations with 
the U.S.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
reportedly planning to enter a court dispute between Korean and 
American corporations over patent violation by presenting a 
brief of amicus curiae at the U.S. federal court to defend the 
rights of the Korean company. 
  When the Iljin Group files an appeal early next month 
against 
a ruling in favor of General Electric Co. by the federal court 
of Boston last January and its order of a seven-year halt to 
production of synthetic diamonds as well as immediate disposal 
of manufacturing equipment, the Foreign Ministry will attach a 
brief of amicus curiae, a ministry official said Thursday. 
  The case will be the first time that the government has gone 
all the way for a local firm in a foreign court. 
  "We hired a local lawyer to examine the U.S. federal court 
decision and decided to act against the parts we find 
unreasonable by explaining our side through a brief of amicus 
curiae," the official said. 
  A brief of amicus curiae is a form of legal advice given by 
a 
third party, such as the government or an economic body, 
advocating the rights of the concerned company from their 
country in its appeal in an international court dispute. 
  In its brief, the government will state that Iljin's 
technology was developed in a joint state project with the Korea 
Institute of Science and Technology and the Seoul National 
University Institute, and that the order to destroy even the 
manufacturing equipment is unjust. 
  Amicus curiae is relatively unknown in Korea, but its legal 
efficacy has frequently produced success in Japan, Switzerland, 
the Netherlands and Britain, the official said. 
  He added that the ministry will work on various measures to 
protect the rights of Korean companies advancing overseas in an 
era of heated trade competition. 
  The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) will send a 
separate letter to GE's chairman asking the company to relent in 
its suit against Iljin.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Full-fledged 
negotiations are under way with Moscow on bringing to South 
Korea those North Koreans who are roaming about Russia after 
having escaped from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, but 
the talks may have hit rough going. Repatriation is likely to 
occur much later than Seoul first expected, as the task is more 
difficult than generally anticipated here. 
  Chongwadae [presidential office] officials say it will be 
difficult to bring the North Korean escapees into the country 
before June because the government has yet to obtain correct 
information on their whereabouts and personal histories. 
  This is a far cry from Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's 
remarks that some of the loggers could arrive this month as the 
government would complete repatriation formalities as soon as 
possible. Han made the comments upon his arrival from Russia on 
Monday. 
  But presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Wednesday, "the 
government does not yet know where these North Koreans are now 
and what they are like. So it is unlikely that they will get to 
Seoul before June, though the government is seeking to bring 
them back as soon as possible." 
  Noting that while negotiations are under way with Russia 
about when repatriation should occur, he said no timetable has 
been agreed. This indicates that repatriation could take place 
later than generally expected, depending on how the talks with 
Moscow progress. He made it clear, however, that the United 
Nations would not intercede in resettling the North Korea 
defector-loggers, saying the issue would be settled only through 
negotiations with Moscow. 
  The Foreign Ministry attributed Chu's remarks about a delay 
in repatriating the loggers to the difficulties facing the 
Korean Embassy in Moscow as it tackles the issue. 
  A ministry official said the embassy is having trouble 
determining the loggers' exact whereabouts and personal 
histories. There have been few reliable reports on them from the 
Embassy in Moscow, he added. 
  Some 90 North Korean loggers have visited the Embassy in 
Moscow and other South Korean diplomatic missions in former 
Soviet Republics to ask for refuge in South Korea, but it is 
difficult to maintain contact with them as they move from one 
hideout to another for fear of capture by North Korean agents. 
  For those granted permanent residence in Russia, it takes 
time to confirm whether they want to be repatriated to South 
Korea. In particular, those with Russian wives generally do not 
wish to come to South Korea. This being the case, working-level 
officials from the Foreign Ministry were somewhat surprised when 
Minister Han, upon arriving from Russia on Monday, told 
reporters the North Korean loggers would come as early as this 
month. 
  The government first sought to repatriate the North Korean 
loggers with the help of Russia and the U.N. high commissioner 
for refugees, but this policy has changed after Minister Han's 
Moscow visit. 
  The change was prompted by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's positive stance on the repatriation issue during his 
meeting with Han, ministry officials observed. 
  The Foreign Ministry has instructed the Embassy in Moscow to 
repatriate the loggers as soon as possible, raising speculation 
that the government is dealing with the issue in light of 
political considerations on domestic issues. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the 
Russian Government had requested, through Seoul's Embassy in 
Moscow, that the South Korean media practice self-restraint in 
reporting on the repatriation issue. The government is not 
negotiating with Beijing on repatriating North Korean defectors 
in China but is focusing on the issue of North Koreans in 
Russia, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean economic 
cooperation will be limited to tourism and joint investment in 
such export-oriented industries as textiles and footwear even 
after the ongoing nuclear dispute, the biggest hurdle to 
bilateral economic links, is solved peacefully, an Economic 
Planning Board (EPB) official said Friday. 
  Speaking at a meeting of lawmakers on the outlook for 
South-North economic cooperation, Pae Yong-sik, the deputy 
director general of the EPB's International Economic Policy 
Bureau, also said the North would likely open very limited parts 
of its territory such as the Rajin and Sonbong special economic 
district along the Tuman River in order to cut off the North 
Korean community from South Koreans. 
  Stressing the need to proceed slowly on Seoul-Pyongyang 
economic cooperation, Pae said, "a lot of things have to be 
considered for the Tuman River area development program, which 
needs more than 30 billion dollars in funding and coordination 
of the interests of concerned countries." 
  The EPB official noted that the Tuman River program should 
be 
treated as a multilateral project, not as one between Seoul and 
Pyongyang. 
  "It is desirable for the government to act as the sole agent 
for economic cooperation with the North in the initial stage to 
establish order," the official said, adding that private 
companies could later do business with the North on their own.

cooperation between the two countries. 
  During the meeting, the ROK plans to request Iran's support 
for ROK TDX companies' participation in biddings, propose a 
technical cooperation agreement, and recommend the exchange of 
information concerning policy on privatizing the 
telecommunication business. 
  Iran is considering a telecommunication network development 
project which requires a total of 3.6 million lines of switching 
facilities to be supplied from 1994 to 1996. Daewoo is 
considering participating in the international bidding for the 
TDX to be held in May.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- The average Korean used 
606 kilograms of steel last year, putting the country at No. 4 
in the world, the Korea Iron and Steel Association (KOSA) said 
Saturday. 
  Per capita steel consumption rose 14.4 percent from 1992's 
530 kg thanks to a business boom in the shipping and automobile 
industries. 
  Singapore, a major infrastructure investor, was top in per 
capita consumption with 1,260 kg, followed by Taiwan with 1,024 
kg, Japan with 676 kg and then South Korea. North Korea weighed 
in with 328 kg. 
  Korea's steel output grew to 33 million tons last year from 
1992's 28.1 million tons to elbow aside Ukraine for sixth place 
in the world rankings. 
  Japan was the No. 1 steelmaker with 99.6 million tons, 
trailed by China with 88.7 million tons, the United States with 
87.1 million tons, Russia with 58.2 million tons and Germany 
with 37.6 million tons.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Automakers rolled out 
some 552,000 motor vehicles in the first quarter, a 10.8-percent 
increase from the same period last year, Trade, Industry and 
Energy Ministry officials said Saturday. 
  In March alone 207,000 units were made, a 15.0-percent rise 
that marks the second largest monthly figure after last December. 
  Of all, cars produced in the three months totaled 161,000, 
up 
12.9 percent, and commercial vehicles reached 46,000, up 22.8 
percent. The sharp gain in the commercial vehicle production 
was largely helped by a recovery in construction activity, 
officials said. 
  Domestically 354,000 automobiles were sold, a rather 
moderate 
7.2-percent increase, indicating that the economy, which 
previously showed signs of overheating, started to stabilize. 
  In the period, a record 161,000 automobiles were exported, 
up 
18.1 percent, thanks to the yen's continued strength and strong 
sales in the U.S. market. 
  Of the exports, cars numbered 143,000, up 11.9 percent, and 
commercial autos 18,000, up 110.5 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Home Affairs Minister 
Choe Hyong-u volunteered Saturday to clarify the background on 
the appointment of Pak Chung-pae, director-general of the 
Ministry's local administration bureau, as governor of South 
Chungchong Province. 
  Choe told a press conference that Pak was appointed after 
three opinion polls were conducted of provincial government 
officials and "young people," most of whom supported Pak. 
  "Pak, who is only a second grade government official, was 
selected as we believe that it is only right to appoint the 
governor the local people want," Choe said. 
  Some eyebrows were raised over Pak's appointment because of 
his rank. He replaces Pak Tae-kwon, one of President Kim 
Yong-sam's close associates, who resigned amid charges of 
illegal electioneering before the legal campaign period started. 
  "The new governor is a South Chungchong man who was born 
there and worked as a local government official for more than 20 
years," Choe said. "He is second to none in his qualifications 
and ability." 
  Pak lagged behind in receiving a promotion because he had 
"no 
background (supporters)," Choe said, praising President Kim for 
selecting an able man for the post. 
  The government will continue to appoint low-ranking 
officials 
to high positions if they have the ability, Choe said. 
  Meanwhile, for the first time in administrative history, the 
government has named a woman mayor and chief of a city ward (ku). 
  Mrs. Chon Chae-hui, director-general of the Labor Ministry's 
vocational training bureau was appointed mayor of Kwanmyong 
city, Kyonggi Province. Mrs. Yi Hyon-hui, director-general of 
the Taegu city government's welfare bureau, was named chief of 
Taegu's South ward.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia is prepared to import 
10,000 tons of high-quality rice from the U.S. under the GSM 
[expansion unknown]-102 credit guarantee program, Minister of 
Food Ibrahim Hasan says. 
  Ibrahim told a meeting of editors and reporters here 
yesterday that the imported rice, due to its fine quality, would 
not threaten local rice producers. 
  "This has been approved by President Suharto and a 
memorandum 
of understanding will soon be signed between the governments of 
the two countries," Ibrahim said. 
  He said the imported rice would likely only be sold at 
top-rated restaurants and hotels and wouldn't prevent 
Indonesians from continuing to consume the inferior 
locally-produced rice. 
  Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
Indonesia is actually required to import as much as three 
percent of its domestic consumption of some 20 million tons of 
rice. 
  He said the world market supply was only about 12 million 
tons of rice or about four percent of the world output, while 
Indonesia's domestic rice production reached 25 million tons a 
year. 
  "The world rice market is dominated by the U.S., Vietnam, 
and 
Thailand who supply 60 to 70 percent of the world market," 
Ibrahim said. 
  He, therefore, saw the plan to buy 10,000 tons of rice from 
the U.S. as an effective way of meeting GATT rules. 
  Ibrahim said the GSM-10 will guarantee U.S. $200 million in 
loans for U.S. agricultural exports to Indonesia such as rice, 
soybeans, cotton, and meat. "The loans will mature within three 
years and the interest will not exceed 3 percent," he said. 
  "We are also proposing to import about 75,000 tons of 
soybeans," he said. 
  Ibrahim added that the imports would also benefit Indonesia 
in terms of soft-loan financing.

  [Text] Vienna, April 20 KYODO -- North Korea has replied 
positively to an IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
request for inspections of a nuclear facility that Pyongyang 
barred the agency from checking last month, an agency spokesman 
said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  The spokesman said the Vienna-based International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) received a positive response from North 
Korea to the U.N. request and that the agency will decide how to 
deal with the issue within a few days. 
  The North appears to have agreed to inspections on a part of 
the key atomic site with certain conditions, instead of full 
inspection as the IAEA has demanded, diplomatic sources said. 
  The IAEA sent a letter to the North on April 8 urging 
Pyongyang to allow the agency to make additional inspections at 
the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, north of the capital. 
  The IAEA also asked North Korea to allow the agency to 
change 
film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed at all the 
declared nuclear facilities. 
  IAEA inspectors went to North Korea in early March but were 
denied access to the radiochemical laboratory. The agency said 
the tests it wanted to carry out at the laboratory were 
necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
materials. 
  The agency on March 22 referred the matter to the U.N. 
Security Council, which issued a presidential statement March 31 
urging the North to allow the IAEA to complete the inspections. 
  North Korea has denied it is developing a nuclear arsenal 
and 
warned a war could break out on the Korean peninsula if it was 
pressed too hard on the matter.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Committee of 
Korean Veterans in Moscow on April 7 sent letters to the United 
Nations Security Council and the U.S. President concerning the 
tensions on the Korean peninsula growing due to the anti-DPRK 
nuclear racket of the United States and its followers. 
  The letter to the UN Security Council said that the 
situation 
on the Korean peninsula has reached a brink of war owing to the 
moves of the reactionary forces of the United States, Japan and 
South Korea. This poses a threat to peace in northeast Asia and 
the rest of the world, it added. 
  It appealed to the UN Security Council to cooly and 
prudently 
assess the situation created around the Korean peninsula and 
exert its utmost efforts to solve the nuclear issue in this 
region in a peaceful way. 
  It demanded that the United Nations take the stand of 
impartiality and rectify its policy toward the DPRK. 
  The letter to the U.S. President said if the U.S. President 
really intends to call upon the governments of all countries to 
observe human rights and democracy, humanitarianism and moral 
freedom, he should immediately take practical and necessary 
measures and decisions to prevent the aggravation of the tense 
situation surrounding the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, give up 
the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, 
stop the maneuvers of U.S. aircraft carriers and warships and 
cancel the deployment of Patriot missiles.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Foreign political 
parties and public organisations urged the United States to 
immediately stop all its hostile acts against the DPRK. 
  A resolution on invigorating the movement for solidarity 
with 
the Korean people was adopted at the 14th plenary meeting of the 
Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party (Red 
Motherland). The resolution said the North of the Korean 
peninsula has no nuclear issue in actuality and that the 
"nuclear issue" was intentionally invented by the United States 
to divert elsewhere public attention from their nuclear weapons 
deployed in South Korea. 
  It urged the United States to immediately stop the bellicose 
acts and the campaign over "nuclear threat from the North." 
  The Arab Islamic Democratic Movement and the 
Islamic-Christian United Action Front in a letter to the U.S. 
President criticized the U.S. for reversing the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and 
held that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be 
settled through DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The group for the study of the chuche idea of President Kim 
Il-song in Austria in a statement strongly demanded that the 
United States give up the scheme to resume the Team Spirit joint 
military exercises and the deployment of Patriot in South Korea 
and immediately stop all its hostile acts against the DPRK. 
  The Congolese committee to support the proposal for founding 
the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo in an appeal to the 
peaceloving people of the world called on them to heighten 
vigilance against the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States 
and denounce it.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of 
Korean youth and students in Japan was held at the Shiba Park in 
Tokyo on April 19 to denounce the nuclear war provocation moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and 
pave the way of peace of the country and its reunification on 
the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the April 19 popular 
uprising in South Korea. 
  Present were So Man-sul, vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), and some 2,000 Korean youths and 
students. 
  Pak Ku-ho, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the 
League of Korean Youth in Japan, said in his report that the 
April 19 popular uprising was a historical resistance which 
demonstrated the indomitable fighting spirit of South Korean 
youth, students and people who rose up for an independent and 
national reunified country without flunkeyist traitors. 
  "The noble desire of the April 19 martyrs, youth and 
students 
and people has been ruthlessly trampled upon owing to the crimes 
of the U.S. imperialists and the flunkeyist traitor Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique", he said, and evinced their resolve to make every 
possible effort for the convocation of a national conference 
proposed by the joint meeting of the government, political 
parties and public organisations of the DPRK on April 11. 
  Representatives of youth and Japanese friends made speeches. 
  At the end of the meeting, the participants staged a 
demonstration.

  [Text] New york, April 20 (YONHAP) -- An official at the 
North Korean mission to the United Nations reiterated Tuesday 
that Pyongyang will not permit further inspections of its 
nuclear sites before a third round of Washington-Pyongyang 
high-level talks is held. 
  "We received all the inspections needed to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards that have been agreed with the United 
States," said the North Korean official. "We are willing to 
discuss the issue of additional, regular and special inspections 
of our nuclear facilities and Pyongyang's return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) once the third-round talks are 
held." 
  Asked about the possibility of resuming working-level 
meetings for further high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang, the official said that "it is not clear for now at 
least. The important thing is that the United States suspend 
Team Spirit (the annual South Korea-U.S. joint military 
exercise) as Washington agreed Feb. 25 and hold the third round 
of talks."

  [Text] In his speech in Tokyo on 21 April, Koichiro 
Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs until 
recently, commented on the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister 
and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor on 15 April. He said, "Although prospects 
remain uncertain for resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, the minutes of the meeting show that at various points in 
his remarks, Mr. Kantor showed his willingness to work for 
setting the framework talks in order." He thus indicated that 
there has been a change in the U.S. position. 
  With regard to the resumption of the talks, he said, "Both 
Japan and the United States have to come up with ideas on how to 
formulate the objective criteria. They should narrow their gap 
through behind-the-scenes contacts." He stressed the need to 
come up with points of compromise through unofficial discussions. 
  On the issue of reducing Japan's current accounts surplus, 
Matsuura reiterated that "Japan should not set a numerical 
target." He pointed out that "what is important is to adopt 
policies which will produce actual results in reducing the 
surplus in each quarter of the year." 
  As to the microeconomic sectors, he said, "If possible, 
measures, even in the financial services and other non-priority 
sectors, should be compiled before July."

  [Text] A nationwide poll conducted by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 
16 and 17 April revealed that 70 percent of the people feel 
uneasy about North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. 
The number of respondents who answered that they would 
"support" Japan's decision to cooperate with the United Nations 
in imposing sanctions against North Korea if it continues to 
reject nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), and if the United Nations decides to take some 
kind of sanction, totaled 60 percent. 
  How to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear 
arms development has become the most important task confronting 
Japan. It is also a focal point of policy discussions among the 
ruling coalition parties. However, the poll indicated that the 
people are highly interested in this issue, and many of them are 
of the view that the international community, with the United 
Nations as the central figure, should take a decisive stand 
against North Korea. 
  As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development, the total of respondents who answered they were 
"very much interested" or "somewhat interested" reached 70 
percent, exceeding by far the 27 percent who answered they were 
"not so much" or "completely not" interested. 
  As for apprehension about suspected nuclear arms 
development, 
as many as 71 percent of those surveyed answered they "feel it," 
and only 23 percent said they "do not feel it." As regards the 
question of whether Japan should cooperate with the United 
Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea, 60 percent 
said they would "support" and 24 percent said they would "not 
support" the government's decision to cooperate. 
  It seems the people are highly interested in and feel 
apprehensive about the issue due to the fact that, in addition 
to Japanese disapproval of and precautions against nuclear 
weapons, North Korea has developed missiles which can strike 
most parts of Japan. 
  Asked why they supported Japan's cooperation in imposing UN 
sanctions, 42 percent--the highest rate--said that North Korea's 
nuclear development is a "threat to Japan's security." This was 
followed by 31 percent who said North Korean nuclear arms 
development "runs counter to international trends, including 
reductions of nuclear weapons" and by 14 percent who said "North 
Korean is ignoring UN agreements."

  [Text] While political parties have been engaged in the 
final coordination of selecting a successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a 
nationwide opinion poll on 16-17 April to sound out the trend of 
public support for "Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata" and the 
people's view on various issues, including Hosokawa's 
resignation announcement. A majority of the respondents 
indicated support for "Prime Minister Hata." For example, 61 
percent said they would "support" Hata if he becomes the next 
premier, while only 21 percent said they would "not support" 
him. As for Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60 percent of 
the respondents said "he is irresponsible"; this number exceeded 
the proportion of those who said "he acted with good grace in 
announcing his intention to step down." These results indicate 
the people's strong criticism of Hosokawa for suddenly giving up 
the administration. At the same time, 57 percent of the 
respondents said they "wanted Hosokawa to remain in power." 
This number exceeded by 20 points the 37 percent of respondents 
who said "there was a good reason for him to step down," 
indicating Hosokawa is still popular among people. In addition, 
65 percent spoke highly of the achievements made by the Hosokawa 
administration during the past eight months. 
  The 61 percent support rate for Hata is high, exceeding the 
nonsupport rate by 40 points. We cannot compare it with the 
support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet because the figure is not 
an actual support rate for a Hata cabinet. However, it is 
higher than the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet (55.1 
percent) in the survey conducted last March. Thus, the poll 
revealed the strong hopes the people place on "Prime Minister 
Hata." 
  Moreover, regarding the question of "who is the most 
appropriate person to be the next prime minister?" Hata ranked 
highest with a 37-percent approval rating. This compared with 
12 percent for former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who was regarded as a 
probable candidate at the time of the poll. These ratings are 
followed by 7 percent for former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu 
and 4 percent each for Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, LDP Policy Research Council Chairman Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, and LDP President Yohei Kono. 
  As for the most desirable composition of the next 
government, 
respondents answered as follow: 1) an administration composed 
of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, the Japan New 
Party, and a portion of the LDP (28 percent of the respondents); 
2) the same administration led by the current coalition, 
excluding the LDP and the Japan Communist Party (21 percent); 
3) an administration composed of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan, the Democratic Socialist Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and 
a portion of the LDP (15 percent); and 4) an administration 
composed mainly of the LDP (14 percent). 
  In response to Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60 
percent said "it was irresponsible" while 35 percent said "he 
acted with good grace." 
  Regarding accomplishments made during the past eight months 
of the Hosokawa administration, 65 percent of the respondents 
said "it can be highly evaluated" while 31 percent said "it 
cannot." As specific achievements to be noted, 37 percent said 
"the Hosokawa government put an end to the LDP one-party 
administration"; 34 percent cited "it raised people's political 
consciousness"; and another 34 percent said "it enacted 
political reform-related bills." 
  On the other hand, the poll also revealed the people's 
negative attitude towards the Hosokawa administration. 
Criticism was mostly centered on Hosokawa's lack of decisive 
policies and power struggles within the administration. For 
example, 35 percent of the respondents said "Hosokawa often 
retracted his decisions on important issues"; 33 percent noted 
"Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa had too much influence upon the 
administration"; and 32 percent said "there were too many 
discords and conflicts within the administration."

  [Text] It was disclosed on 19 April that 17 lower and 
upper house lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], including Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and former Chairman 
Makoto Tanabe, attended North Korean President Kim Il-song's 
birthday celebration held on 13 April at the Chosensoren 
[General Assembly of Korean Residents in Japan] Central Hall in 
Tokyo. 
  According to several concerned people, those who attended 
the 
birthday celebration were Masako Goto, first secretary to lower 
house Speaker Takako Doi; SDPJ Chairman Murayama; former SDPJ 
Chairman Tanabe; Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Policy 
Committee; Akihiro Ohata; Kenji Taguchi; Yuzuru Shimazaki; 
Ichiro Hino; Issei Inoue; Tatsukuni Komori; Hajime Fukata; 
Tatsuo Yoshida; Eiko Mieno; Hisato Kishimoto; Atsushi Kameyama; 
Yutaka Shitoma; and Sumiko Shimizu. 
  Reportedly, Goto attended on behalf of Doi because she had 
an 
appointment with a top foreign leader. About 300 senior 
executives of the major mass media--except for SANKEI 
SHIMBUN--attended the celebration. It is said that after a 
speech by the organizer, the attendants increased exchanges 
[koryu o fukameta] while standing around the food tables. 
  President Kim Il-song's birthday celebration is an annual 
event held prior to the actual day of his birth; many SDPJ 
lawmakers attended. However, it seems likely the UNSC will 
adopt a resolution designed to impose economic sanctions against 
North Korea over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development. Therefore, the U.S. Government is pressing Japan 
to cooperate in imposing sanctions. Moreover, the international 
community is criticizing Japan regarding the issue of remitting 
money to North Korea, saying it deviates from the trend of the 
international situation. 
  Meanwhile, North Korean issues are becoming a focal point at 
the ruling coalition parties' policy meetings for the formation 
of a post-Hosokawa administration. Therefore, it is expected 
that having many SDPJ lawmakers attend the celebration will 
create a stir in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa; first in a series of articles </F>
entitled "Building of the New SDF Following the End of the Cold 
War"; this article is entitled "Secret Plan To Reduce SDF"] 
  [Text] How will the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] change while 
the world is moving toward disarmament? At an SDF reviewing 
ceremony last fall, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa declared 
that "Japan will take the initiative in disarmament." Under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the 
government is promoting the process of reviewing the "National 
Defense Program Outline." Although there are some unstable 
factors in Japan's neighboring countries, including the DPRK, 
which is faced with the issue of nuclear inspections, the fact 
that the cold war has ended following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union has significant importance. The "final battle," on which 
is staked the survival of SDF organizations, has begun. 
  Seiki Nishihiro, adviser to the Defense Agency [DA], frankly 
said: "Although it did not have enough members, the SDF was 
trying to make it look as if there were enough members. The SDF 
was like a paper tiger." He also said: "Because it had 
responsibilities as a member of the West, Japan so far has been 
trying to do things that were beyond its capabilities. Now that 
the cold war is over, we should have weapons that we can afford 
to have. How about reducing the number of Ground Self-Defense 
Force [GSDF] divisions from 13 to about five?" 
  Nishihiro is an influential member of the "Panel for Defense 
Issues," which is an advisory organ to Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
Its task is to review the National Defense Program Outline. 
Nishihiro was chief of the Defense Planning Division of the 
Defense Agency's Bureau of Defense Policy 18 years ago when the 
outline was prepared. After that, he acted as a leader of the 
team that prepared the current midterm defense buildup plan. 
Although he was deeply involved in mapping out the defense 
buildup plan, Nishihiro now advocates a plan to reduce the size 
of the SDF. 
  Looking back at when the midterm defense buildup plan was 
prepared, General Yusuke Matsushima, commanding general of the 
Middle Army, said: "Nishihiro has not changed. It has been his 
cherished wish to reduce the size of the SDF." Matsushima, who 
is called "the soldier of soldiers in terms of his ideology, and 
his looks as well" and the "bravest general" in the GSDF, was 
GSDF chief of staff. He had heated arguments with then Vice 
Minister of Defense Nishihiro, who called for a scaling down of 
the GSDF. 
  Gen. Matsushima said: "Only 10,000 service members are 
available in case of an emergency, and none of them can be 
dispatched outside of Tokyo. We could protect up to the Tsugaru 
peninsula if we had 100,000 men. If we reduce the number of SDF 
members, then we will be able to have a national defense 
commensurate with its size. I repeatedly advised Nishihiro to 
hold a Diet debate on this issue to see if the people will 
accept it." 
  The dispute between Nishihiro and Gen. Matsushima indicates 
the difference of opinions between the DA and the GSDF Staff 
Office. DA officials have different opinions over the issue of 
reviewing the outline of the current defense buildup plan, too. 
As a group of bureaucrats, the DA is sensitive to the prime 
minister's intentions. However, SDF uniformed officers, who 
normally base their thinking on military rationality, are 
opposed to the idea of reducing the size of the SDF, and such an 
idea is preceded by a general mood favoring a reduction. 
  Gen. Matsushima even advocated expanding the size of the 
GSDF, saying: "Properly speaking, the size of the SDF should be 
determined taking into account what is the actual threat to the 
nation. Even if it is determined simply by being compared to 
the national population, the current size of the GSDF is still 
too small." 
  On the other hand, Nishihiro said: "A unit becomes unable to 
fulfill its duties when it loses 30 percent of its troops; 
however, the active strength of the entire GSDF is currently 
less than 70 percent of its permitted level. It will be 
meaningless to maintain such an organization which is bound to 
lose even before the actual start of a battle. It is impossible 
to discuss Japan's military independence because Japan does not 
have nuclear weapons. The primary concern must be to maintain 
favorable Japan-U.S. relations." 
  The "Nishihiro theory" is often regarded as a proposal for 
limiting the SDF's size to the required minimum based on the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and this is attractive to many 
civilian officials in the DA. Nishihiro is still regarded as a 
charismatic leader of defense policy, and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa relies on him greatly. When Hosokawa hit upon the 
revision of the National Defense Program Outline, he brought the 
plan to Nishihiro before showing it to the DA. 
  The final report by the "Defense Issues Council," which is 
to 
be submitted this summer, is expected to advocate drastic arms 
reduction policies. In preparation for this, the DA and the 
GSDF Staff Office secretly began to formulate a plan for 
"downgrading some divisions to brigades." 
  The GSDF Staff Office is now trying to make sure that there 
will be 15 units--13 divisions plus two combined brigades--even 
if several divisions are downgraded to brigades. This is 
because the GSDF Staff Office believes that if the number of 
units is kept unchanged at 15, there will still be opportunities 
for expansion in the future. Now that the GSDF Staff Office has 
decided to resort to this "ultimate tactic," its antagonism 
against the DA has disappeared.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa, from the "Building of the New SDF </F>
Following the End of the Cold War" series; part two entitled 
"Self-Defense Forces Incapable of Fighting Due to Lack of 
Bullets"] 
  [Text] "The only imperfection is that there are few bullets 
to shoot on the rare occasions they are required." As stated 
in a "senryu" [Japanese traditional satirical poem] composed by 
a member of the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF] have suffered from chronic shortages 
of ammunition. Although ammunition factories are fully capable 
of production, half of these factories are not in operation. 
  Chugoku Kayaku Corporation [CKC] is engaged in filling 
cartridge cases with gunpowder (the main office is in Kure, 
Hiroshima Prefecture). There are eight assembly plants in 
Yoshii, Gunma Prefecture, but only half of them are operating 
every day. 
  Four years ago, when the number of contracts received from 
the Defense Agency [DA] reached its peak, CKC extended its road 
to construct new factories along it. However, at the moment no 
new factories are found, and only weeds grow near the road. 
  There are more than 10 ammunition manufacturers in Japan, 
but 
only two companies are engaged in filling cartridge cases with 
gunpowder. CKC exclusively handles large ammunition, such as 
artillery shells and guided missiles; 87 percent of its sales 
rely on contracts received from the DA. 
  Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the growth of the 
DA budget for purchases of ammunition leveled off in line with 
the sluggish rise in the defense budget. In the draft 1994 
budget, the defense budget decreased compared to that of the 
previous year. Due to the increase in expensive ammunition such 
as guided missiles, the budget for artillery shells was reduced, 
while the number of cartridge cases to be filled with gunpowder 
also decreased. The amount of orders received by CKC fell to 
two-thirds of that during the peak. 
  Tomihiro Umeyama, head of CKC's Tokyo branch office, said 
frankly: "Further sluggishness in the size of orders could 
result in a severe situation, such as deteriorated quality and a 
drain of technicians." 
  On the other hand, an official from the DA Equipment Bureau 
[DAEB] said: "It is impossible to increase the defense budget 
for the sake of one private company." However, at the same time 
he added: "From the viewpoint of national security, the 
bankruptcy of an ammunition manufacturer could cause problems." 
It is common sense in the international community that 
ammunition should be produced domestically because, in case of 
emergency, there is a possibility imports will be suspended. A 
DA officer merely reiterated the routine remark: "The company 
should make increased efforts." 
  More than 1,300 manufacturers do business with the DA; this 
number is even larger if subcontracting companies are included. 
Reduction in the defense budget is a direct issue of life and 
death for the defense industry. However, the DAEB is helpless 
because "the development of the industry is beyond our 
responsibility." Some officials even retort aggressively: "If 
they are really faced with difficulties, they will raise unit 
prices. If they do so, we will simply have to buy more 
expensive products." 
  The essence of the problem is believed to lie in Japan's 
defense philosophy itself. When the "National Defense Program 
Outline" was formulated in 1976, the DA stipulated that in an 
emergency the SDF should be able to fight for one month, and 
thus began storing ammunition. However, total stores of 
ammunition, including reserves at the end of 1992, are 127,000 
tons, far short of the goal of a one-month stock. 
  On the other hand, the DA did not hesitate to purchase the 
most advanced equipment for frontline defense, including the 
F-15 fighter, Aegis ships with superior air defense capability, 
and airborne warning and control systems (AWACS). 
  A colonel with the Ground Staff Office offers 
self-criticism, 
saying: "If there is insufficient ammunition, the latest 
equipment will be nothing but paper-mache. The absence of 
objections to distorted procurement programs proves the DA has 
become insensitive under the prolonged peace." 
  Disarmament brings out the reality of an "army" incapable of 
fighting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article, from the "Building of the New SDF </F>
Following the End of the Cold War" series; part three entitled 
"Lineup of 100 `P-3C' No Longer Justified"] 
  [Text] "I do not think today's Russia can invade Japan. We 
do not want to sacrifice our town for a war that will never 
occur." Seiho Kina (age 68) of Motobu, Okinawa, sighed in front 
of the construction site of a Maritime Self-Defense Force [MSDF] 
communications facility for "P-3C" antisubmarine patrol planes. 
The Motobu communications facility is planned as a hookup 
station between P-3C's in operation and the antisubmarine 
warfare operation center (ASWOC) on the MSDF base in Naha. The 
Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau [DFAB] has already 
secured 96 percent of the construction site. 
  ASWOC's have been built in Hachinohe, Atsugi, Iwakuni, and 
Kaya; however, the last one in Okinawa is facing strong 
resistance from local citizens. Kina is the leader of the 
Motobu residents who oppose the communication facility. About 
10 local people stay in a watch-house every day so as not to 
allow DFAB officials access to the construction site. 
  Nevertheless, a high-ranking MSDF officer stressed that 
construction plans for the Motobu communications facility will 
not be dropped, saying: "Okinawa's ASWOC cannot perform even 
half of its functions if the Motobu communications facility is 
not available." He added that antisubmarine warfare (ASW) by 
P-3C's is the lifeline of the MSDF. 
  The MSDF is planning to procure 100 P-3C's (it currently has 
94). When the MSDF obtains its goal, Japan will have the world's 
second-largest lineup of P-3C's after the United States; this 
will be even larger than the total of all NATO member nations, 
except the United States. As a matter of fact, the heavily 
equipped lineup is intended for coping with the military power 
of the former Soviet Union. 
  Explaining the lineup of 100 planes, a senior member of the 
MSDF Staff Office said: "We need 20 P-3C's to patrol deep seas, 
60 for coastal sea areas, and 20 for sea lanes. The lineup of 
100 planes is the minimum strength for covering all patrol areas 
once a day." 
  The main concepts of Japan's sea lane defense are to secure 
the nation's maritime traffic and protect U.S. fleets from 
(former) Soviet submarines in southwestern and southeastern sea 
lanes in case of emergency. In connection with the second 
concept, the above-mentioned MSDF officer noted: "If we cannot 
have Okinawa's ASWOC, we cannot cover the southern sea lanes, 
and this will ruin Japan's entire ASW network." 
  However, Russian naval forces have become less active since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some believe submarines of 
the Russian Pacific Fleet, including nuclear-powered submarines 
equipped with ballistic missiles, have already been reduced to 
around 40, or 50 percent less than the lineup in the Soviet era. 
The MSDF Staff Office member said "we still have to exercise 
precaution," but acknowledged the changes in Russia's posture, 
saying: "We probably need other reasons to justify the lineup 
of 100 P-3C's." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's advisory "Defense Issues 
Council" held its fourth meeting on 30 March. At the meeting, 
members noted "excessive equipment has been observed" in the Air 
Self-Defense Force [ASDF] and the MSDF. They said heavily 
equipped ASW by P-3C is included among the questionable fields. 
  The council is currently reviewing the National Defense 
Program Outline of 1976, focusing on reducing Ground 
Self-Defense Force [GSDF] troops. The "threats" surrounding 
Japan have been downgraded to "uncertainties," and the ASDF and 
MSDF are also expected to be involved in discussions regarding 
Japan's arms reduction. At the 30 March meeting, the Defense 
Issues Council referred to ASDF and MSDF arms reduction for the 
first time. 
  In Motobu, the Naha DFAB will shortly begin construction of 
the communications facility. Kina looked up from the 
watch-house at a P-3C and said: "I will stop the construction 
work at the risk of my life."

<F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa, from the "Building of the New SDF </F>
Following the End of the Cold War" series; part four entitled "I 
Shamefully Say That I Am a Soldier in the SDF Reserves"] 
  [Text] Last winter, a group of reservists from the Ground 
Self-Defense Force [GSDF] underwent marksmanship training at the 
Kitafuji Training Ground in Yamanashi Prefecture. About 120 
reserves from Shizuoka, Yamanashi, and Kanagawa Prefectures 
participated in the training. Many wore spectacles for the 
elderly because they had been discharged from the Self-Defenses 
Forces [SDF] at the mandatory discharge age. 
  Kenso Goto, 60, said after finishing his training: "Why did 
I come here? I came here to meet old friends again." He was a 
warrant officer in the reserves. Reservists undergo five days 
of markmanship training every year. 
  It is rumored that the fixed number of the GSDF members will 
be reduced when the Guideline for Defense Buildup is reviewed, 
and that the reserves are a "trump card" for the GSDF. The 
GSDF, which has 46,000 reserves, intends to maintain its combat 
capability by making up for future reductions in its numbers by 
using the reserves, but there are a host of problems with the 
GSDF reserve system. 
  Uniforms are given to reservists when they report to 
training; they pin their insignia on and begin markmanship 
training. Unlike SDF members on active duty, no officer is in 
charge of overseeing their training, and no call-up training has 
ever been conducted to prepare them for an emergency. The GSDF 
reserve system falls short of meeting the requirement for 
immediate preparedness, and has a fatal defect in maintaining 
the reserves as supplementary combat capabilities. 
  The "Guideline for Defense Buildup," which was formulated 18 
years ago, clearly carries a provision calling for the 
"expansion" of the reserves to bolster the SDF's combat 
capabilities during an emergency. If the expansion in the 
provision aims at bolstering the nation's combat capabilities by 
calling up the SDF reserves in large numbers and by making 
emergency procurements of such mainstay military hardware as 
tanks and fighters (as a senior official in the Defense Agency 
[DA] interprets), then the SDF reserve system should be revamped. 
  The "Defense Issues Council," an advisory body for Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, held its fifth round of meetings on 6 April. 
Providing an explanation of the provision at the meeting, the 
Defense Agency said: "In the past we studied it, but we do not 
do so now. We have no system for emergency procurement." 
  Explaining the reason for the DA leaving the provision 
untouched, a senior DA official has said: "We need legislation 
to strengthen our combat capabilities in the event of an 
emergency. However, we fear being interrogated in the Diet 
about such legislation." While some say such "legislation is 
locked in a safe," others say the legislation has been shelved 
because of a lack of tension in Japan's neighbors. Seiki 
Nishhiro, an adviser to the DA who was involved in formulating 
the Guideline for the Defense Buildup, has recalled: "The 
provision was fake." 
  What has the DA done over the past 18 years since the 
Guideline for the Defense Buildup was formulated? Another 
senior DA official has said: "If the DA takes aggressive 
measures to enforce the provision and announces the recruitment 
of SDF reserves, the people will undoubtedly criticize the DA 
for trying to institute a draft." Although the 1992 Defense 
White Paper described the SDF as "the people's forces," the DA 
in fact feels alienated from the people. 
  Bureaus in the DA as well as the Ground Staff Office in the 
GSDF have begun studying ways to adopt a new SDF reserve system, 
but they will certainly encounter rough sailing in their study. 
Recently the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development has been raised, and Prime Minister Hosokawa, who 
expressed an for disarmament, announced his resignation on 8 
April. 
  Several senior DA officials are revealing their hopes that 
the current SDF reserve system will be strengthened by external 
factors, asking: "Will the direction of the winds change?"

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Regression Should Be Allowed in </F>
Comprehensive Review of Regulations"] 
  [Text] Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] issued a report asking for the relaxation of 
government regulations for the distribution and transport 
sectors. The statement represents the consensus reached among 
its members, and is meant to be an appeal to the government's 
Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters. Keidanren also 
asked for deregulation to facilitate the effective use of 
information and communications. 
  In the distribution sector, the report asked for the gradual 
abolition of the Large Retail Store Law, easing of regulations 
on retail licenses for liquor, and revamping the distribution 
system of rice and grain. In the transport sector, it demanded 
liberalization of fares under a set upper limit for passenger 
transport by railway, bus and aircraft. 
  There is an upsurge of opinion seeking deregulation in the 
business sector. This is probably because the businesses have 
come to truly realize that although the economic recession has 
hit bottom, there is still a glaring gap between demand and 
supply; and to get on the track of recovery while undertaking 
structural reform, it is necessary to grab the opportunity to 
expand the market through deregulation. 
  With the enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law 
scheduled for October, some businesses have come out and asked 
for the "documentation of administrative guidance." This is 
meant to enable businesses to monitor the ambiguous 
administrative procedures and instructions of government offices 
which do not have any legal basis. This can also be taken as a 
manifestation of the business sector's initiative to open up new 
markets. 
  Among the consumers, there is also a strong desire for 
deregulation and clarification of rules. They have come to be 
more concerned with eliminating the price gap between Japan and 
foreign countries, and with possible ways to obtain high-quality 
goods and services at a lower price. We would like the 
government to seriously consider such pressure from the business 
sector and consumers to relax government regulations as a "sign 
of the times." 
  In its "Outline of External Economic Policy Reform," 
formulated recently as part of the efforts to bring about a 
breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the 
government pledged to work intensively on a radical review of 
regulations. It cited the following sectors as major areas to 
be considered: housing and land; information and 
communications; import promotion, improvement of market access, 
and distribution; and banking, securities and insurance. 
Working groups for the first three sectors have been formed to 
enable free discussions between experts and the concerned 
ministries and agencies. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is also chairman of 
the 
Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, serves 
concurrently as chairman of the three working groups. According 
to informed sources, with the resignation of Hosokawa, the 
working groups now have a weakened sense of purpose. If this is 
true, they will not be able to fulfill the government's pledge 
to the people. This will be a betrayal of the people's high 
hopes. 
  It is important to review government regulations 
intensively. 
The deregulation being considered in the three areas has the 
potential of expanding domestic demand, promoting imports, 
developing new businesses, and improving the people's quality of 
life. Therefore, we hope the working groups will continue to 
actively discuss effective measures in their own areas in 
preparation for the formulation of another deregulation package 
in June. Of course, followup on the measures already included 
in the emergency economic package is also indispensable. 
  Another point which we would like to stress here is that the 
basic thinking on deregulation upheld in the Outline of External 
Economic Policy Reform -- that "the economy should be free in 
principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases; and social 
regulations should be limited to the minimum, in line with the 
original policy goals"--should be sustained resolutely. Failure 
to come up with a midterm program for deregulation under such a 
philosophy will render what Hosokawa termed "Deregulation Year 
One [Kisei Kanwa Gannen]" only a castle in the air.

<F P=106> [Article by Masao Yokomizo, deputy director, Nikko Research </F>
Center: "Japanese Productivity: Correct Distortion Among 
Industries"] 
  [Text] 1) There is a view that the productivity of 
the Japanese manufacturing industry is considerably lower than 
the United States, but if calculated using purchasing power 
parity [PPP] by industrial sector, Japanese productivity is 
superior. 
  2) In the recent economic recession, however, Japanese 
productivity superiority has temporarily disappeared because the 
mining and manufacturing industries production has fallen on a 
large scale. Furthermore, with the rapid rise in the yen, wages 
in dollars considerably exceed the United States, and the 
environment surrounding the manufacturing industry has become 
grim. 
  3) The relative price structure among the Japanese 
export, industrial , and consumption goods and service sectors 
has a unique distortion viewed internationally. In order to 
solve these problems, it is necessary to correct the high yen 
and seriously undertake relaxation of regulations. 
<H5>  Conversion of Purchasing Power Parity by Sector Necessary </H5>
  In the 11 January issue of this newspaper, there was an 
article entitled: Come Back Manufacturing Industry; Common 
Sense Lies Seen in Data and Common Sense 3 Equals 
High Productivity and Efficiency. Although the productivity 
of the Japanese manufacturing industry is high in commonsense 
terms, it was no more than 77 percent that of the United States 
in 1990 according to an analysis by the Japan Productivity 
Center. Basically, however, it is correct to view that Japan is 
higher than the United States as "common sense" dictates. 
  The Productivity Center converts the value added of the 
manufacturing industry by the purchasing power parity (PPP) of 
the whole nation to calculate productivity. In the international 
comparison of physical productivity, calculating by PPP is 
certainly closer to the real situation than conversion by the 
exchange rate. 
  However, this differs according to industrial sector. The 
purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry, which is 
a ratio of the respective nation's total amount of money in the 
identical U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industry product 
baskets, should be markedly higher than the agricultural product 
basket. Making an international comparison of productivity by 
industry ignoring the differences in purchasing power parity 
among such sectors becomes a misleading basis. 
  However, it is difficult to measure directly the purchasing 
power parity of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, if the 
purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry for 1991 
is calculated using the U.S. and Japanese industrial product 
wholesale prices with the second quarter of 1973 as the starting 
point for approximation, $1 is equal to 154.5 yen. On the other 
hand, the purchasing power parity of the GDP (gross domestic 
product) on an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development) basis was $1 equals 193 yen in 1991. 
  The most recent point in time when the U.S. and Japanese GDP 
were known by industry was 1991. The GDP per employed person in 
the manufacturing industry in that year was 8.434 million yen 
for Japan and $50,220 for the United States. If this is 
converted by GDP purchasing power parity, Japan is 87 percent of 
the United States. It certainly is low, but if it were the 
manufacturing industry, Japan is higher than the United States 
at 109 percent. This is closer to the real situation. 
  It seems that Japan is slightly higher even adding labor 
time 
(the labor time of manufacturing industry production workers is 
a little over 7 percent lower for the United States). The 
figures of the Productivity Center are widely used by Nikkeiren 
(Japan Federation of Employers' Associations) and others, but it 
is probably necessary to be cautious on that problem point. 
<H5>  Cost Increases With High Yen and Manufacturing Industry </H5>
Hollowing Out 
  According to national income statistics, however, employee 
income per person in the manufacturing industry in 1991 was 
4.635 million yen for Japan and $37,049 for the United States. 
The exchange rate for 1991 was $1 equals 134.54 yen. It should 
be converted by this from the viewpoint of international 
competition, and the Japanese wage level is 93 percent that of 
the United States. That means Japan enjoyed high productivity, 
low wages, and rather comfortable management. 
  However, the situation changed completely with the high yen 
later. Supposing no change in wages, using the 1993 exchange 
rate, 111.18 yen, Japanese wages were 113 percent compared to 
the United States. It is higher than the 9-percent difference in 
productivity of 1991. 
  Moreover, Japanese productivity dropped for a short period 
due to the later recession (the United States was booming and 
productivity rising). Mining and manufacturing industries 
production dropped 10.3 percent from 1991 to 1993, manufacturing 
industry employees also decreased 1.3 percent, but productivity 
dropped about 9 percent. 
  Premised on the above calculations, Japanese wage costs 
exceed the United States by over 10 percent, and international 
competition must be viewed as rather severe. 
  Temporary factors due to business cycles should be taken 
into 
consideration here, but basically the high yen is the main 
cause. The exchange rate in December 1993 was $1 equals 109.7 
yen, but the purchasing power parity of industrial product 
wholesale prices was $1 equals 146.92 yen. The difference of 
both is about 37 yen and has greatly expanded from 20 yen in 
1991. The yen rate has become much removed from the basic 
conditions of the Japanese manufacturing industry. 
  No matter how much effort is put into rationalization and 
improving productivity, the Japanese manufacturing industry is 
not able to catch up with the high wage costs due to the soaring 
yen; as a result, it will soon be forced to hollow out. 
  Hollowing out is a pullback from exports, overseas 
procurement of raw materials and products, and reduction and 
abandonment of domestic production due to an import offensive. 
Even if there is such an impact, big businesses can partially 
deal with it and will probably continue to exist, but the 
existence of medium, small, and petty businesses will be 
threatened under the large-scale decrease in demand and demands 
to cut unit prices exceeding ceilings. 
  The Japanese manufacturing industry has been formed by many 
layers of medium, small, and petty businesses through the long 
period of accumulation of proficiency with adaptation to 
circumstances supporting the production of growth products that 
change from time to time. There is the fear that once these 
businesses disappear due to cessation of business, reappearance 
will be close to impossible and Japan's basis for creativity 
will be destroyed. 
  If there are such structural problems besides the serious 
deflation effect brought by the high yen, correction of the high 
yen is an important issue involving national interest. $1 
equaling 115 to 120 yen probably will be appropriate. If "the 
volume of trade on the foreign exchange market in recent years 
is 60 times the flow trade (1993 Economic White Paper), it must 
be that the high yen effect from the trade surplus is limited 
and speculation along with monetary conditions at home and 
abroad is strongly influencing the yen rate. 
  It can be seen from the fact that just one word uttered by 
U.S. President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Bentsen has 
greatly changed the flow of yen trade. In order to correct the 
high yen, in addition to effective economic measures and 
complete opening of markets, we should prepare for effective 
measures to counteract verbal intervention from key members of 
the U.S. Government. 
<H5>  Productivity Imbalance Raises Price Level </H5>
  The above are considerations about the manufacturing 
industry, but let's turn our eyes to industry as a whole. 
  The GDP per employed person in the 1991 private industry 
total was 6.768 million yen for Japan and $42,718 for the United 
States. If this is converted by $1 to 193 yen, which is the GDP 
purchasing power parity, Japan is 82 percent of the United 
States. In other words, the productivity of the manufacturing 
industry was higher than the United States, but the productivity 
of the whole nation is 20 percent lower. One can see how low the 
productivity of nonmanufacturing industries is. 
  For the manufacturing industry, including the trade goods 
sector which is exposed to international competition, price is a 
given condition, so to speak, and if wages, which are determined 
by the domestic labor market, also are a given condition, there 
is no other way than to raise productivity. However, since 
international competition is less in the nonmanufacturing 
industry and there is a lot of industry protection and entry 
regulation, competitive conditions are not severe. For that 
reason, price can be decided in terms of a non-given condition 
to a certain extent, and consequently, income has become high 
and productivity has become low. This is one of the major 
factors in the so-called domestic-foreign price difference (in 
addition, high land prices are a big aspect). 
  Although wages are decided by a nationwide labor market, 
such 
conditions by industry are reflected to a certain extent and 
wages in the nonmanufacturing industry have become high. 
Consequently, employee income per person for 1991 in the private 
industry total where the nonmanufacturing industry has a high 
weight was 14 percent higher with Japan at 4.357 million yen and 
the United States at 3.820 million yen calculated at the 
exchange rate. 
  Although the productivity of the nation overall is low, the 
price level is considerably higher than the United States 
because wages are high. If these wages are converted at the 1993 
exchange rate, Japan will actually be 38 percent higher than the 
United States. 
  So far, as the yen went higher, the manufactyuring industry 
adapted to the new yen level by efforts at rationalization, high 
value-added, and improved productivity. Low price stability has 
continued for the output price of the manufacturing industry 
viewed on a yen basis. 
  On the other hand, the nonmanufacturing industry has easy 
competitive conditions, improved productivity is behind, and the 
output price has continued to rise. The spotty price between 
these sectors is conspicuous viewed internationally and makes 
the structural problems of Japanese industry stand out.

|Consumer price basis     |199.69                   |1.6678                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Note: Purchasing power parity = exchange rate at base point of time x Japan (| 
|Germany) price index/U.S. price index. Base point of time is second quarter 1| 
|973.                                                                         | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  As indicated in the table, with the second quarter of 1973 
directly after the shift to a floating exchange rate system as 
the starting point, the purchasing power parity calculated from 
relative prices with the United States in November 1993, which 
is the most recent point in time that can be taken in the 
statistics all together, for either export prices, industrial 
product wholesale prices, or consumer prices, was about 1.7 
marks per dollar in Germany, and the actual exchange rate was 
also 1.7 marks. 
  In Japan, however, the export basket is slightly over 92 
yen, 
and the industrial product basket is on the 146 yen level. In 
the consumer spending basket, it is an extremely wide margin at 
$1 to about 200 yen. The real exchange rate is on the 103 yen 
level and close to the export basket. 
  The German exchange rate is close to the balanced economic 
fundamentals, but the Japanese structure is very distorted in 
the form of higher prices the further the sector is from trade 
and viewed from the economy overall, the exchange rate can be 
called abnormal and high. 
  The nonmanufacturing industry, in a sense, can be called a 
support sector for the manufacturing industry and the fact that 
there has become such high cost there probably involves the 
existence of the manufacturing industry. Drastic structural 
reform such as full-scale relaxation or abolition of regulations 
is desired. 
  In the same table, the purchasing power parity on an export 
price basis of slightly over 92 yen is impressive, but comparing 
the U.S. and Japan export product composition, a characteristic 
is that the United States has many agricultural products and raw 
materials for industry, and Japan has many capital goods and 
autos; and it cannot be compared in the same export basket. The 
fact that the contents are not the same can also be said of 
other baskets, but since the discrepancy is believed to be 
rather large for exports, no precise meaning is seen in the 
level of 92 yen.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur April 20 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec and Premier of the Malaysian Federation 
Datuk Sri Mahathir talked today about the necessity of 
diversifying international contacts, Zieleniec said at the end 
of his Malaysian visit. 
  They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation between 
the Czech Republic and Malaysia, and the export of traditional 
Czech goods here. At the press conference Zieleniec mentioned 
Czech glass, saying that he had seen Bohemia Glass products in 
several Kuala Lumpur shops. 
  He and Mahathir had agreed that joint companies were a 
suitable form of cooperation, Zieleniec said, adding that the 
two countries could work together in Vietnam, for example. 
  They did not talk about specific projects, he said, because 
this was up to individual companies. Asked by local journalists 
what the Czech Republic could offer Malaysians interested in 
cooperation, Zieleniec replied that the Czechs offered the same 
possibilities to everybody. 
  He also declared that he believed in the rapid signing of 
two 
agreements, on trade and the protection of investments, and had 
given proposals for them to Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian 
trade and industry minister. 
  There had been no talk for the meantime about a further 
necessary document, that on the prevention of double taxation, 
Zieleniec said. 
  He told journalists that he had conveyed an invitation to 
the 
Czech Republic from Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus to Premier 
Mahathir. 
  Relations between the Czech Republic and Malaysia began to 
develop properly in the 1980's. The main Czech exports to 
Malaysia are engineering products and consumer goods, including 
glass, pianos and sporting and hunting equipment.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 20 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
governmental "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" newspaper publishes the 
information about the official visit of the Governor-General of 
Australia Bill Hayden to Mongolia at the invitation of the 
President of Mongolia P. Ochirbat. The visit was lasting from

  The newspaper carries the text in full of the speech of the 
Prime Minister P. Jasray over the national radio and television 
in connection with the hunger strike of representatives of the 
democratic association demanding resignation of the government. 
The prime minister noted that it is the Great State Hural only 
which is entitled to solve the issue of resignation of the 
government. He said in his speech that the government has been 
taking all possible measures to provide the implementation of 
its programme of action and has proper possibilities for it due 
to which it is not to pose on its initiative the issue of its 
resignation. The prime minister has called the population to 
continue their labour efforts, displaying soberness and 
vigilance. The premier has stressed that the responsibility for 
the aftermath of the hunger strike and its taking in 
unauthorized place should be beared by the organizers of the 
above mentioned action.

Hural 
a group of parliamentarians have expressed their regret in 
connection with the decision of a member of the parliament, 
Chairman of the Social Democratic Party R. Gonchigdorj to join 
the participants of the hunger strike.

member of the presidium of the city party committee T. 
Baasanjav. He noted that over just one and a half year of its 
activities the city administration has been guided by the 
objectives of transferring the economy to market relations, 
stabilizing the economy, setting down the topic issues of 
concern referring to the improvement of the city, advancing its 
services and solving the social issues of the population. 
  The newspaper informs that on the initiative of the public 
in 
the capital city is being revived the old tradition of carrying

advanced workers. 
  Writing in the newspaper journalist O. Lhagvadorj touched 
upon the delay in the restoration of the statue of the

reports that the rate of infectious meningit has to be declined 
recently and tends to preserve its race for a few last days at 
the same level.

<F P=106> [Essay by Unidentified Station Editor] </F>
  [Text] The U.S.-owned Crestone energy company issued a 
press release on 18 April 1994, announcing that it is conducting 
a seismologial survey and preparing for exploratory drilling to 
evaluate the latent oil and gas potential of the so-called 
WANANBEI-21 Contract area. The public is expressing indignation 
over the attitude of the Crestone energy company and its actions 
because of the following reasons: 
  First, the sea area where Crestone is conducting the 
seismologial survey is precisely the Tu Chinh coral reef of 
Vietnam. This area lies within Vietnam's sacred terrorial sea. 
By arrogantly conducting a survey in this area, Crestone has 
brazenly and gravely violated Vietnamese sovereignty, thus 
tramping on international justice and law, provoking public 
opinion, and running counter to the trend of our time which, 
promoted by the world community, calls for the respect of the 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of every 
country. 
  Second, the U.S.-owned Crestone company deliberately 
distorted the truth and the history to cover up its wrongdoing. 
It claimed that its action is a continuation of China's history 
of research and exploration in that sea area, which allegedly 
began since time immemorial as far back as 200 years B.C. 
  In view of the wrongful attitude and action of Crestone, we 
express our great indignation over the company's action and 
denounce it before the public. 
  Right from the time when the company signed an oil 
exploration and exploitation contract with the Offshore Oil 
Company of China in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry had 
issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and 
that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's 
sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well 
as against international law. 
  We assert that according to international law, Vietnam has 
long exercised its sovereignty over the Tu Chinh area. As early 
as before 1975, this area was divided into bid lots for oil and 
gas exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional 
Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a 
statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of 
the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12 
May 1977 and 12 November 1982, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty 
over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the 
Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided 
for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has 
since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas 
resources in that area, including its cooperation with many 
foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an 
economic, scientific, and service zone has been established 
there since 1989 with the presence of a system of Vietnamese 
lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station. 
  On 20 April 1994, a spokesman for the SRV Government again 
clearly pointed out that the seismological survey by the 
Crestone company and its arrogant declaration of a planned 
exploration and exploitation of national resources in the area 
within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf 
-- an area which is, both legally and practically, totally under 
Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes a new, very grave step of 
escalation; and that the Crestone company must bear full 
responsibility for the consequences arising from its actions. 
  Once again, we asserted that the contract of the Crestone 
company is invalid and that its actions are illegal. No 
countries or companies will be allowed to conduct any 
exploration or exploitation of natural resources within 
Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone without 
permission from the Vietnamese Government.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Maksymovych 
arrived in Hanoi on Thursday for an official visit to Vietnam at 
the invitation of Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
Radio Voice of Vietnam reviews relations between Vietnam and 
Ukraine over the past years. 
  The visit to Vietnam by the Ukrainian foreign minister is of 
great significance to both countries as this is the first visit 
to Vietnam of a foreign minister from Ukraine, a republic of the 
former Soviet Union. It is a start in relations between the two 
countries. 
  Following a foreign policy to be friends with all nations in 
the world, Vietnam has established diplomatic relations with all 
the member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Diplomatic 
relations with Ukraine was established in January 1992. Today, 
the bilateral relations between Vietnam and Ukraine has 
developed in many fields. The number of agreements to be signed 
by the two countries with a view to exploiting each other's 
potential will help the economic development of each country. 
They include the agreement on economic relations; trade, 
military, technical, and aviation cooperation; a protocol on 
foreigners; and an agreement on the travelling of citizens in 
each country. 
  Vietnam and Ukraine have also signed other documents such as 
the agreement on the encouragement and protection of investment; 
the agreement on the avoidance of double taxation; a consular 
agreement; and an agreement on cooperation in culture, science, 
and education. 
  Both nations are now promoting the trading ties. In 1992, 
the two-way trade turnover was only $15 million. In 1993, the 
turnover was also lightly increased. Vietnam mainly imported 
dairy products, steel, and construction materials, while Ukraine 
imported agriculture products and consumers goods. Ukraine is 
assisting Vietnam in building the Yali Hydroelectric Power Plant 
and another project with a total capital of $18 million. 
  This visit by the Ukrainian foreign minister is a good 
opportunity for the two countries to join efforts and find 
measures to further strengthen the cooperative economic 
relations. The visit is also a chance for the two countries to 
exchange experiences in economic development of each country. 
The Vietnamese people as well as the Ukrainian people hope that 
this visit to Vietnam by Minister Anatoliy Maksymovych will make 
contribution to the development of relations between the two 
countries.

<F P=106> ("Topical Talk" feature with station editor Vu Dinh Vinh] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted on Lenin's concepts in 
proletarianism and his work and devotion that resulted in the 
victory of the Great Russian October Revolution and the setting 
up of the first socialist state in the world] Dear comrades and 
friends, in commemorating the 124th birthday of Lenin, we should 
study his work and devotion to clearly understand his concepts. 
This will help us to have a correct stand in the current 
politico- ideological struggle. For this reason, our party has 
encouraged systematic studies on achievements and failure of the 
international communist and worker's movement, especially the 
collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. Through these studies we will clearly understand the 
real concepts of Marxism-Leninism to be able to renovate our 
thought to bring the doctrine into full play, thus catching up 
with developments of the era. At the same time, we will be able 
to uphold the Ho Chi Minh thought and promote socialism to 
formulate measures and orientations for our revolution in the 
current stage. 
  Our party's basic lines and policies are to renovate thought 
and concept while striving to oppose opportunism and revision 
and overcoming conservatism and dogmatism. 
  It is necessary to say that we are facing numerous 
difficulties in the politico-ideological struggle. As a result, 
we must strive to maintain and develop all favorable conditions 
to win in the struggle. The most fundamental favorable feature 
of our just cause rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh 
thought. Although efforts are being made to study and overcome 
weaknesses in socialist concepts, achievements of the renovation 
process have testified to our correct application of 
Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought, especially in the 
current complicated changes at home and abroad. 
  Today, in commemorating great Lenin's birthday anniversary, 
we recall a foreign scholar's expression: Amid crises, there 
existed persons of genius who created historical events, such as 
Lenin and Ho Chi Minh. Indeed, they have written an 
unforgettable history despite changes and developments.

  [Text] From 15 to 18 April, President Le Duc Anh paid a 
working visit to the northeastern border Province of Quang Ninh, 
which belongs to the targeted economic development zone formed 
by Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh. 
  After being briefed by leading officials of the provincial 
party committee and people's committee on socioeconomic 
development projects for the years ahead, President Le Duc Anh 
pointed out the great potential and important role of Quang Ninh 
in the renovation process and construction aimed at turning the 
province into a prosperous and beautiful part of the country. 
  The tasks and objectives of the Quang Ninh Province party 
organization and people are well-defined and aimed at promoting 
key economic sectors, namely production of coal, cement, and 
construction materials; processing of agro-forestry-sea 
products; and development of a sea-based economy, tourism, and 
service industries. Concentrated efforts are needed to help 
local coal producers and industrialists overcome difficulties in 
capital, technology, and marketing. First of all, it is 
necessary to invest in infrastructure building projects 
involving communications and transport, water conservancy, power 
transmission, and information and communications. It is 
necessary to accelerate the movement for wasteland reclamation 
and aquaculture as well as to create sources of raw materials 
for processing industries and exports. It is important to step 
up external economic relations, attract investment capital from 
local and foreign investors, increase export indexes of 
traditional and local products, and work out adequate plans to 
exploit tourist attractions. At the same time, it is necessary 
to step up the campaign against corruption and smuggling, 
restore order and discipline, and maintain political stability.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vo Tran Chi, member of the Political Bureau </F>
and secretary of Ho Chi Minh City party committee, by SAIGON 
GIAI PHONG correspondent Van Dinh on "political stability as the 
preliminary condition for socioeconomic development" -- place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: The mid-term national 
party congress has pointed out four dangers. How does the city 
view these dangers? 
  [Vo Tran Chi] All four dangers raise issues of equal 
importance and are interrelated. Therefore, concentrated 
efforts must be made to overcome them. Given the 
characteristics of the city, however, top priority must be given 
to efforts to overcome the danger posed by the peaceful 
evolution scheme. Hostile forces are implementing their 
peaceful evolution scheme on a nationwide basis. Ho Chi Minh 
City, however, is regarded as a key target because it has all 
the conditions for the enemy to undermine our political, 
economic, cultural, ideological, and organizational structures. 
  Furthermore, it is the objective of the peaceful evolution 
scheme to cause political instability. Meanwhile, political 
stability is the preliminary condition for socioeconomic 
development. Only when political stability is maintained can 
people throughout the country have a sense of security while 
engaging in business activities and accelerating socioeconomic 
development. Political stability is also the preliminary 
condition for encouraging foreign countries to make bold 
investments. 
  [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: That is the preliminary condition. 
Are there any other conditions? 
  [Vo Tran Chi] It is necessary to build a sound socioeconomic 
infrastructure. Socioeconomic infrastructure here means 
policies, laws, discipline, management mechanisms, and personnel 
who are competent and highly qualified for the overall 
development on the socioeconomic and political fronts. 
  [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: What should the city do to overcome 
the danger of being left farther behind economically? 
  [Vo Tran Chi] Intensive efforts must be made to effect 
economic restructuring based on the need for industrialization 
and modernization. Ours is an industrial city, but there still 
remains much room for improvement. In my opinion, as far as the 
1994-95 period is concerned, drastic efforts must be made to 
improve technology, increase production output, and enhance 
economic efficiency. It is necessary to take practical measures 
to effect agricultural industrialization, thereby creating 
enough strength to promote socioeconomic development in the 
entire city and in surrounding areas. 
  [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: To this end, what is the most 
decisive factor for success? 
  [Vo Tran Chi] First of all, it is necessary to strengthen 
and 
enhance the leading role of the city party organization and the 
efficiency of state management agencies. Past experiences show 
that correct policies trigger quick responses from the masses 
and help rally the people around the party and make them act 
according to party policies and lines. Those policies guarantee 
both the common interests of the collective and the personal 
interests of each member of society. 
  In addition to correct policies, it is necessary to conduct 
propaganda activities, organize implementation, draw 
experiences, and make amendments to keep those policies more 
consistent with real life situations. 
  Furthermore, it is very important for the party 
organization, 
cadres, and party members to maintain firmly their political 
qualifications and socialist orientations. Therefore, it is 
necessary to consolidate grassroots party organizations and make 
them pure, firm, and strong so they can assume an overall 
leadership role in the new stage. 
  [Van Dinh] Thank you, comrade.

trials on various corruption and smuggling cases. 
  To enhance its results, the National Assembly Standing 
Committee has requested the government to formulate concrete 
plans and effective measures to supervise sectors, branches, and 
localities to carry out tasks uniformly and implement the 
National Assembly resolutions consistently. Efforts must be 
made to motivate the people to participate in various activities 
while striving to develop positive factors against corruption, 
smuggling, and wastage. Various law enforcement agencies must 
integrate their efforts to seriously investigate and try a 
number of important, complicated cases so as to firmly maintain 
law and order and win the people's confidence. 
  The National Assembly Standing Committee has also heard and 
reviewed reports on the implementation of the National Assembly

Culture and Information and agencies concerned to help them 
implement the Law on Publications effectively and thereby create 
favorable conditions for the development of culture and the 
arts, contribute to the opposition against negative practices, 
build a healthy cultural and spiritual life for the people, and 
serve the nation's comprehensive renovation undertaking. 
  5. The National Assembly Standing Committee has contributed 
ideas to the draft bill on amending and supplementing some
