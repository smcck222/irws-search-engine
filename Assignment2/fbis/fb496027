<F P=106> [Article by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai: "What </F>
Should the Banking Sector Do To Meet the Development Demand of 
the Economy"] 
  [Text] Progress scored in 1993 by the banking sector has 
contributed actively to the general improvement of our economy. 
Many problems, however, still remain. While discussing 
cooperation in financial consultancy with foreign countries, our 
prime minister remarked: Finance and money are the two most 
important areas when we transform to the market economy under 
state management. These areas have made some progress and 
achievements. But they are far too short for our demand and too 
little when compared with our neighboring countries. 
  Therefore, in 1994 and the following years, the entire 
banking sector must further its renovation and satisfactorily 
accomplish the duties outlined in the government program of 
action. The important duty and requirement imposed on the 
banking sector by the national economy is that it must firmly 
stabilize the currency. This is one of the decisive factors for 
a stable macroeconomy and for the creation of a safe environment 
for savings and investment. Therefore, it must be considered a 
paramount duty in monetary management. This is a main and 
direct responsibility of the Central Bank and this 
responsibility must not be neglected. Although inflation has 
decreased and market prices have been relatively stable, our 
ability to control inflation is not very strong and the 
possibility of increasing inflation must not be considered 
lightly. 
  We resolutely have stopped issuing money to cover budget 
overruns. But with its current practice of providing credit 
capital to commercial banks, the Central Bank cannot control and 
regulate monetary circulation and it cannot fulfill its role as 
a last credit provider in the credit system. And the two-level 
banking structure outlined by the stipulations of the banking 
system has not been correctly implemented. 
  The control and regulation of monetary circulation becomes 
more complicated when development investment rapidly occurs and 
foreign capital quickly enters the system. This causes the 
investment situation to overheat and damages price stability. 
In addition to that, many enterprises, government organs, and 
the public still use both U.S. dollars and gold to settle their 
financial transactions in the market. The bank cannot control 
this practice. In reality, there has been no progress in the 
attempt to make the dong the only currency used for financial 
transactions in our country. This is an urgent and complicated 
issue for the banking sector in its duty to control inflation 
and stabilize the currency. 
  Capital is badly needed to maintain and expand current 
business and production enterprises, build new establishments, 
and create economic transforming steps for industrialization and 
modernization. When the capital market is still primitive and 
without the existence of a stock market, the effort to fulfill 
the capital demand for different economic sectors and the public 
is a great imperative and challenge for the banking sector. 
  In 1994, the capital reserved for loans by the Investment 
and 
Development Bank is at least 6,300 billion dong, excluding 3,000 
billion dong reserved for the electricity sector. The demand on 
capital by different sectors and localities is much greater, 
about 20,000 billion dong. Many urgent investment projects have 
not been able to find any funding sources. 
  Present enterprises are badly in need of capital to upgrade 
equipment and technology and to meet their higher demand to 
circulate capital. Our agriculture and rural areas also demand 
a great amount of capital to change their production structure; 
to transform the planting and cropping structure in central and 
mountainous provinces; and to invest in processing industries, 
building material production, and fishing boats. We must 
introduce processing industries to rural areas as outlined in 
the Fifth Plenum resolution in order to build new rural areas 
and improve the peasants' material and spiritual life. 
  At the mid-term party national conference, Comrade General 
Secretary Do Muoi stressed: Internal capital is decisive and 
external capital is important in the national construction 
process. Internal capital comes from higher economic efficiency, 
the practice of frugality, and the continuous rate of 
accumulation for investment. To raise internal capital 
resources, one must encourage the people to practice thrift for 
their own interest and for national prosperity, ensure adequate 
developing investment, and create conditions for better 
attraction and application of the external capital resource. In 
a strategic sense, internal capital has a decisive role, 
although in the beginning, external capital may account for a 
higher percentage in the total developing investment. According 
to the Statistics General Department, at the moment, there is 
about 20,000 billion dong (equals to $2 billion) of idle capital 
in the public domain. If it can be put to use, it will be an 
important source to develop investment. 
  The banking sector should develop cohesive coordination with 
other sectors to widen relations with foreign credit 
organizations, which offer acceptable interest rates. This 
credit then can be used in various forms as loans to business 
establishments and individuals at reasonable interest rates. 
This is an urgent task that needs to be started now or we might 
miss many development opportunities in 1994. 
  In the process of transforming to a market-oriented economy, 
it is impractical for central-level management to send out 
orders on projects to local authorities. The establishment of 
projects should be based on the development trend of our 
economic structure from now until the year 2000; credit and 
investment activities should be oriented by the 
industry-agriculture relations. The banking sector should be 
sensitive to all new demands, be apt in finding targeted 
customers, and be dynamic in soliciting credit partners and not 
using the usual sit-and-wait-for-the-customer practice. 
  Banking activities should be thoroughly revitalized before 
they effect changes in the economy. In many countries, banks 
never reject a loan proposal that proves to be efficient and 
will be repayed. Bankers will find other ways to finance a good 
proposal if funds are not readily available, including loans 
from other banks, raising funds, or calling for foreign credit. 
  Current bank interest rates are another issue that needs 
reorganization. In the present situation, most business 
capital, especially circulating capital, is obtained through 
bank loans. When the inflation rate is at a level that makes the 
borrower pay annual interest several tens of percent, then it is 
excessive and exceeds repayment capacity. 
  At the current interest rates for bank loans, business 
establishments will not be able to create any reserves nor 
expand their business after tax obligations are fulfilled. 
Business establishments are actually facing this difficulty. 
If businesses are unable to develop, their production 
activities will not expand or modernize. Competitiveness will 
be damaged and they will not be able to avoid further the danger 
of economically lagging behind other countries. 
  The interest rates, therefore, need to be adjusted more 
reasonably. This will allow businesses to develop and banks can 
develop their credit activities. Business establishments with 
sluggish activities need to be reorganized. Bank interest rates 
also have a direct relation to banking operation costs, which 
presently are too high. Measures should be worked out for more 
suitable interest rates. 
  We must strive for progress in foreign currency management 
in 
1994. A foreign professor remarked that there is now a trend of 
U.S. dollarization in liquidation [USD hoa trong thanh toanfor 
banks to guarantee their liquidating ability in all situations, 
using faster and more convenient methods, and using less cash. 
This will attract more funds for bank reserves. Liquidation 
procedures through banks quickly should be modernized. Banks 
should have concrete plans for investment in technology and 
equipment modernization and use all available fund sources, 
including the depreciation allowed by the government or overseas 
loans. 
  The last issue is the urgent need to train bank personnel at 
present and for the future. We need to gradually form a 
contingent of banking experts. We are also in need of experts 
to be sent to work at international and regional finance 
institutions. 
  We need to pay attention to both skills and character when 
training staff since these two elements are closely 
interrelated. Talent should be coupled with a high sense of 
morality, which can be effectively used, in every country. This 
is even more important as we pursue a socialist path: bank 
cadres should not see money above all else. 
  The banking sector should strive to fight negativity and 
corruption. It has to be reorganized to get rid of excessive, 
annoying, and redundant procedures. It also has to eliminate 
authoritativeness and other disturbing attitudes. This way 
people will see that the banking sector truly serves the 
people's interests and the national economy. The trust of the 
people and customers is a decisive element for the 
competitiveness of the state bank 21/03] in Vietnam. This is 
a dangerous trend and we need to be careful, especially when 
using the U.S. dollar to lend and repay capital and interest. 
We have to prepare positively and start as early as possible to 
carry out all operations of exchange, trade, and liquidation for 
goods and services using Vietnamese currency. All 
establishments with income in foreign currencies should sell 
those currencies to banks. Business establishments, according 
to operations demands, presently can keep suitable amounts of 
foreign currencies in their bank accounts for use to import 
supplies and materials for production activities or to expand 
business. Banks should ensure that business establishments can 
easily purchase foreign currencies whenever needed. Banks 
should operate in accordance with the economic structure and not 
rely on administrative orders to buy and sell foreign currencies. 
  Bank liquidation operations made some progress, but they are 
mainly manual and backward when compared with foreign banks. 
The target for the year 1994 is for banks to guarantee their 
liquidating ability in all situations, using faster and more 
convenient methods, and using less cash. This will attract more 
funds for bank reserves. Liquidation procedures through banks 
quickly should be modernized. Banks should have concrete plans 
for investment in technology and equipment modernization and use

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 20 -- The Mekong River delta 
provinces have got a record rice harvest this year in terms of 
acreage, yield and total output, a source from the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Industry said. 
  Some 1.09 million ha were put under the 1993-1994 
winter-spring rice crop in the whole region, an increase of 
60,000 ha as compared with the corresponding crop last year. By 
early April, farmers in these provinces harvested more than 
886,000 ha with an average yield of 4.82 tonnes per ha, up 0.3 
tonne over the previous crop. An Giang and Can Tho Provinces 
obtained the highest average yield of 6 tonnes per ha. 
Parlicularly some farmer households got 10 tonnes per ha. The 
Mekong delta provinces are expected to get 4.5 million tonnes 
of paddy, up 700,000 tonnes in comparison with the previous 
crop. The Mekong delta is Vietnam's biggest rice producer. 
Last year its total output of paddy stood at nearly 11 million 
tonnes, double the country's total paddy output in 1975.

  [Text] On behalf of the Government's Standing Committee, 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has approved the targeted 
development plan for the Bac Bo lowlands. The plan was 
presented at a recent meeting with chairmen of the people's 
committees of Hanoi and Haiphong Cities and of Quang Ninh, Ha 
Bac, and Hai Hung Provinces. 
  Under the plan, the cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ha Long 
of 
Quang Ninh Province will play a strategically important role in 
the socioeconomic stabilization and development program for the 
Bac Bo lowlands and the country as a whole. Hanoi, Haiphong, 
and Ha Long will become the entrances to the Bac Bo lowlands and 
key industrial centers. These cities show great potential in 
tourism, mineral resources, manpower, and sea-based economy. 
They also create many favorable conditions for exploiting and 
upgrading local sea port facilties to the same standards set by 
other sea ports in a number of Southeast Asian countries.

  [Text] Zhu Liang, chairman of the National People's 
Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, and his delegation arrived 
on 15 April on a visit to Thailand as guests of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Zhu Liang and his delegation paid a courtesy call on 
Parliament President Marut Bunnak yesterday morning. The two 
sides exchanged views on ways to strengthen contacts between the 
parliaments of the two countries and develop bilateral relations. 
  On 19 April, Zhu Liang and his delegation paid courtesy 
calls 
on Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan and Deputy Foreign 
Minister Surin Phitsuwan. During the meetings, Amnuai and Surin 
said that Thailand has attached great importance to friendly 
relations with China over the past 19 years. They expressed 
their hope that the two countries will expand bilateral 
cooperation in politics, trade, and other fields. They 
expressed the opinion that on the occasion of next year's 20th 
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the 
two countries should hold grand celebrations throughout the year 
to promote bilateral relations further. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Surin also suggested that a Chinese museum be built in Bangkok. 
Such a museum would highlight the origins and migrations of the 
Chinese people, important historical figures, and the 
development of Thailand-China relations in order to deepen the 
Thai people's understanding of the Chinese people. 
  Zhu Liang and his delegation visited Khon Kaen and Chiang 
Rai 
Provinces on 16 and 17 April to exchange views with officials 
concerned with the Quadrangle economic development project. 
  Zhu Liang and his delegation also attend a party hosted by 
Bangkok Bank President Chen Youhan [Chatri Sophonphanit] last 
night. The delegation will leave Bangkok for the Philippines

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Game is Prince Ranariddh Playing?"] </F>
  [Text] Looking back into the past, we cannot believe that 
the four warring Cambodian factions killed one another to the 
brink of extinction. A man whose life was saved by Thai 
soldiers during the Khmer Rouge offensive at Choam border pass 
near Surin Province is Prince Ranariddh, who is now a co-prime 
minister of Cambodia. Had the Thai artillery unit failed to 
rescue him from danger at Choam battlefield, the prince would 
not have become the prime minister nor would he have had the 
chance to behave so arrogantly as he is doing today. 
  As Prince Ranariddh and certain ministers of the Cambodian 
Government are making numerous slanderous accusations against 
Thailand to discredit our country in the eyes of the 
international community, we are pleased with the actions taken 
by our prime minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Armed 
Forces in the defense of our nation's image and prestige. We 
hail their tremendous tolerance and patience, otherwise we would 
have fallen into the trap set by the Cambodians. 
  Considering the situation, we can see that Prince Ranarridh 
is no different from the Bosnian Serbs who believe in national 
reunification through war with the intention of keeping other 
factions under their thumb and detesting national 
reconciliation. As a matter of fact, if the Cambodians want to 
prolong their genocidal war, that is their business, not ours. 
In reality, things turn out differently. Thailand has been 
accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It believes that Prince 
Ranariddh wants to use Thailand as the target of criticism to 
divert the attention of the Cambodian people away from other 
domestic difficulties. 
  Our government and Armed Forces must be patient in dealing 
with this problem. We know well that the Cambodian Government 
is now very weak. Soldiers and policemen have not received 
their salaries for several months and are living in agony. They 
can rise up against the government at any time. The longer the 
war drags on, the weaker the government will be due to depleting 
financial resources. Hence, the same old trick is employed to 
divert the people's attention to something outside the country 
so that they will not be aware of internal shortcomings. 
  From another point of view, Prince Ranariddh and several 
countries now investing in Cambodia are not happy with 
Thailand's growing economic and cultural influence in Cambodia. 
At the instruction of former colonialists, Prince Ranariddh 
deems it necessary to do something to eliminate the Thai clamp 
on Cambodia in exchange for military and economic assistance 
from other countries. Prince Ranariddh and his colleagues might 
be misled by old information and pictures provided by 
intelligence units of certain countries and blindly use them to 
substantiate his charges against Thailand. 
  The repetition of groundless accusations against Thailand is 
causing many countries to wonder about the truth of such 
allegations. Moreover, Cambodia reacts indifferently to 
Thailand's protests in this regard. Optimistically speaking, 
the Cambodians might now come to realize that they have made a 
mistake. Therefore, we must act wisely in order to assert our 
maturity. Let them continue killing one another as they wish.

  [Text] There was a report of heavy shelling inside 
Cambodia opposite Sa Kaeo Province on 21 April. According to 
the report, a group of about 200 Khmer Rouge forces of the 519th 
Division at 0500 on 21 April opened fire on a former Khmer Serei 
command post, which is now under control of the Cambodian 
Government, at Boeng Ta Kuan in Thmar Puok District, Banteay 
Meanchey Province, about 20 km from Ta Phraya District, Sa Kaeo 
Province. As a result, people's houses and markets were 
damaged; government soldiers were running away from the attack. 
The shelling continued until afternoon. About 600 Cambodian 
people, mainly children and the elderly, crossed the border into 
Thailand's Ban Khlong Phaeng, Tambon Thapsadet, Taphraya 
District. Thai soldiers and policemen disarmed them and gave 
them help on humanitarian grounds. General Atchawin 
Sawetserani, Burapha Task Force deputy commander, ordered that a 
temporary shelter be given to those people until the fighting 
inside Cambodia calms down. They will be pushed back once the 
shelling stops.

  [Text] KHMER Rouge guerrillas attacked a Cambodian 
government border village yesterday, killing about 20 civilians 
and sending some 1,000 civilians fleeing across the border to 
Thailand. 
  Over 200 guerrillas launched a pre-dawn attack on Boeng 
Trakuon village, which was defended by about the same number of 
government troops headed by Lt Gen Chea Tun. 
  Thai military sources said the Khmer Rouge appear to have 
routed the defenders and captured the base, which is located 
opposite Ban Ta Phraya of Ta Phraya district. 
  A black market at Boeng Trakuon, an ammunition dump and a 
storage bungalow were burned down by the guerrillas. 
  The blaze sent big black plumes of smoke twisting into the 
sky which were seen from the Thai side of the border. 
  Cambodian army major Kong Savin, who fled to Ban Ta Phraya 
with the refugees, said at least 20 civilians were killed and an 
unknown number were captured. He said the Khmer Rouge attack 
caught the government forces by surprise. 
  He added that the guerrillas had threatened to kill every 
man 
who was seen wearing an army uniform. 
  Maj Kong said he deeply appreciated Thailand's humanitarian 
support for the refugees. 
  Col Atchawin Sawetserani, deputy commander of the Burapha 
Task Force, said he had received a report that 628 Cambodian 
refugees had arrived in Thailand and the number was still 
increasing. 
  The refugees, he said, will be given refuge and food. 
  But armed Cambodian soldiers will be disarmed, he added. 
  The colonel added that the refugees would be repatriated as 
soon as possible to safe areas where there is no fighting. 
  He said the border passes at Phnom Phra and Phnom Chat would 
be the repatriation route. 
  He also warned that the Thai military would retaliate if 
stray shells land in Thailand. 
  "Only one artillery shell landed on the Thai side yesterday, 
but there has been lots of small arms fire," said the colonel, 
acknowledging that the cross-border firing might be accidental. 
  A military source said Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been 
spotted advancing towards Thmar Puok which is the head quarters 
of the 7th Division.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Premeditated Military Buildup </F>
Maneuvers"] 
  [Text] The U.S. imperialists' military buildup maneuvers 
to provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula have become more 
unscrupulous. According to a report on the testimony at a 
subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 18 
April, (Rowen), assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Defense, revealed that the United States would deploy anew to 
South Korea one brigade of military equipment, including tanks, 
howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. 
  Stating that the United States is pushing ahead with a new 
strategy of deploying various types of firing instruments and 
combat equipment on naval ships in South Korean waters and in 
the waters surrounding it, (Rowen) babbled that, through this 
strategy, the United States could more quickly deploy stronger 
ground forces to battles and that it was correcting the problem 
of a lengthy deployment of tanks and other heavy weaponry to 
battle sites, as took place during the Persian Gulf war. 
  This is part of the premeditated military buildup maneuvers 
designed to take a preemptive attack on our republic and openly 
reveals the U.S. criminal attempt to ignite a nuclear war. 
  A tense situation still prevails on the Korean peninsula. 
This is totally because of the treacherous acts by the United 
States. As everyone knows well, the United States made it clear 
domestically and internationally through a DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement that it wants to resolve the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula peacefully, that it will not use force of arms, 
including nuclear weapons, against the other side, and that it 
will not even threaten the other side with such a force of arms. 
  Completely overturning the agreement made at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York, however, the United States is concentrating 
its large-scale aggression Armed Forces in South Korea and in 
the area surrounding it, babbling that it will not rule out a 
preemptive attack against us and that it will suspend the 
North's nuclear development even at the risk of a war, and, 
thus, staging every day a provocative war exercise for a 
northward invasion. 
  Following the recent deployment of offensive-purpose Apache 
helicopters to South Korea, Patriot missiles arrived in Pusan on 
18 April. It is also said that aggression forces and missile 
equipment loaded on other transport ships will arrive in South 
Korea soon to complete the deployment of the Patriot missile 
unit to the frontline area. 
  In addition, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South 
Korea and had a conspiratorial war conference with puppet 
military bosses. His junket to South Korea was not only a junket 
for frontline command [ilson chihwi haenggak] designed to 
convert the puppets' plan for a northward invasion into 
practice, but is also a junket to conspire to organize combined 
armed forces against us, which is a phenomenon that we can see 
usually on the eve of a war. 
  The fact that at this juncture the assistant secretary of 
the 
U.S. Department of Defense revealed the United States would 
deploy military equipment, including tanks, howitzers, and 
multiple rocket launchers, to South Korea vividly shows that the 
U.S. imperialists are attempting to further reinforce their 
force of arms on the Korean peninsula in order to provoke a war 
of Northward invasion at any cost. This also clearly proves 
that it is none other than the United States who is leading the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and that 
they have no intention at all to solve the nuclear issue by 
means of dialogue. 
  It is evident to everyone that when, following the 
deployment 
of Patriot missiles, heavy weaponry such as tanks, howitzers, 
and multiple rocket launchers are deployed to South Korea, the 
situation on the Korean peninsula will be further aggravated. 
  The U.S. imperialists are busily moving in order to provoke 
a 
war of northward invasion. The U.S. imperialists' inherent 
nature of aggression has not changed at all. The United States, 
which became the only superpower after the end of the cold war, 
now acts more arrogantly, further strengthening its military 
threat and blackmail against small countries and, particularly, 
on those countries advancing toward independence. This finds 
expression in the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers for arms buildup 
and war on the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that they cannot 
subdue or frighten our people with military threats or blackmail. 
  We are prepared for both dialogue and war. If someone 
provokes us, our people and People's Army will retaliate on the 
rascal a thousand-fold. Our people, who regard independence as 
life, will sternly punish any aggressor and resolutely defend 
the nation's sovereignty. 
  The South Korean puppets should not run wild 
indiscriminately, fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
Thursday [21 April] began to deploy new-type Patriot missiles in 
the central sector of the front after shipping them into South 
Korea despite the resolute protest and denunciation from the 
Korean people and broad world public, according to Seoul-based 
radio No. 1. 
  This is an open challenge to the DPRK. It is aimed at posing 
military threat to the DPRK and mounting a preemptive strike on 
it. 
  The United States began to deploy the Patriot in the central 
sector of the front, while crying over "threat of attack" from 
the North. This is a dangerous, deliberate military action to 
make the situation on the Korean peninsula more unstable and, 
further, ignite a new war. 
  The deployment of Patriot missiles in broad daylight shows 
that the U.S. authorities remain indifferent to the armistice 
agreement and the armistice body and readily reverse any 
commitment in order to attain their aggressive design. 
  The U.S. imperialists must act with discretion, clearly 
mindful what grave consequences would arise from the deployment 
of the Patriot in South Korea which poses a grave threat to 
peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far East.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry's three-day visit to South Korea was a war 
monger's trip aimed at examining the war preparations against 
the North on the spot and giving a new order to the puppets. 
  During his trip, Perry held military confabs with the 
traitor 
Kim Yong-sam, the puppet defence minister and the puppet foreign 
minister and framed a series of dangerous intrigues such as 
resumption of the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers this 
year, reinforcement of U.S.-South Korea combined forces, 
strengthening of a "cooperation system" and promotion of 
"sanctions against the North" at the United Nations Security 
Council. 
  This was an unpardonable criminal act which would bring the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a crisis and might cause a 
dangerous event. 
  Perry did not forget to cry over the "provocation" of the 
North. But this was intended to justify the aggressive design of 
the United States. 
  It goes without saying that the military provokers on the 
Korean peninsula are the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique that deployed new-type Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and plan to extensively introduce tanks, howitzers, 
multiple rocket vehicles and other means of war. 
  The warhawk Perry's visit to South Korea and war confabs 
show 
well that the U.S. authorities have no willingness to settle the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and 
negotiation but they are working hard to stifle the DPRK with 
strength. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the Kim Yong-sam group invited 
the U.S. defense secretary for a "close cooperation system" and 
held war confabs with him against fellow countrymen. This 
eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of 
never-to-be-condoned traitors hell-bent on war provocations 
against the North with the sinister intention to slay fellow 
countrymen in collusion with outside forces as a war servant of 
the United States. 
  Although the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet 
clique are trying to strengthen the "cooperation system" and 
overpower the DPRK with strength, it is a foolish dream. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs 
must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful that their 
persistent line of war and confrontation will lead to their own 
destruction.

  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, flying into Seoul 
despite South Korean people's strong opposition and rejection, 
is holding a series of war conferences [chonjaeng moui] with the 
Kim Yong-sam ring. 
  On 20 April, Perry held a conference with traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and discussed measures to jointly deal with the North's 
so-called nuclear issue and the issue of building up the 
U.S.-South Korean combined forces. The nation-selling traitor 
Kim Yong-sam, raving that a close joint cooperation system and 
arms buildup posture are essential to the solution of the 
North's nuclear problem, begged his U.S. master to sell more 
weapons to South Korea. 
  Perry and the Kim Yong-sam ring demanded again our acceding 
to the additional inspection [chuga sachal] by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the unjustness of which has already been 
clearly proven, and decided to push ahead with the UN Security 
Council's sanctions on the North, according to a report. 
  In the conference, the two of them agreed that the South 
Korean puppets will introduce a mobile ultra-modern radar 
equipment from the United States soon and that the United States 
will predeploy heavy weaponry for brigade-scale rapid deployment 
forces to South Korea. 
  On the same day, Perry held a secretive conference with the 
puppet defense minister as well. The two of them, raving about 
the North's fictitious nuclear issue, agreed to maintain a joint 
cooperation system, to build up arms, and to conduct the 
criminal Team Spirit war exercise, according to a report. In 
the conference, Perry explained a U.S. plan to build up the 
combat capability of the combined forces, including the 
additional deployment of heavy weaponry to South Korea, and the 
modernization plan of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. 
  In the talks between Perry and the puppet foreign minister 
held on the same day, the two of them discussed joint measures 
for the phase of tension [kinjang kungmyon] and agreed to grope 
for various measures, including economic sanctions against us, 
according to a report. 
  On 20 April, while the very dangerous war fever for 
northward 
invasion was actively inspired, Perry did not hesitate to make a 
violent remark threatening someone that the military situation 
on the Korean peninsula should not be miscalculated. 
  In the meantime, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. Defense 
Department disclosed that the Patriot missiles deployed in South 
Korea will soon be positioned for actual combat deployment. 
  The war conference between the U.S. secretary of defense and 
the Kim Yong-sam ring reveals how recklessly the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets are going wild to 
accelerate at the final practical stage the preparations for a 
nuclear war of northward invasion to crush [apsal] us under the 
pretext of the fictitious North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Because of the frenzied war provocation commotions of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, the situation on 
the Korean peninsula is dashing minute by minute to a dangerous 
brink of war. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets should be aware of what dire consequences their war 
frenzy will bring them, refrain from rash acts, and act with 
discretion.

  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul on 19 April, 
the puppet Navy Operational Command staged a so-called joint 
chemical, biological, and radiological exercise with the 23d 
Chemical Battalion of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. In 
this war exercise, which was aimed at waging a port blockade in 
Chinhae District, the racals clamored about a perfect posture, 
improvement of the capability of technique and tactics for an 
actual war, and the like, thus, inspiring war fever. 
  That the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet 
clique 
which are frantically running wild in arms buildup for a 
northward invasion are constantly waging a new military 
commotion proves that the rascals are further driving the 
situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists staged a nighttime airborne refueling exercise for 
a northward invasion on 18 and 19 April. 
  For this war exercise, two KC-130 refueling planes from an 
overseas base were deployed to a U.S. air base in South Korea in 
the afternoon of 18 April. These refueling planes, which were 
mobilized on the skies over the sea off Kunsan around 2100 hours 
[1200 GMT], that day refueled some 50 various types of 
fighters-bomber and assault fighters, flying between Oeyon 
island and Taehuksan island until dawn of the next day. 
  This war exercise, which was frantically staged under the 
cover of fighters from U.S. air bases in Japan, was aimed at 
improving the capability of nighttime airborne refueling to 
airplanes mobilized from overseas air bases and long-range 
airplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Forces unit in South Korea 
and the puppet Air Force for a northward invasion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets on April 20 staged an air war 
exercise against the North simulating a surprise bombing on 
targets with the mobilisation of more than 300 fighter-bombers, 
assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes 
after creating an electronic jamming in the skies above Chungju, 
Yongwol, Wonju, Kanghwa Island, Pochon and Yonchon of South 
Korea, according to military sources. 
  This exercise staged under the command of an E-3 early 
warning plane was a very dangerous war gamble aimed at a 
surprise strike at the northern half of Korea. 
  This vividly shows that the U.S. imperialists are racing 
headlong along the road of confrontation and war on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The American Friends 
Service Committee in a recent statement urged the United States 
to stop utterance threatening military action and resume talks 
with the DPRK. 
  The statement warned that the U.S. deployment of Patriot in 
South Korea, resumption of Team Spirit joint military maneuvers 
and pursuit of international "sanctions" would only aggravate 
the tensions and increase threat to the DPRK. 
  Therefore, the only way of relaxing the tensions is 
dialogue, 
said the statement. 
  The statement demanded that the United States put the final 
stop to the Team Spirit maneuvers, withdraw its troops from 
South Korea, reduce its nuclear weapons and equitably apply the 
nuclear non-proliferation policy to all countries so as to take 
the lead in the promotion of the denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula and the rest of the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Foreign public circles 
denounce the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and express 
support and solidarity for the Korean people's struggle of 
justice. 
  The chairman of the Central Committee of the National Union 
of Democratic Youth of Nepal in his speech at a mass rally in 
Katmandu on April 8 condemned the U.S. hostile policy toward the 
DPRK. 
  The ralliers adopted a letter of protest to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and marched toward the U.S. Embassy shouting 
slogans with the placards "U.S. Imperialists, Promptly Stop 
Campaign Against North Korea Over Nuclear Issue" and "U.S. 
Imperialists, Quit Korean Peninsula." They handed the letter 
signed by 100 political and public figures to the U.S. Embassy. 
The letter demanded that the United States pull all its troops 
and nuclear weapons out of South Korea and give up the projected 
"sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  At a solidarity meeting held in Cuba earlier, the U.S. 
campaign against the DPRK was denounced and support and 
solidarity were expressed for the Korean people's just struggle. 
  A letter to the Korean people was adopted at the meeting. 
  The French Institute for the Development of International 
Relations in a communique April 6 expressed full support and 
solidarity for the Korean people's just stand toward the 
situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula. 
  Pierre Welo Ahondju Ewale, chairman of the Zaire-Korea 
Friendship Association, in a statement April 5 stressed that the 
United States must sincerely approach the unshakable attitude of 
the DPRK Government to find a peaceful, negotiated solution to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great September First Revolution of 
the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, denounced 
the nuclear threat of the United States to the DPRK at the 
second lawyers conference of Libya held in Tarabulus over April 
14-16. 
  In his speech he charged that the United States was using 
the 
United Nations as a tool for suppressing the people and abusing 
it for the attainment of its aims. "The confrontation today is a 
confrontation with imperialism," he said. 
  Saying he did not pin any hope on the UN Charter which had 
already been violated and destroyed, he went on: 
  "Has North Korea occupied Kuwait? Or has it reached the 
nuclear arms on the earth? Is this the reason why they abuse 
and threaten North Korea and attempt to strike it? Aren't they 
going too far? 
  "We must fight a bloody fight against imperialism. We will 
fight to the last man to defend our rights."

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets' Nuclear Waste Dumping Denounced" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Working people in 
Pyongyang held a mass rally today to bitterly denounce the South 
Korean puppets' criminal dumping of nuclear waste. 
  Hwang sang chun, chairman of the State Environmental 
Commission, and representatives of various strata took the floor. 
  The speakers branded the South Korean rulers' nuclear waste 
dumping in the sea as an anti-national, anti-human crime that 
can be committed only by those indifferent to the existence of 
the nation and international law and as a never-to-be-condoned 
crime in cutting the lifeline of the nation. 
  The South Korean puppets dumped as much as 11,000 trillion 
bequerel of nuclear waste in the sea in the 1986-1992 period. 
  In South Korea, even the Raktong River has been contaminated 
with radioactive material, causing a big public stir. 
  The speakers said due to the South Korean puppets' nuclear 
waste dumping, fishes in South Korean waters have disappeared, 
the haul of myongthae has diminished to ten percent, undaria 
pinnatifida and other sea resources have been exterminated and 
women often give birth to deformed babies. 
  They pointed out that the nuclear waste dumping is getting 
more grave and dangerous with the nuclear arms development 
promoted in secrecy in South Korea. 
  The South Korean puppets started to develop nuclear weapons 
under the "nuclear umbrella" of U.S. imperialism long ago and 
now they are promoting nuclear arms development, possessed of 
reprocessing facilities. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam unilaterally scrapped the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The speakers denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for massively 
shipping Patriot and other means of nuclear war to South Korea 
and desperately working to unleash a war while crying for an 
"international cooperation system" and "military countermove" 
over the faked-up "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  They demanded that the South Korean puppet clique 
unconditionally stop the nuclear arms development, discard the 
intention of igniting a new war in collusion with outside forces 
and step down without delay.

<F P=106> ["Criminals Must Face Justice" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA)--Members of Greenpeace, 
an international organisation of environmental movement, held an 
anti-nuke rally in Samchok, South Korea, together with members 
of South Korean organisations of environmental and anti-nuke 
movement, at which they urged the puppet authorities to stop the 
construction of an atomic power station, sounding warning 
against the danger of radioactive leakage from it. 
  This is an expression of the unshakable will of the members 
of Greenpeace and the South Korean people not to tolerate the 
criminal acts of the South Korean puppets in dumping nuclear 
waste in the sea to destroy the ecological environment of the 
Korean nation and mankind, declares MINJU CHOSON in a commentary 
today. 
  The analyst says: 
  Nuclear waste dumping in the sea by the South Korean puppets 
is a heinous crime in reducing the Korean peninsula and its 
surrounding waters to a barren region contaminated with nuclear 
substance and a wanton violation of the international law and 
convention banning nuclear waste dumping in the sea. 
  It is quite natural that Greenpeace members conducted 
anti-nuke activities in South Korea together with the local 
people. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group continue to dump nuclear waste in 
the sea and wreck ecological environment while accelerating the 
development of nuclear weapons, ignoring the unanimous protest 
of the people at home and abroad, it will face a stern judgement 
by the whole nation and the world people.

different countries expressed full support to the Korean 
people's cause of national reunification and their efforts for a 
peaceful solution of the nuclear issue. 
  Meles Zenawi, president of the transitional Government of 
Ethiopia, when he met a DPRK Government delegation on April 15, 
expressed solidarity for the struggle of the Korean people to 
achieve an independent and peaceful reunification of their 
country, and supported the DPRK's stand to solve the nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula peacefully through DPRK-USA talks. 
  Prime Minister of Uganda George Kosmas Adyebo when he met a 
delegation of the DPRK Foreign Ministry on April 14, expressed 
support and solidarity for the just cause of the Korean 
Government and people for the reunification of the country by 
means of confederacy. He said he firmly supports Korea's stand 
to peacefully solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula 
through the DPRK-USA talks. 
  Antoine Malonga, chairman of the Congolese Movement for the 
Construction of New Society, when he received the DPRK 
ambassador to his country on April 9, denounced the anti- 
socialist, anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its

defensive measures of the DPRK.

socialism, he stressed.

  The secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist 
Party of Australia in a statement April 11 urged the United

implement the policy based on non-interference in the internal 
affairs of sovereign states.

<F P=106> ["Papers Rap at Anti-Chongnyon Rowdyism" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- More than 70 gangsters 
belonging to an ultra-rightist organization of Japan, "the Kanto 
Council of the Great Japan Patriots Union" kicked up a row in 
Tokyo on April 19, shouting "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and 
"North Korea, promptly stop nuclear threat to Japan." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this was an 
organised and premeditated provocative act perpetrated under the 
backstage manipulation of the Japanese authorities for a 
sinister political purpose. 
  The analyst says: 
  This rowdyism staged in Japan in broad daylight was also a 
product of the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy toward the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their moves against 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon.) 
  Drawing attention to the fact that the incident occurred at 
a 
time when the United States was intensifying its aggressive and 
belligerent moves on the Korean peninsula and shortly after the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam toured Japan, the analyst continues: 
  Chongnyon is an authoritative and dignified organization of 
overseas citizens of the DPRK. We will decisively cope with the 
attack on Chongnyon and its subsidiary organizations and 
Japan-resident Koreans, regarding it as an attack on the DPRK. 
  The Japanese authorities boasting of Japan being "a 
constitutional state" took no step to check the incident that 
occurred in the city center of Tokyo. 
  They must now make a thoroughgoing investigation into the 
incident, apologize for it, arrest and punish all the criminals 
responsible for the provocation, make clear the truth behind the 
incident and take responsible steps to prevent the reccurence of 
such incidents. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says: 
  If an unhappy thing occurred due to the sinister acts of the 
reactionary forces against Chongnyon and its branch organs, we 
will regard it as a provocation against the DPRK and call the 
Japanese authorities to account for it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The fact-finding group 
on the forcible drafting of Koreans on April 18 discovered among 
documents kept at the U.S. National Archives lists of about 
10,000 Korean workers and women who were taken away by the 
Japanese imperialists for forced labour and as "comfort women 
for the army" during the Second World War, according to a KYODO 
report. 
  It was learned that the names of Korean workers and women 
drafted for forced labour and as "comfort women for the army" 
were in the lists of 180,000 soldiers of the former "Japanese 
Imperial Army" and civilian personnel who were taken prisoners 
of war by the allied forces in the Philippines. 
  The group plans to make public the lists soon.

delegation of the Workers Home of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
headed by its Deputy General Secretary Ebadati Esrafil Sarigihe. 
  The head of the delegation said he extended congratulations 
to the great leader His Excellency President Kim Il-song on his

  I am convinced that although the United States, with huge 
Armed Forces deployed in and around South Korea, tries to 
destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through 
military aggression, the people under the guidance of 
illustrious leaders, the people with revolutionary faith in 
their leaders will certainly win, he said. 
  Noting that the United States is now using the UN Security 
Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other 
international organisations as means of putting pressure on 
progressive countries, he stressed the United States would bump 
into resistance of revolutionary countries and meet its doom 
finally.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The "Ilso" books 
publishing house in Seoul has printed and distributed more than 
2,800 copies of books of the northern half of the country, 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  In September last year, this publishing house procured the 
literary and art work "Smelters" and other books of the northern 
half of the republic through a dissident academic organisation 
and reprinted it. 
  Upset by this, the fascist clique reportedly detained Pak 
Chi-kwan, chief editor of the house, on April 21 on charges of 
violation of the notorious "National Security Law".

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Korea is putting big 
efforts into agricultural production this year, too. 
  According to the state budget for 1994, a huge amount of 
fund, or up 6 percent from last year, will go to the 
agricultural sector. 
  This year, Korea will consolidate the achievements of the 
rural technical revolution which has been completed in the main 
and bring its might into full play and further expand and 
develop the successes in mechanization and extensive application 
of chemicals in keeping with the high level of irrigation and 
electrification. 
  Many farm machines of various kinds are supplied to the 
countryside to develop the comprehensive mechanization of 
agriculture to a higher level. Only recently, 500 tractors and 
250 trucks were supplied at a time to Chongdan, Yonan and 
Paechon Counties. 
  Large quantities of various chemical fertilizers are 
produced 
and supplied as well. 
  Last year, the state allocated funds, or up 2.8 percent from 
the previous year, to agriculture. 
  One of the most important successes registered in the 
countryside of Korea last year is that an unusual bumper harvest 
was reaped even under the unfavorable weather conditions.

<F P=106> ["Calculation for People" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Tongil Street in 
Pyongyang is lined with rows of superhigh apartment houses of 
tower, folding screen and other styles for tens of thousands of 
families and public welfare facilities along the bank of the 
River Taedong. All the several-room flats of the street ensure 
conditions for the living of the dwellers on the highest level. 
The state has provided people gratis with these houses built at 
a colossal cost. The DPRK does not count money, if it is for the 
people. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said that national fund 
must not be spared in providing people with a happy life, 
stating: "This is my arithmetic and the calculating system of 
the Workers' Party of Korea." 
  When the construction of factories, hospitals, recreation 
facilities and other objects was projected, he acquainted 
himself first of all with their usefulness for the people before 
calculating its cost and, when he found them needed to the 
people, he saw to it that they were built on the highest level 
without delay. 
  It was in September 1979 when the Pyongyang maternity 
hospital with a plottage of 43,000 square metres and a floor 
space of over 60,000 square metres was under construction. 
While acquainting himself with the progress of the project, he 
learned that it was designed to cover some corridor floors with 
artificial stones. He gave instructions to cover all the 
corridor floors and indoor stairs with marbles, asking where 
else marble should be used if not for the hospital which would 
be a palace for the "kings" of the country. He earnestly said 
jewels must be used for the designs, saying nothing must be 
spared for the children, no matter how much it might cost. Thus, 
the floor of the central entrance hall was covered with "a jewel 
carpet". A total of 35 tons of natural jewels were used in this. 
  Under his benevolent care 20 years ago, a TV relay tower was 
erected for a few families in a remote village of lumberjacks in 
Chagang Province, a branch school built for two children on a 
beacon islet and a railway station set up for a few school 
children. 
  It was under the boundless care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for 
the people that Pyongyang and local cities have taken on grand 
looks and many monumental architectures including the Changgwang 
health complex, the ice rink, the Chongnyu restaurant, the Grand 
People's Study House and the Hamhung dental preventive hospital 
have been built in the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Several scientific 
films have been released of late by the Korean scientific and 
educational film studio. 
  The scientific film "Lactic Acid Drink Made of Water 
Strained 
Off Coagulating Bean Curd" introduces an easy method of making 
the drink. 
  The water in which bean is swollen and the water strained 
off 
coagulating bean curd contain different kinds of nutritious 
ingredients. When they are fermented by putting lactobacilli 
into them, they are turned into a good lactic acid drink. 
  It is good for daily drinking and is highly effective in 
promoting the digestive functions and preventing and curing 
colitis and other diseases. 
  The scientific film "Magnet and Fur" shows the mechanism of 
the device of cleaning fur from boilers, telling it will pay off 
profusely if it is installed at all places where fur forms. 
  Besides, the studio has made scientific films of different 
themes such as "Production of Methane in Winter", "Calcining Egg 
Coal", "King Tongmyong and His Tomb" and "Taekwon-do and Health".

<F P=106> [By Minnie Cadlina] </F>
  [Text] Senator Ernesto Maceda (NPC-Nationalist People's 
Coalition) yesterday urged the government to resume an all-out 
war with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's 
Army (CPP-NPA), who, he said, are not really interested in 
negotiating for peace. 
  In pushing for the resumption of hostilities with the 
CPP-NPA, Maceda said it is time for the government to take a 
hardline position with the communist rebels since the peace 
talks have been dragging for two years now with no substantial 
agreements. 
  "It has come to a point where we should ask whether we are 
getting anywhere with the peace process with the NPA," he said. 
  Maceda, chairman of the crime committee, made the statement 
in reaction to a radio message of "Comrade Roger" Rosal 
commander of the Melito Glor Command, accusing President Ramos 
of "coddling criminals" in reference to Leopoldo "Comrade 
Hector" Mabilangan. 
  He said Ramos should not let the accusation pass as he urged 
the president to order the deployment of six to eight battalions 
around Mt. Banahaw in the Sierra Madre mountain "to flush out" 
Rosal, who has admitted masterminding Mabilangan's killing. 
  Mabilangan was sentenced to death by a "people's court" 
which 
found him guilty of involvement in kidnapping and carnapping 
activities. 
  He said government should stop worrying about committing any 
act that would jeopardize the peace negotiation since even the 
communist rebels are not interested in pursuing the peace 
process. 
  "I say we scrap it (peace negotiatian) and resume an all-out 
war with the NPA," he said. 
  "They (CPP-NPA) have no public support anyway and they have 
become less dedicated in their ways. They have turned to 
banditry," he added. 
  Asked if he was not worried about derailing the peace 
process, he said, "what is there to derail? There is nothing 
happening." 
  It would be recalled that Maceda reportedly became a target 
of the NPA in 1989 for alleged corruption.

  [Text] Several armed regulars of the New People's Army 
(NPA) who have availed of the government's amnesty program have 
questioned the authority of communist leaders Jose Ma. Sison and 
Luis Jalandoni, both living in exile in the Netherlands, in 
preventing members of the local communist movement from getting 
involved in the government's ongoing peace process. 
  This was disclosed yesterday by Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, a 
member 
of the government peace panel, who conducted a dialogue with 
several rebel returnees in Tuguegarao, Cagayan. 
  Biazon said that the NPA leaders who attended the dialogue 
have criticized Sison and Jalandoni for issuing statements in 
behalf of the entire communist movement. They stressed that the 
two had lost the moral authority to lead them because of their 
prolonged absence in the country. 
  "We are tired of these leaders (Sison and Jalandoni) who 
always speak for us," Biazon quoted the NPA guerrillas in 
Tuguegarao as saying. 
  Biazon said the local NPA group from Naguilian, Isabela, and 
Gattaran, Cagayan, had completely detached themselves from the 
influence of the Netherlands-based communist leaders. 
  In their previous pronouncements, Sison and Jalandoni have 
rejected President Ramos' Amnesty Proclamation No. 347 for 
insurgents as they questioned the government's sincerity in its 
reconciliatory moves with various rebel groups. 
  Biazon said that a big number of local NPA guerrillas in 
Cagayan "are very much interested in the peace process but many 
are still worried about the pending court cases against them." 
  Similar dialogues were conducted between government 
representatives led by Biazon and NPA surrenderees in Iligan and 
Davao City during the past few days. 
  Meanwhile, Biazon called for an investigation of the alleged 
arbitrary arrest of rebel returnee, identified as Domingo 
Tagade, in Isabela by local police forces. 
  Tagade, who surrendered to the government in 1989 and later 
applied for amnesty, was charged with rebellion in Isabela. 
  Biazon requested the Philippine National Police (PNP) to 
submit a formal report regarding the arrest which, he claimed, 
is not in accordance with the government's peace program with 
the communists. 
  "Any pending court cases against rebel returnees who came 
out 
and surrendered should be suspended pending the outcome of the 
congressional hearings on the amnesty proclamations," he 
stressed.

  [Text] The military leadership today denied involvement 
in a plot to liquidate Jose Ma. Sison, exiled leader of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National 
Democratic Front [CPP-NPA-NDF]. This was revealed by Lieutenant 
General Arturo Enrile, Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP] 
chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler, AFP vice chief of 
staff, in reaction to Sison's accusation. 
  Enrile emphasized that any attempt on the life of any of the 
communist movement's leaders will only destroy the peace process 
pushed by government. 
  Meanwhile, Filler said that there is no report of any such 
plan monitored by the AFP Intelligence Service. Filler 
clarified that it is Sison's group who are doing things that are 
destructive to them in the first place, like murder, kidnapping, 
and robbery. 
  [Begin recording in English] [Enrile] Why should we do that 
in the first place. You know, we are part of that sincere 
effort for peace in this country. If that is done, that will 
only derail whatever peace process that we are working out with 
the CPP-NPA-NDF. So, there is really no such thing. 
  [Filler] The Armed Forces of the Philippines do not operate 
that way. We view such an act as entirely counterproductive to 
the reconciliation process and our search for lasting peace.

<F P=106> [By Joe Macabalang] </F>
  [Text] Cotabato City -- A separate government peace 
negotiation with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is 
"not needed" as long as the ongoing peace talks between the 
government and its rival rebel front will implement the 1976 
Tripoli Pact, the MILF said yesterday. 
  However, Ghazali Gaafar, MILF vice chairman for political 
affairs, warned of a "more protracted and rigorous" struggle by 
Muslim rebels if the government's current peace talks with the 
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) bogs down anew. 
  Gaafar said the MILF "will not ask for more" as long as the 
government and the MILF will agree on the full implementation of 
the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. 
  "The success of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF 
talks depends much on the government's willingness to abide by 
such agreement," he added. 
  Gaafar refuted earlier reports that the MILF has had direct 
participations in earlier atrocities in Cotabato, Sultan 
Kudarat, and Maguindanao provinces to attract attention and 
"force" the government to hold separate talks with their front. 
  He said, the MILF consider the MNLF a "friendly force" and 
that there is no difference in the two fronts' objectives. 
  Sources said the sudden attitude of the MILF leadership 
towards its rival MNLF could be a result of the recent 
"consolidation dialog" between leaders of the two fronts, in a 
bid to strengthen the Bangsamoro rebels' revolutionary stature. 
  MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, in his "incognito visit" here 
last 
Good Friday, had avoided "to contemplate on the alternative to 
peace," a statement interpreted locally as a gesture of all-out 
efforts by the MNLF to end the peace talks successfully. 
  Corroborating Misuari's statement, Gaafar said, "there can 
be 
no other solution to the Mindanao problem except the grant of 
genuine autonomy in the area." 
  Both the MILF and the MNLF have been demanding for the full 
implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, which calls for 
the grant of autonomy in Mindanao. 
  Under the Aquino Administration, a plebiscite was conducted 
on the 13 provinces and 10 cities, but only four opted to join 
the Constitutionally-mandated Autonomous Region in Muslim 
Mindanao, an institution both the MNLF and MILF have rejected. 
  The agreement's implementation "in letter and in spirit" is 
the main agendum of the resumed RP-MNLF peace talks which began 
last year in Jakarta, Indonesia and resume this month or the 
next in the same host foreign country.

<F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera and Carla P. Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Come and get me. An alleged former official of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] issued this dare 
yesterday to CPP leader Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal in 
reaction to reports that a "people's court" was set to mete out 
death sentences to him and three former comrades in the 
underground movement. 
  "Let them shoot me," Ricardo Reyes, an alleged former member 
of the CPP Central Committee, told the INQUIRER. "I'm an easy 
target, anyway, going around, leading a normal life." 
  A report emanating from a rebel base in Sierra Madre quoted 
Rosal as saying a communist people's court was about to convene 
and hand down judgment on the four alleged former CPP officials. 
  The three others are Romulo Kintanar, reportedly a former 
chief of the New People's Army [NPA]; Arturo Tabara, alleged 
former head of the CPP Visayas Commission; and, Felimon Lagman, 
alleged leader of the CPP Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee. 
  Rosal, CPP spokesperson of the NPA Melitor Glor Command in 
Southern Tagalog, reportedly said all four were likely to suffer 
the same fate as Leopoldo "Ka Hector" Mabilangan, ousted leader 
of the NPA Banahaw Command. Mabilangan was shot dead in Sto. 
[Holy] Tomas, Batangas, on 3 April. 
  It was Rosal, too, who announced that Mabilangan had been 
sentenced to death by a CPP people's court and that his command 
carried out the execution. 
  "I will not be threatened by people who want to play god and 
who have no respect for due process," Reyes said. 
  He said nothing could distract him from working for the 
renewal of the rift-laden leftist movement. 
  Reyes is now identified with Siglo ng Paglaya [Century of 
Independence] (Siglaya), said to be a breakaway group from the 
Bagong Alyansang Makabayan [New Nationalist Alliance] (Bayan) 
and described in some quarters as part of the "third bloc" in 
the leftist movement. 
  Reyes, Kintanar, Tabara, and Lagman have become critics of 
CPP founder Jose Ma. Sison, now on self-exile in the Netherlands. 
  Sison, in turn, has called them "renegades," 
"counterrevolutionaries," and "agents of the government." 
  Lagman and Tabara have openly declared "autonomy" from the 
pro-Sison faction last year. 
  Tabara was captured on Negros Island in January. Blamed by 
the military for a series of kidnappings in Tiaong, Quezon, he 
is now detained in Fort Bonifacio. 
  Kintanar has kept a discreet silence since regaining freedom 
in 1992. 
  Reyes said there had never been a "people's court" but only 
a 
party-appointed one. 
  "Their kangaroo court has no rules of evidence to go by," he 
said, adding that he and the three others would likely be tried 
in absentio without benefit of counsel. 
  The judges in the "court," he said, would likely include 
Benito Tiamzon, allegedly the CPP vice chair; his wife Wilma 
Austria- Tiamzon; and, Leo Velasco and Armano Teng, believed to 
be top party leaders. 
  The four, Reyes pointed out, were the same people who had 
long indicted him, Tabara, Kintanar, and Lagman as 
counterrevolutionaries and agents of the government. 
  "We have this spectacle of the same people acting as 
accusers, prosecutors, fiscals, and judges rolled into one," he 
said. 
  Reyes said Rosal and his comrades must have forgotten one 
very important revolutionary dictum: "They can kill people but 
not ideas." 
  Rosal himself, along with several members of his command, 
was 
charged by the police last Friday with double murder and 
multiple frustrated in connection with the killing of Mabilangan 
and his aide, Alberto Remo, also known as Roberto Kumawan. 
[sentence as published] 
  A policeman, SP0 [expansion unknown] 2 Jaime Rivera, and two 
civilians were wounded in the attack. 
  On Negros Island, a CPP breakaway faction announced a plan 
to 
set up a new party and revolutionary organization to distinguish 
itself from the "Stalinist leadership of Sison." 
  Juanito Montano, commander of the Negros Island Regional 
Operational Command-Autonomous, said in a statement last Friday 
that the consolidation of revolutionary forces under the CPP-NPA 
"autonomous region" in Negros was going on "in preparation for 
putting up a new party, its own revolutionary army and 
alliances."

  [Text] Bacolod City -- A ranking New People's Army (NPA) 
official has confirmed that priest-turned-rebel Frank Fernandez 
has assumed leadership of the pro-Sison forces in Negros. 
  The rejectionist group of rebels under Arturo Tabara, 
however, described the leadership of Fernandez as "fake" and 
said it is not recognized by the NPA forces in Negros. 
  Fernandez is the secretary general of the National 
Democratic 
Front. 
  Estelito Dioquino, former NPA commander of Southern Negros, 
claimed majority of the NPA forces in Negros are supporters of 
the rejectionist group under Tabara, alias Victor del Mar, 
Communist Party of the Philippines Visayas Commission chairman.

  [Text] Leaders of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
[RAM] yesterday cited red tape in government as one of the most 
daunting hurdles in the peace process, saying this may undermine 
the sincerity of government negotiators. 
  Earlier, Ambassador Manuel Yan, presidential adviser on the 
peace process, had singled out the bureaucracy as one of the 
problems facing participants in the peace process. 
  He cited red tape as the reason behind the slow release of 
funds to the government negotiating panels. 
  Another official involved in the peace process said that if 
not for the initiative of some panel members, "the adverse 
effect of the bureaucracy on the peace process might have been 
worse than what has been reported so far." 
  Speaking at the Fernandina breakfast forum, RAM leaders 
again 
pointed to the fact that it took the government and RAM panels a 
year to thresh out "procedural matters." 
  Capt. Danilo Lim, RAM panel spokesman, said the delay in the 
peace talks between government and RAM was "purely bureaucratic." 
  "For example," he said, "it took three months to settle the 
issue on whether or not we could carry firearms for our own 
security, despite the fact that the government panel chairman 
himself, Prof. Alfredo Tadiar, had said this was a reasonable 
request." 
  RAM leaders also reiterated their call for "full-time 
negotiators" to sit on the government panel. "Kami, puwede 
kaming kausapin [They can talk to us], anytime," said Navy Capt. 
Proceso Maligalig, chairman of the RAM secretariat. 
  On the other hand, he said government panel members have 
"other duties" to fulfill other than negotiating with the RAM. 
"Yung pag- uusap, parang naging collateral duties lang [The 
peace talks seem to become their collateral duties]."

<F P=106> [Article by Amante E. Bigornia: "Two Ways of Looking at </F>
Military Rebellion"] 
  [Text] Whom to believe: President Ramos or Gringo 
[Gregorio] Honasan on the rebellious mood of the military? 
  The poser came up when the president praised former Armed 
Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia 
for supposedly having unified the military, in effect making the 
RAM or Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Alliance] of Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan 
irrelevant. 
  The commendation was given by Mr. Ramos when Abadia turned 
over the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] command to his 
successor, Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, former Philippine Army 
commander, at rites in Camp Aguinaldo last Tuesday. 
  The president said the AFP "has already put behind it the 
ravages of dissent and adventurism... The armed forces managed 
(during the three-year stint of Abadia as chief of staff) a 
remarkable turnaround and now we see a more united and 
professional corps of officers, enlisted personnel and civilian 
employees." 
  The day following, last Wednesday, Gringo belied the 
president's claims. The leader of the two failed military coups 
during the preceding administration dismissed the presidential 
claim as a hollow praise given willy-nilly during traditional 
retirement parades. 
  The conflicting views deserve some consideration. The 
government is holding simultaneous but separate peace 
negotiations, although currently stalled, with the military 
rebels and two other insurgent groups, the Communist Party of 
the Philippines/New People's Army, and the secessionist Moro 
National Liberation Front. 
  The problem posed by the mutinous military must have been 
serious when the group was included in the peace process 
initiated by Mr. Ramos immediately after his taking office 
almost two years ago. 
  However, things must have happened, either within the 
rebellious military or in the entire military establishment 
itself between then and now to justify the president's claim of 
unity in the Armed Forces. General Abadia had several informal 
talks with the mutinous military leaders, separate from the 
talks between them and a government panel. 
  On the other hand, General Abadia, only last February, 
accused the rebel leadership of allegedly using the liberty they 
enjoy during the negotiations to muster support in various 
military camps for their movement. 
  Gringo naturally denied this, claiming it was but natural 
for 
them to go around the military camps to talk shop with 
comrades-in-arms, specially old friends, after their long stay 
in the underground. 
  But Gringo did not deny that his group was still active. In 
fact, he reportedly claimed that they still had in their 
possession considerable arms and ammunition, presumably enough 
to mount another coup attempt. 
  At a recent social gathering, Gringo told this writer that 
the rebellious temper of the troops was spreading down to the 
enlisted men's level at a faster pace than imagined. "You'd be 
surprised how deep down the movement has gone," he said. 
  What was more astounding, he added with evident pride and 
satisfaction, was the growing support his group was getting from 
the civilian population. This, to us, was ominous. 
  For at the same gathering, other rebel leaders admitted, 
although not as a strategic mistake, that in the two real coup 
attempts against the Aquino administration, they did not make 
any effort to gain popular support before they staged their 
failed putsches. 
  If they staged a coup, would they have the support this time 
of the civilian population, which was the crucial element of the 
successful EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolt in 1986? 
  Their current activities do not seem geared towards 
generating active popular support -- or they could again be 
committing a miscalculation. 
  They have lately been attending press conferences, 
television 
talk shows and other information fora so often, their motives 
have elicited what might be wrong impressions. 
  Already, Gringo is suspected of wanting to be a senator, a 
position he could easily win. Asked if his group was fielding 
candidates in next year's elections, he said, "If the playing 
fields are level, we will consider it." 
  By this he might be entertaining ideas of shifting from a 
military to the parliamentary struggle to gain the reforms his 
group is fighting for. How effective that could be is open to 
question. 
  But he might be forgetting that his being seen, read and 
heard too often in person, in newspapers and on television could 
erode the glamour that surrounds his persona as well as the 
mystique his group has acquired not only by their failed 
adventures but also by their unknown, mysterious movements for 
many years. 
  Honasan, of course, is masculinely handsome and charismatic. 
But he is playing against the adage that no man is a hero to 
his valet, or the more popular saying that familiarity breeds 
contempt. 
  At any rate, by next year, according to law, the Philippine 
National Police (PNP) will take over from the Armed Forces the 
mission of solving the insurgency problem. With the 
anti-insurgency campaign taken away from it, the AFP would be 
nothing more than a reserve and training command, not an ideal 
source of mutiny. 
  It is unlikely that Gringo's group has or can make inroads 
into the PNP. For the most part, the mutinous officers are 
army, air force and navy officers, and their former comrades in 
the AFP who have joined the PNP are getting fat in the belly and 
therefore not keen on reform. 
  Mr. Ramos may have solved the RAM problem, but without the 
reforms in the military and civilian establishments that the 
rebels demand, the national recovery he hopes to achieve will be 
slow in coming.

<F P=106> [By Katherine Espina] </F>
  [Text] A new oil find has been discovered in the West 
Linapacan "A" field in Northwest Palawan, the Department of 
Energy (DOE) announced yesterday. 
  Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said President Ramos 
was informed yesterday of the latest find in West Linapacan, the 
country's biggest oil field. 
  The find was made as the West Linapacan consortium was 
drilling a sidetrack well dubbed as A-5 to stop water seepage in 
the original well. 
  Water encroachment in the Linapacan wells cut their 
production level from a high of 18,000 barrels a day (BOPD) 
early last year to 5,000 BOPD in December 1993. 
  Consortium representatives told DOE officials last Friday 
that the A-5 well encountered continuous very good oil shows in 
the limestone up to a depth of 8,020 feet. 
  The operators said the oil-water contact in the A-5 well is 
lower than that in the A-3 well, giving an additional 400 feet 
of oil column. 
  An energy department source said the discovery of a new oil 
section may boost the production of crude from West Linapacan. 
  The consortium also reported that the A-5 well may have 
combination gas and water drive which would enhance oil recovery. 
  Three drill stem tests (DST) are to be conducted in A-5 this 
week after which the well will be completed for production and 
hooked up the storage tanker. [sentence as published] 
  Alcorn (Production) Phils., Inc., the operator of the field, 
has a 23.4 percent stake in Linapacan. Its partners are 
Oriental Petroleum &amp; Minerals Corp. (36.6 percent); Basic 
Petroleum (11 percent); Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals (7.4 
percent); Alcorn Phils. Inc. (5.6 percent); Petrofields (5 
percent); Philodrill (4 percent); Seafront (4 percent); Unioil 
(2 percent); and Balabac Oil (1 percent). 
  Still on the oil sector, Shell Philippines Exploration Corp. 
(SPEX) and Occidental Petroleum are eyeing two of the world's 
biggest oil exploration firms as partners in the $2 billion 
worth development of the Camago-Malampaya field in Northwest 
Palawan, the largest gas find in the country. 
  An industry source said that Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco), 
one of the top ten oil exploration firms in the United States, 
and Total Corp., a French oil company, are negotiating 
separately with Shell and Oxy. 
  Arco recently won the geophysical and seismic exploration 
contract (GSEC) covering the Sulu Sea. 
  The source said that SPEX and Oxy, operators of the 
Camago-Malampaya field, are willing to offer up to 15 percent 
each to a foreign partner. Shell and Oxy each have a 50 percent 
stake in Camago-Malampaya. 
  Shell and Oxy have started inviting foreign oil companies to 
join the Camago-Malampaya development last February. 
  Shell and Oxy has shortlisted some five companies as 
possible 
partners which include Arco and Total. 
  Shell and Oxy are willing to accept investors who would be 
able to carry their share of a $2-billion project. 
  A 1 percent participating interest in Camago-Malampaya may 
be 
worth some $20 million. 
  Earlier, sources said that the two oil exploration companies 
were not inclined to dilute the ownership of the field. 
  Last February, Shell and Oxy started the drilling of two 
wells. 
  Two more wells are expected to be drilled to confirm 
reserves 
of three to five trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and a 
minimum of 100 million barrels. 
  Bomasang earlier said the Camago-Malampaya field could 
supply 
Luzon at least 600 million cubic feet of gas per day through an 
undersea pipeline. 
  The amount will be enough to sustain the fuel requirements 
of 
a 3,000-megawatt (Mw) power plant by the year 2000. 
  According to Bomasang, an early production system will 
produce oil at 20,000 to 50,000 barrels per day by 1996 and if 
the reserves are adequate, a final production system of 10,000 
to 20,000 BOPD would be set up by 1999.

  [Text] Initial capital investments of newly-registered 
domestic stock entities rose to P14.44 billion [Philippine 
pesos] in 1993 or 70 percent compared with P8.51 billion the 
previous year, data from the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) show. 
  This developed as a 14 percent increase in registrants was 
posted at 20,572 last year compared with 18,072 in 1992. 
  The finance sector led the upsurge with capital investments 
amounting to P7.99 billion, or 55 percent of the total. The 
manufacturing sector registered second, with P1.86 billion in 
investments. 
  Wholesale and retail trade, community, social, and personal 
services sectors followed closely with investments totalling 
P1.67 billion and P920.7 million, respectively. 
  The highest monthly figure was posted in January at P3.26 
billion, with P2.94 billion going to the financing insurance, 
real estate, and business service sector alone. 
  However, it plunged 83 percent to P558.9 million in February 
due to a corresponding sudden drop in investments in the finance 
sector to only P199.4 million. 
  Capital inflows remained stable for the months of March to 
June with a slight decrease in July where the year's lowest 
investment was listed at P781 million. From there, it gained an 
upward trend and peaked during the month of October with P1.86 
billion due to improvements in the power situation during the 
last quarter of 1993. However, this did not compare with 
January's record-breaking performance. 
  Despite the severe power crisis that crippled some 
manufacturing industries early last year, the sector posted 
investments totalling P1.86 billion -- the second highest among 
the major industries. 
  The agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sector remained at 
the tail-end of the investments race with only P179.5 million. 
This can be attributed to institutional problems like the lack 
of farm-to-market roads and inefficient irrigation systems. 
  Likewise, the electricity, gas, and water sector registered 
a 
modest performance with total fresh capital of P211 million, the 
second lowest among the industries. 
  To encourage private participation in the power industry, 
President Ramos issued Executive Order 215 which allowed the 
entry of the private sector into build-operate-transfer (BOT) 
contracts, and the streamlining of the approval process and 
regulatory framework of independent power producers (IPP). 
  Furthermore, efforts to revive the mining and quarrying 
sector went under way with the Senate's endorsement of the 
excise tax reduction scheme to make the industry more attractive 
to private capitalists. 
  Meanwhile, additional investments in existing domestic stock 
corporations and partnerships declined last year by 17.24 
percent to P26.30 million from P31.78 million in 1992. 
Likewise, a slight dip in the number of firms was experienced 
with 1,057 firms reinvesting in the country -- only three firms 
short of 1992 levels. 
  Capital inflows dropped from P2.64 million in December 1992 
to P0.89 million in the first month of 1993 with 71 firms 
putting in additional investments. 
  A better business climate was experienced during the second 
half of 1993 with reinvestments climbing from P1.89 million in 
June to an all-time high of P5.29 million in September. This 
development was, likewise, attributed to the improved power 
situation.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Finance Minister Sam Rangsi; date </F>
not given] 
  [Text] In Mr Michael Vickery's article entitled "Phnom Penh 
power plays" and published in your April 15, edition, the writer 
spoke of a "FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] faction, probably 
centered on Sam Rangsi, which is lukewarm towards monarchy, 
especially of the Sihanouk variety." 
  Strangely, within the space of just a few words, Mr Vickery 
managed to make two basic errors of fact with reference to 
myself. First, it is completely mistaken to believe that I lead, 
or indeed am part of, any "faction" within the FUNCINPEC party. 
Second, to suggest that I -- together with a "faction" within 
FUNCINPEC -- am anything but completely devoted to the monarchy 
and, in particular, to the person of His Majesty the King is not 
only deeply insulting but also indicates a profound ignorance of 
my views and of Cambodian politics.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 21 (KPL) -- The construction of 
the 156 km Vientiane-Vangviang section of road 13 north 
undertaken by the Road No.10 Construction Company is now 
completed. 
  The director of the road construction company, Mr. Savat 
Nokeo said that the construction project of the road section 
cost 15 million U.S. dollars, which was a loan from the World 
Bank. He said his company conducted the construction for three 
years. 
  He also said that his company was continuing with the 
construction of the 60 km Vangvieng-Kasi section of the same 
road. In addition, he said his company had received a contract 
from Tianjin Company of China, the contractor of road 13 south,

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Heads of the ruling 
coalition will endorse Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday 
[22 April] afternoon as a candidate for prime minister as 
coalition representatives struck a deal on a draft policy 
platform for a new cabinet early Friday. The prime ministerial 
election in both houses of the Diet is expected to be held 
Monday. 
  Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, is certain to be 
elected prime minister because the coalition has a majority in 
the 511-seat House of Representatives. 
  Secretaries general-level representatives of the ruling 
parties reconciled their positions early Friday on two key 
policies -- Japan's response to North Korea's alleged nuclear 
weapons program and tax system reform. 
  The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition 
chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 PM [0500 GMT] Friday to 
endorse the draft policy platform and name a candidate to 
succeed departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who suddenly 
announced April 8 his intention to resign over financial 
improprieties. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the largest force in the seven-party coalition, told a 
news conference early Friday that Hata, who leads Shinseito, is 
the best candidate from a common sense viewpoint. He also 
denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister. 
Murayama currently does not hold a cabinet post. 
  Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an 
impasse 
over how to find common ground to document policies in two key 
areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Earlier Thursday, all the coalition parties other than the 
SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform 
and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a 
new cabinet, officials said. 
  The SDP earlier threatened to leave the alliance because of 
differences on the key issues but decided to remain in the 
coalition by seeking a compromise. 
  The representatives agreed on a phrase requiring the 
government to seek "cooperation with Asian nations concerned" in 
addition to the United States and South Korea in the event of an 
emergency over North Korea's alleged nuclear program. 
  The agreement was made after the SDP conceded its demand on 
the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a phrase 
obligating the government to consult with China, as well as the 
U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to slap 
economic sanctions on North Korea. The SDP has friendly ties 
with Pyongyang. 
  On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan 
to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform 
based on "public understanding" through possible revision or 
elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing 
attention on raising indirect taxes. 
  The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be 
inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike 
in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an 
indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from 
the current 3 percent. 
  The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption 
tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls 
for creation of a new indirect levy with public consensus. The 
SDP scored a victory in the 1989 House of Councillors elections 
campaigning against the consumption tax. 
  In February, Hosokawa was forced to scrap a plan to 
introduce 
a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to offset a 6 trillion yen 
tax cut in place of the consumption tax in the face of strong 
opposition from the SDP.

<F P=106> [Statements by Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) </F>
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, and 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi at a joint 
news conference with unidentified correspondents at the Diet 
building in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Murayama] I am Murayama of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Since the moderator asked me to explain 
the details of what we discussed at the party leaders' meeting, 
I will now do so. 
  The party leaders' meeting started at 1400 [0500 GMT] in the 
Standing Committee chairman's room. As has been explained, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa acted as chairman of the 
meeting. As the moderator said, we had long discussions at the 
meeting. I am sure all of you have a list of what we discussed 
and confirmed at the meeting. The party leaders confirmed a 
total of 10 policies -- nine policies plus one supplementary 
policy -- and signed an agreement. After the discussions, 
Chairman Hosokawa said he wanted to discuss with us the 
selection of a candidate for the next prime minister. I 
immediately said that I wanted to recommend Tsutomu Hata, who 
served as deputy prime minister of the Hosokawa administration, 
for the post, saying that he is the most suitable candidate. 
After each party leader explained his opinion, the meeting 
unanimously endorsed Tsutomu Hata as a candidate for the next 
premiership. After that, the meeting was ended. That is what 
we discussed at the meeting. 
  [Unidentified moderator] Now, I would like to ask the 
Komeito chairman to speak. 
  [Ishida] We had serious policy debate during the past two 
weeks. As a result of it, we reached an agreement on the items 
needed to be confirmed for formation of a new coalition 
government. After agreeing on the items, we decided to recommend 
Tsutomu Hata as the next prime minister. Now we have agreed on 
formation of the second coalition government, I feel that each 
party has shouldered quite a heavy responsibility. 
  Moreover, the opening paragraph of the policy agreement 
states that we will unite under the banner of reform, which the 
Hosokawa administration called for, to regain the people's trust 
in politics. Because of this, I think that continuation of 
efforts for realization of reform is one of the main tasks of 
the second coalition government. Moreover, various opinions 
were expressed during the policy debate and I think it is a very 
important task of the new coalition government to play a 
responsible role in dealing with the international situation. 
  Another task is that we have to start budget deliberations 
as 
soon as possible to accelerate economic recovery. Steady 
economic recovery is the major task of the second coalition 
government. These are what we are determined to do. 
  [Unidentified moderator] The next speaker is DSP Chairman 
Ouchi. 
  [Ouchi] I am Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist 
Party of Japan. Our party has asserted not only that a new 
leader to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be 
decided within the framework of the current coalition 
government, but also that it should be clarified to the people 
what the new administration intends to do. As a result of many 
hours of policy discussion, coalition representatives have 
pulled their hearts together to successfully work out an 
agreement, even though it was a formidable task. This is a 
historical achievement in the history of Japanese politics as 
regards coalition governments. Clarifying policies and forming 
a new cabinet are important responsibilities of the coalition 
government which must be fulfilled for the sake of the people. 
Since I felt this has been achieved, I gave it my appraisal. 
After carefully considering in our own way who should be chosen 
leader from among the coalition alliance, we judged that Tsutomu 
Hata, who is deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign 
minister, was the most appropriate candidate based on his 
character, knowledge, and ability. I made a statement to that 
effect at the meeting of coalition party leaders, explaining 
that our party fully endorsed Hata. Should a new coalition 
government under Hata be formed, its major responsibility would 
be to first have Diet deliberations carried on as smoothly as 
possible regarding the draft budget bill, which is what the 
people want right now, and have it enacted as soon as possible. 
I also feel this would tentatively be the most important key to 
help bring about economic recovery. There are still problems 
which need to be solved before political reform can be 
completely carried out. While continuing to work toward this 
end, it will be necessary as soon as possible to settle those 
issues which will be particularly important from now on, 
particular among them relations with the United States, 
especially regarding economic ties which continue to be 
entangled. In view of the upcoming Naples summit, I also feel 
improving Japanese-U.S. relations is an impending issue. Many 
other problems have accumulated. The fact that coalition 
representatives have conducted heated debates on such issues as 
tax system reform and the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms 
development is extremely significant. The new administration 
must carry out its policies by building a foundation on the 
results of such debates. This is a great task that will be 
imposed on the new administration. We plan to give our full 
support so the new administration can carry out this task. That 
is all.

<F P=106> [Question-and-answer session of the joint news conference by </F>
coalition leaders Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata, SDPJ Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama, Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, DSP chairman 
Keigo Ouchi, Kaikaku-no-Kai's Takeo Nishioka, the Democratic 
Reform Party's Eiichi Nakamura; live; session begins following 
Hata's statement on his candidacy for premiership, and is 
moderated by JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka] 
  [Text] [Matsuoka] Thank you Mr. Hata for showing us your 
resolve. We still have time until 1540 [0640 GMT], and we would 
like to receive some questions. Thank you in advance for your 
cooperation. Please go ahead. 
  [Reporter Kure] I am Kure from Nihon TV. In the last two 
weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 
the coalition parties' opinions were at first split over whether 
the next prime minister should be elected by coalition party 
leaders or party secretaries general, and interparty disputes 
continued until the very last stage of working out new policy 
accords. It seemed to us that these disputes left serious 
cracks in the coalition. However, the coalition reached an 
accord early this morning to start again under the leadership of 
Mr. Hata. 
  Mr. Hata, could you give us your comments on the two-week 
dispute? 
  [Hata] In fact, a two-week period is not a very short time 
to me. I think it took so long because the parties discussed 
various issues frankly. While you said cracks may remain in the 
coalition, we are allies who have been working together under 
the premiership of Mr. Hosokawa. It is true that the coalition 
often faced difficulties in such subjects as the Uruguay Round 
and electoral reform; however, we somehow overcame all of these 
problems. Recalling the last eight months, I do not think any 
serious discord remains among us. 
  With respect to the pending issue of tax reform, we have an 
international pledge to settle the issue before the end of June. 
Taking this opportunity of forming a new administration, we 
tried to narrow disparity in the parties' stances on such issues 
as much as possible, and this was why it took so long to work 
out an accord among the parties. In this sense, I think the 
prolonged debates were quite meaningful. The coalition parties 
have been working together over the last eight months, but each 
of them has its unique standpoint and history. Throughout the 
two-week debates, I have become confident of a point that the 
coalition parties are always able to overcome their positions 
when they exhaustively discuss the nation's present 
circumstances. So, I have to say I do not see any cracks in the 
coalition. 
  I met a foreign official earlier today. When I asked him if 
the international community is worrying much about the prolonged 
political confusion in Japan, he replied that, if the new prime 
minister is nominated today, that would be regarded as a 
relatively smooth election process as a nation ruled by a 
multiparty government. He said one nation has a rule to set a 
three-week period to form a new administration, and, when the 
period runs out, spends another three-week period to continue 
discussions. He said yet another nation conducted a national 
election a long time ago, but anything but parliament membership 
has been determined up until now. I thought that was a funny 
way to cheer me up. 
  All party leaders gathered today know the fiscal 1994 budget 
must be compiled as soon as possible, and political confusion 
should not worsen the economy. Also, we have to work on the 
1995 budget following the compilation of the 1994 budget. Under 
such circumstances, we tried hard to reach an early accord, and, 
as you all know, yesterday's discussions continued even after 
midnight. My understanding is that mutual confidence and the 
sense of unity are strengthened through the debates. 
  [Matsuoka] Next question, please. 
  [Unidentified reporter] In the beginning of the interparty 
debates on the new administration, the coalition's 
decision-making mechanism, or the conference of party 
secretaries general, evoked so much controversy. The coalition 
agreed to review the position of the secretaries general's 
conference. How do you do that hereafter? 
  [Hata] I am not aware of such an agreement. As you all 
know, party secretaries general played key roles in the 
inauguration of the coalition government led by Mr. Hosokawa. 
In the Hosokawa administration, we are all serving as cabinet 
ministers, and we have to spend almost all day working on 
administrative duties. As Mr. Nakamura noted earlier, party 
secretaries general met 27 times in the two-week period. While 
I do not know the total length of the meetings, it must have 
been impossible for party heads to spend the time on political 
debate. Since we are in the cabinet, secretaries general are 
actually taking charge of all political affairs such as Diet 
administration. In this sense, I think the conference is an 
important mechanism for the coalition government. I do not 
think some people are intentionally disparaging the mechanism, 
and I think it is necessary to smooth out interparty talks. 
However, I believe the interparty accord could not be reached 
without the secretaries general's conference. So, my opinion is 
that we have to set much value on the mechanism. 
  Any more questions? 
  [Unidentified reporter] Since the new policy agreement was 
reached, the issue of forming a united lower house group will be 
a new political task. Can I ask each party leader to briefly 
comment on this? 
  [Hata] Chairman Murayama told me to go ahead first. We have 
been discussing political reform since we were in the LDP. Now, 
Japan plays a very important role in international society. We 
have to daringly promote major reform at home too. Under such 
circumstances, some people thought it was not a good idea to 
have many political parties. I have been saying that the 
dynamism of Japanese politics will be created if two major 
parties debate and compete with each other. 
  However, we have formed the coalition. To tell you the 
truth, I think it would be better if the coalition parties could 
debate together on what party representatives or party leaders 
discussed at party representatives' meetings rather than having 
separate discussions. For example, we can have true cooperation 
in elections if we all belong to the same party or the same 
group. This is an issue over which we will have heated debate 
again in the future. However, we all agree that we have to 
promote reform. On the basis of this common viewpoint, I wish 
we could form one main group or a concentric circle. If we can 
do that, then we will be able to exert greater power. 
  [Murayama] On the basis of what we have gone through, the 
second coalition government is about to start. As you know, we 
are confronted with important international and domestic tasks. 
We talked about what this administration has to do to respond 
to the people's expectations. I am sure that all parties which 
support the coalition administration are trying to find ways to 
deal with these tasks. Therefore, I think it is possible that 
some of them may try to merge into one group. This is something 
each party or each group has to think about. 
  However, as I said earlier, the SDPJ will deal with the 
reality to enable the Hata coalition administration to smoothly 
respond to the people's expectations. 
  [Ishida] We confirmed in the policy agreement that the next 
general election will be held under the new administration. In 
this sense, we can say that the new system will determine which 
party or parties will take power. Needless to say, I cannot 
tell you when the general election will be held. However, it is 
extremely important for Komeito to continue to exert efforts and 
to seek formation of a united group because the new election 
system will determine the governing party. 
  [Ouchi] Since it is the beginning of a new 
administration, I plan to give this issue some serious thought. 
  [Nishioka] Regarding policy decisionmaking and other 
procedures under the Hosokawa administration, for its part the 
Kaikaku no Kai has fully witnessed the hardships encountered by 
those who have participated in the process. I feel that maybe 
it is necessary to adopt new ideas based on the experiences of 
these people. In addition, as mentioned earlier by Chairman 
Ishida, it has been decided that elections will be held under a 
new electoral system. Therefore, I feel it is proper for the 
coalition to move in this direction as a single unit, and we of 
the Kaikaku no Kai are in the process of discussing the issue 
with this thought in mind. 
  [Nakamura] Minshu Kaikaku Rengo has already formed an upper 
house floor group called Shin Ryokufukai. This group is 
comprised of Minshu Kaikaku Rengo, Shinseito, JNP, and DSP. We 
are now in the process of asking upper house members from the 
SDPJ and Komeito to join us in Shin Ryokufukai. Therefore, 
particularly in the upper house, it is clearly evident that in 
order to enact the long-awaited policy agreement and prepare for 
next year's election, the coalition parties now want to move 
toward forming a unified group. With this in mind, we are 
actually in the process of moving in this direction. 
  [Matsuoka] We do not have much time left. Let us have one 
more question. A while ago... please go ahead. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] This is for confirmation. As 
the new coalition government is being formed, when we look at 
the stage there is one member missing who was present when the 
first coalition government was formed. Takemura from Sakigake 
is not here. While Sakigake withdrew from the coalition amidst 
the recent turmoil, there have been some LDP defectors, and many 
small groups have been formed. This has been referred to as Act 
II of the political realignment. Under such circumstances, in 
what specific ways does the coalition plan to deal with these 
groups, as well as Sakigake, in regard to working out 
cooperative relations with them? 
  [Hata] I cannot talk about specific ways since I have not 
spoken to any of these people yet. However, the representatives 
of these groups have asked me to meet them immediately after 
this news conference. I plan to hold frank discussions with 
them. 
  [Matsuoka] Thank you very much for your cooperation. We 
would like to conclude the joint news conference at this time. 
However, to round things off, we would like all the party 
leaders to shake hands together on the stage.

<F P=106> [Statement by Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata at a joint news </F>
conference with unidentified correspondents at the Diet building 
in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Hata] This is Tsutomu Hata. As has just been 
announced by the coalition leaders, I have been selected from 
among the coalition party leaders, including Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, as a candidate 
to be the new prime minister of the coalition's second 
administration. 
  Frankly speaking, I do not think I am a capable man, and 
cannot help feeling some hesitation in accepting the serious 
responsibilities over state affairs. However, since the 
coalition leaders have been trying so hard to reach a 
conclusion, I have to take upon myself the hair-raising 
responsibilities as top leader of the nation. Thus, I have 
decided to accept the candidacy. 
  As Murayama just noted, the coalition has worked out a 
multiparty memorandum on a policy accord for forming a new 
coalition government. When I am approved as the new prime 
minister through Diet elections, I will try my best, in line 
with the policy accord, to make Japan a sound nation where 
everybody can live in comfort. Also, I will seek the 
high-quality nation advocated by Hosokawa. 
  Another point is that, as other coalition leaders have 
stated, Japan must become a trustworthy, understandable, and 
beloved nation in the international community. I would like to 
try my best to achieve these objectives. 
  I sincerely seek the understanding of the public. Thank you 
very much.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Foreign Minister and Deputy </F>
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by NHK Political News Department 
correspondent Sobata on 22 April; place not given; from the 
"News 7" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sobata] Hata, you have been officially nominated 
as the coalition's candidate for prime minister. In the two 
weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 
consultations among the coalition parties were tough. What are 
your comments on the confusion during that period? 
  [Hata] In view of the reasons for Hosokawa's resignation, 
members of my party have been discussing the need for a stable 
administration. Since we once tried to invite a new group to 
the coalition government with the approval of other parties, I 
was personally surprised at the latest decision by the coalition. 
  [Sobata] The new administration is supposed to work on a 
delayed compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget. Do you think the 
lineup of the Hosokawa administration should be drastically 
reshuffled? 
  [Hata] I am undetermined on that issue, but I personally 
think cabinet ministers who provided the budget plan should take 
the responsibility to pass the budget bill. Even if new cabinet 
ministers are assigned, they would have no time to review and 
analyze the budget bill. So, generally speaking, I personally 
think the enactment of the budget bill had better be done by the 
ministers currently in charge. 
  [Sobata] However, some members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] are calling for a full-scale cabinet reshuffle. What is 
your comment? 
  [Hata] I want to spend more time before finalizing my stance 
toward the issue. 
  [Sobata] It is often said the coalition government has been 
led by the so-called Ichi-Ichi line of Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa 
and Komeito's Yuichi Ichikawa, and this is the major cause of 
friction among the coalition parties. Some members of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are saying that such a 
tendency may be intensified under the premiership of the 
Shinseito leader. What is your opinion? 
  [Hata] Many people criticize the Ichi-Ichi line. Recalling 
the last eight months, it was one of the most difficult periods 
in the history of Japanese politics. To manage the difficulties 
with the multiparty government, somebody had to take the 
leadership, otherwise the coalition government could not do 
anything. While their roles were highlighted too much, I think 
somebody had to do that. Ozawa has long been in the center of 
the nation's politics, and he knows the heavy responsibilities 
of political leaders. He had to take strong attitudes to set 
the political trends straight. I felt sorry about that because 
he is playing a thankless role for us. 
  [Sobata] I would like to ask you about policy issues. 
Throughout the policy debates among the coalition parties, it 
was difficult to obtain SDPJ approval to increase the 
consumption tax. Under such circumstances, do you really think 
you can carry out tax reform before the end of June? 
  [Hata] Instead of discussing whether or not we can do it, we 
should think about what the revenue resources for income tax 
reductions should be. We have to ask the public if the income 
tax cut should be discontinued next year. The tax cut should be 
continued, but Japan will soon become an aged society. To 
manage future problems, can we keep depending on the income tax 
imposed on young workers? This is the fundamental question. 
The government relies on direct taxes from individuals by 70 
percent, and indirect taxes are only 30 percent of the revenue. 
I think most people agree that this imbalance should be 
redressed somehow; even those coalition members who opposed the 
tax reform plan think some sort of reform is needed. Anyway, we 
have to determine through much discussion the direction of the 
tax reform before the end of June and enact legislation this 
year. This is an agreement of the coalition government, and I 
think we can certainly reach an accord.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will have to carry out political, tax and economic reforms 
if he becomes the new premier, departing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday [22 April]. 
  "I think political reform has not been completed and there 
also are tax and economic reforms" to be accomplished, Hosokawa 
told reporters. "We have many problems... but all of us decided 
to support him (Hata) and to hold out," he said. 
  Two weeks after Hosokawa abruptly announced his resignation 
over his allegedly shady financial deals, the ruling coalition 
officially chose Hata on Friday as its candidate for the 
premiership election in the Diet on Monday. 
  Hosokawa had been under fire over allegations he had raised 
funds in dubious ways via a 100 million yen loan from 
scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group and 
purchase of shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone Corp. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, Diet Affairs Committee chairman of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said the LDP will 
continue grilling Hosokawa about his financial deals after he 
quits. 
  The LDP is considering demanding that the Diet summon 
Hosokawa after his resignation to testify on his transactions, 
Ozato said. 
  Ozato said suspicions about Hosokawa's finances deepened 
when 
the premier's aide said Friday that Hosokawa had failed to 
report to tax authorities his personal income of 29 million yen 
from stock and bond investments during a 10-year period from 
1981. 
  Hosokawa told reporters he had no intention of evading taxes 
and simply failed to report the income. He reiterated he will 
not resign as a House of Representatives legislator or head of 
Japan New Party, saying he is stepping down as premier to take 
responsibility for his personal finances.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan's most probable next 
prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, on Friday [22 April] pledged his 
coalition government will overcome one of its major internal 
policy differences to introduce by June a bill reforming the 
nation's taxation system. 
  In an interview on the National Television Network Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) news program, Hata said the current tax 
system is "totally out of balance" with 70 percent of revenue 
coming from direct taxes and the remaining 30 percent coming 
from indirect ones. 
  "This is a ratio that must be corrected," Hata said. "We 
have to have measures to meet the aging society. How are we 
going to get the necessary funds? Are we going to be relying on 
the younger workers to support the aged people in the society? 
  "This is a basic contradiction in the society. This will be 
the core of the debate. 
  "The tax system is totally out of balance and we will decide 
on a direction by June of this year. We will try to achieve a 
consensus and we will try to pass this bill by the end of the 
year. We have reached a certain level of agreement and I am 
sure that this will be realized," he said. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the 
coalition's largest party, had insisted during debate over a new 
coalition policy platform, that any attempt to implement an 
indirect tax increase should be done after "gaining a national 
consensus." But in further negotiations, the coalition members 
later agreed to a proposal that an indirect tax increase be 
implemented "while trying to gain public support." 
  SDP intransigence over the indirect tax issue was one of the 
main reasons for the delay in final agreement among the parties 
over their platform. 
  On Friday, the coalition formally chose Hata as its 
candidate 
for prime minister. The Diet will elect Hata as Japan's 51st 
prime minister Monday afternoon, with the coalition parties 
occupying a majority of seats in both chambers of the 
legislature. 
  In the interview, Hata downplayed the central role in the 
coalition of two key strategists, Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. 
  "People talk about control by these two people, but if we 
look back over the past eight months of the coalition government 
and take a historical perspective I do not think you can say it 
has been controlled by these two people," said Hata, who is head 
of Shinseito. 
  "When you have a coalition like that you really need someone 
like that who can pull the parties together, somebody has to 
take the lead. 
  "Mr. Ozawa has been at the core of politics and he knows 
more 
about politics than anybody else. "He has always been in 
situations of power and of course it was natural for him to 
assume a powerful position. 
  "And I feel sorry for him because he has always been in a 
position of being the person everybody loves to hate." 
  Hata refused to divulge his thoughts on the makeup of the 
new 
cabinet. "We really have to give this a little more thought," 
he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Senior officials of 
coalition parties finally struck a deal on a draft policy 
platform for a new government early Friday [22 April], setting 
the stage for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's assumption of 
power, coalition officials said. 
  "We have just agreed on a policy platform after having 
continued eleventh-hour negotiations since yesterday," said 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who 
chaired the coalition forum on policy talks. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest party in the governing 
coalition, said that at an early Friday meeting of the 
secretaries general-level coalition representatives, the ruling 
parties reconciled their positions on two key policies -- 
Japan's response to North Korea's nuclear arms program and tax 
system reform. 
  The accord followed another agreement reached Wednesday on a 
separate major element of policy -- national security. 
  The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition 
chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 P.M. on Friday to endorse 
the draft policy platform and name a candidate to succeed 
departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Kubo said. 
  Coalition officials said heads and secretaries general of 
coalition parties will hold a meeting after 2 P.M. Friday to 
confirm the policy platform for a new government and also pick 
Hata, leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], as its candidate for prime minister. 
  But the House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed 
Thursday evening not to convene a plenary session on Friday to 
pick a successor to Hosokawa, who suddenly announced on April 8 
his intention to resign. 
  The prime ministerial election in both houses of the Diet 
may 
be carried over to next week because of the delay in agreement 
among the coalition parties over policies for a new government, 
the officials said. 
  The main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), has refused to attend vote-taking plenary sessions at the 
weekend, the officials said. 
  A senior LDP official told reporters that the Diet has so 
far 
failed to hold the prime ministerial election only because of 
the ruling coalition's indecisiveness. "We won't agree to a 
weekend plenary session," he said. 
  The SDP's Murayama told an early Friday press conference 
that 
Hata is the best candidate from the viewpoint of common sense. 
He denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister. 
  The officials agreed on a phrase requiring the government to 
seek cooperation with Asian nations concerned, in addition to 
the United States and South Korea, in the event of an emergency 
with North Korea's alleged nuclear program. 
  The SDP, the largest contingent in the ruling alliance, had 
insisted on the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a 
phrase obligating the government to consult with China, as well 
as the U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to 
slap economic sanctions on North Korea. 
  On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan 
to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform 
based on public understanding through possible revision or 
elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing 
attention on raising indirect taxes. 
  The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption 
tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls 
for a creation of a new indirect levy with a public consensus. 
  The coalition parties have been under pressure to forge an 
agreement on a policy platform for a new government since 
Hosokawa's resignation announcement. 
  Hosokawa will remain on board until his successor is 
selected. 
  Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an 
impasse 
over how to find common ground to document policies in two key 
areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Earlier on Thursday, all the coalition parties other than 
the 
SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform 
and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a 
new cabinet, officials said. 
  At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of 
coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by the 
coalition's core party Shinseito told the SDP that they will not 
accept its demands. 
  The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be 
inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike 
in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an 
indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from 
the current 3 percent. 
  Hata, who is widely expected to be picked as a successor to 
Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should make a decision in 
order to maintain the coalition government. 
  At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining 
session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General 
Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept 
the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition." 
  Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa also ruled out a compromise with the SDP, but hinted at 
efforts to bring together all forces ready to endorse the 
coalition's proposed policy document. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition 
strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace 
(Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we will definitely 
fall into confusion in two to three months." 
  "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide 
whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa 
said.

<H5>  IV. Problems on the Korean Peninsula </H5>
  The situation on the Korean peninsula, including North 
Korea's nuclear development project, is extremely serious for 
the security of Asia and Japan. (Japan) will place emphasis on

cooperation with the United States and South Korea in order not 
to isolate North Korea. 
  If the United Nations decides its policy (on the issue),

aging of the nation and introduce measures for the easing of 
direct taxation. 
  To achieve the aforementioned policies, the government will 
decide by the end of June on a thorough reform of the tax system 
with the emphasis on an indirect tax rate hike, including 
measures to reduce direct taxes, and revision or abolition of 
the current consumption tax, gaining support of the Japanese 
people. The government will enact a related bill by the end of 
the year. 
<H5>  VI. Economic Reform </H5>
  The government will make every effort to achieve domestic 
economic recovery.

economic activity, the stimulation and transparency of the 
market, and the reduction of differences between domestic and 
overseas prices through the easing of excessive regulations. 
<H5>  VII. Administrative Reform and Regional Autonomy </H5>
  As well as aiming for the simplification of administration 
and higher efficiency, the government will actively promote 
local autonomy to make regional communities attractive and to 
promote sound, democratic government based on local governance.

<H5>  IX. Lifestyle </H5>
  The government will strive for the building of a society in 
which both men and women can share in leading fulfilling lives, 
with education as the basis of the building of the nation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- A policy accord newly 
reached by the ruling coalition parties will spur discussions of 
a comprehensive tax reform to include income tax cuts and 
consumption and other indirect tax hikes, the head of a 
government tax panel said Friday [22 April]. 
  "The agreement is in the same direction with the panel's 
discussions... and confirmed that the tax reform will be decided 
in June and enacted at the Diet by the end of the year," Kan 
Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told reporters after a 
panel meeting. 
  The coalition reached the accord earlier in the day as a 
basis for forming a new cabinet, with Foreign Minister and 
Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata selected as the coalition's 
candidate to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Under the accord, the coalition parties agreed on a plan to 
revamp the tax system while seeking "public understanding." The 
plan calls for revision or elimination of the 3 percent 
consumption tax while raising indirect taxes. 
  The chairman of the advisory panel to the prime minister 
interpreted the accord as calling for cutting direct taxes and 
raising indirect taxes. 
  Hosokawa asked the panel when it began its discussions 
earlier this month for income tax cuts and net tax increases to 
realize a balanced tax system for income, assets and consumption 
to cope with the coming aged society in the 21st century. 
  Panel members did not bring up the coalition accord at 
Friday's meeting, Kato said. 
  The panel will speed up its discussions by holding meetings 
on Tuesdays and Fridays from next week to compile a report with 
various options for the parties to decide in June, Kato said. 
  The meeting centered on administrative reform, with many 
panelists calling for further slimming of the government and its 
affiliated companies and institutions to win public support for 
net tax increases, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The primary opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) criticized Friday [22 April] 
policy accords by the ruling coalition parties as a "patchwork" 
of different ideas, and declared the LDP and coalition will face 
off in the Diet. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono said the coalition parties "cobbled 
up agreements, putting aside policy differences. (The LDP) can 
become an offensive... it is important for the party to 
streamline its array and press hard on the process of the policy 
accords." 
  Kono also blasted Friday's nomination of Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's mainstream party Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party), as its candidate to succeed departing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation 
on April 8. The Diet's prime ministerial elections are 
scheduled for Monday. 
  Kono said if Hata is elected prime minister, his 
administration will be "a Shinseito administration rather than a 
coalition administration.... There still exists a dual power 
structure." 
  The comment is an apparent criticism of key coalition 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito secretary general, who led 
the grouping into selecting Hata as Hosokawa's successor. 
  The LDP president also predicted the coalition will founder 
over policy discords sooner or later, saying, "it will be 
clearer whether the policy accords are essential." 
  LDP Party Secretary General Yoshiro Mori echoed Kono, 
saying, 
"the coalition patched up a framework for the present but the 
process and contents are complicated. (The LDP) will clarify 
differences and inconsistencies of their policies in plenary and 
Budget Committee sessions in the Diet." 
  Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the coalition's small bloc, 
new 
party Sakigake (Harbinger), had mixed reactions to the accords. 
  Although praising the policy framework as a whole, Takemura, 
who is also chief cabinet secretary, noted ambiguities 
concerning issues of national security and the Korean peninsula. 
  Regarding wording that Japan will actively join U.N. peace 
activities, Takemura said, "It can be widely construed as making 
it possible for Japan to participate in (combat) activities for 
peace because the wording has not spelled out peacekeeping 
activities." He also said all 15 Sakigake members will vote for 
Hata in the prime ministerial election in the House of 
Representatives. 
  Sakigake, which will reject posts in a new coalition 
cabinet, 
has pledged to support the new government from outside the 
alliance. 
  The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) harshly criticized the 
policy ties. Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP secretariat, told 
reporters the coalition's declaration on an indirect tax hike is 
"extremely serious." 
  "It is irrational to push ahead without seeking the judgment 
of voters in election," he said. 
  On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Shii 
said, "there is no reason in punishing North Korea while 
allowing the United Stated to have nuclear weapons." 
  In a predawn Friday meeting, seven coalition partners 
reached 
agreement on major policies after wading through gaps on the two 
key issues -- tax system reform and Japan's stance on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development program. The agreement 
was a precondition to the nomination Friday afternoon of Hata as 
the coalition's official candidate for the premiership. 
  The eight-month-old coalition government of Hosokawa will 
resign en masse Monday morning before the House of 
Representatives and the House of Councillors convene vote-taking 
plenary sessions. 
  The seven coalition blocs are the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New 
Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Democratic 
Reform Party, and Kaikaku no Kai, a parliamentary group of LDP 
defectors in the lower house. 
  Hosokawa is resigning to take responsibility for his alleged 
involvement in financial scandals that stalled Diet business for 
the past two weeks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said 
Friday [22 April] that there will be no general election for the 
House of Representatives before the fall of 1995. Watanabe was 
speaking about the possible timing of a dissolution of the House 
of Representatives and subsequent election at a general meeting 
of Diet members belonging to his faction, the third largest 
within the main opposition party. 
  The election "will not be called for a certain period," the 
former deputy premier said, adding that "moves toward the 
general balloting will surface after the fall of next year." 
  The veteran conservative politician was apparently referring 
to the likelihood that a new government under Tsutomu Hata would 
press ahead with Hata's proposal to contest the next general 
vote under a new election system that combines single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation. 
  Heads of coalition parties on Friday picked Foreign Minister 
Hata, who is head of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], as its candidate for the premiership. Hata, 58, 
is almost certain to win the two elections to be held Monday in 
plenary sessions of the House of Representatives and the House 
of Councillors due to the coalition's majority.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Replacements for the posts 
of foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary, to be vacated 
by Tsutomu Hata and Masayoshi Takemura, will be the focal point 
of the new cabinet which will emerge after Hata is formally 
elected prime minister on Monday [25 April], coalition sources 
said Friday. 
  The coalition parties began negotiations over formation of a 
new cabinet Friday after the seven coalition blocs endorsed 
Hata, head of the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), as their joint candidate for the upcoming Diet election 
to select a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who declared his resignation on April 8. 
  Hata is expected to be elected prime minister with the 
coalition majority's backing in vote-taking plenary sessions of 
the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. 
  Only minor changes, however, will be made in the 
20-portfolio 
lineup, chiefly focusing on the posts of foreign minister and 
chief cabinet secretary, because of the need to move on the 
overdue fiscal 1994 state budget drawn up by the present 
government which is still pending enactment in the Diet, the 
sources said. 
  Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive and lower house 
lawmaker, has emerged as a likely choice to succeed Takemura, 
along with Kozo Watanabe, Shinseito's deputy secretary general, 
the sources said. 
  Hata hopes to pick the cabinet secretary, who serves as his 
chief spokesman and chief of staff, from among his own party 
members who know him well, they said. 
  As for the foreign ministerial post, Michihiko Kano, a lower 
house legislator who recently defected from the primary 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form a new party 
called New Party Mirai (Future), and Motoo Shiina, an 
independent international-minded House of Councillors member, 
are being considered as possible replacements to Hata, the 
sources said. 
  There are some within the coalition that expect Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of 
Japan -- SDPJ], the largest group in the coalition, to assume 
the post of deputy premier currently held by Hata. 
  Murayama, however, is reacting with reluctance toward the 
idea, while placing the priority on party business, the sources 
said. 
  The SDP is the only coalition party whose chief does not 
hold 
a ministerial post in the present seven-party coalition.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday [22 April] he did not personally have a 
hand in a failure to report some 29 million yen of his personal 
income to tax authorities. "It is common for legislators to 
have their offices handle accounting and raising of funds, 
including their personal funds," Hosokawa said. 
  Hosokawa's chief political secretary, Namio Yatsuka, told a 
news conference earlier in the day that the prime minister did 
not disclose the 29 million yen income from stock and bond 
investment during a 10-year period from 1981. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Domestic vehicle production 
and sales of Japan's "Big Two" automakers -- Toyota Motor Corp. 
and Nissan Motor Co. -- for fiscal 1993 were down from the year 
before, the two automakers announced Wednesday [20 April]. The 
dismal showing for production and sales of cars, buses and 
trucks in the year ended March 31 stems from slack consumer 
spending due to the national economic downturn, industry 
analysts said. 
  Toyota said its domestic motor vehicle output for fiscal 
1993 
totaled 3,459,840 units, 11.4 percent lower than the year 
before. Output of cars fell 11.4 percent to 2,795,055 and that 
of trucks and buses together declined 11.2 percent to 664,785, 
it said. 
  By contrast, Toyota's overseas vehicle output surged 14.3 
percent to 908,199. 
  The auto giant's domestic vehicle sales sagged 8.1 percent 
to 
2,024,329 in terms of registrations, with car sales falling 7.3 
percent to 1,439,790, and those of trucks and buses slumping 
10.1 percent to 584,539. 
  Toyota's exports of cars for the year under review came to 
1,072,227, down 15.5 percent, and those of trucks and buses 
totaled 399,440, a 7.7 percent drop. 
  Meanwhile, Nissan said its overall domestic output of cars, 
trucks and buses for fiscal 1993 fell 14.1 percent to 1,749,814. 
Production of cars were down 11.8 percent to 1,484,303 and that 
of commercial vehicles fell 24.9 percent to 265,511. 
  The company's overseas production, however, gained 7.2 
percent to 993,503. 
  Nissan's overall domestic vehicle sales were down 9.6 
percent 
to 1,067,130, with sales of cars slumping 9.9 percent to 793,455 
and those of commercial vehicles falling 8.8 percent to 273,675, 
the company said. 
  The company's vehicle exports plunged 30.0 percent to 
629,990, with exports of cars falling 29.8 percent to 513,997 
and shipments of commercial vehicles plunging 30.9 percent to 
115,993.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's ship export 
contracts in fiscal 1993 totaled 197 vessels of 7,471,018 gross 
tons, the second highest in 10 years and 2.8 times more than the 
previous year, the Japan Ship Exporters Association said 
Wednesday [20 April]. The association said the highest figure 
in the 10-year period was 8.04 million tons in fiscal 1989. 
  The increase for fiscal 1993, which ended March 31, 1994, 
was 
chiefly due to more orders for bulk ships, which recovered to a 
3.3 percent growth from fiscal 1991 levels after a sharp drop in 
orders in fiscal 1992 because of the world recession, an 
association official said. 
  The contracts included 125 bulk ships of 3.75 million tons 
and 21 tankers of 2.11 million tons, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's food imports 
expanded 5.5 percent in 1993 to a record high 40,158.40 million 
dollars, going above the 40 billion dollar level for the first 
time, a governmental trade body said Wednesday [20 April]. The 
Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) said the record high 
imports stemmed mainly from increases in fresh vegetables, beef, 
fish and rice. 
  Imports of fresh vegetables, which suffered a poor crop as a 
result of a cool and rainy summer last year, posted a 15.4 
percent climb, and those of beef rose 18.2 percent, supported by 
a reduction in custom duties and the yen's sharp rise, Jetro 
said. 
  An 11.1 percent increase in fish, which has the largest 
share 
of total imports, also contributed much to the record high, it 
said. 
  Imports of rice, which began as an emergency measure 
following a shortage of domestic rice in the wake of last year's 
unseasonable summer, totaled 107,900 tons worth 42.18 million 
dollars. 
  Orange imports rose a tiny 2.8 percent, discouraged by lower 
prices of domestic "mikan" mandarin oranges, while imports of 
orange juice plunged 25.9 percent in a reactionary move against 
last year's surge after liberalization of the farm product.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Singapore's prime minister, Goh </F>
Chok Tong, by Alexander Nicoll, in London, date not given] 
  [Text] Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, 
warned yesterday that a break in Sino-US relations over China's 
human rights policies would have severe long-term consequences 
for the world. 
  In an interview with the Financial Times in London, Mr Goh 
emphasised that he did not foresee a fracture in relations 
because he did not expect President Clinton to revoke China's 
most-favoured nation status, which comes up for annual renewal 
in June. 
  "The US at the end of the day will be rather pragmatic," he 
said. "China is a huge export market for the US. US business 
people are putting pressure on the administration that you can 
only make a point on human rights thus far and beyond that the 
Chinese are not going to move." But if there were a break 
between Beijing and Washington, Singapore would continue to 
invest in China. "China will need even more investments from 
Singapore because there will be fewer from the States. The 
market will be open to those who trade with China." The 
principal concern would be over the geo-political consequences. 
China would interpret the US action as an attempt to limit its 
growth and would remember it for a long time, Mr Goh said. 
  "China will continue to grow -- that is our assessment. The 
resources are generated internally, not like the former Soviet 
Union which depends on (other countries) for resources," he said. 
  "When China becomes powerful in 20 or 30 years time, there 
is 
no reason why China should behave kindly towards the west. 
That's our worry: China may want to flex its muscles and then 
it will be a very troublesome world," Mr Goh said. 
  To prevent this, Mr Goh advocated a policy of constructive 
engagement "so that when China grows, it grows as part of the 
international community. There are certain ways of behaving, 
certain norms of behaviour internationally. If China wants to 
be an influential member in the world it can have influence only 
if its norms of behaviour are similar to the others'." 
  Mr Goh said that Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation, the 
17-member trans-Pacific grouping, was the best forum to promote 
common understanding. 
  Mr Goh declined to comment on Singapore's caning sentence on 
Mr Michael Fay, an 18-year-old American convicted of vandalism, 
in advance of consideration of Mr Fay's appeal. 
  The prime minister was in London to spearhead a marketing 
effort for Singapore's "external wing" policy, under which it is 
building industrial parks in other Asian countries and wants 
foreign companies to set up plants in them while also basing 
part of the operation--corporate headquarters, high-technology 
manufacture, training or research and development--in Singapore. 
He admitted the argument was less persuasive to UK companies 
with long-established Asian links that it was, for example, in 
Germany. The industrial parks which Singapore is building in 
China, India and Indonesia were regarded as "an extension of 
Singapore--so that you can take advantage of the lower labour 
costs in those countries". Among other points Mr Goh said: 
  1. Following last year's partial privatisation of Singapore 
Telecom, the government planned to offer shares in the gas and 
electricity systems--now run by the Public Utilities Board--and 
in the port. 
  It was considering enlarging the government's property 
development arm by merging smaller companies into it, to prepare 
it for privatisation. 
  2. Singapore was seeking to develop "three or four" 
multinational corporations and to encourage "a big presence" for 
them abroad which, he said, would be both systematically 
developed and entrepreneurial. 
  3. Protest votes against the ruling People's Action party 
sprang from growing materialistic aspirations. 
  Asked whether he expected opposition parties to become a 
force to be reckoned with, he replied: "Not in my political 
life-time."

  [Text] Canberra, April 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will 
support Australia's effort to become a non-permanent member of 
the U.N. Security Council [UNSC], Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec told journalists today. 
  The Czech Republic, currently one of the Security Council

itself was striving for the post, Zieleniec said after he had 
met Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. 
  Australia wants to achieve the post in 1996.

  [Text] A new search for missing in action [MIA] from the 
Vietnam war began on Thursday with the participation of more 
than 100 American specialists. It is the second biggest search 
since the lifting of the United States trade embargo. 
  They will conduct interviews of local people, and undertake 
excavations in 15 provinces and the three large cities of Hanoi, 
Ho Chi Minh City, and Haiphong. 
  Lieutenant Colonel John Cray, chief of the United States MIA 
Bureau in Hanoi, said that over the past six weeks, American 
specialists visited 10 prisons but did not find any evidence of 
the Americans detained after the war.

  [Text] In Hanoi on the afternoon of 19 April, Dr. Ho Si 
Thoang, general director of the Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation 
[VOGC], signed a production-sharing contract with 
representatives of the U.S. (NJP) Group and Japanese companies 
for oil and gas exploration and exploitation in Lot 05-1B on the 
Vietnamese continental shelf. Participating in the contract are 
the VOGC's Oil and Gas Exploration and Exploitation Company and 
an oil and gas company of the Russian Federation. This is 27th 
production-sharing contract signed between the VOGC and foreign 
companies since the introduction of the state Investment Law; it 
is the first contract signed with a major U.S. oil company. 
  Lot 05-1B in the Thanh Long oil field is located on the 
Vietnamese continental shelf. It lies about 400 km southeast of 
the Vietnamese coast next to the Dai Hung oil field. It is 
considered a promising spot for oil and gas. The U.S company 
searched and explored here in early 1975 before withdrawing in 
April 1975. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were Deputy Prime Minister 
Tran Duc Luong, many high-ranking Vietnamese Government 
officials, and diplomatic representatives of the concerned 
countries.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai returned from Malaysia 
this evening. Talking to reporters upon his arrival at Don 
Muang Airport, he said that his talks with the Malaysian prime 
minister on issues of common interest proceeded in a good 
atmosphere. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] In brief, I held talks with the 
Malaysian prime minister on bilateral cooperation, such as 
cooperation in the field of communications linking Thailand and 
Malaysia and this region and the issue of the proposed East 
Asian Economic Caucus. The Malaysian prime minister explained 
details of the proposal. The foreign minister briefed the 
Malaysian side on the results of his trip to Burma and the 
Malaysian prime minister agreed with Thailand's plan to invite 
Burma to attend the upcoming ASEAN ministerial meeting to be 
held in Thailand in July. Other miscellaneous issues were also 
discussed. The meeting proceeded in a good atmosphere. The 
launch of the Malaysian-Thai Joint Authority sets a good example 
for other countries to follow. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did Malaysia raise the issue of 
Cambodian accusations against Thailand during the meeting? 
  [Chuan] No, nobody is interested in this issue. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So you did not mention anything 
about this. 
  [Chuan] No, we have nothing to talk about. We discussed 
only the main issues such as bilateral cooperation. We 
emphasized cooperation in the triangle economic development 
between Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Private sectors of 
the two countries have made progress in this regard. We will 
get a clear direction for this project when the Asian 
Development Bank completes its study for the project in the next 
two or three months. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Military Tieup" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Japanese and U.S. 
brasshats met in Tokyo recently to discuss "the Japan-U.S. 
cooperation system for coping with a possible dispute on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  NODONG SINMUN today views this as a clear proof that the 
U.S. 
and Japanese reactionaries, in league with each other, are 
proceeding with designs of aggression and domination on Korea 
and other Asian countries. 
  They regard aggression on Korea as the key to achieving 
military upperhand and supremacy in Asia, the analyst says, and 
continues: 
  The United States is intending to stifle the DPRK by using 
the Japanese territory and its military and economic potentials, 
while the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to convert Japan 
into a military power in a short period and gratify their desire 
to stage a comeback to Korea by cooperating with the United 
States in the execution of its policy. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese reactionaries are 
openly revealing their design to reinvade Korea, charging the 
DPRK with "nuclear development" and "missile threat" at a time 
when the United States has intensified the anti-DPRK campaign to 
stifle it as never before. 
  It is a lie to describe the Japan-based U.S. Forces as 
something for "Japan-U.S. security." They have been deployed 
according to the U.S. aggressive strategy of forward deployment. 
Their basic mission and duty are to play the role of a shock 
brigade in the execution of the U.S. policy of aggression and 
war against the DPRK and other Asian nations. 
  The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries must give up their 
criminal military tieup and aggressive moves against the DPRK 
and other Asian nations.

  [Text] Former Ambassador Leandro I. Verceles Sr., 
yesterday branded as "thoroughly gratuitous and inappropriate" 
the stand taken by Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo 
concerning the United States' insistence on international 
inspection of the nuclear facilities of North Korea. 
  Verceles, a recognized United Nations expert in economic 
diplomacy and international law, pointed out that Romulo's 
criticism of the United States on the nuclear inspection issue 
could be misconstrued that the Philippines is siding with North 
Korea. 
  "As a former diplomat, I find the statement, twice now, of 
Secretary Romulo criticizing the United States for its stand 
vis-a-vis North Korea as thoroughly gratuitous and 
inappropriate," he said. "(Romulo's statements) might create the 
impression that the Philippines stands by the side of North 
Korea which certainly should not be the case. Indeed, such 
statements would tend to exacerbate the already sensitive 
situation in the (Korean) peninsula." 
  Verceles, who had participated in more than 100 major U.N. 
and bilateral conferences as chairman and/or member of the 
Philippine delegation, said that it was the refusal of North 
Korea to allow the international inspection of its nuclear 
facilities, in accordance with treaties of the United Nations, 
that has spawned the controversy. 
  The U.N. Security Council has already called on North Korea 
to adhere to its commitment to permit inspection of the seven 
declared nuclear sites in the country. 
  According to Verceles, the Security Council has the primary 
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and 
security under the U.N. Charter. "Clearly," he said "it is the 
better part of wisdom and prudence for us to await action of the 
Security Council. 
  Verceles said that instead of pointing an accusatory finger 
at the United States, Romulo should join the call of the 
civilized community of nations for inspection of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities. 
  "We must realize that the Philippines is a piddling power in 
the arena of international politics" he said. "We should not 
pretend to be otherwise. We should always bear in mind that 
when elephants quarrel or make love it is the grass that gets 
trampled underfoot."

  [Text] Canberra April 21 (CTK) -- The current visit of 
Josef Zieleniec to Australia is the first visit by the Czech 
foreign minister to the continent since the appearance of the 
independent Czech Republic. 
  Before Zieleniec arrived in Australia, the last stop-over on 
his current foreign tour, during which he also visited Vietnam 
and Malaysia, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans stressed 
that the Czech Republic was playing an ever greater role in 
Central Europe. He voiced the conviction, which he reiterated at 
a joint news conference with Zieleniec today, that the Czech 
Republic had achieved great progress in its political and 
economic reform since the 1989 revolutionary change. 
  Speaking after short talks with Zieleniec, Evans said that 
the talks concerned both bilateral and regional problems and 
could serve as a basis for firmer cooperation. 
  Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic was interested in 
cooperation in traditional branches -- engineering and the glass 
industry and that it would also be ready to export Czech beer to 
Australia, regardless of the highly competitive environment in 
this field. 
  Zieleniec expressed gratitude to Australia for receiving 
Czech citizens who had to leave the communist Czechoslovakia. 
At present these people served as a link between the two 
countries which helped promote Czech-Australian trade, he added. 
  On the Czech Republic's joining NATO, Zieleniec said that it 
was not a question of immediate security. Membership was 
important from a long-term perspective as Central Europe had 
always been a subject for fights between East and West and it 
would be difficult for the Czech Republic to exist without 
certain security guarantees, he said, adding that the Czech 
Republic wanted to be a member of the West European family. 
  Zieleniec's visit follows Czech Economics Minister Karel 
Dyba's visit to Australia last August during which an agreement 
on mutual support and protection of investment was signed. The 
two countries want to start talks this year on the next 
agreement -- an agreement on the prevention of double taxation. 
  Czech-Australian trade reached 48.6 million USD last year. 
The Czech Republic exports to Australia chiefly glass and 
textile products and power equipment and imports mostly wool. 
However, imports of Australian wool to the Czech Republic have 
been diminishing considerably. 
  Since the '80's Australia has been markedly orienting itself 
towards cooperation within the Asian-Pacific region and was an 
initiator of the Council for Economic Cooperation for Asia and 
the Pacific (APEC) which resulted in a dramatic change in the 
structure and content of Australian trade. More than half of 
Australian exports currently go to East Asia while formerly they 
went mostly to Europe and the United States. On the other hand, 
East Asian goods make up a third of Australian imports.

<F P=106> [Article by Ukeru Magosaki, ambassador to Uzbekistan: </F>
"Japanese Diplomacy Is To Be Tested in Uzbekistan"] 
  [Excerpts] I. Distinguishing Features of Central Asia 
<H5>  Litmus Test for Japanese Diplomacy </H5>
  With the collapse of the USSR, Central Asia is experiencing 
changes in all political, social, and economic areas. Moreover, 
the changes are qualitative changes which may be regarded as 
revolutionary. Central Asia has shifted from being a "colony" 
of the USSR to a glorious independent state. The incident 
should be celebrated wholeheartedly. Besides, in the long run 
the area has full potentiality for development with its rich 
resources such as gold, raw cotton, petroleum, gas, and others 
as background. 
  However, this area has to first undergo hardship. The 
hardship is so serious it might be the most serious experienced 
in the life of individual citizens. 
  Said an Uzbek citizen who holds a responsible position: 
"Compared to this confusion, the USSR socialist structure is 
considered better. People's hearts are growing wild with 
economic difficulties. At least we used to enjoy visiting and 
receiving friends. Today, it is even difficult to do that. I 
cannot but feel anxious about the future of our children." 
  While attaining independence, why should they become so 
anxious today? If such anxiety really does exist, what should 
the Japanese do about it? Roughly speaking, there are two 
courses for us to take. 
  Since the area is not closely related to us, one course is 
to 
assume the attitude of an onlooker. This by itself is a fully 
justifiable choice. Over the past several decades, there have 
been few exchanges between Central Asia, which was under USSR 
control, and Japan. The only Japanese citizens who are 
regularly stationed in Tashkent, which has a population of over 
2 million, are our four staff members at the embassy, two 
representatives from business firms, a Japanese language teacher 
(there is a Japanese language course at a local university where 
over 50 students are studying Japanese without Japan's aid; a 
Japanese lady has been teaching at the university for a monthly 
salary of only a bit more than $10), a student visiting the 
country to study archaeology, and the representative (a 
Japanese) of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. This shows how scarce the relationship between 
Japan and this area is. Therefore, it can be justifiable to 
flatly say: "It is not our concern no matter what may happen in 
this area." 
  Another course is to seek ways to positively help the area. 
It is true that, while under USSR control, there had been no 
close relations between this area and Japan. However, with the 
collapse of the USSR, 23 million people in Uzbekistan alone are 
experiencing hardship. Should they fail to overcome the present 
situation, it is possible that serious political and economic 
confusion may occur. 
  Japan and other countries can help the situation by offering 
economic and intellectual assistance to these areas. When Japan 
is being criticized at home and abroad about "lacking its own 
diplomacy," Japan can offer positive assistance and nip the 
causes of future confusion in the bud one by one. When Japan's 
attitude in making international contribution is at issue, we 
should realize that to shed blood is not the only way to make 
contributions. Japan should seek the most effective ways of 
making contributions. Perhaps a most effective way for Japan is 
to help the area stabilize its political, social, and economic 
situation through economic contributions. Japan can best 
contribute in the field where it is most superior. It seems 
natural for Japan to do so, and in the long run Japan may be 
appreciated for so doing. Besides, such a way of assisting is 
most welcome to countries such as those in Central Asia and 
others which are experiencing confusion following the end of the 
Cold War. 
  Central Asia is an area unknown to us, for we do not have a 
direct relationship with this area. Yet, the area is in need of 
Japan's help. Japan's way of dealing with these areas may be 
regarded as a litmus test for Japanese diplomacy in the future. 
[passage omitted on historical background] 
  II. Political and Social Changes 
  [passage omitted on historical background] 
<H5>  The Role of Parliamentary Democracy Is Limited </H5>
  For the purpose of instituting religious activities, a large 
amount of funds are flowing into this area from Iran and other 
countries. Let me offer a concrete example. In October 1993, I 
traveled the Fergana area by automobile. To my surprise, 
mosques were being constructed on first-class lots in almost all 
villages, including small villages. In larger towns and cities, 
Islamic theological schools were under construction, with the 
school abutting the main street for 150 meters. Mosques were 
emerging throughout a land which was about to be totally 
evacuated following the withdrawal of Russian culture. Except 
for Tashkent, where reinforced concrete buildings were 
constructed one after another under the USSR, mosques are being 
constructed in every district of Uzbekistan. Presently, 
buildings are under construction, and little noticeable 
religious activity is being carried out. Therefore, voices of 
anxiety are seldom heard. However, two or three years from now, 
when construction comes to a halt, religious activities are 
expected to begin full-scale. 
  It is highly possible that religious activities will bear a 
strong Iranian color. Such a possibility derives from Iranian 
history and the existing racial structure of the country. 
  We may say that, from the pre-Christian era until about the 
eighth century, Central Asia was included in the Persian 
cultural sphere. Uzbeks and other Turkish descendents came to 
the region during this period. The strategy of the Turkish 
descendents was not to attempt to conquer all areas, but to 
gradually invade the area where Persian descendents were weak. 
As a result, a local community was formed where Persian and 
Turkish descendents were intermixed. The Persian descendents 
are living in the urban areas of historically famous Samarkand 
and Bukhara, and the Turkish descendents are living in the 
surrounding areas. 
  Under the USSR, both the Persian and Turkish descendents 
were 
equally regarded as second-class citizens. However, with 
Uzbekistan becoming an independent state, and by virtue of the 
"National Language Law," Uzbeks of Turkish descent constitute 
the leading stratum, with those of Persian descent forming a 
subordinate class (though there are many Persian descendents who 
speak Uzbek fluently). 
  Shi'a Muslims, which have strong influence over Iran, also 
have strong infiltrating power among the oppressed. In 
addition, the Tajikistan people who maintain a considerable 
influence in Uzbekistan are of Persian ancestry. Moreover, they 
have strong financial support from religious sectors. Though 
today educational funds for Islam are also being offered mainly 
by Saudi Arabia, their role is simply to contribute money no 
matter how much funds are offered. The funds offered by Saudi 
Arabia will bear fruit in the form of increased Iranian 
influence in strengthening human, historical, and cultural ties. 
(Note: There is an opinion that, since Sunni Muslims are 
conducting Islamic education in Central Asia, it will be 
difficult for Iranian Shi'a Muslims to infiltrate the area. 
However, oppressed under the USSR, the teachings of Islam have 
not infiltrated into the area that deeply, and its influence is 
not strong enough to prevent a particular religious sector from 
coming into the area.) As I mentioned earlier, restoration of 
the mura [premodern] community will bring about the restoration 
of Islam. 
  As we have seen so far, we can understand that this area is 
experiencing a violently changing period. New political and 
social orders are about to be created. The scale of change is 
almost revolutionary. Naturally, there will emerge a group to 
resist the changes. Racial and cultural tensions are being 
created in this area, and tensions are expected to increase 
further. There are confrontations between those of Russian 
(European) descent and the local people; between those of 
Turkish and Persian descent; between "unification of politics 
and religion" and "separation of politics and religion"; and 
between the modern and premodern community. 
  Under such circumstances, the government is exerting itself 
to avoid confusion, and is trying to prevent the country from 
returning to a primitive Islamic community. Different from 
other areas of the former USSR where confusion has surfaced, 
this area alone has been able to maintain its political 
stability mostly owing to the leaders. How should the West deal 
with this community? 
  One of the requirements which qualifies this country to 
receive aid from the West is "to what extent has parliamentary 
democracy been introduced?" An international financial group 
came up with this idea. However, parliamentary democracy is 
based on a generally accepted idea that "the minority group is 
ready to accede to the majority group so long as the minority 
group is given the opportunity to express its opinions." 
  However, while the great revolution is taking place, with 
the USSR regime shifting to an Uzbek regime, the role of a 
parliamentary democracy becomes very limited. The Russian 
people who have become second-class citizens cannot resume their 
reign no matter how much they may shout at parliament. It is 
not parliament that decides the role of religion. In a 
community where there is confrontation between "unity of 
politics and religion" and "separation of politics and 
religion," the role of a parliamentary democracy is narrow. The 
confrontation cannot be settled within the parliamentary 
framework. When we think about ways of appraising and assisting 
such a community, it is not necessarily appropriate to place a 
great burden on "to what degree has a parliamentary democracy 
been introduced". 
<H5>  III. Changes in the Economic Field </H5>
<H5>  Favorable Economic Environment </H5>
  During the Russian regime, which lasted 120 years, the 
economic structure of this area was formed from the viewpoint of 
colonial management. In order to prevent this area from 
becoming politically independent, its economy had been totally 
linked with the economy of Moscow and others so that the area 
could never become economically independent. Though Uzbekistan 
was a world-famous place for raw cotton production, raw cotton 
was not processed here; raw cotton was sent to Russia to be made 
into fiber. Though there were industries in Uzbekistan, parts 
and raw material were mostly imported from other areas of 
Russia. Just like meshes, the Uzbek economy was incorporated 
into an inter-dependent framework involving all areas of Russia. 
  Moreover, the Uzbek economy had been influenced by the Cold 
War. Afraid of U.S. attacks during the Cold War, the USSR 
dispersed its munitions industries to various districts. 
Unimaginably large factories are located in local districts. 
Tashkent is no exception. On the outskirts of Tashkent there 
are the only two assembly plants (with tens of thousands of 
employees) in the USSR for transport aircraft (including 
military aircraft). Reportedly, there is a uranium factory in 
Uzbekistan which is one of the largest in the USSR. 
  What will become of this economy after the collapse of the 
USSR? Transport aircraft can be assembled only when the 
necessary parts are procured. A factory cannot be operated 
without parts, even if it has excellent engineers and excellent 
assembly lines and runways. 
  Under such circumstances, Uzbekistan employed a clear 
strategy. Supposedly, the strategy was formed from the following 
concepts: 
  1. The economy promises a long-range view. 
  The balance of international payments will be improved by 
increasing the production of gold, by elevating the degree of 
processing of raw cotton, and by providing petroleum products 
for itself. The economic environment is favorable in a 
long-range view. However, it will take at least four or five 
years to realize these objectives. 
  2. For the time being, as a transitional measure an economic 
structure dependent on the Russian economy may be maintained 
until a self-supporting economic structure is established. 
  This strategy is considered reasonable. 
  So far, Uzbekistan has been producing gold in large volumes, 
ranking between sixth and eighth in the world. Foreign 
investments began to be introduced. Newmont [as published] 
Company of the United States has established a joint venture, 
and an English enterprise has also concluded a contract to 
extend its business in this area. Japanese enterprises are also 
waiting for a chance to do business here. 
  The country produces high-quality raw cotton in large 
quantities. Japanese enterprises which have closed their 
domestic spinning mills because of the high labor cost are also 
studying the possibility of operating mills in this country. 
  The country is abundant in deposits of petroleum and gas, 
and 
has enough deposits to export after supplying its domestic 
demand. 
  In these three fields alone, the country has good prospects 
for success. Its potentiality is by far greater than many other 
developing countries. 
  Why Did the Plan Fail? 
  However, their plan did not work. The plan described in 
point 2 above failed. For the USSR, the colonies (republics) 
were expensive propositions. Russia aims to cut off the 
republics, proposing to them conditions to remain within the 
Russian economic sphere. Judging that "these requests are too 
severe compared with the former conditions," the newly 
independent countries intend to become economically independent 
by introducing their own currencies. However, for a country 
which had been able to maintain its economy through its 
connection with Russia, in the short-term it means economic 
collapse in attempt to become economically independent. The bill 
is to be totally shouldered by the citizens. The ruble which 
citizens have saved will become as good as wastepaper. Inflation 
will be accelerated. Citizens have lost their trust in the 
currency and do not want to save money. They do not sell but 
rather accumulate goods. Distrust prevents the economy from 
functioning smoothly. 
  In Central Asia (and maybe in Russia), there are presently 
two factors creating economic difficulties. 
  -- Problems created by the collapse of socialism, and by the 
shifting to a market economy. 
  -- Problems created by the collapse of the USSR economic 
sphere. 
  While many intellectuals point out the former as a cause of 
difficulties, in the short-term serious confusion has been 
caused mostly by the latter. There is no way of solving the 
problems without taking the latter's influence into account. 
Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, is seriously in need of 
advice concerning economic operations. However, the advice 
given by IMF and other institutions is: "It is necessary to 
completely shift to a market economy." This advice may be 
adequate if the present hardship was attributable to the 
contradictions of socialism alone. However, the most serious 
hardship was created by the collapse of the USSR economic 
sphere. What is necessary is to deal with the problem, taking 
the situation of Central Asia into account, and not to try to 
apply textbook rules to economics. The other day I met one of 
the advisory members of the IMF who said: "Honestly speaking, 
we are at a loss. We are not sure if it is of any use to give 
advice aimed at partial improvement of a structure totally 
different from our own. It is like a mental specialist trying to 
cure a fractured leg." 
<H5>  IV. What Can Japan Do? </H5>
<H5>  Japan Can Be the Best Model </H5>
  First, what is the president of Uzbekistan expecting from 
Japan? If I arbitrarily compose a statement based on his 
speeches, what he wants is as follows: 
  "We do not want to receive charity from foreign countries. 
However, we want foreign countries to help us out of our 
economic difficulties following independence. If we 
successfully operate the economy today, there will be a bright 
future for us. We have resources such as gold, petroleum, and 
raw cotton. Basically, we have diligent workers. These factors 
will prove fully helpful to us in making rapid progress in the 
future. Yet, just as I do not need Islamic fundamentalism, I do 
not need either `democratic fundamentalism' or `market economy 
fundamentalism'. It does not bring about any solutions to be 
forced to accept principles without taking individual situations 
into account. Under a different environment, we should engage 
in different approaches. To restore the economy is a task of 
the utmost priority for us. We want to shift to a market 
economy step by step. Of course, in view of social security, we 
should also place importance on welfare. It is impossible to 
try to completely shift to a market economy all at once. We 
want to carry out the project with the central government taking 
control. Japan seems to be the best model for us in operating 
our economy. Asians have their own approaches. When I talked 
to West European leaders, I related my idea to that effect. We 
want to learn from Japan. We also want Japan to help us in 
laying the foundation for development. If Japan could assist us 
now, in the long run we will also be able to help Japan. 
However, to my regret, Japanese Government officials and the 
private sector are late in taking action." 
  The president, who is accustomed to delivering speeches in 
the USSR-style, will speak for hours fluently and with dignity. 
Yet the essence of his speech will be as I described above. 
  The core of the problem is whether or "not" Japan can 
judge that "from a broad point of view, it conforms with Japan's 
interests to help those Central Asian countries which are 
suffering hardship." 
  Does Japan consider it right to exert itself in solving 
problems directly related to its interests? Or does Japan 
consider it will benefit the country in the long run to exert 
itself in solving problems, even though the problems are not 
urgent ones for Japan? Or when its qualifications as a UN 
Security Council member are being discussed, does Japan consider 
it its responsibility to do so? Japan's way of dealing with the 
problem will differ largely depending on what choice it makes. 
  If Japan's choice is the latter, we can form a number of 
projects. 
  -- Offer advice: Japan can give advice in economic 
operations based on its experience in overcoming the postwar 
confusion. 
  -- Assist key industries, and assist the region in improving 
the social infrastructure. (In order to improve the balance of 
international payments, the assistance should focus on such 
industrial fields as mining, oil development, textiles, and 
tourism.) 
  -- Offer humanitarian assistance. 
  -- Offer cultural assistance. (With its rich tradition, the 
Central Asian culture possesses a high quality beyond our 
imagination. However, in the community where the people barely 
make a living, some of the traditional cultures are in the 
process of destruction.) 
  Western countries, including Germany but excluding the 
United 
States, are taking steady action in assisting the region. 
Fortunately, the Japanese are gradually beginning to feel Japan 
should help Central Asia. However, I am afraid that to feel 
that way may be excessive wishful thinking by the writer who has 
almost no point of contact with Japan.

  [Text] Here is a report on the attack and liberation of 
Boeng Trakuon and its vicinity: 
  1. Boeng Trakuon, also called Banteay Mean Rit, is an 
important area from which UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia], the United States, and an alliance used artillery 
pieces and tanks to attack Phnum Prak hill in the Phnum Chhat 
area in August 1993. 
  2. After the attack, the two-headed government, the United 
States, the alliance, and the communist Vietnamese assigned the 
8th division of U.S.-backed puppet Dien Del [former chief of 
staff of the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces] to 
join the 7th and 8th divisions of the communist Vietnamese 
puppets. 
  3. The 7th, 8th, and 12th divisions joined the communist 
Vietnamese puppets' troops to attack the Malai and Pailin 
regions. [sentence as heard] In February and March 1994, the 
United States provided the Dien Del forces with more than 1,000 
tonnes of armaments and ammunition bought from the communist 
Vietnamese and Russia. 
  4. After clearly grasping the situation, the people and 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea mustered forces to attack 
the warmongering troops and destroyers of the nation at Boeng 
Trakuon called Banteay Mean Rit, the biggest base of Dien Del. 
  On the night between 20 and 21 April, the people and NADK 
attacked and completely liberated Boeng Takuon and its vicinity. 
The area, which is a major base of U.S.-backed puppets Dien Del 
and Pan Thai, was totally destroyed. In the wake of the attack, 
the people in the area raised their hands praying and said: 
Down with the notorious border bandits, Down with the great 
assassins. As for parasoldiers [of the Khmer People's National 
Liberation Armed Forces], they also shouted: Down with great 
border bandits Dien Del and Pan Thai, who plunder the people's 
cattle and send them across the border.

<F P=106> [20 April PASASON Editorial: "Steps of Development of </F>
Lao-Malaysian Relations and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai 
Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime 
minister of Malaysia, led a delegation of the Malaysian 
Government to pay an official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 
16 to 18 April. The Malaysian Government delegation was 
honorably welcomed at an official ceremony. It was also 
accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon 
and the multiethnic Lao people everywhere it visited. 
Noteworthy is that during the visit, H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir bin Mohamed and his delegation paid a courtesy call on 
H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, which proceeded 
in an atmosphere of close friendship. The delegation also 
visited various places of economic, historic, and cultural 
significance in Vientiane capital and Luang Prabang Province. 
  Official talks between a high-level LPDR delegation led by 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and a high-level Malaysian delegation led 
by H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed were held at the 
prime minister's office in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an 
atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. 
During the talks, the two sides informed each other about 
domestic situations, lines, and policies in their respective 
countries which they considered a firm basis for further, ever 
more vigorous development of Lao-Malaysian relations and 
cooperation in various fields, both in the state and private 
sectors, to bring about concrete benefits to the two peoples. 
The two sides discussed and exchanged views on various issues, 
including promoting investment between Laos and Malaysia, an 
issue in which the Malaysian side is interested. Following the 
talks, the two sides agreed to step up delegation exchanges at 
all levels. During the visit, a seminar on the foreign 
investment atmosphere in the LPDR was also organized. The 
Malaysian side also assured the Lao side of its willingness to 
render assistance in training Lao cadres. Part of the 
assistance will be directly provided by the Malaysian Government 
and the rest will be in the form of funds from a third country. 
Noteworthy is that the two sides have reached an agreement on 
repayment between the Bank of the LPDR and Bank Negara of 
Malaysia -- the central banks of the two countries. This 
agreement, together with the agreement on promoting and 
protecting investment which was signed in 1992, serves as a firm 
basis and marks a historic milestone for the further, ever more 
fruitful promotion and expansion of the existing good and 
friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and 
the two peoples of Laos and Malaysia. Another significant point 
is that the prime ministers of the two countries believe that 
Laos and Malaysia have maintained sufficient conditions to 
promote and expand relations and cooperation in all spheres in 
the immediate future as well as in the long-term period. 
  The multiethnic Lao people wholeheartedly hail the glorious 
success of the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation on 
this visit to the LPDR. The visit is considered a new step of 
development in relations and cooperation between the two 
countries. The success of the visit also serves as a basis for 
the two countries to increasingly promote, expand, and 
strengthen friendly relations and cooperation in various fields, 
which will thus contribute to establishing and promoting peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation in this region.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States have fundamentally different interpretations of the 
overall goal of the so-called "framework" trade talks, a senior 
Trade Ministry official said Friday. 
  The perception gap emerged during the latest meeting between 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said the 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who declined to be named. 
  The MITI official was referring to "basic objectives" 
mentioned in the joint statement on the Japan-U.S. framework, 
which was issued after the summit meeting between then Japanese 
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Clinton in 
Tokyo in July last year. 
  "The U.S. interpretation was found to be fundamentally 
different from Japan's understanding," said the official, who 
attended the Hata-Kantor meeting on April 15 in Morocco. 
  But the official did not explain the difference. He also 
refrained from specifying which part of the joint statement was 
discussed during the Marrakech meeting. 
  The Hata-Kantor meeting fell short of setting a specific 
time 
for resumption of the stalled framework talks. 
  The MITI official said that Kantor requested Tokyo to give a 
"satisfactory" answer to U.S. proposals made during the 
Marrakech meeting on three areas -- macroeconomic areas, 
objective criteria and overall goal. But the official declined 
to reveal details of the proposals. 
  The MITI official said the U.S. proposals on the three areas 
were "far from" acceptable for Tokyo. He said Tokyo will make a 
reply to these proposals by sending an official to Washington 
probably after the Golden Week holiday season ending on May 8. 
  The Japanese understanding is that Washington is prepared to 
reopen the framework talks through informal channels, only when 
the Japanese answer is found "satisfactory," the MITI official 
said. 
  During the Hata-Kantor meeting, Kantor sounded "softer" on 
the issue of numerical targets, the idea of which Hata flatly 
dismissed at the outset of the meeting, the MITI official said. 
But the official did not elaborate, only saying Kantor did not 
show any response. 
  Asked if the Japan-U.S. trade ties have worsened after the 
Hata-Kantor meeting compared with the situation immediately 
after the February 11 breakdown of the summit, the MITI official 
said it is difficult to judge. Tokyo could avoid discussing the 
conceptual gap over the "basic objectives," if it focuses on 
sector-by-sector discussion, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan will lend El Salvador 
up to 10.3 billion yen to help finance its program to repair and 
expand roads destroyed by guerrillas during the 12-year civil 
war, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [21 April]. 
  Japanese Ambassador to El Salvador Shigetaka Ishihara and El 
Salvador's Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria exchanged 
documents on the loan in San Salvador on Wednesday, the ministry 
said. 
  The 30-year loan, with a grace period of 10 years, carries 
an 
annual interest of 3 percent, the ministry said. 
  The latest loan brings the total amount of Japanese loans to 
the Latin American country to 27.68 billion yen, the ministry 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- A government job training 
program designed to promote the transfer of technology to 
developing countries got off to a poor start in fiscal 1993 
because the number of applicants fell below expectations, a 
Labor Ministry official said Wednesday [20 April]. The number 
of applicants stood at 1,147 for the year ended March 31, 
falling short of the 15,000 applicants envisaged for the first 
year of the program, the official said. 
  Under the program, applicants will be given 
Japanese-language 
lessons and job training for the first year and then those who 
pass a job examination test will be allowed to work in Japan for 
a year without a working visa. 
  The official attributed the fewer-than-expected applicants 
to 
the sluggish economy, and the resulting drop in demand for 
foreign labor. 
  The official also cited a hesitancy among employers to hire 
those trained under the program. 
  Most applicants were from Asian countries. China led the 
list of applicants with 602, followed by Indonesia with 426 and 
the Philippines with 53.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe by </F>
NHK Political News Department correspondent Koike; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Watanabe] I believe that the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] alone cannot take power. Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] alone also 
cannot take power. I am in agreement with the policies of 
Shinseito and the Japan New Party, and Komeito [Clean Government 
Party] appears to be agreeing with their policies. My agreement 
with those policies can pave the way for forging a conservative 
coalition, and this is the best option under the present 
political situation. Forging such a conservative coalition will 
serve the interests of our nation. 
  The coalition partners so far have placed importance on 
making a distinction between the LDP and the non-LDP, and their 
attitude has stood in the way of forging such a conservative 
coalition. I have intended to play a role in rallying 
conservative political parties that share the same political 
beliefs. I have thought that this is an ideal approach. To play 
such a role, I have to form a new political party after quitting 
the LDP. Political parties that share the same policies should 
forge an alliance after putting aside their past grudges and ill 
feelings. I still believe that this is the best way. 
  [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, there is a belief that you may have 
ridden the wave of Ozawa's strategy. 
  [Watanabe] I do not think that I have ridden the wave of his 
strategy. I have acted in accordance with my own beliefs. 
  [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, in recent days you have made twists 
and 
turns. How do you assess Mr. Ozawa? 
  [Watanabe] Mr. Ozawa and I share completely identical 
policies, and I trust him. 
  [Koike] Would you comment on his artifice [chibo]? 
  [Watanabe] Artifice and the way of getting things done 
differ 
from person to person. I think that Mr. Ozawa is a decisive man 
and a man of action. He is a wonderful man. If he relies 
excessively on his artifice, this would cause problems. I am an 
old man. I value relationships with other people as much as 
possible. I always hope to get along well with other people. 
Mr. Ozawa and I do not necessarily share the same artifice. 
  [Koike] Do you still have the desire to become prime 
minister? 
  [Watanabe] I intend to fulfill my desire as long as I serve 
as a politician. I will keep the desire in mind.

  [Text] Nagano, April 21 KYODO -- Although Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is likely to become the first prime minister from 
Nagano Prefecture, officials of the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympic 
Games Organizing Committee (NAOC) are not necessarily happy 
about his taking the nation's helm at this juncture. 
  If Hata, who heads Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
powerhouse of the seven-party ruling coalition, succeeds 
departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his term is expected 
to be short given the current unstable political situation, 
according to political sources. 
  "We hope Hata will be nominated for the premiership because 
that would be a great help toward the Olympics," said an 
official who requested anonymity. "But we are afraid he would 
not be able to keep his position until the year of the games," 
he said. 
  The 58-year-old Hata hails from Ueda in the central Japan 
prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono urged Thursday [21 April] parties in the ruling coalition 
to disband, saying a delay in choosing a new prime minister is 
impermissible. Kono, president of the major opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), said in a statement that the coalition 
ignores the people through its prolonged negotiations, and that 
the situation has already passed the permissible point. 
  He said the coalition should have the courage to disband 
rather than conceal differences in policies. After the 
dissolution of the coalition, parties should again discuss 
policies and decide on a new government, he said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced on April 8 that 
he 
will resign over his alleged shady financial deals and delays in 
Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. During nearly two 
weeks after Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation, the 
ruling parties have not chosen his successor due to internal 
power struggles and differences over key policies for a new 
cabinet. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's core 
party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is regarded as the most 
probable successor to Hosokawa. 
  Kono also said Japan should have a "definite policy" before 
sending its finance minister to a series of international 
monetary meetings in Washington this weekend. On Sunday, 
finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of 
Seven (G-7) industrialized nations are scheduled to meet in the 
U.S. capital. 
  The LDP president urged a speedy beginning to Diet 
deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills, saying the obstacles 
to debate disappeared now that Hosokawa announced he would step 
down. The coalition government submitted the bills to the Diet 
in early March, but the LDP insisted on discussing Hosokawa's 
financial transactions first and has refused to start budget 
debates. 
  Kono said Hosokawa's questionable deals should be discussed 
further at a Diet committee, but not at the Budget Committee 
where the budget is tabled, noting that he will continue to be 
head of a political party, the Japan New Party. 
  Hosokawa had been under fire over suspicions about shady 
fund-raising through a 100 million yen loan from a 
scandal-tainted trucking firm and a stock purchase.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Policy differences over 
tax reform and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development program threatened Thursday [21 April] to 
split the ruling coalition again, coalition officials said. 
Following the deepening rift among the coalition parties, the 
House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed Thursday not 
to convene a plenary session on Friday to pick a successor to 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation 
on April 8. 
  Political sources said the inauguration of a new cabinet may 
be carried over into next week. 
  All the coalition parties other than the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned the SDP's demands to play 
down the wording on tax reform and the North Korean nuclear 
issue in a policy document for a new cabinet, the officials said. 
  At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of 
coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] told the SDP, the largest party 
in the eight-month alliance, that they will not accept SDP 
demands. The SDP demands that the term "national consensus" be 
inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike 
in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an 
indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from 
the current 3 percent. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is Shinseito head and 
regarded as the most probable successor to Hosokawa, told 
reporters that a raise in the indirect tax is necessary. 
  Earlier in the day, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told 
party 
executives, "Please be aware that we may have to pull out of the 
coalition." 
  The SDP earlier told its partners it would never drop its 
demands for abolition of the consumption tax and security policy 
coordination with China in the event of a military conflict on 
the Korean peninsula over the nuclear inspection row. 
  At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining 
session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General 
Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept 
the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition." 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also ruled out a 
compromise with the SDP, but hinted at efforts to bring together 
all forces ready to endorse the coalition's proposed policy 
document. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition 
strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace 
(Foreign Minister Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we 
will definitely fall into confusion in two to three months." 
  "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide 
whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa 
declared. 
  The standoff has revolved around two key policy fields. 
  The non-SDP camp called for inserting into the policy 
document an indication of its readiness to hike the consumption 
tax from the current 3 percent, while the SDP demanded that a 
term of "public acceptance" be inserted as a prerequisite for 
the hike. 
  The non-SDP camp rejected this condition, saying it would 
make it virtually impossible to hike the rate and secure 
revenues to fund increasing welfare outlays for the elderly. 
  The SDP also demanded the insertion of wording calling for 
China's consent to any Japanese compliance with a possible U.N. 
Security Council resolution on economic sanctions on North Korea. 
  Ozawa and Ichikawa told the coalition meeting that if China 
vetoed the resolution and expressed dissatisfaction over 
Japanese cooperation with U.S. forces, such wording could deter 
Japan from taking defensive military action in the event of 
fighting on the Korean peninsula. 
  Ozawa earlier urged coalition partners to recognize the need 
for legislative preparations to empower the Japanese 
Self-Defense Forces to provide logistical support if U.S. 
warships conducted a naval blockade of North Korea. 
  In the face of rejection, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
has asked for time to persuade other SDP leaders to rethink the 
issue. 
  The secretaries general of the non-SDP camp agreed to 
reconvene their meeting at 8 P.M. [1100 GMT] after letting Kubo 
make another effort at reconciliation, coalition sources said. 
  Kubo and SDP executives were scheduled to meet at 6 P.M. to 
decide whether to accept the stance of their coalition partners, 
the sources said. If they can reconcile their differences, the 
coalition allies will call a meeting of party heads to endorse 
the policy tenets and select Hata as their candidate to succeed 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, who is head of the key coalition party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], on Thursday urged the coalition's biggest group, 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], to come 
closer to other parties over policy affairs. Hata, who is 
widely expected to be picked as a successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should 
make a decision in order to maintain the coalition government. 
  The SDP has threatened to secede from the coalition because 
of differences with other parties on tax reform and Japan's 
response to North Korea's suspected nuclear development program. 
  Hata said some SDP members are making endeavors to keep the 
coalition together. He said the ruling parties should debate 
policies thoroughly, noting that such discussions would later 
help the new government. 
  The coalition has failed to pick a successor to Hosokawa for 
nearly two weeks since Hosokawa announced his resignation on 
April 8.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party's [of Japan -- SDPJ] stance on taxes and its policy toward 
North Korea remained the main stumbling blocks to agreement 
among coalition parties Thursday [21 April] morning, political 
sources said. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the 
coalition parties, is stipulating that an increase in direct 
taxes should be linked to "an end to the consumption tax and the 
establishment of new taxation after seeking the people's 
consent." 
  The other parties want reference to the consumption tax 
restricted to the expression "including reorganization of" the 
tax, but support a compromise that omits reference to "the 
consent of the people." 
  At meetings of its three top executives and its central 
executive committee, the SDP leadership spent the morning 
discussing possible ways to reach a compromise with the other 
coalition parties. 
  But during a 10.30 A.M. [0130 GMT] break in proceedings, 
sources said, it appeared the party was determined to insist on 
the revised proposals it had originally put before a meeting of 
coalition leaders on Wednesday. 
  If agreement is reached among all the coalition members 
Thursday, the parties will hold a meeting of their leaders to 
secure written assent to the deal and choose Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as 
successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Shinseito is the coalition's second largest party. 
  This outcome would mean that a plenary session of both 
houses 
of the Diet could not be convened until Friday at the earliest, 
but political sources said it is possible political manoeuvering 
and negotiations over the new cabinet could further delay the 
process until Saturday. 
  Other policy issues negotiated among coalition members 
included the question of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons. The SDP holds that in the event of an 
emergency, Japan should engage in "close collaboration" with the 
United States, South Korea and China. 
  But Shinseito's top strategist Ichiro Ozawa disagreed, 
arguing that in a hypothetical circumstance where China has 
exercised its right to a veto in the United Nations Security 
Council and Japan subsequently is subjected to a missile attack, 
Japan would be unable to engage in "close collaboration" with 
China, nor treat it in the same manner as the U.S. and South 
Korea. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters Thursday 
morning that the party would engage in "spirited debate" over 
the unresolved issues. 
  "We have to deal with the budget as soon as possible," 
Murayama said. "We are reaching the limit. We want to sort 
things out somehow."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The head of the primary 
coalition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- 
SDPJ], indicated Thursday [21 April] that his party will remain 
in the eight-month-old ruling coalition, party officials said. 
Tomiichi Murayama told a party meeting that the SDP will 
continue efforts to keep the coalition intact against growing 
speculation that the SDP may leave the alliance over policy gaps. 
  Murayama, speaking at a meeting of the party's leadership 
body, the Central Executive Committee, expressed willingness to 
continue talks with other coalition partners to find a 
breakthrough to deadlocked negotiations on cementing policy 
accords. 
  The coalition hopes to come to a consensus prior to picking 
its candidate for a new premier in the Diet election who will 
succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Talks among the coalition partners remain at an impasse over 
how to find common ground to document policies on two remaining 
key policies -- tax reform and Japan's stand on North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development program. Murayama told the 
meeting that the SDP will modify its own alternative on the two 
key issues, saying the coalition partners can not reach 
agreement on policy talks if they refuse to change any wording.

  [Text] Yokohama, April 19 KYODO -- The Yokohama District 
Court found Tuesday [19 April] two former leaders of now-defunct 
support groups for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker, 
guilty of receiving tax refunds illegally through submitting 
false accounts. 
  The court sentenced Yoshio Nagano, 52, to 18 months 
imprisonment with four years' suspension and a 5 million yen 
fine, and Kiichiro Hara, 51, to one year imprisonment suspended 
for three years and a 3 million yen fine. The two previously 
led political groups for LDP House of Representatives member 
Akira Amari. 
  From 1989 to 1991, they submitted to the Kanagawa Prefecture 
Election Monitoring Committee reports of donations 10 times 
greater than those actually received. According to the 
accounts, the men received tax refunds and evaded some 68 
million yen in taxes. 
  Judge Hiroshi Akiyama said, "their criminal liabilities are 
serious since they established the political groups for the 
purpose of tax evasion by making unlawful use of the (state's) 
tax rebate system."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Establishing an economic 
affairs minister with broad jurisdiction is possible if the 
purpose is clarified, economic planning chief Manae Kubota said 
Tuesday [19 April]. At a press conference after what she said 
was probably the last regular meeting of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet, Kubota said the reported idea of such a post 
"is possible if the purpose is made clear." 
  "That purpose isn't clear to me," said Kubota, director 
general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). But she added, 
"It may be possible. The economy is a broad field." 
  The idea of a broadly defined economic affairs minister was 
reported in Tuesday's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, which quoted a Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] leader. The party is headed by Tsutomu 
Hata, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, believed to 
replace Hosokawa as premier. 
  Kubota also said the economy "is going in a brighter 
direction" but repeated concern about such uncertainties as the 
high yen and the possible effects of drawn-out political turmoil 
on the budget. She said the economy is at "the most important 
point in trying to get to its feet." 
  Kubota also said her Social Democratic Party should not 
agree 
to raising the consumption tax at the outset of coalition talks 
on a promised overhaul of Japan's tax system.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno indicated Tuesday [19 April] the central bank 
would soon declare the economic recession over. 
  Speaking at a luncheon meeting in Tokyo, sponsored by the 
Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Mieno said there were 
signs of improvement in the domestic economy, centering on 
personal consumption. Mieno, however, said the central bank is 
still unable to determine an economic pickup before key 
indicators are analyzed closely. 
  Steady progress in stock adjustments suggests the groundwork 
is being laid for economic recovery, he said. 
  Mieno also said the central bank sees no need to change the 
official discount rate for now from the present 1.75 percent per 
year.

despite a lack of clear-cut signals from government statistics. 
  Speaking at a news conference, TSE President Minoru Nagaoka 
said trading volume is still vulnerable to political uncertainty 
and other negative news, but he pointed to a tendency in the 
volume to rebound quickly after any setback. 
  Asked to comment on the overnight tumble on Wall Street due 
to a rise in U.S. interest rates, Nagaoka said he is closely 
watching the New York stock market, but added that he is 
confident Tokyo stocks will not follow New York.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy is poised 
to recover with the government's latest stimulus package 
expected to send it into a full pickup phase in the current 
fiscal year, Finance Ministry regional bureau chiefs said 
Thursday [21 April]. 
  The bright picture came in a report assessing overall 
economic activity based on reports by 11 regional financial 
bureau heads gathered in Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting. 
"The time is ripening for an economic recovery, with personal 
consumption showing brightness, housing construction remaining 
buoyant and public investment staying at high levels," the 
report said. 
  It also cited bright signs in some areas in production, a 
turn around in corporate outlook to profits for the first six 
months of the current year, and declining bankruptcy cases. 
  By steadily implementing the February 15.25 trillion yen 
stimulus package and the economy-oriented fiscal 1994 budget, 
the economy "is expected to move on to a full-fledged recovery 
track in the current fiscal year," the report said. 
  On the down side, it said corporate capital spending plans 
for the current year "remain cautious," and the labor condition 
is deteriorating, both mainly in the manufacturing sector.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The head of the Japan

he believes the Japanese economy remains in the doldrums and is 
showing few signs of recovery. JCCI Chairman Kosaku Inaba told 
reporters that the economic condition is neither improving nor 
worsening. 
  Inaba said the prolonged political uncertainties, recent 
hikes in public utility rates and the yen's appreciation against 
the dollar could affect an economic recovery. 
  He expressed concern over a delay in the selection of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's successor and called for urgent 
efforts to form a new cabinet and expedite Diet approval of the 
government budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan can attain the 
government's economic growth target of 2.4 percent for the 
current fiscal year, a senior Finance Ministry official said 
Thursday [21 April], brushing aside a weak International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) projection. 
  Vice Finance Minister Juro Saito, speaking at a regular news 
conference, also indicated that Japan is not considering fresh 
economic measures ahead of a meeting slated for Sunday in 
Washington of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group 
of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations. 
  The IMF said Wednesday in a twice-yearly report that Japan's 
growth in real gross domestic product will be 0.7 percent for 
calendar 1994, the lowest among the G-7 nations, and called for 
further fiscal and monetary measures. 
  The world economic report serves as a key material for the 
G-7 talks and the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF and the 
World Bank. 
  Referring to the IMF outlook, Saito said, "There are various 
ways to assess the economy... but we think the 2.4 percent 
target is possible by steadily implementing the ongoing stimulus 
measures." 
  "The economy has become brighter and is unlikely to fall 
further," Saito said, analyzing reports by the ministry's 
regional financial bureau chiefs. 
  Summing up reports by 11 regional chiefs who gathered in 
Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting, the ministry said 
earlier, "the time is ripening for an economic recovery," with a 
full-fledged recovery expected in the current fiscal year on the 
heels of February's 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and the 
fiscal 1994 budget. 
  On the fiscal side, Saito said that he interpreted the IMF 
report as calling for "continued measures and not additional 
ones." The report said, "For the upswing to gain sufficient 
momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of 
monetary conditions may well be required." 
  Considering monetary measures, Saito declined to comment, 
saying Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno clearly indicated 
his stance in his latest remarks to the press. Speaking to 
foreign correspondents in Tokyo Tuesday, Mieno said, "I'm not 
thinking of changing the discount rate at the moment."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan will back down from 
its plan to promote plutonium use for nuclear recycling, 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said 
Tuesday [19 April]. Kumagai was referring to reported calls by 
the Advisory Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for 
reviewing Japan's policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to 
meet energy demand in the future. 
  The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new 
energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the 
energy field. 
  Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the 
committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of 
plutonium. "Discussion so far by the committee seems to be 
convincing," Kumagai said. 
  Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium 
policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been 
cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of plutonium. 
  Kumagai said he will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Tuesday to discuss Japan's stance on the so-called trade 
"framework" talks with the United States. 
  Discussion will focus on assessing last week's meeting 
between Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in 
Marrakech, Morocco, in search of a breakthrough in the stalled 
framework talks, the trade minister said. 
  Kumagai said Japan should maximize its efforts to reopen the 
bilateral trade talks before the annual summit of the seven 
major industrialized countries in Naples in July. 
  The Hata-Kantor meeting failed to produce an accord on 
setting a time for resumption of the trade talks. But reports 
said some progress was made over "objective criteria" or 
numerical targets. 
  The framework talks have been suspended since Japan rejected 
a U.S. request to use numerical targets to measure the openness 
of its markets.

  [Text] Nagoya, April 20 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) said Wednesday [20 April] it has ordered mosaic tile 
makers to dismantle the price cartel for tiles sold at home and 
overseas. The FTC said the national union formed by 114 tile 
makers has fixed the prices of mosaic tiles for domestic sale 
and exports in violation of the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Commission officials said the tile makers, plagued by 
swollen 
inventories in the wake of the burst of the "bubble economy," 
formed the price cartel to prevent price falls. 
  The FTC issued the order after three rounds of 
investigations 
at the union's headquarters in Nagoya and other places, the 
officials said. 
  Tile makers belonging to the union set a low-end price for 
mosaic tiles at 95 yen per sheet, each consisting of 18 tiles, 
the officials said. 
  Companies not accepting the FTC order will be liable to a 
penalty fine set in proportion to sales.

<F P=106> [By Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 19 Apr -- According to a senior White 
House official and U.S. Government sources, the U.S. Government 
has decided to hold a Japan-U.S. summit between President 
Clinton and a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in 
Naples on 7 July immediately before the annual summit of the 
Group of Seven [G-7] industrialized nations to be held there. 
The U.S. Government will begin final coordination on the 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting after the new administration is 
inaugurated in Japan. 
  The next Japan-U.S. summit meeting was originally regarded 
as 
the deadline for drawing up agreements on all the sectors in the 
economic framework talks. However, since the framework talks 
were virtually broken off in February, the schedule is expected 
to be greatly delayed. Because both Japanese and U.S. 
Governments believe that "the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting 
will serve as a major turning point in efforts for the economic 
framework talks," they intend to seek the resumption of the 
economic framework talks and agreements on the three priority 
sectors -- namely, automobile and auto parts; government 
procurement; and insurance -- at least before the Japan-U.S. 
summit meeting. 
  It has so far been believed that the Japan-U.S. summit will 
take place before the Naples summit of G-7 leaders. There was 
speculation that the Japanese prime minister would visit the 
United States to hold summit talks with the U.S. President on 
his way to Naples. In response to the U.S. request, the 
Japanese Government and the new prime minister will make a final 
decision on the schedule for the Japan-U.S. summit after the new 
administration is inaugurated.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yoshihisa Furumori] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 18 Apr -- It was learned on 18 April 
that both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
separately expressed their concerns to top Japanese leaders that 
there were people in the center of Japan's ruling coalition who 
maintained strong ties with North Korea. They asked whether or 
not these people could be a stumbling block to sanctions against 
the DPRK, which might be imposed as a result of the nation's 
suspected nuclear program. The delivery of this strong concern 
and the questioning by top U.S. leaders indicates the Clinton 
administration has a strong sense of distrust in a group of 
people within the ruling coalition. 
  On 18 April a source well versed in Japan-U.S. relations 
said 
this concern was first revealed by President Clinton during the 
summit meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 21 
February. According to the source, Clinton said that if economic 
sanctions were imposed against the DPRK due to suspicions that 
Pyongyang was trying to arm itself with nuclear weapons, Japan's 
participation in the sanctions would be decisive. He then noted 
there was a person "in the center of the Hosokawa government" 
who maintains a close relationship with North Korea, and asked 
Hosokawa whether Japan could participate in sanctions in 
defiance of that person. 
  Clinton did not specify the person, but merely said he was 
"in the center of the government." However, Japanese officials 
involved in the summit said they felt President Clinton was 
alluding to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
Takemura served as secretary general of the delegation which 
visited the DPRK in September 1990 led by Shin Kanemaru. He was 
also actively engaged as a senior member of the Dietmen's League 
for the Promotion of Friendship Between Japan and North Korea 
[name as published]. 
  On 14 April, Vice President Gore met with Japan's Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakesh, 
Morocco, to attend a ministerial meeting of the GATT Uruguay 
Round trade negotiations. According to the same source, Gore 
expressed concern to Hata over the fact that the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which maintains relations with 
North Korea, is in both the Hosokawa government and the ruling 
coalition. He then asked Hata whether or not Tokyo could move 
toward sanctions despite the existence of the party. The source 
said Gore clearly mentioned the SDPJ at the meeting. 
  It is unusual that both the President and Vice President of 
the United States have separately expressed to the prime 
minister and the deputy prime minister of Japan their concern 
about a political force within the governing coalition. This 
could be a reflection of the U.S. perception that Japan's role 
in the DPRK nuclear issue is very important, and of its serious 
concern that a "connection with North Korea" in Japan might 
hinder Tokyo from imposing sanctions against the DPRK.

  [Text] In its front-page story in the 19 April evening 
edition, SANKEI SHIMBUN reported that President Clinton and 
other U.S. officials have made remarks suggesting "there are 
pro-North Korean forces within the ruling coalition parties." 
On 19 April, a top government official denied the remarks as 
groundless, saying: "We have let officials check whether remarks 
have been made to that effect, but at the end of the check no 
such remarks were found to have been made." 
  The front-page article cited the testimony of a source 
familiar with Japan-U.S. relations, the Japan-U.S. summit 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa in February, and the talks held between Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 
Marrakech, Morocco, on 14 April during the ministerial talks of 
the Uruguay Round. According to the testimony, during the 
Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton pointed out to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa that a political party which maintains a close 
relationship with North Korea is positioned at "the center of 
the government." Clinton then asked the prime minister whether 
Japan would be able to enforce economic sanctions against North 
Korea. Also, Vice President Gore candidly told Foreign Minister 
Hata that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is 
believed to have friendly ties with North Korea. Gore said he 
was wondering if Tokyo could really accept economic sanctions 
against North Korea as long as the SDPJ participated in the 
coalition government.

  [Text] Japanese Government special envoy Nobuo Matsunaga 
disclosed in a speech on the afternoon of 20 April that U.S. 
Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor said that "Japanese 
macroeconomic measures are most important" in dealing with the 
stalled Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. Matsunaga 
reported that Kantor again sought the continuation of income tax 
cuts and the implementation of other measures. 
  With regard to the priority sectors in the framework talks 
such as automobiles and auto parts, he said that "both Japan and 
the United States should make arduous efforts" to formulate 
objective criteria which do not entail numerical targets, and he 
stressed the importance of compromise by both sides. 
  Matsunaga visited Washington in early April to hold talks 
with U.S. Government officials. He touched on these talks in 
the speech. In reporting the U.S. position on this issue, he 
disclosed that Kantor had stated: "While specific issues with 
Japan surely need to be resolved, macroeconomic policies are 
most important. If the Japanese economy is not transformed into 
a domestic demand-oriented one through macropolicies, there can 
be no progress in Japanese-U.S. relations." In connection with 
this, Matsunaga said during the speech, "It is a fact that there 
are doubts overseas about the effectiveness of tax cuts and how 
much actual public investment is involved." "There is little 
time left before June. If we do not work hard on this, we will 
not make it in time." 
  Matsunaga also revealed that he had told U.S. officials that 
"from Japan's point of view, the U.S. battlefront is divided" 
and that he had expressed the view that differences of views 
inside the U.S. Government contributed to difficulties in 
bilateral negotiations. He reported that in response, U.S. 
officials had explained: "There is indeed room for some 
soul-searching. We are now building a consensus around USTR 
Kantor, who is responsible for government procurement, 
insurance, and other specific sectors of the framework talks."

  [Text] Kin -- The U.S. Marine Corps [USMC] on Okinawa 
began a live-fire exercise on Camp Hansen training field at 0803 
on 20 April [2303 GMT on 19 April]. For the exercise, Highway 
104 was closed for the fourth time this year. A notice by the 
USMC says the three-day exercise will be continued until 22 
April, using three gun platforms in the training field. The 
prefectural government said the exercise is the 146th since 
March 1973. 
  Kin just elected a new mayor on 17 April. Commenting on the 
exercise held in the wake of his inauguration, Mayor-elect 
Katsuhiro Yoshida stated: "U.S. exercises should be stopped. I 
am planning a field trip to inspect the areas adjoining the 
training field to learn about the actual problems of U.S. bases." 
  Early in the morning of 22 April, local leftist groups 
gathered around the training field and repeatedly shouted: 
"Stop the firing exercises!" About 30 people joined a rally 
held by The Security Repeal, Livelihood, and Democracy 
Protection Okinawa Prefecture United Action Liaison Council 
[Toitsuren] starting at 0700 [2200 GMT]. At the rally, Chairman 
Hiroaki Yoshizawa of the Anti-Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Council 
Okinawa Branch [Ken-Gensuikyo] stressed: "The live-fire exercise 
is held in the wake of a series of aircraft crashes on Kadena 
Air Base and Futenma Air Station. We must jointly oppose such 
brutal practices by the U.S. Forces." 
  Meanwhile, the Okinawa Peace Campaign Center also held a 
100-man rally on a hill in Igei District starting at 0800 [2300 
GMT]. Chairman Zenshun Arakaki stated: "U.S. Forces conduct 
various exercises almost daily, as if Okinawa is a battlefield. 
We must be persistent in opposing such practices in order to 
stop them someday."

remark. It cannot be denied that Egawa's comment was rather 
inconsiderate in giving the impression that the testing of 
high-vision broadcasting will stop immediately--even tomorrow. 
However, a closer study of the background of this comment allows 
us to find a significant meaning hidden in it, and this makes us 
realize that this comment should not be overlooked as a slip of 
the tongue. Egawa abruptly mentioned, "We should seek the 
digitalization of high vision, the analog-type HDTV," at the 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Social Capital Group meeting 
held on 18 February. The point is that this took place during 
the Shinseito group meeting. 
  In fact, the heated confrontation between Shinseito and the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] over the issue of running the 
MOPT has been accelerating since last summer, when the new 
government was born. The future course to be pursued by the 
respective parties on the issue of HDTV, which will be a 
generator of enormous demand in the 21st century, has often been 
rumored. Although NHK and the MOPT have been taking the 
initiative in developing HDTV, MOPT-related members of the LDP 
have served as the actual decisionmakers. Rushing to embrace 
the digitalization of HDTV by making high vision out-of-date 
will permit Shinseito to obtain new political power. 
  Amid such circumstances, we can regard Egawa's comment as a 
reflection of the intention of the MOPT to get out from under 
the LDP and move toward Shinseito. 
  If such a comment as "Executive officials of the MOPT 
frequently visited (Shinseito Secretary General) Ichiro Ozawa 
before Shinseito group meetings," is true, it is possible to 
assume that extensive groundwork had already been laid prior to 
Egawa's comment. 
  In the MOPT, there is a group of people who have developed 
close relations with Ozawa since he was a member of the LDP. 
They first met at "Ichinokai," a study group in the ministry 
once formed around Ozawa. Participants in this study group 
include Mr. Misuo Igarashi, director of the Telecommunications 
Policy Bureau; Akiyoshi Takada, deputy director of the same; 
Kanichiro Aritomi, director of the Policy Division of the same; 
Hideo Shimizu, director of the Broadcasting Administration 
Bureau; and other opinion leaders on the issues of the 
telecommunications and broadcasting administration of the MOPT. 
This illustrates that the Shinseito-oriented course had already 
been established. 
  The important point here is that a change in the direction 
of 
the MOPT does not merely mean a shift in the domestic power 
structure; it is also a matter of international concern. Ozawa, 
who made positive commitments to solving U.S.-Japanese 
construction-related frictions, as well as electronics- and 
telecommunications-related frictions, has been relied on heavily 
by the U.S. Government and has been considered "pro-U.S." 
Although I do not intend to discuss the real meaning of Ozawa's 
approaches here, it is clear that "taking a pro-Ozawa course 
means choosing a pro-U.S. course" (as was stated by a person 
with the MOPT). 
  As far as HDTV is concerned, the United States has already 
decided to adopt the digital method. Because European countries 
are also inclined to take the same course, the isolation of 
Japan, a country that is proceeding with the analog method, is 
becoming increasingly decisive. The United States is displeased 
by Japan's continued intention to stick with the high-vision 
choice because this will possibly prevent the entry of 
U.S.-method hardware and software into the Japanese market. 
  At the Shinseito group meeting, Egawa stressed, "Japan's 
high-vision-oriented commitment will create another trade 
friction," and he added the importance of taking a concerted 
step with the U.S. method by giving up Japan's own standard. 
  It can be said that the MOPT's pro-U.S. attitude was 
reflected well in the February resolution of trade frictions 
over the issue of Motorola's mobile telephones. The MOPT 
resolved the issue by making a substantial concession, which was 
a big surprise to other government agencies. Ichiro Ozawa is 
said to have taken various steps to settle the negotiations. 
  Because of the heated criticism of the Japanese bureaucracy 
by the U.S. Government, Kasumigaseki is becoming increasingly 
fed up with the United States. Amid these circumstances, the 
attitude of the MOPT appears to be odd. It is particularly 
interesting to observe the response of the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry [MITI], which is a rival of the MOPT. Such an abusive 
comment as "The decision made by the MOPT is traitorous in 
promoting Japan's becoming technologically subordinate to the 
United States" is heard from it. It is well-known that MITI is 
strongly opposed to the U.S. demand to introduce numerical 
targets at the U.S.-Japanese economic framework talks. This 
clearly illustrates a discrepancy between two high-tech 
ministries, MITI and the MOPT, in dealing with the United States. 
  Which ministry will take the leading role in Japan's 
information technology policies for the 21st century? It seems 
that the answer to this questions will significantly influence 
the U.S.-Japanese relationship in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Tadae Takubo, Kyorin University professor: </F>
"`U.S. Stern Expression Which Abandons Japan'; in special 
edition `Fearsome Neighbors'"] 
  [Text] Buchanan's Exasperation 
  I think there are many people who have forgotten the name 
Patick Buchanan. He is the neoisolationist who in the 1992 U.S. 
presidential election fought former President Bush for 
nomination as the Republican Party's presidential candidate. 
Though a neoisolationist, he is not a lightweight who indulges 
in irresponsible flattery of the public. He is a political 
commentator who served as a special adviser to [former] 
President Nixon and as a presidential adviser to [former] 
President Ford and [former] President Reagan, and who sets forth 
vigorous arguments in newspapers and on television. 
  Buchanan wrote an article in the 8 September 1991 edition of 
THE WASHINGTON POST about two and a half years ago and argued 
that "North Korea, which is openly trying to produce an atomic 
bomb is fearsome. But why is Kim Il-song's atomic bomb our 
problem, not that of the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, and 
Russia?" Since the range of the "Nodong-1" ground-to-ground 
missiles that North Korea possesses is 1,000 km, it is 
impossible for them to reach Hawaii. Why, in spite of this, must 
the United States alone worry about North Korean nuclear 
weapons? I feel as though the angry voice of Buchanan is 
carried to us that the Japanese must think this has nothing to 
do with them. 
  In the same article Buchanan stated that "The United States 
should announce the date on which it will withdraw all U.S. 
ground units from the Republic of Korea. Why must young American 
men be the first to die in the event that North Korea attacks 
across the demilitarized zone?" and "The security treaty with 
Japan should be scrapped. If the relatively small countries of 
East Asia fear the hegemony of Japan and China and desire the 
presence of the U.S. Navy, they must pay the cost." 
  Most Japanese probably feel strange when they hear this kind 
of statement because postwar Japan placed security, which is 
considered the first consideration for an ordinary country, 
completely in hands of the United States. Therefore, when there 
is an emergency on the Korean peninsula, most Japanese look on 
as idle spectators or make light of it, thinking that in the end 
the United States will probably do something. They firmly 
believe that since the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was concluded 
at the request of the United States, the United States would 
never broach the subject of scrapping it. And they are convinced 
that the reason Japan has been at peace is that it has a "peace 
constitution." They have frowned upon persons who say things 
contrary to this "common knowledge," thinking them to be hawks 
or right wing. 
  But what would they do if they themselves were U.S. 
citizens? 
Would they try to shed their blood were there an emergency on 
the Korean peninsula? Should Japan face danger, would they 
rescue, by a war to the death, selfish Japanese who is carefree 
while entrusting the safety of their own country to the United 
States? Now that the Cold War is over, I think that what U.S. 
citizens really feel are reflected in what Buchanan says. 
Buchanan garnered 37 percent of the votes in the New Hampshire 
primary that was held on 18 February 1992. President Bush, the 
incumbent, got 53 percent. Then Prime Minister Miyazawa was 
asked his impression by the press corps and answered: "Somebody 
like Buchanan is probably big only in that place (New 
Hampshire)." Buchanan heard of this and it made him very angry. 
In the end Buchanan did not become the presidential candidate of 
the Republican Party, but I think we cannot simply overlook the 
isolationist trend or the inward-looking posture that is being 
born in the United States. 
<H5>  The Isolationist Posture of "Postwar Generation" Clinton </H5>
  Then, what kind of posture does the Clinton administration 
have? I have observed the past five presidents: Nixon, Ford, 
Carter, Reagan, and Bush. It is impossible to unreasonably 
classify these administrations in a black or white manner as 
having been internationalist or isolationist, or 
"outward-looking" or "inward-looking," but I think that what the 
Clinton adminstration, which was born against the background of 
the end of the Cold War, aims at is very distinctive. First, 
Clinton is the first postwar-generation president who does not 
know what things were like before World War II. Second, it is 
necessary to remember that the reason the administration was 
born is found in the rebuilding of the domestic economy. Third, 
the cold treatment of Japan. Fourth, the patronage of Russia, 
particularly of President Yeltsin personally, to an extent which 
can be felt to be abnormal. From this my diagnosis is that the 
Clinton administration is clearly an "isolationist" 
administration and has begun to lose both the will and the 
ability to fulfill the role of policeman throughout the world. 
In other words, its orientation is the neoisolationist tendency 
which Buchanan advocates, so one can assume that it will do its 
utmost to avoid action that will shed the blood of young 
American men for the sake of Japan or the Korean peninsula. 
  While he was the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, 
Clinton made a speech at the Los Angeles conference on world 
problems on 13 August 1992: "In order to play a firm role in the 
new world, the United States must restore its economic 
strength." In concrete terms he said that it was encouragement 
of investment and strengthening of industry's international 
competitiveness. This basic view runs through his inaugural 
address, the "comprehensive economic policy" announced on 17 
February 1993 after his inauguration, and his State of the Union 
Address read before a joint session of Congress on 25 January 
1994. 
  What the president stressed in the State of the Union 
Address 
was probably a request for the cooperation of Congress 
concerning job creation, universal national insurance, welfare 
reform, promotion of democracy, anticrime measures, and 
revitalization of U.S. communities, and making clear the 
attitude of stressing domestic affairs. In the small space which 
dealt with foreign affairs, only 10 percent of the entire State 
of the Union Address, where he advocated that the United States 
recover its leadership and support democratization, nothing 
differs from what had been said repeatedly up till now. 
<H5>  Japan Does Not Notice "Change of Heart" of the United States </H5>
  When one gives it some thought, there is reason for the 
Clinton administration to become "isolationist," and something 
is the matter with those who say such things as that it were 
outrageous for the United States to abandon the position of 
world policeman. Are not Japanese the only ones who have not 
noticed that the world environment changed completely with the 
end of the Cold War? 
  Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard University wrote an 
article titled "Why Is International Ascendancy Important?" in 
the Spring 1993 issue of INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, and heaped 
scathing criticism on Japan. In the article he listed existence 
of a common enemy, a relationship of common economic interests, 
and agreement of values as preconditions for an alliance. 
Economic friction between Japan and the United States has 
existed for some time, but it had only secondary importance when 
the common enemy of the "Soviet threat" existed before one's 
eyes. However, now that the "Soviet threat" has diminished, one 
should judge that Japan and the United States have entered an 
economic war. The common values of democracy and market economy 
that Japan and the United States hold will probably not 
disappear, but it is difficult to think that they will become 
the absolute condition for an alliance. It is necessary for 
Japan to become aware quickly that the content of the Japan-U.S. 
relationship has changed. 
  The Clinton administration fixed its eyes on the Asia 
Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and in November 1993 held an 
APEC summit conference in Seattle. President Clinton, who made a 
speech at the conference, declared openly that "The United 
States has no intention of continuing to bear the heavy burden 
of its military presence and regional leadership in Asia if 
denied the benefit of growth which produces stability." If told 
frankly that the United States participates in APEC because it 
can gain economic benefit, and that without such benefit, it 
will not shoulder unnecessary responsibility in the region, 
people who cannot free themselves from old stereotyped thinking 
will probably be shocked. But if Japan tries standing in the 
U.S. position, it is a very natural statement. If I were 
President Clinton, I would probably just roar at a country that 
was shocked by this: "Don't act like a baby!" 
  In the Gulf war Japan paid $13 billion and left the 
dangerous, dirty, and difficult international job to 29 
countries, including the United States. Therefore, in the event 
that an emergency should occur on the Korean peninsula, it would 
have neither qualification nor grounds for rebuttal if it were 
informed by President Clinton that "we will leave the dangerous 
work to Japan and will shoulder only a suitable amount of 
money." It is merely a matter of Japan being convinced 
arbitrarily that, although the Cold War has ended, since the 
United States is still the leading country in the world, in an 
emergency on the Korean peninsula it has a "duty" or a 
"responsibility" to control it. 
  At the beginning of last January an agreement was reached at 
U.S.-North Korean working-level talks. But why didn't the U.S. 
side insist strongly on a special inspection of the two 
unreported nuclear waste storage facilities in the vicinity of 
Yongbyon? The 7 January issue of THE WASHINGTON POST criticized 
the negotiation method and rapped "virtual unconditional 
surrender of the United States," but from the very beginning the 
Clinton administration has been timid, not wanting to make a 
dangerous gamble on the Korean peninsula. Notwithstanding that 
even the WASHINGTON POST would criticize that "the Clinton 
administration's adventurism is dangerous," should it reject 
North Korea's demands and plunge into an all-out showdown. 
Congressional criticism of the Clinton administration's measures 
toward Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti was always "refrain from going 
too far." 
  When President Clinton met with President Yeltsin in 
Vancouver in April 1993 he advised the Russian leader, who was 
about to visit Japan, "when Japanese say yes it means no." 
President Yeltsin wrote this down in a note, but forgot to take 
the note with him when he left the site of the meeting. In spite 
of the fact that Russia's reform policy line has to be revised 
and that the extreme right has risen in Zhirinovskiy, it is said 
that President Clinton, who visited Moscow in mid-January, was 
in high spirits at a dinner party held at President Yeltsin's 
villa and played his saxophone. One wonders would President 
Clinton ever perform "Summertime" and "My Funny Valentine" at 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's villa in Karuizawa? 
  Presidential Assistant W. Anthony Lake (in charge of 
national 
security) announced last September that the United States would 
change the Cold War era strategy of "containment," and adopt a 
"strategy of expansion" which enlarged the group of nations with 
democratic government and market economies. That will do for an 
ideal, but does the United States have the strength to support 
it? It is uncertain whether public opinion will emerge which 
demands that at times the blood of young American men should be 
shed in order to advance a "strategy of expansion." If the 
"isolationist" posture is continued into the 21st century, the 
U.S. military presence in Asia may end. Japan is not even 
mentally prepared to deal with that.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of how to deal with the 
DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, which is one of 
the focal issues in the ruling coalition parties' ongoing policy 
coordination meeting, a government source said on the morning of 
20 April that if a naval blockade is implemented as part of 
economic sanctions by the UN Security Council, Japan "will not 
participate in sanctions premised on the use of force." He thus 
indicated that Japan will not participate in such a naval 
blockade. 
  While a blockade is meant to ensure the effectiveness of 
economic sanctions, and no use of force is involved in the 
objective and mission of such an action, "corresponding 
measures" are permitted under "certain conditions"--for 
instance, if the other party resorts to armed resistance.

  [Text] With regard to the question of Japan's permanent 
membership on the UN Security Council [UNSC], a top Foreign 
Ministry official said on 20 April: "If we do not join the 
UNSC, there are various kinds of information that we cannot 
obtain. In order to play an active role, Japan should attain 
permanent membership on its own initiative rather than wait for 
other nations' recommendations." He thus indicated that with 
the inauguration of the new administration, Japan should 
demonstrate an even more positive attitude than that of the 
Hosokawa administration.

measures to be taken by the government in the event of economic

  With regard to the increase in the consumption tax rate,

saying: "The SDPJ is terming administrative reform the source of 
revenue to cover tax cuts. This is nonsense if you do not have

  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter 
in Tokyo on 20 April, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Don 
McKinnon, who is on a visit to Japan, said, "We must keep in 
mind that China is not as concerned over the issue of North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons as are other 
nations." In the interview, he also said he was doubtful about 
how far China would go in taking concerted steps with Japan, the 
United States, and South Korea to resolve the issue. 
  In late March, the UN Security Council issued a presidential 
statement calling on North Korea to accept international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. Commenting on the 
opinion that China took the initiative in issuing the 
presidential statement, the New Zealand deputy prime minister 
denied that China took any initiative, saying, "Other nations 
decided to issue that presidential statement out of 
consideration for China." In calling China the "player who 
holds the key," he stressed the need to continue the efforts to 
urge China to get involved in the issue.

<F P=106> [Summary of remarks by Aoyama Gakuin University Professor </F>
Ryutaro Komiya from an interview with unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] It is incorrect to regard the trade surplus as 
"profits." U.S. deficits do not also mean that the United 
States is suffering losses. Surplus countries provide "goods" 
to deficit countries in exchange for "funds." Trade surpluses 
and deficits have nothing to do with profits and losses because 
surplus countries do not take away funds without providing goods. 
  The surpluses earned in Japan are invested in foreign 
countries. Some of them are invested directly in building 
factories, and others in bonds, such as U.S. Government bonds. 
Wherever they are invested, they are put to good use. 
  Some people say that domestic investment should be increased 
rather than making use of foreign investment. However, their 
opinion does not touch on the essence of this issue. Private 
companies are supposed to invest in projects which are more 
profitable. Their business operations should not be manipulated 
artificially. With regard to public investment, the cost of 
building subways should be borne by those who will benefit from 
them. It is improper to increase the burden of government 
spending. 
  In any case, regardless of the size of the surplus, the 
government should judge the proper scale of public investment. 
  It is important to lower import barriers and to improve the 
transparency of the various systems and policies. However, 
these measures will not be effective in reducing the surplus. 
Even if the volume of specific imports, such as cars, is 
increased, the surplus reduction effect will be offset by the 
foreign exchange rate moving toward the depreciation of the yen. 
It is beneficial for the people for good and cheap products to 
be imported from foreign countries. Therefore, regardless of the 
surplus, steady efforts should be made in dealing with this task. 
  A substantial portion of the current surplus has resulted 
from the sluggish economic situation. I think there are still 
several financial measures to be implemented, including lowering 
the official discount rate. However, with regard to fiscal 
policies, any further economic stimulation may, on the contrary, 
destabilize the economy.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated 
that a February package of measures to stimulate Japan's economy 
generated the effect of increasing Japan's gross domestic 
product [GDP] by only 0.7 percent. The Japanese Government is 
refuting the IMF's estimate, arguing "The IMF has underestimated 
the effects generated by the package." Commenting on the IMF's 
estimate that the February package generated the effect of 
cutting Japan's current account surplus by only $2 billion, the 
Japanese Government is expressing discontent with the estimate 
made by the international monetary organization, asserting, "The 
package is supposed to have generated the effect of reducing 
Japan's current account surplus more than the IMF has estimated 
it has." The Finance Ministry is wary of the possibility that 
the United States will ask Japan to map out an additional 
package of measures to spur its economy. 
  At the time of formulating the February package of economic 
stimulus measures, the Japanese Government announced that the 
package would cause Japan's GDP to increase by about 2.2 percent 
within one year. The IMF has estimated, however, that the 
February package generated only one-third of the desired effect 
for stimulating Japan's economy. The Economic Planning Agency 
[EPA], which was in charge of formulating the package, assumes 
that the IMF has probably underestimated the role of the income 
tax cut and financial investments and loans in stimulating 
Japan's economy. 
  The Japanese Government has not made public how the package 
of economic stimulus measures has generated the effect of 
reducing Japan's current account surplus out of the fear that 
"the U.S. Government may use the effect as numerical targets." 
Commenting on the IMF's estimate that the February package 
generated the effect of reducing Japan's current account surplus 
by only $2 billion, the EPA argues, "The package generated the 
effect of expanding domestic demand to a greater degree than the 
IMF has estimated occurred." The EPA anticipates that the 
package will further reduce Japan's current account surplus. 
  The IMF has estimated that Japan will achieve 0.7-percent 
real growth in 1994. A senior EPA official says: "In September 
1993, the IMF announced that Japan would achieve 2.0-percent 
real growth in 1994. We cannot understand why the IMF has 
lowered its original prediction of 2.0-percent real growth for 
Japan by 1.3 percentage point despite the fact that personal 
spending has shown signs of recovering since late last year and 
Japan's economy is moving toward a recovery."

  [Text] On 18 April, the Environment Agency's "Study Panel 
on the Promotion of Low-Pollution Vehicles and Their Widespread 
Use in Local Districts" (with Waseda University Professor 
Yasuhiro Daisei as its chairman) compiled its final report in 
which it recommended that "to promote the widespread use of 
low-pollution vehicles, public agencies such as the national and 
local governments should set specific targets and try to 
actively promote the introduction of such vehicles." For the 
first time, the report shows in concrete figures that, in 
reality, there have only been a few cases in which these 
environmentally clean vehicles have been introduced even in 
cases where the opportunities were very good. On the basis of 
the report, the Environment Agency plans to consult with the 
relevant government ministries and agencies and then include in 
the basic environment program on which it is currently working 
the specific number of low-pollution vehicles it hopes to 
introduce within a certain period. 
  Currently, there is not enough demand to warrant 
manufacturers' mass production of low-pollution vehicles. This 
is reflected in the high prices of such vehicles, and this in 
turn impedes their widespread use. Thus, as a last resort to 
improve the ever-worsening air pollution in metropolitan 
districts in Tokyo and six prefectures, the government has 
spelled out a plan to introduce 300,000 environmentally clean 
vehicles by 2000. These are vehicles which produce no or very 
little exhaust emissions, such as electric cars, those powered 
by methanol or natural gas, and hybrid cars combining a 
conventional engine with electric power. It is feared, however, 
that the government's plan may not be carried out successfully. 
  Late last year, the Environment Agency's study panel 
surveyed 
government ministries and agencies, and prefectures, as well as 
cities with at least 500,000 inhabitants, and questioned 
officials at such public agencies as to what extent they could 
introduce low-pollution vehicles. The panel subsequently 
analyzed the results of the survey which showed that although, 
with proper management, approximately half of the 68,000 
vehicles officially used by such organizations could be replaced 
with low-pollution vehicles, only 268 such vehicles are 
currently in use. 
  In particular, although approximately 4,000 electric cars 
could definitely be used by central government ministries and 
agencies, only two, as a matter of fact, are being used as 
official vehicles for senior officials at the Environment Agency 
and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Survey 
results also showed that although hybrid vehicles could replace 
all 40 trucks and buses currently being used, not even one has 
been replaced. 
  The report compiled by the Environment Agency's study panel 
also touches on the issue of how government ministries and 
agencies and local governments ought to use official vehicles 
for transporting senior officials. In its report, the panel 
urges public agencies to further strive actively toward 
promoting the widespread use of low-pollution vehicles. For 
example, it suggests employing a combination of railway systems 
using electric railcars.

  [Text] On 19 April, a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
leader commented on the appointment of chief cabinet secretary, 
a focal point in the selection of members of the "new 
administration of Tsutomu Hata." He indicated his basic 
intention to appoint a Shinseito member as chief cabinet 
secretary, saying: "The relationship between chief cabinet 
secretary (and prime minister) is like being bound by a common 
fate. We hope that a person who is on friendly terms with the 
new prime minister will be named as chief cabinet secretary." 
In concrete terms, it is believed that he made the remarks 
while keeping in mind Hajime Funada, former director general of 
the Economic Planning Agency, and other Shinseito members. In 
this connection, a Komeito leader said on the same day: "It is 
appropriate to appoint a Shinseito member as the chief cabinet 
secretary." He indicated that if the number of cabinet posts 
occupied by Shinseito members increases, it is better to adjust 
the allocation of cabinet posts rather than that of the chief 
cabinet secretary. A Democratic Socialist Party leader agreed 
with them.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In his 
speech over the national television of 16 April the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray has stated the government's stands on 
organized by the Presidium of the Mongolian Democratic 
Association meetings held at the unsanctioned place the D. 
Suhbaatar Square, demands for resignation of the government and 
hunger strike. [sentence as received] 
  The settling down the issue on the resignation of the 
government, granting it a vote of confidence or nonconfidence 
are pertaining in pursuance with the Constitution of Mongolia to 
the prerogative of the Great State Hural. 
  The government regards that there is no reasons to pose the 
question on the self dismissal of the government on its own 
initiative because it is taking all the possible measures for 
the implementation of a programme of its action considering that 
it is quite possible to be fulfilled within its term of office. 
  In reference to the slander addressing himself he has 
referred to the court which probably will establish the truth 
and make it public. 
  The diversity of opinions is quite natural under the 
conditions of a democratic society. 
  However they should be solved not via meetings ultimatum 
ways 
but within the frameworks of the parliament on the basis of 
allround consideration weighing all those different opinions. 
So I think that the organizers of those meetings and hunger 
strikes ought to have a sense to stop their actions, P. Jasray 
said. 
  The prime minister called upon the people to observe 
strictly 
the law, display a sense and security and concentrate their 
forces and attention on the present day's hard economic 
situation of the country. 
  The organizers of those actions, the prime minister said, 
should to bear responsibility for all the adverse aftermath of 
arranging the meetings at the unsanctioned place and announcing 
the hunger strike.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Council for National Security of Mongolia has discussed the 
current political situation established due to the hunger strike 
at the D. Suhbaatar and Erh Choloonii Squares and their possible 
aftermath and taken a decision in this connection which provides 
for that it would be expedient to keep the Great State Hural 
informed about the political situation settled in the country 
with hearing during its discussion at the parliament's session 
of the demands put forth by those participating in the hunger 
strikes. 
  Then it goes on to say that the demands by the participants 
of the hunger strike at the Suhbaatar Square are not to be 
accepted as being groundless. Taking into account that the 
hunger strike and the following political crisis might be of 
adverse consequences for the national interests the council 
considers it is necessary to call upon the hunger strikers to 
stop their actions. 
  Then the council also recommended to submit for 
consideration 
to the Great State Hural for approval the draft law on 
procedures of holding demonstrations and meetings. 
  In this connection it is thought to be necessary to work out 
in immediate future proper law on the press and until its coming 
into force it recommended to the government to carry on the 
radio and television "Tribune of Political Parties" programme as 
well as to settle urgently all the topical issues of concern to 
be regulated in terms of the press.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The tense 
situation shaped down in the country due to the political hunger

addressing the parliament to discuss at the morning meeting both 
the demands of hungers and the opinion of the prime minister on 
this point.

released by the leader of the Mongolian Bourgeois Party [MBP] 
and owner of a large private "Buyan" company B. Jargalsaihan. 
In his interview to the Mongolian television he defined the 
stand of his party regarding the tense situation shaped down in 
the country due to a political hunger strike by representatives 
of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) a number of 
opposition forces of the country demanding for resignation of 
the incumbent government. 
  According to him, the government headed by P. Jasray is not 
to be blamed for all the economic and other hardships of the 
country. 
  We should remember of the state of the country at the moment 
of its forming as well as the state of the national economy. If 
the demands of those participating in the hunger strike are 
associated with some certain persons their cases should be 
solved within the frameworks of the law, he pointed out. 
  It is the conscious labour of every Mongolian, discipline, 
order and good arrangement and not empty words and mere 
declarations and political hunger strikes and chaos that will go 
out Mongolia from the economic crisis and destruction, considers 
B. Jargalsaihan. The leader of the MBP condemns the extremity 
of actions of the opposition forces arranging the current hunger 
strike.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States should hold preliminary negotiations on "objective 
criteria" for gauging foreign penetration of Japanese markets 
before resuming bilateral "framework" trade talks, a senior 
Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [21 April]. Koichiro 
Matsuura, former deputy foreign minister, made the remark at a 
lecture in Tokyo. 
  The framework talks have been stalemated since the Feb. 11 
breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit over objective criteria. 
  Matsuura, commenting on the Group of Seven (G-7) summit 
scheduled to open July 8, forecast that Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's successor is likely to meet U.S. President 
Bill Clinton immediately before the summit. 
  Regarding the April 15 talks in Marrakech, Morocco, between 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor, Matsuura said Kantor's comments 
seem to show "serious U.S. intentions" to settle the framework 
talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Nearly 70 percent of 
Japanese and 50 percent of South Koreans polled say the United 
States is the most important country in international relations, 
a survey jointly conducted by Japanese and South Korean think 
tanks said Thursday [21 April]. Both the Japanese and South 
Koreans said Japan is the second most important country, 
according to the poll, conducted last October among 300 people 
in Tokyo and 300 people in Seoul, all aged 25 to 45. 
  The survey was jointly carried out by the Dentsu Institute 
for Human Studies, affiliated with the Japanese advertising 
agency Dentsu Inc., and the Hanbek Foundation, South Korea's 
leading private think tank. It showed how citizens in the two 
countries view each other in such fields as politics, economy, 
society, culture, corporations and human relations. 
  Regarding a question on what was considered South Korea's 
most famous company in Japan, 12 percent of the Japanese said 
"Hyundai," followed by "Samsung" at 9 percent and "Lotte" at 8 
percent. 
  Meanwhile, 40 percent of the South Koreans said "Sony" when 
asked to choose the most famous Japanese firm in South Korea, 
with 12 percent opting for "Mitsubishi" and 4 percent each 
selecting "Toyota" and "Honda," the survey said. 
  The survey also asked, "Would you do overtime work even on a 
wedding anniversary day?" Fifty percent of the Japanese said 
they would stay at the office rather than go home, while 50 
percent of the South Koreans answered, "It depends on the 
situation." 
  Regarding AIDS as a social issue, 88 percent of the Japanese 
and 64 percent of the South Koreans said it is "serious." 
  The survey was released for a symposium held Thursday in 
Tokyo titled, "The Outlook for 2005 in East Asia." 
  Ten panelists from Japan, South Korea and China took part, 
including Heita Kawakatsu, a professor at Waseda University and 
Kim Yong-wun, president of Hanyang University of South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director 
General Kazuo Aichi offered Thursday [21 March] to take 
legislative action if the United Nations adopts economic 
sanctions against North Korea over its rejection of full 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities, Japanese 
officials said. Aichi told U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry, however, that the action will be within the framework of 
the pacifist Constitution which bars the country from resorting 
to the threat or use of force as a means of settling 
international disputes. 
  The defense ministers of Japan and the United States agreed 
that the U.N. Security Council will respond if diplomatic 
efforts fail to settle the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Perry arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day from Seoul for a 
two-day visit to Japan. He will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Friday.

  [Text] Kobe, April 19 KYODO -- Police searched the office 
of a Japanese trader Tuesday [19 April] on suspicion that it 
illegally remitted 118,860 dollars to the banking account of a 
North Korean trading house based in Pyongyang. The trading 
company, Mitaka Boeki, allegedly contravened a requirement under 
the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law to report to 
the finance minister any overseas remittance of money exceeding 
5 million yen. 
  Investigators suspect the company fabricated a contract 
document regarding the import of North Korean marine products to 
make the banking remittance look legal, police said. 
  Police said they suspect the Kobe-based trader also exported 
50 used cars worth 255,000 dollars to North Korea without 
obtaining the required permission from the prefectural public 
safety commission. 
  Remittances of money from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in 
Japan to North Korea have come under scrutiny in connection with 
allegations that Pyongyang is trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
Some U.S. Congress members and government officials have been 
urging Japan to regulate the flow of money which the Japanese 
Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimates at up 
to 200 billion yen a year. 
  Earlier this year, police raided another Japanese trading 
company on suspicion that they exported to North Korea 
high-technology equipment capable of being used for military 
purposes. 
  The Yokohama-based trading house was searched on January 14 
on suspicion that it exported a spectrum analyzer that could be 
used to boost the target-hitting accuracy of the Nodong-1 
missiles Pyongyang test-fired in the Sea of Japan last year. 
Police arrested the president of the company, Masahiko Kondo, 
on the day and sent papers to the prosecutors on March 30.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- An influential business 
group on Tuesday [19 April] urged the government to carry out 
further deregulation in telecommunications and information 
fields, giving the private sector a wider role in constructing 
infrastructure. 
  A report from the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren) recommended construction of a nationwide optical 
fiber communication network as a core project in Japan's future 
infrastructure in advanced telecommunications. It should be 
built through free-market competition and private-sector 
participation, utilizing financial support from the public 
sector, it says. 
  The report also calls for simplification of procedures in 
the 
radio frequency licensing system to encourage new entries into 
mobile phones. The recommendations will be submitted to 
ministries and agencies for inclusion in a government 
deregulation program scheduled for release this year.

  My current visit to Mongolia which is the first one is a

<F P=106> [By Akio Tamesada; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr -- An International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) source revealed on 20 April that the DPRK (North 
Korea) sent a letter to IAEA on 20 April indicating a positive 
attitude toward inspections of nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. 
While details are not available, the DPRK seems to have 
attached certain conditions. The IAEA started considering on 20 
April whether or not to accept the North Korean proposal. A 
conclusion is expected to be reached in a few days. 
  The IAEA inspected seven nuclear facilities in North Korea 
in 
early March. However, it was not able to inspect a nuclear fuel 
recycling facility, the "Institute of Radiation Chemistry," 
although the inspection had been previously agreed upon. 
Therefore, the IAEA has been demanding that the unfinished 
activities obstructed by North Korea during the March inspection 
be carried out fully. 
  To sustain the reliability of data obtained during the last 
inspection, films and batteries of monitor cameras have to be 
replaced in early May. The IAEA will probably take this into 
consideration in its deliberation on the letter from the DPRK. 
  The March inspections consisted of limited inspections to 
ascertain whether there had been any conversion of nuclear 
substances to military use since February 1993, after the IAEA's 
regular inspections were suspended. Therefore, even if 
additional inspections are carried out fully this time, they 
will merely mean the completion of the March inspections. The 
possibility of resuming special inspections and of implementing 
special inspections of two undeclared facilities suspected of 
being involved in nuclear weapons development remains uncertain.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with DPRK President Kim </F>
Il-song by special correspondent Pedro Margolles Villanueva at 
the Government Palace in Pyongyang on 18 April] 
  [Text] Pyongyang--DPRK leader Kim Il-song has denied his 
government's intentions or capacity to produce nuclear weapons 
because this would make no sense. However, Kim warned that the 
United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and 
coercion it can bring the DPRK to its knees. 
  The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an 
exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace. 
  In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim Il-song talked about 
the 
tense situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations 
with China and other countries, foreign investments, and the 
prospects for the country's reunification. Kim also spoke 
fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President Fidel 
Castro. 
  In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern 
buildings and wide avenues welcome a sunny spring. 
  Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the 
celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as 
the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in 
Pyongyang. 
  One does not get a sense of a war-like atmosphere in some 
areas of the Korean countryside. The peasants work the land, 
grow rice, and the industries continue operating. 
  An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in 
the 
august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim 
Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly. 
  "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing 
nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we 
did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria 
ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to 
ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said. 
  Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction 
of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The 
United States deployed a large number of these weapons to 
maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to 
confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy 
in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula began with the hostile U.S. policy toward his country, 
and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral negotiations. 
  Considering that in recent years the Cold War ended 
worldwide 
and North and South Korea have signed nonaggression agreements 
and a joint declaration on denuclearization of the peninsula, 
there is no justification for the United States to continue 
maintaining its nuclear arms in the South, the president pointed 
out. 
  The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in 
the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after 
the monumental battles of 1945. 
  Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion 
of 
Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce 
battles were waged and the country was virtually destroyed. The 
38th Parallel and Panmunjom became fixed in the memory of 
humanity through persistent anticommunist propaganda that 
depicted U.S. citizens as defenders of noble ideals. 
  Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the 
leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including 
Pyongyang, which had been razed. Industry was constructed and 
agriculture reestablished. 
  Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has 
eradicated poverty. 
  That same man, who has a great deal of history in his 
background, now explains that "in order to not lose the control 
they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the 
North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading 
groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the 
situation." South Korean authorities have joined this nuclear 
scandal and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war. 
  The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he 
said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing 
international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it 
worsened the situation to the extreme, he added. 
  Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure and coercion can 
never be the method to resolve problems. 
  The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through 
pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees, 
because they value independence as they value their own lives. 
  If it becomes obstinate in pressuring our republic, we will 
be forced to adopt legitimate self-defense measures to safeguard 
the nation's dignity and sovereignty. 
  During the interview, the paramount Korean leader 
reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic Korea is 
to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. Whether it can 
be resolved through peaceful means depends entirely on the 
United States, which must cease its clumsy international 
pressure against our republic and adopt a trustworthy position, 
he added. 
  International organizations should not support the unjust 
demands of this power (the United States); instead, they should 
endorse solutions to the problem, Kim Il-song stressed. 
<H5>  Foreign Relations </H5>
  Korea wants to maintain good relations with its neighbors. 
With China, relations are good; with Japan, they are hostile. 
The traditional friendship between Korea and China continues to 
develop. The Japanese Government has maintained unalterable 
hostility, and if an unexpected incident takes place here, it 
would not bode well for Japan, he said. 
  When dealing with international relations, the paramount 
leader of the DPRK confirmed that his government's foreign 
policy is based on the ideals of independence, peace, and 
friendship. He said Korea hopes to foster cooperation with 
socialist and nonaligned nations and to establish links with 
capitalist nations that respect its sovereignty. 
  Korea opposes all types of domination and submission, and it 
attributes a great deal of importance to linking itself 
peacefully to nearby nations, "some of which, he indicated, get 
along well with us, while others do not." With China we have 
good relations.'' Korea and China are neighbors, separated by 
rivers, and their peoples are beloved comrades in arms and 
brothers who struggle for a common cause. Resolutely united, 
they have struggled and shed their blood in the fight against 
imperialism. They have been supporting and cooperating with 
each other in their efforts for socialism.'' [quotation marks as 
received] 
  The president explained that the traditional friendship 
between Korea and China continues to develop in the political, 
economic, and cultural fields because of joint efforts of the 
two nations' government parties and peoples. 
  In terms of Japan, he indicated that, on the contrary, 
normal 
relations have not been established between the two nations 
because the Japanese Government has maintained a policy of 
unalterable hostility. In recent times, it has played into the 
hands of the United States in its conspiracy against Korea, 
thereby undermining the resolution of the nuclear problem on the 
peninsula. It is attempting to realize its dirty political and 
military ambitions. He warned: "If the situation worsens here 
and an unexpected event takes place, this would not bode well 
for Japan. The Japanese Government should look at the reality 
of the situation and act with moderation." 
  As for economic relations with other countries, he 
explained that they are being expanded and developed not only 
through trade but also through other means such as joint 
administration and cooperation, which helps build the economy 
and follows the trend of international economic cooperation. 
  He said that a foreign investment law and other laws have 
been established in the DPRK to encourage foreign investment in 
the republic. All of these measures are based on the principles 
of complete equality and mutual benefit, protection of the 
foreign businesses, and safeguard of the foreign businesses' 
legitimate rights and interests. 
  Kim Il-song explained that the Rajin-Sonbong zone has been 
created as a center for free trade and a free economy, where a 
better environment and better conditions for investors are 
promoted. It is located on the border with China and Russia. It 
has great potential because of its advantageous economic and 
geographic conditions. Many countries want to invest in the 
Rajin-Sonbong zone, and the government of the republic has its 
doors open to foreign investors, he indicated. 
<H5>  The Reunification of Korea </H5>
  Our people face great difficulties and obstacles for the 
reunification of the fatherland, but the prospect is viewed 
optimistically, President Kim Il-song said. 
  The paramount leader of the DPRK explained that every effort 
is being made to undertake at all costs this historic task in 
the 1990's. 
  Last year, the "10-Point Program of the Great Pannational 
Unity for the Reunification of the Fatherland" was presented. 
It unanimously reflects the aspirations of all fellow 
countrymen in the North, South, and overseas to achieve 
reintegration and national prosperity, above differences of 
ideology and regime. 
  Nevertheless, he said, the South Korean authorities ignored 
that aspiration of the entire nation, following a path of 
submission to foreign forces and of confrontation with the 
North. The current "power" in South Korea is a servile and a 
turncoat power, which faithfully follows the foreign forces. 
  The president indicated his people face great difficulties 
in 
their struggle for the reunification of the fatherland, but they 
are optimistic about the prospects for this task. "The forces in 
favor of reunification irreversibly will overcome and defeat the 
separatists." 
  The so-called Korean war began on 25 June 1950 when South 
Korean Army troops launched, with the support of the United 
States, an invasion into the northern region of the peninsula 
where the DPRK was established in 1945, after having defeated 
the fascist Japanese Army. The response by the North was strong 
and the North's military units occupied Seoul. 
  The United States directly involved itself in the conflict 
to 
save its about-to-be-defeated allies. Three years of war went 
by. This aggressor, the Yankee army, suffered 405,998 
casualties; the puppet South Korean Army suffered 1.1 million 
casualties; and countries that were allies of the United States 
in this war suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Much of North 
Korea was virtually destroyed. The war ended on 27 July 1953. 
The United States was unable to occupy the North. The country 
remained divided. Forty years have gone by since the war ended. 
The North has been totally reconstructed and prosperity is 
tangible. 
  President Kim Il-song continued: Now, considering that there 
are ideologic differences and different social regimes in the 
North and South, we have drawn a more rational path for the 
reunification of the fatherland. Our proposal is to unite in a 
confederated state that features two regimes and two governments. 
  He said this proposal is fair and realistic and permits an 
expeditious reunification of the country in an independent and 
peaceful way, without either side defeating the other. After 
its reunification, Korea will function as a neutral nation 
without becoming a satellite of any other nation and without 
participating in any military alliance or political bloc. 
<H5>  Total Support and Solidarity for the Cuban People </H5>
  The Korean president expressed high esteem, total support, 
and firm solidarity with the Cuban people who are honorably 
fulfilling the strategic tasks of the "special peacetime period." 
  From the very start of the interview, the veteran leader, 
who 
for more than 60 years has worked for the national liberation of 
his nation, asked about President Fidel Castro and Revolutionary 
Armed Forces Minister Raul Castro, both of whom he characterized 
as brothers-in-arms and for whom he expressed high regards. 
  "Even today--he indicated--I recall our 1986 encounter with 
Fidel Castro, which took place in Pyongyang. It was the first 
historically significant meeting, which we had been both 
pursuing for some time. We were able to talk for several hours 
in a climate of camaraderie. The leaders of the two countries 
were able to review diverse issues of common interest, including 
the possibility of increasing and promoting relations of 
friendship and cooperation." 
  That visit left an unforgettable and profound impression on 
both nations, and from then on our relations attained new 
momentum. 
  The DPRK and Cuba are separated by oceans and continents, 
and 
yet their respective peoples retain friendly ties as if they 
were neighbors. This is the friendly pugnacity of brothers of 
similar mettle who are struggling against imperialism and for 
the victory of socialism. Our friendship is genuine and solid 
because it is based on revolutionary principles and moral 
camaraderie, Kim Il-song stated. 
  He stipulated: "Complex and unexpected events have appeared 
on the international scene, and yet the links of friendship and 
cooperation between both nations continue to develop without 
changes in accordance with what was agreed upon during the two 
leaders' meetings. These ties remain steadfast amid this 
traumatic historical phase, which is decisive for the future of 
socialism. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  In reference to the critical times the island is facing, Kim 
Il-song pointed out that the Cuban people are firmly defending 
their role as the vanguard of socialism in the Western 
Hemisphere amid difficult conditions under which the 
imperialists are relentlessly pursuing all sorts of schemes to 
isolate and destroy it. 
  In this respect, he indicated: "Our people have high regard 
and express their total support, as well as their firm 
solidarity, for our Cuban brothers who are honorably carrying 
out the strategic tasks of the special period during times of 
peace, and who are singularly united around the Communist Party 
led by Comrade Fidel Castro. [no closing quotation marks as 
received] 
  In the future, the Korean people will do everything within 
their power to bolster relations with their Cuban brothers. 
  Kim Il-song concluded the interview by sending friendly 
greetings to the Cuban people and expressing his hope for 
greater successes in the struggle to safeguard the independence, 
sovereignty, and development of socialism.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- A pro-Seoul Korean 
residents' organization in Japan said Thursday [21 April] it has 
changed its official Japanese name to delete any suggestion that 
members are only temporary residents of Japan. 
  The Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan) said 
Wednesday's 
regular assembly has decided to drop the word "kyoryu," or 
"temporary stay," from its title since the Japanese word 
suggests that they are only in Japan for a short time or 
temporarily. "We want to make clear our intention that we are 
permanent residents of Japan, so the characters for `kyoryu,' 
which were a part of our name until today, were deleted," 
newly-elected Mindan Chairman Shin Yong-sang, 69, said at a 
press meeting Wednesday following the assembly. 
  Mindan's Information Office said Thursday that it had not 
yet 
considered whether the official English name of the group would 
be changed. 
  Shin also said that while Korean residents of Japan pay 
taxes, they have no political rights, adding "our rights and 
responsibilities are not equal." He added that for the sake of 
Japan's internationalization, Mindan planned to campaign 
extensively in favor of Japan's foreign residents being given 
the right to vote. 
  Many of Mindan's 450,000 members were born and raised in 
Japan but are still considered foreign residents. 
  At the end of World War II, there were an estimated two 
million Koreans in Japan, most forcibly brought in during the 
1910 to 1945 colonial period to labor in factories and mines. 
  Although many were later repatriated, others stayed on and 
today some 700,000 Koreans, including descendants of those 
forcibly brought in, currently live in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Tokyo police and 
immigration authorities arrested five Chinese Tuesday [19 April] 
for allegedly assisting some 150 compatriots looking for work in 
Japan to sneak into the country in February and March. 
  Police also arrested six more Chinese for allegedly trying 
to 
sneak in Japan. All were arrested for suspected violations of 
the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law. 
  Tokyo immigrations authorities are holding a total of 14 
Chinese suspected of being involved in the large-scale illegal 
entry attempt earlier this year. 
  Meanwhile in Tokushima Prefecture on Shikoku, the smallest 
of 
Japan's four main islands, police arrested three Thai workers 
for overstaying their original 90-day visas issued in June 1991. 
According to investigators, the three continued to work at a 
woodworking firm in Tokushima even though their visas had 
expired. 
  In the Chinese case, the five suspected contacts for the 
Chinese attempting to enter Japan allegedly met about 60 Chinese 
coming ashore near a Wakayama fishing village and then took them 
by rented car to Nagoya where they boarded a Shinkansen bullet 
train to Tokyo. The five are suspected of sheltering the 
illegal entrants in an apartment in Tokyo's Toshima ward. 
  According to one of the Chinese sneaking into Japan, they 
were told that they could make money in Japan, but needed 2.7 
million yen to pay for the sea transportation. The would-be 
worker testified that a portion of the fee had already been paid. 
  Police said they are pursuing the strong likelihood that the 
smuggling of Chinese workers into Japan is an organized effort.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 19 KYODO -- New Zealand Deputy Prime 
Minister Don McKinnon reiterated his country's support for 
Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council [UNSC], Japanese Foreign Ministry officials 
said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  McKinnon, concurrently minister of foreign affairs and 
trade, 
who arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a three-day stay, voiced the 
support in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the 
officials said. 
  He told Hata that New Zealand thinks it important for Japan 
to become a permanent member of the Security Council because 
Japan's international role is increasing not only in the 
economic sphere but also in the political field, they said. 
  Hata was quoted as replying that Japan wants to actively 
contribute to the international community. 
  Also in the 75-minute meeting at the Foreign Ministry, 
McKinnon said New Zealand, which currently chairs the Security 
Council, wants to cooperate with the international community to 
prevent North Korea from becoming a country with nuclear 
weapons, according to the officials. 
  Hata told McKinnon it is important for the world to unite to 
urge North Korea not to change its position on the nuclear 
problem [as received], the officials said. 
  McKinnon also said New Zealand is placing importance on Asia 
and has hammered out an "Asia 2000" plan to promote its ties 
with the region. 
  Hata and McKinnon agreed that the upcoming Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations regional forum should seek boosting the 
openness of military power in the region to promote stability 
and security in Asia, the officials said. 
  Touching on the just-signed Uruguay Round trade pact, they 
agreed on the importance of settling disputes on a multilateral 
basis, not by taking unilateral steps, the officials said. 
  On the bilateral front, McKinnon expressed New Zealand's 
opposition to whaling, while Hata pointed out cultural 
differences, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- A restructured U.N. 
Security Council [UNSC] with Japan as a permanent member should 
reflect the world body's ability to resolve problems it will 
face in the next century, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Don 
McKinnon said Thursday [21 April]. 
  McKinnon, whose country currently chairs the Security 
Council, told a press conference in Tokyo that New Zealand 
supports Japan's bid to become a permanent Council member, but 
any decision on membership will have to wait at least two or 
three years. McKinnon, who is concurrently minister of foreign 
affairs and trade, said this is the time it will take for the 
U.N. to conduct a thorough debate on the issue, initiated by 
U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  "It is going to take a fair bit of tough debate," McKinnon 
said. "But more importantly, that is to ensure that if the 
changes do take place, they not only reflect 1994, 1995 and 
1996, but hopefully through to the 21st century." 
  McKinnon also said New Zealand believes the power of veto is 
"inappropriate" and any new permanent member should not be given 
veto powers. The five permanent Security council members are 
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, which all 
have veto power. 
  McKinnon said other countries being considered as candidates 
for permanent membership on the Council are Brazil, Canada, 
Germany, India, Nigeria and Turkey. 
  "From a purely Asian-Pacific viewpoint, I am very much aware 
that of the permanent five members, four have Caucasian faces 
and only one has an Asian face," McKinnon said. "And that 
balance could easily be upset to the point where the Security 
Council possibly begins to lose credibility." 
  "And the credibility of the Council is really the basis of 
this whole exercise." 
  McKinnon said Japan's contribution to peacekeeping

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Farmers gave free apples 
to pedestrians in Tokyo's Ginza District Wednesday [20 April] to 
protest imports of apples from New Zealand. 
  The first batch, a sample consignment of some 50 kilograms, 
was due to arrive at Narita Airport on Wednesday. Some 100 tons 
of New Zealand apples will arrive by ship in mid-May. 
  Apple imports were liberalized in 1971, but with only minor 
exceptions were essentially banned, with agriculture officials 
citing risks associated from insects possibly arriving with the 
imported apples. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry, however, cleared New Zealand apples for import last 
June. 
  Japanese apple growers are now attempting to devise ways of 
producing apples at equally competitive prices. The apples 
given to Ginza pedestrians came from Aomori Prefecture in 
northern Honshu, where much of Japan's apple crop is grown. 
  Ginza pedestrians receiving the free apples were told they 
risk ingesting residual agricultural chemicals if they eat 
imported varieties. 
  Wednesday's imports, a variety known as "Royal Gala," are a 
sample batch brought in by the New Zealand Embassy for testing. 
  Consumers will not find New Zealand apples on supermarket 
shelves until late May. Apples from the United States are also 
expected in Japan in autumn. 
  Transport and insurance costs for the Royal Gala apples will 
effectively put them in the same price range as locally grown 
ones, but future bulk imports are expected to result in price 
drops.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Minoru Nagaoka, head of 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange [TSE], said Tuesday [19 April] the 
exchange is studying measures to prevent foreign firms from 
pulling out of the market. Nagaoka said the study will focus on 
ways to reduce listing costs, and the exchange will accept some 
documents prepared in English by foreign firms to provide 
investment information to customers. 
  Measures are needed to internationalize the market's 
operations as the English language sphere, including Asia, is 
expanding, he said. He added, however, that details of the 
study have yet to be worked out. 
  Nagaoka took a cautious attitude toward the listing of Asian 
companies on the Tokyo market. 
  Economic development in Asian countries has made extensive 
progress but measures to protect investors have to be studied, 
he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa approved Tuesday [19 April] a draft 
amendment to legislation that would partially lift curbs on 
foreign lawyers wishing to practice law in Japan, government 
officials said. The draft will be submitted to the Diet later 
in the day and go into force within a year from its 
parliamentary endorsement. 
  It would conditionally authorize the management of a joint 
law firm between Japanese and foreign lawyers, while keeping a 
ban on the personnel hiring of Japanese lawyers by foreign 
lawyers. 
  The draft would also allow such joint law firms to employ 
Japanese or foreign lawyers to provide consultation services on 
Japanese and foreign laws. 
  However, the proposed legislation would continue to bar 
foreign lawyers from arguing both criminal and civil cases in 
Japanese courts. 
  The amendment will also soften the current law's principle 
of 
mutual benefits, thereby authorizing lawyers from countries that 
ban Japanese lawyers' activities to practice law in Japan, 
although such practices would have to be approved by the justice 
minister on a case-by-case basis. 
  The amendment calls for qualifying foreign lawyers, who have 
practiced law for more than five years in the country where they 
obtained their license, to practice law in Japan. 
  It will also soften the five-year requirement by allowing 
such lawyers to count up to two years of practicing law in Japan 
as a legal trainee as part of the five-year requirement. It 
would allow foreign law firms that launch joint law firms in 
Japan to use the same corporate names in Japan that they use in 
their countries of origin. 
  The amendment was sketched out in response to demands by the 
United States and the European Union, which have been urging 
Japan to decontrol its regulations on foreign lawyers' 
activities. The proposed legislation constitutes a key part of 
a government package of market-opening and deregulation measures 
that was announced in February.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Policy coordination by 
seven major industrialized nations is falling apart amid a 
spreading gap in credit policy, and Japan is expected to 
continue facing strong pressure for fresh economic measures, a 
top Japanese economist says. 
  The following are excerpts of an interview with Masaru 
Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, on a meeting 
of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven 
(G-7) nations slated for Sunday in Washington. 
  Q: Is substantial agreement possible when the G-7 nations 
are starting to place emphasis on domestic policy? 
  A: It was rather easy to take cooperative steps when 
interest rates were on the decline in all nations. But now that 
the United States has already turned to tightening its credit 
policy to prevent inflation, disarray is starting to surface in 
monetary policy. 
  Such cracks will spread further, and I think it will be hard 
to reach a meaningful agreement. 
  Q: Do you expect stronger pressure on Japan? 
  A: The U.S. and European nations brushed aside the 
government's market-opening package launched in late March, and 
Japan is far behind schedule to adopt concrete measures to 
expand domestic demand. Moreover, resumption of the stalled 
Japan-U.S. trade talks is not yet in sight, and what else can 
you expect when even Finance Minister (Hirohisa) Fujii may not 
be able to attend? 
  It's like asking, "please criticize." 
  Q: What should the incoming new cabinet do to dodge such 
criticism? 
  A: Japan must rush to detail measures to boost domestic 
demand and open markets. If I were the prime minister, I would 
take the responsibility to implement such measures as 
continuation and expansion of income tax cuts and building up 
social infrastructure investment while holding separate 
discussions on funding. 
  No country will be satisfied with Japan just repeating, "We 
can't accept any numerical targets and we are not thinking of 
any alternatives." 
  Q: What are your expectations of rising U.S. long-term 
rates? 
  A: If the U.S. economy continues to recover, we definitely 
cannot expect U.S. rates to decline. Higher rates will 
probably send stock and bond prices lower, and may also drag 
down the economies of Japan and Europe. 
  Along with Japan's facing pressure to cut its huge trade 
surplus, the U.S. is also likely to come under pressure from 
the other G-7 countries to curb interest rates. 
  Q: What about labor issues? 
  A: Structural problems, primarily faced by European nations, 
should rather be discussed from a long-term perspective. As for 
the G-7 talks, the main point is on limiting increases in 
unemployment rates by ensuring economic recovery through 
financial policy coordination. 
  Q: Do you expect much discussion on exchange rates? 
  A: Against Japan's expectations, I believe currency rates 
will hardly be discussed at all. The U.S. dollar is not 
necessarily falling against European currencies, and the yen 
seems to be staging a lonely appreciation. 
  The usual mention may be included in the joint statement, 
but 
substantial talks on exchange rates are unlikely to take place.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- The Foreign Ministry said 
Wednesday [20 April] it has notified the European Union (EU) 
that a ministerial meeting planned for Friday and Saturday in 
Tokyo will be put off till next month due to the delayed 
formation of Japan's new government. 
  At the annual EU meeting, Japan's foreign minister and 
finance minister were scheduled to talk with EU Trade 
Commissioner Leon Brittan on issues such as the country's 
massive trade surplus with the EU and on its deregulation 
measures. 
  Japan's prime minister and cabinet ministers have yet to be 
officially selected, however. The delay in the formation of a 
new government has led to postponements of visits to Tokyo by 
such dignitaries as the Egyptian president and Thai prime 
minister.

  [Text] Washington, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's battered 
economy is showing signs of revival this year, and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wednesday [20 April] gave the 
credit to an ambitious stimulus package the Japanese Government 
introduced in February. There would be "essentially no growth 
in the absence of the package," the IMF said in a study on the 
macroeconomic effects of the 15.3 trillion yen economic program. 
  The package, which consists of a mix of government spending 
plus a one-time tax reduction, "will raise the level of output 
by about three-fourths of 1 percent in both 1994 and 1995," the 
IMF said in its semiannual review of the world economy. 
  The IMF study also said the stimulative effect of the 
economic package is expected to cut Japan's current-account 
surplus by 1.5 percent this year and by a lesser margin in 1995. 
  Without the package, the IMF projects the surplus in Japan's 
current account, which provides the broadest measure of foreign 
trade, will rise from 131.4 billion dollars last year to 135.5 
billion dollars this year. With the package in place, this 
year's surplus is expected to shrink by 2.1 billion dollars to 
133.4 billion dollars. 
  For 1995, the package is expected to produce a 1.5 billion 
dollar difference in Japan's projected current-account surplus, 
from 127.2 billion dollars to 125.7 billion dollars.

  [Text] The Creston Energy Company of Colorado, USA, issued 
a press release on 18 April 1994, announcing that it is 
conducting a seismological survey and preparing for exploratory 
drilling to evaluate the latent oil and gas potential of the 
so-called WANANBEI-21 Contract area which is, in fact, the Tu 
Chinh coral reef located entirely within Vietnam's exclusive 
economic zone and continental shelf. 
  The press release also stated that the exploration cited 
above and the potential commercial exploitation plan for that 
area will be a continuation of the history of China's research 
and exploration in that sea area, which began since time 
immemorial, as far back as 200 years B.C. 
  In view of this matter, a spokesman for the SRV Foreign 
Ministry gave the following remarks on 20 April: 
  Right from the time when the Creston Company signed a 
contract on oil exploration and exploitation with the Chinese 
Offshore Oil Company in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry 
issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and 
that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's 
sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well 
as against international law. The statement also pointed out 
that according to international law, Vietnam has long exercised 
its sovereignty over that area. As early as before 1975, this 
area was divided into lots for bidding to conduct oil and gas 
exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional 
Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a 
statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of 
the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12 
May 1977 and 12 November 1984, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty 
over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the 
Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided 
for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has 
since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas 
resources in that area, including its cooperation with many 
foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an 
economic, scientific, and service detachment has been 
established there since 1989 with the presence of a system of 
Vietnamese lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station. 
  A seismological survey by the Creston Company and its 
arrogant declaration of its planned oil exploration and 
exploitation in the area within Vietnam's exclusive economic 
zone and continental shelf -- an area which is, both legally and 
practically, totally under Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes 
a new, very grave step of escalation. 
  The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry once again asserted 
that the contract of the Creston Company is invalid. Its 
actions are illegal. No countries or companies will be allowed 
to conduct any exploration or exploitation of natural resources 
within Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone 
without permission from the Vietnamese Government. The Creston 
Company will have to bear full responsibility for the 
consequences arising from its actions.

  [Text] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec held a press 
conference in Hanoi before leaving for Hue and Ho Chi Minh City. 
Here is our report. 
  It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Czech foreign 
minister, and the foreign minister of an Eastern European 
country since the disintegration of the Eastern European 
countries. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec spoke to newsmen 
about the significance and objectives of his visit to Vietnam. 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording in English] Now I finish the 
third 
day of my visit in Vietnam. We feel that this is an important 
visit for the Czech Republic. I have met my colleague Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Minister of Trade Le Van Triet. I 
have met Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President and Speaker of 
Parliament Nong Duc Manh. These were useful and important talks 
for us. You know that the Czech Republic has traditional 
contact with Vietnam. There are many people here in Vietnam who 
know us, who speak our language, who study in my country. And 
there are also quite a considerable number of people in my 
country who know very well of Vietnam. This is a good basis for 
mutual relations. There were big changes in both countries in 
the last years. It is important to find new conditions, new 
ways for cooperation. It is important to find new contact for 
economic and trade cooperation. This is the reason for which we 
discussed especially economic programs. We discussed the whole 
set of treaty which is needed for proper cooperation between our 
business communities. We discussed also political issues. We 
exchanged views on developments in both countries. We discussed 
also our views on the issues connected with discussion about 
human rights and other issues. I think this visit shows that 
relations between my country and Vietnam has very big potential, 
and it is possible to continue traditional intensive contact and 
good cooperation, also after changes in my country and in 
Vietnam. [end recording] 
  On the first day in Hanoi, the Czech businessmen attended 
the 
Vietnam-Czech economic seminar held in Hanoi by the Vietnam 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Czech Embassy. Foreign 
Minister Zieleniec attended the seminar. Both Czech and 
Vietnamese businessmen discovered great possibilities for 
economic and trade cooperation. Mr.Rudolf Baranic, president of 
the Association of Czech Businessmen said: 
  [Begin (Baranic) recording in Czech fading into English 
translation] The balance of trade between Czech and Vietnam has 
reduced over the last few years due to main changes in the Czech 
Republic. Czech's export to Vietnam has been reduced by half, 
and Vietnam's export to Czech reduced by one fourth. However, 
there are possibilities to further improve the trade balance 
between the two countries. Most interesting is that almost all 
those who are involved in export activities to the Czech 
Republic were Vietnamese who had studied and worked in the 
country. There are many Vietnamese who know the Czech language. 
It is an advantage in cooperative relations between the two 
countries. [end recording] 
  At the press conference in Hanoi, the Czech foreign minister 
also said that he was not the first high-ranking Czech official 
to visit Vietnam. A delegation of the Czech minister and trade 
and industry, and a parliamentary delegation have visited 
Vietnam. The Czech minister of labor also plans to Vietnam and 
is expected to sign an important agreement on labor cooperation 
between the two countries. The Czech Republic will continue 
helping Vietnam in education and personnel training. As with 
previous delegations, the Czech delegation discussed the 
completion of a trade agreement between the two countries, and 
agreement on investment guarantee and promotion, and the 
agreement on avoidance of double taxation.

  [Text] Accepting an invitation from SRV Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife, Czech Republic Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec and his wife paid an official visit to Vietnam 
from 16 to 19 April. Accompanying Foreign Minister Zieleniec 
were several high-ranking officials of the Czech Foreign 
Ministry and the Industrial and Commercial Ministry, as well as 
many businessmen. 
  During their stay, Minister Zieleniec and his entourage were 
cordially received by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and National 
Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam and his wife also warmly received and entertained Minister 
Zieleniec, his wife, and the visiting guests. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam welcomed and highly 
evaluated the first official visit to Vietnam by the Czech 
foreign minister. He considered it a new and important 
development step in preserving and consolidating the 
time-honored friendly and cooperative relations between the two 
countries. He stated that in the new situation, the two sides 
should work out an appropriate and efficient cooperative form to 
fully exploit the potential and advantages of each country in 
order to quickly strengthen and accelerate the multilateral 
relations between Vietnam and the Czech Republic. Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam expressed his sincere and profound 
appreciation to the Governments and peoples of the former 
Czechoslovakia and the current Czech Republic for their precious 
support and assistance to the Vietnamese people in our 
undertaking of national protection and construction and for 
efficient help in training a large contingent of technical 
cadres and skilled workers. 
  Minister Zieleniec expressed joy at his chance to visit 
Vietnam, a country of courageous and hospitable people who are 
close to the Czech Republic residents and have fine traditional 
relations. He welcomed prominent achievements scored by the 
Vietnamese people in their renovation cause and in their foreign 
affairs. These achievements have heightened the role and 
position of Vietnam in the region and in the world and they are 
creating favorable preconditions for the two countries to 
further develop relations in all fields, beginning with economic 
and commercial relations. 
  Minister Zieleniec held official talks with Minister Nguyen 
Manh Cam and they were pleased to realize that SRV-Czech 
relations have made encouraging development steps. They

<F P=106> [Station Commentary] </F>
  [Text] According to the news agency of AFP, Cambodian MPs 
affiliated to the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] have proposed 
the elimination of Khmer Rouge [KR] from the peace process and 
the closing down of their representative office in Phnom Penh. 
The Cambodian People's Party occupies 51 seats of the total of 
120 seats in the Cambodian Parliament. Here is our radio 
editor's opinion. 
  The Cambodian People's Party members of parliament's 
proposal 
to move the Khmer Rouge representatives out of Phnom Penh was 
put forth after the Khmer Rouge refused to take part in the 
ceasefire during the traditional new year festival, as proposed 
by Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen last week. 
  The MPs are now preparing the draft law on the issue to be 
submitted to the coming parliament meeting in order to 
officially remove the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and to 
outlaw the rebellious section. Vice Premier and Minister of 
Home Affairs in the Cambodian Royal Government Mr. Sar Kheng, 
told AFP that King Sihanouk approved the proposal to isolate the 
Khmer Rouge. The king was reportedly disappointed when the 
Khmer Rouge refused to cease fire. Mr. Sar Kheng is a member of 
the Executive Committee of the Cambodian People's Party. 
  Reality shows that the Khmer Rouge always run counter to the 
Cambodian peace process. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement 
on Cambodia, the faction not only refused to implement the 
commitment, but always tried to undermine the process. They 
refused to participate in the elections, and take part in any 
solutions put forth by the Cambodian Royal Government. While 
Cambodian people concentrate on national reconstruction, the 
Khmer Rouge conduct repeated sabotage activities. 
  The world still remembers the Khmer Rouge as extremely 
barbarous criminals against their own people when they were in 
power in the seventies. Since the restoration of peace in 
Cambodia, the faction has committed many massacres against their 
own nation and Vietnamese residents in the country. The Khmer 
Rouge's refusal to cease fire during the Cambodian new year 
festival once again proves their war-like nature. That is why 
the proposal to oust the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and 
from Phnom Penh will meet the aspirations of the Cambodian 
people.

  [Text] In Hanoi on the morning of 13 April, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session with the core 
leaders of Quang Tri Province to discuss a number of 
socioeconomic issues of the province. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed special concern on the 
socioeconomic programs that Quang Tri going to carry out in the 
period to come. He recommended that for the hilly areas of the 
province, the local authority should work out a comprehensive 
plan to cover with greenery and other industrial plants for over 
20,000 hectares of bare hills and empty lands, in conjunction 
with plans to reallocate the population and resolve its 
infrastructure issues. 
  The prime minister urged the leaders to consider thoroughly 
and select wisely the plants to grow on suitable land, to create 
rich forest with high-industrial-value plants and trees, thus 
efficiently utilizing the assistance of the government in forms 
of capital, plant species, and purchase of products. 
  Apart from the local labor force, provincial leaders should 
motivate the contributions from the immigrants who came to 
resettle in the province, so that the uplands areas would grow 
quickly out of poverty and hunger, and the plains areas would 
also see their residents' living standards improve. 
  The settled life and settled farming program for mountain 
areas should be completed quickly according to a detailed plan 
with concrete objectives and fixed time schedule, so that the 
bad practice of slash-and-burn farming could be eliminated in 
parallel with an improvement in living standards of minority 
ethnic people. 
  For the people living along the coast, in addition to 
development of the catch, rearing, and processing of aquatic 
products, the local authority should set up concrete economic 
development plans for every village located in the area of 
30,000 hectares of sandy land along the coast, to ensure an 
ever-improving life for both the people fishing offshore and 
those who work inland. 
  In plain areas, the leaders should strive to bring 
production 
opportunity to each family living in safe and stable areas. To 
the areas where production activities are not stable, alternate 
species planting should be considered as a measure to avoid 
harsh weather conditions. 
  In terms of industry, the prime minister maintained that the 
leaders should firmly grasp contents of the industrialization 
process for Quang Tri Province so that the process would be 
carried out steadily and suitably, thus creating conditions for 
the transformation from the present agro-forestry to the 
agro-industry economic structure in a near future. The province 
should strive to develop early its industry, especially 
processing industry and construction material production at 
small and medium scales, utilizing modern technology obtained 
with assistance of foreign partners. 
  The prime minister also reminded leaders of Quang Tri to 
strive for better implementation of reallocation plans for 
people in Dong Ha and Khe Sanh Route No. 9 so that the locations 
would be able to become commercial and tourist attractions of 
the province. The task of developing cultural, social, medical, 
and education activities should also receive appropriate concern 
and care from leaders. Families of war dead and social pension 
recipients should be cared for since the people of Quang Tri are 
those who suffer the most heavy consequences in all aspects of 
the war.

<F P=106>   [Article by Lieutenant General Trinh Tran, commander, Border </F>
Defense Forces: "On the Border Defense Troops' Traditions Day 
-- Let's Develop the All-People Strength, Maintain Sovereignty 
and Security on the Fatherland's Borders"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] With the background of profound 
international changes, on the one hand, there are opportunities 
for us to win peace, to expand our international relations, and 
to develop our country; on the other hand, we must do our best 
to remain vigilant because the adversary forces are frantically 
pushing their "peaceful event" plots and tricks combined with 
armed rioting so as to overthrow the socialist system in our 
country. The issues involving land borders, national 
sovereignty, and the struggle against violations and seizure of 
our border and sea-island sovereignty, resources, and national 
interests are becoming urgent and complicated ones. The 
activities of various kinds of political, criminal, and economic 
violators who take advantage of the "open door" situation are 
increasing and becoming more and more daring and well-organized, 
with the use of arms and the connections between the country and 
the outside creating many hot issues regarding the security and 
order on our borders and the sea. This is the reason why the 
work of organizing our border defense is playing an extremely 
important role and there must be a thorough understanding of the 
task and view mentioned in Resolution 3 of the CPV Central 
Committee, namely, to strengthen the management and maintaining 
of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to maintain 
security and order on the borders, coast, and islands of our 
fatherland. 
  The need for managing and maintaining sovereignty and 
security on our national borders in the new situation must be 
total, with maintaining our sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
resources, environment, and national interests being closely 
combined with maintaining political security and social order 
and security, and defeating the criminals' peaceful-event plots, 
violations of territorial sovereignty, and sabotaging of 
security and order; at the same time, we must thoroughly 
understand the foreign policy of our state in the renovation 
period, build the peace-and-friendship borders with our 
neighbors, and open the doors and expand international relations 
in the fields of foreign investment and economic cooperation. In 
order to fulfill the above-mentioned task and need and to act on 
our own initiative under any circumstances, on the basis of our 
recent experience we must build a strong all-people border 
defense, maintain national solidarity, and closely combine 
socioeconomic development with strengthening and consolidating 
our national defense and security. Now and in the coming years, 
we must continue to properly implement the government's Decision 
16/HDBT aimed at raising the quality and effectiveness of the 
Border Defense Day; make people know very well the new situation 
and task; heighten their revolutionary vigilance; strengthen and 
consolidate the political bases and the movement to maintain the 
fatherland's security; build the people's security front along 
with the all-people national defense front; and develop 
solidarity with and attachment to the people, joint combat and 
mutual assistance relations between the border defense forces 
and the people and forces stationed on the borders, and hence 
mobilization of the country's total strength to serve the task 
of building and defending our borders, particularly in the 
situation of unexpected events suddenly taking place. 
  We need to build a more profound and stronger all-people 
border defense on the basis of developing the all-people 
strength, the strength of the country and the political system 
as a whole, from inland areas to the borders, both in the rear 
and at the front, so as to resolve on a first-priority basis the 
urgent socioeconomic issues and to build strong border and 
coastal areas and islands, particularly the highlands and remote 
areas, which will serve as the base for building the front line 
based on the people's wishes, the front line based on the 
people's security, and for firmly defending our national borders. 
  We need to strengthen leadership provided by the ministries 
and central sectors and by local echelons and sectors, and to 
mobilize the people all over the country and particularly the 
ethnic groups in border and sea-island areas for properly 
implementing Directive 525/CT-TTg on a number of programs and 
measures aimed at developing socioeconomic conditions in the 
highlands and among ethnic groups, and Directive 399 CT/TTg on 
the task of developing the sea-based economy. The border 
defense troops, along with central and local committees and 
sectors, are to continue to effectively carry out programs 
calling for joint action with the Ministries of Education and 
Training, Culture and Information, and Public Health; the 
Vietnam Women's Union; and the Youth Union Central Committee and 
to obtain better and better results from them. At the same 
time, they must join with the localities in basic investigations 
of the socioeconomic conditions in border villages so as to 
introduce there programs of action having important and key 
provisions. 
  As for the border defense troops, after 35 years of 
building, doing regular work, fighting, and growing up, they 
need to develop their proud traditions; to heighten their 
political capabilities and fighting power in all fields; to do 
their best to overcome any remaining shortcomings and 
weaknesses; to continue consolidating solidarity, democracy, and 
internal discipline; and to eliminate such negative aspects as 
authoritarianism and harassment of the people so as to 
strengthen the blood-and-flesh attachment to the people, to 
correctly implement the national and religious policies, and to 
turn themselves into strong, well-trained, regular troops 
capable of properly fulfilling their task while continuing to 
combine border defense work with socioeconomic development as a 
means to improve the standard of living and with strengthening 
of the masses' work as an important political task of the forces. 
  The task of maintaining sovereignty and security in border 
areas requires that we set renovation at the same level as that 
of the new need and task. By fully learning from the "consider 
the people as the roots" lesson, knowing how to develop the 
strength of the masses while creating favorable conditions for 
stabilizing their living conditions, effectively promoting 
socioeconomic development, and achieving national wealth and 
strength, as well as a fair and civilized society, we will 
certainly succeed in building a front line based on the people's 
wishes that becomes stronger and stronger everyday, maintaining 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, contributing to 
maintaining the country's political stability, and bringing 
victory to the renovation undertaken by our party and people as 
a whole.

<F P=106> [Article by Vo Hong Anh: "Border Defense Troops Show </F>
Strong Fighting Spirit, Close Army-People Solidarity"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our country is getting better 
everyday as it travels on the total renovation road under the 
leadership of the party. What is important in the new period 
is to maintain political stability in order to gradually achieve 
economic, cultural, and social development, as well as 
strengthening of national defense and security. Taking 
advantage of the renovation policy, open borders, and 
international circulation, the adversary forces from without 
have been strengthening their infiltration across the borders, 
maintaining contact with the reactionaries within the country to 
develop their strength, and building covert installations along 
the borders and the coast. Through touristic activities, visits 
with relatives, and border crossings, they have been bringing in 
people, means, and reactionary materials to support the forces 
within the country. They have been taking advantage particularly 
of our ethnic people's current economic difficulties in order to 
incite them, to distort our party's policies and line, and thus 
to destroy their confidence in the party, and at the same time 
using economic means to gain the support of the masses, to 
attract them to their side, and to gradually create an 
opposition force fighting against the revolution. In the last 
several years, they had been taking advantage of the 
nationalistic and freedom-of-religion policies adopted by our 
party to engage in illegal propaganda, with the hope that they 
could raise complicated political issues, gain influence toward 
the masses, and cause instability from within, particularly in 
border areas, where the standard of living and intellectual 
capacity of the people remained low. Although the development of 
a market economy and business deals with foreign countries was 
active, there appeared a lot of complications such as 
across-the-border smuggling, criminal acts, and social ills, 
which sometimes destabilized law and order in border areas and 
made the border defense troops' responsibility for protecting 
and managing the borders much heavier. 
  In the last 5 years, the forces in charge of the southern 
sea 
zone caught 596 foreign boats which had violated our fishing 
grounds. With active support from the people, the border defense 
troops handled 186 cases of illegal border entries and 8,567 
major cases of smuggling involving 533 cars and motorcycles, 
2,284 kilograms of opium, and so on. 
  To help the people, particularly the ethnic people, has 
always been considered by the border defense troops their 
central work. Their activities, such as "medical doctors of 
blue military rank" and "teachers of blue military rank," 
reflecting their spirit of sacrifice in saving the people in 
natural disasters like storms and floods, and in sharing food 
and clothing with the people, have further strengthened the 
close relationships between the army and the people. 
  On 22 February 1989, the Council of Ministers issued 
Decision 
16/HDBT to set the 3rd day of March every year as the Border 
Defense Day. Since the promulgation of this decision, party 
committee echelons, local administrations, mass organizations, 
and social organizations have been showing their wholehearted 
interest in turning the activities on "Border Defense Day" into 
a widespread movement being carried out in many rich and lively 
forms. In border provinces and cities throughout the country, 
many movements, such as "assault youth being the masters of 
borders," women "for our borders," "peaceful hamlets," "model 
elders and village chiefs," and so on, have succeeded in 
mobilization.

    [Editorial Report] The 5 Mar 94 REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on pages 
1 and 11 reported on First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh's "recent" trip to Mondolkiri Province. The 
prince is quoted as saying "it is not right for Cambodian 
provincial governors to have to ask Vietnamese permission to 
transit [SRV] territory...we should be able to travel...on our 
own territory." He pledged that the government would build a 
road "as soon as possible"from Memot [Kompong Cham Province] and 
Snuol [Kratie Province] into Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri 
Provinces. He said assistance for this would be sought from the 
United States and "other friendly countries." 
  The article noted that what roads there are in northeastern 
Cambodia have sustained war damage and are still mined. 
Ranariddh said that construction of "strategic roads along 
borders" would facilitate border defense and security. He 
concluded by saying that "if we cannot build these roads, we 
cannot resettle people" in the border areas.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 21 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King 
Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday that the nominal leader of the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] had warned him to leave the country for his own 
safety ahead of a nationwide terrorist campaign. 
  "His Excellency Khieu Samphan requested that if I want to 
avoid accidents or danger I sould get out of the country as soon 
as possible," the king told reporters at the capital's Royal 
Palace. 
  The king said he received a "secret letter" from Khieu 
Samphan late Wednesday in which the guerrilla leader warned that 
the "Khmer Rouge would provoke turmoil in the whole country, 
including Phnom Penh." 
  The king said he was advised not to wait for a private plane 
but to take a commercial flight to Bangkok. Khieu Samphan 
requested that the king not divulge the contents of the letter, 
he said. 
  "But I cannot be quiet," he said. 
  "I have to tell Khieu Samphan through (state-run) television 
and radio that I will not run. Ever since I was young I never 
ran from danger." 
  The king said he was scheduled to leave for Beijing in June 
to undergo further treatment for cancer. 
  "But even if I am sick in June and there is turmoil in the 
kingdom created by the Khmer Rouge, I will not go," he said. 
  The king pledged to remain with his people in times of 
trouble. 
  "I will never leave my people," he said. 
  A government official, however, dismissed the guerrilla 
warning as "political bluff." 
  The king went on to say that the government's proposed move 
to formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge did not concern him. 
  "It's a matter for the Royal Government to decide," he said, 
adding: "The king reigns but does not govern." 
  Co-Premier Hun Sen told AFP Wednesday that the government 
had 
already drafted a law to outlaw the radical faction and would 
present it to parliament Monday. 
  The king also said it was also up to the government to 
decide 
whether to evict the Khmer Rouge representatives from their 
compound in the capital. 
  Another government official, however, said the king 
supported 
the move to outlaw the guerrillas. 
  "The king does not want to do anything to jeopardise the 
peace process. But the Khmer Rouge have got on his nerves," the 
official said.

  [Text] According to an unofficial source, the Royal 
Government of Cambodia may be reshuffled very soon. These 
changes would affect the ministries of economy and finance, 
foreign affairs and international cooperation, and interior and 
national security. 
  Another source has revealed that these changes will not 
affect the role of any current cabinet ministers. In other 
words, this reshuffle only involves moving officials from one 
ministry to another. In this process, an official, who is 
currently a minister, could be taken away from a ministry and 
made a deputy prime minister. A few weeks ago there were rumors 
that Sam Rangsi, currently minister of economy and finance, 
would be promoted while Chak Sarik, currently governor of Kandal 
Province, would replace Sam Rangsi. 
  An official who requested anonymity has disclosed that the 
Ministry of Interior and National Security may be split into 
two, namely the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry 
of Interior. However, this plan is still under consideration. 
It has not been decided yet which officials from what party 
would be in charge of what ministry. Yu Hokkri [currently 
co-minister of interior and national security] could be 
transferred to another ministry and another official, also from 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], would be in charge of the 
Interior Ministry or the National Security Ministry and could 
also have the rank of deputy prime minister. 
  These sources add that the planned reshuffle is not the 
result of conflict in the cabinet but is just a rearrangement of 
leading leaders to suit their respective expertise and 
competence.

    [Editorial Report] The "Political Viewpoint" column on 
pages 1,2 of the 27 Feb 94 PRACHEACHON carries a 700-word 
article entitled "What To Do To Get Real Democracy." The 
author, Im Sonchearea, somments that democracy is not simply the 
right of freedom of expression, a free press, or freedom to 
stage demonstrations. Nor is it something that can be imported 
from abroad and applied 100 percent in Cambodia. The writer 
views democracy as tied to the availability of employment and 
says that each country must create democracy by itself. 
  The author sees as "very correct" First Prime Minister 
Ranariddh's "recent" comments in which he said that "Democracy 
is not just the freedom of expression, but also rests on 
[people] being educated, happy, and proper attention being paid 
to avoiding cleavages between rich and poor." The author 
comments that if the gap between haves and have-nots is large, 
true democracy will not exist for long. True democracies abroad 
do not merely have freedom of expression, but also a gap between 
rich and poor "that does not keep growing." The writer says that 
in Cambodia "if this gap continues, it will be impossible to 
stamp out corruption, people's happiness will certainly be 
threatened... and democracy will be simply a matter of lip 
service."

  [Text] According to sources at the National Assembly 
office, the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia will 
resume its first legislature's second session on 25 April 
following the cheerless conclusion of the session on 5 April. 
  The 5 April session was closed at noon on the same day 
following the conflict of views among some Assembly members 
concerning the use of some words in the agenda. These members 
argued that it was inappropriate to use those words. Finally, 
the session withdrew some of the items from its agenda, and the 
meeting was closed. Some public opinions have criticized the 5 
April session as futile. 
  At the upcoming 25 April session, it is expected that there 
will be five items on the agenda. The first item is the 
election of new people's representatives; the second, the 
discussion and adoption of bills and proposed laws concerning 
the Supreme Council of Judges; the third, the discussion and 
adoption of the 1994-95 socio-economic plan; the fourth, the 
setting up of a special commission to provide advice and to 
improve the National Assembly's internal regulations; and the 
fifth, the discussion and adoption of a draft on the structure 
of the National Assembly's secretariat. However, the same 
sources have affirmed that the agenda could be altered by the 
time the session is convened because some other important issues 
are being considered for inclusion in the agenda by the National 
Assembly. A high-ranking official in the National Assembly has 
disclosed that the Khmer Rouge issue may be also be put on the 
agenda of this session so that the entire National Assembly can 
discuss and decide whether to outlaw the Khmer Rouge or not. 
  It is expected that apart from the election of new people's 
representatives, the Khmer Rouge issue could be an important 
item for this session. However, sources at the National 
Assembly office have not been absolutely clear about the 
inclusion of the Khmer Rouge issue into the agenda. 
  This session will elect 19 new people's representatives, 
including 13 from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and 
six from the Cambodian People's Party. These new people's 
representatives will replace the 19 who are carrying out public 
functions that are incompatible with the role of people's 
representatives. This issue was deadlocked at the 5 April 
session over a question of wording. 
  It was remembered at that session that the National 
Assembly's Standing Committee used the words "invalidity of 
people's representative status." These words were criticized by 
some Assembly members as inappropriate for outgoing Assembly 
members. 
  At this coming session, the wording is "election of new 
people's representatives." A National Assembly official 
expresses his optimism that the election of new people's 
representatives at this session could be done and not deadlocked 
as in the previous meeting; the only thing that is not yet known 
for certain is how the Assembly will do this and through which 
method, whether to do this individually or collectively.

general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], sent a 
message to North Korea expressing the IAEA position on North 
Korea's proposal for the IAEA to witness the exchange of nuclear 
fuel bars at its nuclear facilities. 
  It has been learned that Director General Blix said that the 
witnessing of IAEA inspectors of the exchange of nuclear fuel 
bars should be technically and perfectly carried out without any 
obstruction. He also said the inspection of the radiochemical 
laboratory, which was not carried out during the past 
inspections, should be fully resumed as well.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has officially informed North Korea that 
its inspectors will be present when nuclear fuel rods are 
changed at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, as proposed by 
Pyongyang. 
  One senior South Korean Government official said, "the IAEA 
has made a decision to accept the North Korean proposal and 
conveyed its intention to send its inspectors to North Korea so 
that they can be present for the changing of nuclear fuel rods 
at the 5-megawatt reactor." 
  As a result, IAEA inspectors could arrive in North Korea 
sometime next week as the nuclear fuel rods will likely be 
replaced in early or mid-May. 
  The UN Security Council, in a statement by its president, 
urged North Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections before 
the middle of next month. 
  "The IAEA has told North Korea to ensure safety measures 
needed by IAEA experts during the nuclear fuel rod changing," 
the official said, indicating that the agency and Pyongyang are 
still negotiating follow-up measures to the rod replacement and 
problems related to further checks. 
  In particular, the IAEA is said to be stressing the need for 
additional inspections of the 5-megawatt reactor and a 
radiochemical laboratory, which Pyongyang refused to allow last 
time, he said.

  [Text] David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic

meeting with high-level officials of the North Korean mission in 
Vienna to concretely discuss the timing and method of additional 
inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  Spokesman Kyd said that "it is highly possible that North 
Korea will accept additional inspections of its nuclear 
facilities before the end of April, at the earliest, as wished 
by the IAEA," and added that "in preparation for the smooth 
progress of discussions with North Korea, the IAEA is ready to 
send its inspection team to Pyongyang within next week." 
  On 20 April, North Korea sent a message to the IAEA 
proposing 
that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at 
its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. 
  An IAEA source also said that "in the message North Korea 
asked the IAEA to witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at 
its nuclear reactor," and that "this is the first concrete 
reaction from North Korea to the international community's 
request for additional nuclear inspection."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and reports carried by Seoul vernacular dailies on 22 
April on the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry regarding North Korea's possible possession of enough 
plutonium to produce four or five nuclear weapons. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 200-word 
report entitled "North Korea Will Possess Enough Plutonium To 
Produce Four or Five Nuclear Weapons." The report begins: "U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry said on 21 April that there 
is political tension, but no military tension, on the Korean 
peninsula. The United States does not want a war to be waged on 
the Korean peninsula, nor provoke a war, nor invite it." 
  Referring to the remarks by U.S. Government officials in the 
past that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to produce 
one or two nuclear weapons, the report writes: "U.S. Secretary 
of Defense Perry said that North Korea will have enough extra 
plutonium within weeks to produce four or five nuclear weapons." 
  CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled 
"The Remarks by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry." 
Referring to his remarks that there is no danger of a war on 
the Korean peninsula, the editorial expresses relief, because 
Perry's remarks must have been made based on good information. 
  The editorial continues: "It is important to make people 
trust in the government's readiness in dealing with North 
Korea," referring to the people's attachment of more importance 
to the government's action and steps. The editorial adds that 
"it is important for the government to always prepare for the 
danger of war." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 300-word report 
entitled "There Is No Immediate Danger of War on the Korean 
Peninsula." Referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry's remarks that media reports on tension on the Korean 
peninsula is exaggerated, the report writes: "He said that 
North Korea would change fuel bars in its 5-megawatt reactor 
within weeks and this fuel would provide sufficient plutonium to 
make four or five nuclear bombs." 
  HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled 
"The Changing Situation Regarding the North Korean Nuclear 
Issue." Referring to the meeting between ROK National Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae and U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry on the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial writes: 
"It is very significant that the ROK and United States have 
agreed to strengthen their joint combatant capabilities to 
prepare for a surprise attack by North Korea." 
  The editorial continues: "The ROK and U.S. Governments have 
set the timing of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise at 
around November, which is an expression of their firm will to 
cooperate on dealing with North Korea." Noting remarks by U.S. 
Government officials that North Korea possesses enough plutonium 
to produce nuclear weapons, the editorial writes: "These 
remarks attract the people's attention because they negate the 
remarks made by President Kim Il-song that North Korea will not 
produce nuclear weapons, nor feel the need to produce them." 
  Referring to North Korea's reaction to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, request for additional inspections 
of its nuclear facilities, the editorial writes: "It is not 
hard to access the background of North Korea's change of 
attitude. The reason North Korea has changed its attitude is 
the fact that there is only a few days remaining until the IAEA 
deadline for additional inspections, as set forth in the 
presidential statement by the UN Security Council." 
  The editorial continues: "The change in North Korea's 
attitude is to gain much more support from the United States 
during the third round of U.S.-DPRK high-level talks," and urges 
the government to be more prudent in dealing with North Korea in 
close cooperation with the United States. The editorial 
concludes: "It is important for the government to ask the 
United States to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks 
after North Korea accepts overall inspections [chonmyon sachal] 
of its nuclear facilities, as well as special inspections of its 
two nuclear waste material storage facilities [haekpyogimul 
chojangso]." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "ROK, U.S. Reaction to North Korean Nuclear 
Issue." The editorial writes the decisions made by ROK and U.S. 
defense ministers are very significant because it will prevent 
any difference between ROK and U.S. opinions regarding the North 
Korean nuclear issue and strengthens military alliance between 
the two countries. 
  The editorial continues that the decision to modernize the 
combined forces is more significant because "reaffirming the 
need for improvement of combat capacity, which is discussed in 
every annual Security Consultative Meeting, reflects the 
importance at this point." 
  The editorial stresses that in the meantime, the ROK and the 
United States should not rule out peaceful and diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "If North Korea Has Nuclear Bombs." 
Referring to the "shocking" remarks of U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry that North Korea will be able to make four to five nuclear 
bombs within weeks, the editorial writes it serves as a warning 
to the ROK Government's relaxed judgment underestimating North 
Korea's nuclear capability. 
  Denouncing the government's inconsistent policy on North 
Korean affairs, the editorial urges "immediate" and "major" 
changes of the security policy, the establishment of an 
independent intelligence system, and a review of the hasty 
denuclearization decision giving up nuclear reprocessing 
facilities. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,100-word 
article 
by reporter Yi Sang-ki entitled "Did He Sell Weapons or Not?" 
The article reports that although Secretary Perry denied he had 
tried to sell U.S. weapons, "there is a high possibility that 
the subject was discussed by the working-level officials of 
Secretary Perry's entourage by noting that the purchase of arms 
systems, including the global positioning system, was included 
on the agenda." 
  The article also analyzes that ROK Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae hinted at additional arms purchases by saying that 
priority will be given to counter-battery capability, 
night-fighting capability, and the enhancement of 
inter-operability to improve the combined forces. 
  The article reports that some officials of the ROK Defense 
Ministry expect more pressure to buy U.S. weapons and that the 
Defense Ministry is establishing its own new purchasing 
strategies irrespective of U.S. pressure.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The government and the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) have decided to form a 
special organization to deal with North Korean escapees, DLP 
policy coordinator Paek Nam-chi said Friday. 
  The organization is to be comprised of officials from the 
Economic Planning Board, the Agency for National Security 
Planning, the National Unification Board, and the Health and 
Social Affairs, Foreign and Labor Ministries. 
  The government and the ruling party held a joint meeting on 
foreign affairs Friday attended by Chong Che-mun, chairman of 
the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National Unification 
Committee, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss handling 
escapees from logging camps in Siberia and other North Koreans 
fleeing their country. 
  The soon-to-be-formed organization will study revision of 
related legislation including the law to protect North Korean 
defectors here as well as enact a law to protect refugees, the 
official said. 
  The body is also expected to work out concrete measures to 
help North Korean refugees in South Korea -- providing them with 
opportunities for vocational education and social adaptation 
training, among others. 
  Hundreds of North Koreans have escaped from Siberian logging 
yards, testifying later to rampant human rights violations 
inside the camps. 
  The government and DLP officials agreed to devise mid- and 
long-term measures as the number of escapees from logging camps 
in Siberia and from North Korea is expected to keep increasing. 
  The officials decided to concentrate on strengthening the 
North Koreans' ability to stand on their own here rather than 
giving them financial support. 
  They also established the principle that North Koreans 
staying in China after escaping from logging camps in Russia or 
North Korea can resettle in South Korea if they wish. 
  The government plans to hold diplomatic negotiations with 
the 
Chinese Government on the matter, according to party coordinator 
Park. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han reported recent developments 
in the North Korean nuclear problem to the meeting. 
  "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sent North 
Korea a positive answer to Pyongyang's proposal that IAEA 
inspectors visit Yongbyon and witness the changing of nuclear 
fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor," Han said. 
  The IAEA, Han said, responded that nuclear safeguards 
activities are necessary to complete its inspections and 
proposed that Pyongyang permit further checks of nuclear 
facilities it was denied access to last March and to ensure the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  "IAEA inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor is important in 
securing the nuclear transparency of North Korea," Han said.

instructed its overseas missions Friday to pay extra attention 
to ensuring the safety of Korean residents and expatriates 
abroad lest Pyongyang harm them in retaliation for Seoul's 
decision to give protection to North Korean loggers fleeing 
Siberian camps. 
  The Stalinist regime could harm North Korean escapees or 
even 
South Korean tourists in Russia to retaliate for Seoul's 
decision to resettle willing loggers in the South, a Foreign 
Ministry official said. 
  The South Korean Embassy in Moscow and other overseas 
missions were instructed to protect all Koreans abroad, the 
official said.

  [Text] The government sent a telephone message to North 
Korea this morning, objecting to North Korea's call for the 
repatriation of long-term prisoners who refused converting from 
communism. It has, however, urged North Korea to repatriate 
figures who were kidnapped to North Korea and to resume talks 
between the North and South Red Cross societies. 
  This morning, the government sent the telephone message to 
Yi 
Song-ho, acting chairman of the North Korean Red Cross Society 
Central Committee, in the name of Kang Yong-hun, president of 
the Korea National Red Cross, and stressed: Because Mr. Kim 
In-so--whom North Korea asked on 19 April to be repatriated to 
the North as a long-term prisoner because he refused to convert 
from communism-- acquired the ROK nationality on his free will, 
is no longer a prisoner of war. If North Korea is interested in 
the humanitarian issue, it should take practical steps to 
resolve the separated family matter. 
  In today's message, the government said that the reason no 
progress had been made in the settlement of the separated family 
issue is because of the North side's failure to implement an 
agreement reached between the North and South and demanded that, 
based on the spirit of the Red Cross Society, the North side 
repatriate approximately 440 persons -- who were kidnaped to the 
North -- including Tongjin Ho sailors, as soon as possible, and 
that it immediately resume the suspended Red Cross talks.

<F P=106> [By Ha Chun-u: "Beginning of Military Diplomacy"] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's overseas visit is 
the first official trip of military diplomacy since the revision 
of the national defense goal of adopting a comprehensive concept 
of security on neighboring countries. 
  Among the three countries which Defense Minister Yi will 
visit, two countries--Japan and Russia--have direct influence on 
the security situation in the Northeast Asian region. This is 
relevant to President Kim Yong-sam's order that was made early 
this year to strengthen military exchanges with neighboring 
countries. 
  In particular, this is the first time for an ROK defense 
minister to visit Japan. The upcoming visit to Japan has 
significance in that it will be an opportunity to carry out 
military exchanges that were restricted by past relations 
between the two countries. Currently, the only form of military 
exchange between the ROK and Japan is the exchange student 
program for one or two officers of each's military schools to 
study in the other's country. 
  In the past, through military agreement with the United 
States, the ROK and Japan have maintained peace in the Northeast 
Asian region. Even though the two countries recognized each 
other's military importance because they are close 
geographically, in reality, military exchange between the two 
countries was very limited. 
  It was learned that Japan has assumed a more active attitude 
in carrying out military exchange with the ROK. On several 
occasions in the past, Japan had promoted mutual visits of the 
ROK defense minister and Japan's director general of the defense 
agency. However, our government had not accepted it in 
consideration of the people's sentiment toward Japan. 
  While in Japan, Defense Minister Yi will discuss ways to 
enhance military exchanges with Japan. Concrete agreement is 
expected to be reached on enhancing exchanges in military 
education to the level of the National Defense College and to 
increasing the exchange of maritime training students aboard 
naval vessels. 
  The ROK and Japan have kept up consultations on preventing 
mid-air collisions of military planes. It is expected that with 
Defense Minister Yi's visit to Japan, the two countries will 
cooperate on the level of promising exchange in the form of a 
letter. 
  It seems that Defense Minister Yi's visit to Germany will be 
an opportunity to introduce advanced German military technology 
with a letter of intent. Until now, Germany has been passive in 
military technology cooperation due to North Korea. However, it 
has changed its attitude since 1992. It was learned that the 
Defense Ministry is especially interested in introducing German 
aviation technology. 
  In the final leg of his visit to three countries, Defense 
Minister Yi will visit Russia to revise the 1993 memorandum of 
understanding on military exchange which was concluded in late 
1992 to the 1994 and 1995 memorandum of understanding. Its 
level will be somewhat enhanced also with the addition of 
clauses on the exchange of visits by high-ranking military 
officials, mutual inspection of military installations, and 
exchange of students. 
  Russia is expected to once again offer to repay its economic 
cooperation loan with weapons exports, but since the government 
has not come up with a policy on this matter, it seems that it 
will be difficult for Defense Minister Yi to reveal whether it 
will import weapons from Russia. 
  Through military exchanges with neighboring countries 
including Japan, China, and Russia, the Defense Ministry's 
strategy is to set up a plan for security on the Korean 
peninsula after reunification is achieved. Defense Minister 
Yi's upcoming overseas trip will be an opportunity to broaden 
the depth of understanding on the security situation with the 
defense ministry officials of these countries.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Bilateral trade between 
China and North Korea reached 900 million dollars last year, a 
50-percent increase over the previous year, indicating the 
latter's growing economic reliance on Beijing amid Pyongyang's 
increasing isolation due to its nuclear program, according to a 
report by the Chinese Embassy here. 
  The report, obtained by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry Friday, showed that China exported 600 million dollars 
worth of goods to North Korea, up 11.3 percent from 1992, with 
crude oil accounting for 240 million dollars followed by grain 
(100 million dollars) and electric and electronic products (20 
million dollars). 
  In particular, North Korea's grain imports recorded a 
44.1-percent increase last year from 1992, showing the North 
suffered greatly from food shortages caused by cold weather. 
  The statistics also show that Pyongyang has switched to 
China 
from Russia for oil and ore imports since the collapse of the 
former Soviet Union. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea shipped 300 million dollars worth of 
products to China last year, a 91.2-percent rise compared with 
the previous year, the report said. 
  The total amount breaks down to 210 million dollars in 
steel, 
20 million dollars in cement and 10 million dollars in sea 
products.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- Prime minister Yi 
Hoe-chang instructed relevant government offices on Thursday [21 
April] to obtain his approval of all unification-or national 
security-related policies referred to the Policy Coordination 
Council before they are put into practice. 
  "Since the Unification and National Security Policy 
Coordination Council is designed to review and adopt draft 
government policies, all policy matters referred to and decided 
by the council should now on be approved by the premier prior to 
their implementation," the premier said. 
  Kang Hyong-sok, the prime minister's spokesman, said Yi gave 
the instructions at his senior officials' meeting earlier in the 
day while stressing that all government policies should be 
drafted and determined through cabinet debate. 
  The premier stressed that it was unthinkable that, for 
instance, the policy of allowing North Korean loggers' 
resettlement in South Korea was released to the press before it 
was adopted at the cabinet level. 
  "Prime Minister Yi asked his secretariat to caution relevant 
government offices in this connection," the spokesman said. 
  Prime Minister Yi also told his staff to see to it that any 
expansion of mountain roads should be made in a way that does 
not damage environment, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
wasted no time as it took him only about 20 minutes to appoint 
Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok as Yi Hoe-chang's successor. 
  Unsurprisingly, both the prime minister's office and the 
National Unification Board were apparently stunned by the swift 
change and expressed concern over its repercussions. 
  -- Returning to his office with slightly-reddened face from 
a 
40-minute talks with the president, Yi told Government 
Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha his intention to resign 
and asked him to take necessary steps. 
  He then called his chief secretary Yi Hung-chu and 
administrative coordinator Kim Si-hyong and praised them for 
their hard work. 
  "I'm sorry to have worked you too hard," he told them. 
  Officials at the prime minister's Secretariat found the 
announcement as a shock. 
  "Today was like every other day," one official said, "I 
can't 
believe he would be leaving so suddenly." 
  Premier-designate Yi Yong-tok said that when the president 
called him to inform the appointment around 4:40 p.m., he had no 
time to think twice because he first thought the president was 
trying to tell him to better help the prime minister. 
  Yi, a devout Christian, at first found no words to say when 
he met reporters. "I am afraid I have no sufficient wisdom and 
knowledge. But, I think it is god's dictate," he said. 
  "When President Kim told me to take the premier's post, I 
only understood what he really meant when the president started 
talking about National Assembly approval," he told reporters. 
  -- Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang reportedly explained about 
the 
statement he made on the Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Council to chief presidential secretary Pak 
Kwan-yong Thursday night. 
  Yi had pointed out problems about the council from the legal 
point of view, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said, 
adding Yi must have explained the same thing to the president 
when he met him earlier in the day. 
  But President Kim must have not accepted Yi's explanation as 
diplomatic and security matters fall under the exclusive 
authority of the president and since the council was formed at 
the president's instruction after all, the official said. 
  He said that the Chongwadae secretariat with the duty of 
assisting the president, have to consult government offices 
regarding various policies, but Premier Yi kept ministers from 
making reports directly to Chongwadae, thus posing substantial 
problems to the business of Chongwadae secretaries. 
  Not a few ministers and other government officials had been 
reproached by premier Yi for going directly to Chongwadae in 
breach of his instructions, he said. 
  A senior government official said President Kim thought of 
reshuffling the premier from Thursday when Yi demanded his 
advance approval of unification- and security-related policies.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang has caused quite a political stir by announcing that 
he will increase his control over state affairs. 
  On Thursday, Yi unleashed a stream of reproof and 
instructions regarding the way state affairs are conducted -- 
which analysts are calling "the wrath of Thursday" -- prompting 
Chongwadae [presidential office] to re-examine the premier's 
role and status under the presidential system while pretending 
not to be astonished at the premier's ire. 
  Yi's instructions that all decisions made by the Unification 
and Security Policy Coordinating Council should be put into 
practice only after meeting his approval apparently led to the 
cancellation of a council session slated for Friday. The orders 
are considered by analysts as an expression of Yi's anger at his 
exclusion from the council. 
  It is not certain whether his expression of discontent with 
Chongwadae, the Agency for National Security Planning and 
certain cabinet ministers is intended to tighten his grip on the 
cabinet or is simply an overture for steps he will take in the 
future. 
  But many observers agree that the wrath of Thursday 
demonstrated Yi's unique and strong personality, saying his next 
course of action deserves keen attention. 
  Chongwadae believes that since state affairs must be 
conducted under the president's responsibility in the current 
presidential system of government, the cabinet should be united 
instead of making a great din. 
  But Chongwadae officials have avoided comment on Premier 
Yi's 
wrath of Thursday, seemingly because it is related to a 
sensitive issue that has caused ripples in political circles. 
  When Yi explains his wrath during his weekly meeting with 
President Kim Yong-sam Friday afternoon, the president will 
stress the need for cabinet unity, one of them observed. 
  "The Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Council is 
not an executive agency but an adviser to the president, and the 
premier is represented by his chief secretary in the council," 
said a ranking Chongwadae official. "I can't understand why he 
has made an issue of the council. 
  "The decision to drop the demand for an inter-Korean envoy 
exchange as a precondition to further U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks was announced by the council, but the decision 
was made in the course of policy coordination by related 
agencies, not by the council." 
  Touching on the cancellation of the weekly council meeting 
usually held on Friday, he said, "the meeting was held on 
Thursday because of the need to coordinate policy before U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci left the country. 
The cancellation of Friday's meeting has nothing to do with 
Premier Yi's instructions." 
  Chongwadae officials appear to view Premier Yi as a man who 
sticks too much to the spirit and principle of the law. 
  One official said, "he tries to tackle all problems 
according 
to the spirit of the law, seemingly because of his long bench 
career. I think he needs a flexible approach, such as a 
political approach to political problems." 
  Pointing to Yi's failure to report to President Kim on his 
recent instructions about discontinuing government subsidies to 
several civic organizations, he quipped: "He wants the cabinet 
to obtain his approval for everything, but he doesn't seek the 
president's approval for what ought to be approved by the 
president." 
  Premier Yi's attempt to expand his sphere of influence in 
the 
government and some cabinet ministers' discontent with Yi have 
been reported to President Kim, prompting the response: "Don't 
say such a thing." 
  Cabinet ministers consider Premier Yi's instructions 
regarding Unification and Policy Coordinating Council decisions 
as an expression of his intent to get a firm hold on the cabinet. 
  They are apparently nervous about the instructions' 
consequences because Premier Yi knocked the way a presidential 
council is run. 
  Some ministers have reportedly complained about Yi's demand 
that they go through him when making a report to the president. 
The economic planning, unification and defense ministers, who 
have things which must be reported directly and quickly to the 
president, must be unhappy about Yi's meddling, officials said. 
  Yi has a weekly luncheon meeting with the two deputy 
premiers 
every Thursday, but he cancelled this week's session without 
giving any specific reasons, raising speculation on discord. 
  A ranking cabinet official said, "the president and the 
premier can be compared to the father and the mother of a 
family, and cabinet ministers may directly tell their problems 
to the president as children do to their father. The premier 
playing the mother's role should overlook father-child relations 
from time to time." 
  Officials from the prime minister's office, stressing Yi's 
instructions were made so he could get a good grip on the 
cabinet, are worried about their repercussions. They are 
particularly perplexed at press reports that Yi is feuding with 
presidential secretaries and officials of the Agency for 
National Security Planning. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party generally regards 
Premier 
Yi's wrath as "an expression of his will to work as a man of 
conviction," but is unhappy about the way the press is handling 
the matter. 
  Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "it's quite natural 
that 
cabinet ministers report everything to the premier, and Premier 
Yi expressed his desire to work to the full of his convictions 
in the instructions in question, didn't he?" 
  He added, however, that it would have been better if Yi had 
held prior discussions with related ministers, suggesting 
disapproval of the way Yi deals with problems. 
  Spokesman Ha Sun-pong, asked if Yi's instructions were not 
an 
expression of his discontent with Chongwadae and the 
government's foreign affairs-security team, replied, "I don't 
think he is discontented and I think by giving instructions he 
wanted to remind everyone that he has an interest in diplomatic 
and security issues affecting national interests." 
  A close aide of Chairman Kim Chong-pil supported Yi, saying, 
"Premier Yi gave proper instructions. He has the right to give 
such instructions because the president and the premier are 
ultimately responsible for the conduct of state affairs." 
  The opposition Democratic Party fully supports Premier Yi's 
instructions. 
  Supreme Councilor Kim Won-ki, speaking for Chairman Yi 
Ki-taek while he tours the United States, said, "Premier Yi's 
instructions are quite right and lawful," noting the 
Constitution gives the premier considerable responsibility in 
conducting state affairs. 
  Spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "when he took office the people 
expected much of him as a man of conviction, but he has failed 
to meet such expectations because he has become a premier making 
an apology to the people." Yi's wrath "compels us to pin further 
hope on him."

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
accepted the resignation tendered by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang 
Friday and named Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and National 
Unification minister, to succeed Yi Hoe-chang as new prime 
minister. 
  President Kim told his secretaries to submit to the 
National Assembly on Saturday a bill asking for parliamentary 
endorsement of his appointment of Yi Yong-tok as new prime 
minister. 
  Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said 
in an announcement soon after Yi Hoe-chang's weekly Chongwadae 
[meeting] reporting that "Prime Minister Yi tendered his 
resignation as prime minister at 5 p.m. and President Kim 
accepted it promptly." 
  President Kim met Prime Minister Yi at Chongwadae for about 
40 minutes beginning 4 p.m., during which the president was 
learned to have reproached Yi in connection with his recent 
behavior. 
  A source said that Prime Minister Yi did not express his 
intent of resignation during his Chongwadae meeting with the 
president. 
  But, on return to his office in the integrated government 
building, Yi tendered his resignation through Government 
Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha, the source said. 
  The acceptance by President Kim of Yi's resignation is taken 
as the revelation of the president's determination to firm up 
the discipline of the cabinet under the presidential system. 
  The president is expected to appoint a new deputy prime 
minister and national unification minister soon after the 
parliament endorsed the choice of Yi Yong-tok as new prime 
minister.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister-designate 
Yi Yong-tok pledged Friday that he would do his utmost to serve 
the country and people if his appointment is legally approved by 
the National Assembly. 
  "I will see to it that the entire government becomes one 
under the leadership of the president and devote myself to live 
up to the responsibility bestowed upon me," Yi told reporters at 
his office in the National Unification Board [NUB] after his 
appointment was announced. 
  The NUB minister said the unification is possible once the 
people unite and continue with reforms to build a free country. 
  "Picturing a unified country, I will do my best to ensure 
freedom and welfare of the 70 million people of the Korean 
peninsula," he said. 
  He added that press reports about the intra-government 
confusion over unification and security-related policy were 
wrong.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Political parties showed 
mixed reactions on the resignation Friday of Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe- chang. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party said it was 
inconsiderate 
of outgoing Prime Minister Yi to resign without wisely striding 
over a mountain of important state affairs. 
  "We regret it that Prime Minister Yi, whom we expected to 
wisely surmount many important state affairs, tendered 
resignation all of a sudden," party spokesman Ha Sun-pong said. 
  "We believe Prime Minister-designate Yi Yong-tok, with his 
high virtues and rich experiences, would wisely overcome today's 
difficulties to make the people feel easier." 
  The opposition Democratic Party said the party regrets Prime 
Minister Yi's resignation which it said was caused by "reckless 
checks" by those in power. 
  "The people expected much from Prime Minister Yi. But, he 
couldn't unfold his policy and had to step down due to reckless 
checks," party spokesman Pak Chi-won said. 
  "We fear if Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime minister 
won't 
turn the administration more conservative," he said. 
  The United People's Party said the party was shocked at 
Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang having resigned for the reason that he 
couldn't fulfill the duty given him under the Constitution.

  [Text] Petaling Jaya, April 22 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
Friday called on United Nations Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to resign for doing nothing to resolve the conflict 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he was disappointed 
because Butrus-Ghali did not take a firm stand in dealing with 
the Serb aggression in that strife-torn country. 
  The UN should elect a secretary-general who is really an 
activist and brave, who could resolve the problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he told reporters in Subang, here. 
  Mahathir said he believed the resignation of Butrus-Ghali 
would bring change towards settlement of the problem in the 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  What is certain is he did not do anything to settle the 
conflict in Bosnia, he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir expressed regret that Butrus-Ghali took the 
conflict in Bosnia lightly when it erupted more than two years 
ago. 
  At first, Butrus-Ghali said the occurrence in Bosnia could 
be 
found anywhere... He said it was not the only one but there 
were 10 more in other places, he said. 
  Butrus-Ghali's statement appeared to encourage the Serbs to 
continue their aggression against the Bosnian Muslims on the 
grounds that it was not something extraordinary as the same 
thing was happening elsewhere. 
  Asked if Malaysia would play a more important role in the 
election of the UN secretary-general in future, Dr. Mahathir 
said Malaysia's influence was limited in that matter. 
  In fact, he said, many countries were pressured by the big 
powers to elect their candidate to the post. 
  Malaysia did not support Butrus-Ghali's election to the post 
in 1991, he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir reiterated that the Bosnian Muslims should be 
provided with arms to defend themselves from Serb attacks. 
  He believed the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be 
different if the reverse occurred where the people who are 
murdered are non-Muslims and the murderers were Muslims. 
  If this is the situation, I believe action will be taken 
speedily, he said. 
  Meanwhile Gerakan, a component party of the ruling National 
Front, expressed support for the call for Butrus-Ghali's 
resignation. He was biased and racialist in making important 
decisions, party president Dr. Lim Keng Yaik said. 
  Dr. Lim, who is Minister of Primary Industries, said the UN 
was influenced by big powers like the United States and European 
countries and it was uninterested in settling problems in a 
country that did not share the same religious belief or in which 
they had no special interest.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean official 
in charge of bodyguards for "dear leader" Kim Chong-il was 
arrested in China by authorities there and deported after 
fleeing his country, it was reported Thursday. 
  Five statistics officials from Yanbian Korean autonomous 
prefecture in Jilin Province, northeastern China, confirmed the 
report. The ethnic Koreans are visiting Seoul to receive 
training. 
  According to the officials, the unidentified deputy chief 
bodyguard of Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President 
Kim Il-song, fled to Guangzhou in southern China via Thailand in 
late March. 
  Chinese authorities, at the request of North Korean 
officials, arrested the man while he was in hiding at a 
Guangzhou hotel. The man was then handcuffed and sent back to 
North Korea through the Chinese border city of Tumen near the 
Tumen River, and there is a strong possibility he has been 
executed, the officials said. 
  The ethnic Korean officials, however, said they could not 
determine his identity and did not know how the man had come to 
visit Thailand.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and articles published in Seoul vernacular dailies on 
21 April on the reportedly pacifying gesture by North Korean 
President Kim Il-song during his recent interview with William 
Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, CSIS, and other Western media, such as 
CNN, THE WASHINGTON TIMES, and Japanese NHK Television. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "From the Sea of Fire to Fishing." The 
editorial begins: "Until recently, U.S. media was uproarious in 
reporting that a war would break out on the Korean peninsula at 
any time. Now, a person called vice president of the U.S. CSIS, 
who interviewed Kim Il-song, states that he can confirm Kim's 
pacifying attitude. Noting this rapidly fluctuating scene, we 
are led to believe that Kim Il-song's game with the South, the 
United States, and the media is working. Uproarious commotions 
occurred in Western media concerning `war clouds on the Korean 
peninsula' in reaction to `the sea of fire' remark. Several 
days later, when Kim Il-song said: `I wish to visit the United 
States to fish and hunt,' a U.S. figure said there is no war 
danger. Kim is certainly toying with our side. As revealed in 
Kim Il-song's meeting with Western figures, he is informed on 
the nuclear issue, he is resolved not to ultimately abandon the 
nuclear program while continuing to deny possessing nuclear 
weapons, and he will keep trying to win a package solution using 
the nuclear card." The editorial concludes: "We should 
solidify our security posture and maintain a firm ROK-U.S. 
cooperative alliance, rather than readily reacting to the 
North's game, which does not display any honesty. We should not 
hastily be tempted to meetings or talks with the North." 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,300-word 
article by reporter An Hui-chang entitled: "Kim Il-song's 
Pacifying Scheme -- Well-Planned Propaganda Offensive Aimed at 
Deranging the South." The article notes that "The `smile 
operation' that North Korean President Kim Il-song himself is 
undertaking must have been well-planned." The article then 
notes: "For the show, North Korea displayed a `dovish gesture' 
to the world through an actor called Kim Il-song. The show is 
also aimed at deranging the South. North Korea had to stage a 
show like this because it is thoroughly isolated from the world 
opinion owing to its incomplete compliance with the ad hoc 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. 
Furthermore, the recently reported issue of North Korean 
loggers and escapees from the North brought to light the North 
Korean human rights issue, a disgrace to North Korea." The 
article concludes: "The true North Korean intent behind the 
pacifying show by Kim Il-song will be revealed in the near 
future." 
  CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by Kim 
Chol entitled: "The ROK and the United States Taken by 
Surprise." The article notes that "Using a Western broadcast 
covering the news connected with the tension on the Korean 
peninsula and his 82d birthday, North Korean President Kim 
Il-song took the United States and the ROK by surprise. Kim 
tried to replace his image of a hooligan with an image of a 
neighborly grandfather, a good citizen one can meet anywhere, 
and a friendly figure for the American people." The article 
notes that Kim Il-song's pacifying gesture is likely to confuse 
ROK's North Korean policy and inspire the reunification 
advocates who are not aware of the true nature of the North 
Korean rulers. The article then notes North Korea has succeeded 
in enhancing its position, as was expected, in using the nuclear 
card in view of the present stage of development. The article 
notes: "Kim Il-song's nuclear strategy consists of two stages. 
One is to improve relations with the United States by using the 
nuclear issue as a weapon for the North Korean system, which is 
left as a solitary island in the post-cold war era." The 
article continues: "The second stage of Kim Il-song's strategy 
is to force the U.S. Forces out of the ROK, ultimately through 
the improvement of relations with the United States." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an article by Pak 
Che-kyun entitled: "Kim Il-song's Remarks on His Readiness To 
Abolish the Radiochemical Laboratory." The article notes Kim 
Il-song's remarks in a written interview with Western media that 
he is prepared to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, provided 
that the United States assists North Korea to install 
light-water reactors. The article notes the complexity involved 
in assisting North Korea to install light-water reactors because 
it would mean the United States has to spend $1 to 2 billion per 
reactor, not to mention the 10 years required for the 
construction of the reactor. The article notes: "U.S. 
assistance to North Korea for the light-water reactor means the 
improvement of relations between the United States and North 
Korea, which will probably lead to the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries." The editorial 
concludes: "It is not likely that the ROK and the United States 
will accede to President Kim's proposal at this stage, which 
President Kim will no doubt be aware of. Therefore, while 
unwilling at heart to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, he 
is urging the United States to improve its relations with North 
Korea, using the light-water reactor card, stressing that North 
Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, according 
to an analysis of relevant government officials." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Kim Pong-son entitled: "The Government's View on Kim 
Il-song's Remark Hinting of Abolishing the Radiochemical 
Laboratory." 
  Reporting that the ROK Government reaction was mixed on his 
remark, the article notes those who have an upbeat view hold 
that "such a remark is an indirect expression of change in its 
previous stance that `North Korean-U.S. talks are a prerequisite 
for additional inspections,'" whereas those with a negative view 
maintain "his remark clearly shows that North Korea intends to 
earn more time by adding conditions regarding light-water 
reactors." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 700-word 
article by Kim Yong-ha. Noting the huge differences in their 
capacity to extract plutonium from light-water reactors and 
graphite reactors, the article notes "if North Korea's intention 
to install light-water reactors is true, it can be interpreted 
as an intention to suspend its nuclear development." 
  The article concludes: "The clearest sign that can be seen 
from President Kim Il-song's remark is that `North Korea's 
nuclear card' is becoming ineffective. Hence North Korea's 
gesture implies that North Korea, being driven into a corner, 
seeks an exit that serves its interests." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 5 an 800-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled: 
"Kim Il-song's Pacifying Remarks." 
  Enumerating on North Korea leadership's moderate tone, the 
article writes: "With this pacifying attitude, North Korea aims 
to earn the time necessary for nuclear development, to 
disintegrate the ROK-U.S. cooperative system, and to deepen the 
confrontation between ROK hardliners and moderates." The 
article continues that Kim Il-song "in effect asked the world to 
take him at his word that he had no nuclear ambitions, giving no 
hint of welcoming IAEA inspections." 
  Noting that the North Korean nuclear issue is back to the 
point it had started, the article analyzes "in view of this, 
there is a dominant feeling around U.S. political circles that 
the United States should not be entangled in President Kim 
Il-song's pacifying attitude and that it should firmly push 
ahead with its previous scenario of imposing pressure if North 
Korea fails to meet the early-May deadline." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled: "We Should Not Get Dazzled by a Peace 
Offensive." 
  Referring to U.S. and Japanese media welcoming Kim Il-song's 
remarks for their moderate tone, the editorial questions: "How 
can we believe that he is telling the truth? What we need now 
is his remark that North Korea will unconditionally accept 
overall inspections and carrying it into practice. To one's 
great regret, he has not uttered a word on this even though he 
has made countless flowery remarks." 
  Denouncing North Korea's invariable communist-type disguised 
tactics, the editorial holds that "regardless of such a peace 
offensive, the deployment of Patriot missiles and the Team 
Spirit exercise should not be suspended. The UN Security 
Council should adopt sanctions against North Korea unless it 
accepts IAEA inspections. What is more, we should show more 
positive interest in the human rights condition in North Korea 
to make North Korea acknowledge the necessity of accepting 
nuclear inspections and holding inter-Korean talks." 
  Recalling the recent student demonstrations opposing the 
deployment of Patriots, the editorial warns that "the people and 
public sentiment should not be deceived by North Korea's peace 
offensive." The article concludes that "in this perspective, 
the members of the National Federation of General Student 
Councils should remember that they are playing into North 
Korea's hands."

  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong says his visits to 
Europe should be seen as a tying up of two ends of a ribbon. At 
one end are the prospects in the Asian economies and at the 
other end are prospective investors in Western Europe and 
elsewhere. Summing up his visits to Germany and Britain, Mr. 
Goh said Singapore wants to act as an intermediary to tie the 
knot. This is part of Singapore's overall strategy of going 
regional. The Singapore delegation's spokesman said Mr. Goh's 
trip to Germany had brought bilateral relations to a higher 
level. This is because of new steps being taken such as the 
formation of the Singapore-German Business Forum, the GSBF. 
  On Britain, the spokesman said the level of Singapore's 
relations with the country has been high. British leaders 
shared Mr. Goh's concern on the need to build on this 
relationship. One concrete way to assert the strengthened ties 
is through the setting up of the Singapore-British Business 
Council to be ready in about one to two months' time. 
  Mr. Goh returned home this evening after his official visits 
to Germany and Britain.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul high court on 
Friday handed down two years in jail with a three-year stay of 
execution to Shinohara Masato, the Seoul correspondent of 
Japan's Fuji Television convicted of violating the military 
secret protection law. 
  Shinohara, 41, was sentenced earlier to a two-year prison 
term in a lower court and appealed his case to the high court. 
  In his decision, Judge Min Su-myong said, "the defendant 
rightly deserves the punishment as he violated this country's 
military secret protection law when he spied to obtain military 
secrets for three years and gave them to military attaches at 
the Japanese Embassy in Seoul." 
  The court believes, however, that he was interested in 
military secrets more as a journalist and analyst for his 
articles than as a spy, the judge said. 
  Moreover, this incident does not appear to have had a 
decisive adverse effect on the country's security, the judge 
said. Besides, he noted that Shinohara confessed before 
authorities began questioning him. 
  Considering all the extenuating circumstances, the judge 
said 
he decided to give Shinohara a lenient sentence. 
  Shinohara was indicted last July on charges of receiving 27 
military secrets from former Major Ko Yong-chol, who was working 
in the intelligence headquarters of the Defense Ministry, 
turning them over to Japanese military attaches on a regular 
basis between 1989 and 1990.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia: Lend Muslims a Hand"] </F>
  [Text] The West has not only made a mess of the situation 
in Bosnia, but also a mockery of its pledge to protect the 
Muslim enclaves besieged by the Bosnian Serb forces. Why did 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, of which the United 
States is a leading member, agree to use air power against the 
Serb advance on Gorazde when it had no intention to do more than 
engage sparingly in pinprick strikes? The military buildup by 
the Serb forces last month showed that a major offensive was in 
the offing. True, air strikes can not be expected to prevent 
the Serbs from seizing Gorazde or any of the other Muslim 
enclaves. But this misses the point, which is that no serious 
attempt was made to deter the Serbs or punish them if deterrence 
failed. 
  When the Serb forces moved into Gorazde on Saturday, all 
that 
was done was to order two fighters to attack tanks aiming their 
guns at that town. It should have been clear when the first air 
strikes were carried out 10 days ago that such limited attacks 
would not stop the Serbs. That action should have been spelled 
out to the Serbs as a warning of fiercer strikes to come if they 
did not halt their aggression. It is possible that fear of 
retaliation would have deterred them if a credible threat had 
been made. In any case, the Serb forces should not have escaped 
punishment. They lost only a couple of tanks and a few armoured 
personnel carriers when the objective should have been to target 
their ammunition and fuel storage sites as well as other 
facilities that would erode their fighting capacity. NATO also 
failed to retaliate when one of its aircraft was shot down by a 
Serb missile. It caved in by calling off any further air 
strikes. 
  The fall of Gorazde will embolden the Serbs to proceed 
according to their plan of consolidating their territorial 
conquests with the declared aim of carving out a Greater Serbia. 
Having secured a major road link and a swathe of territory 
connecting their possessions in eastern and southern Bosnia, 
their next likely target is the large Muslim enclave of Tuzla, 
which is one of the six safe havens designated by the United 
Nations. Like Gorazde, it is inhabited mainly by refugees. 
Already under siege, its capture would enable the Serbs to 
tighten their grip over the northeastern region. They can also 
be expected now to reactivate their pressure on Sarajevo. 
  With the Serb forces moving closer to achieving their goal 
of 
Greater Serbia, there can hardly be any prospect of a peace 
settlement since that would require them to make territorial 
concessions. Economic sanctions imposed on Serbia have hurt 
that country, but with its ambition of becoming the centre of an 
expanded Serbia, it will be able to cope with the hardships, as 
seen over the past two years. Reportedly, under the recent 
accord for a loose union between the Muslims and Croats, the 
Serbs would have to concede at least 21 percent of the land they 
control. That much is regarded by the Muslims and Croats to be 
the bare minimum. Otherwise, they would not have enough 
territory to accommodate each other's ethnic interests in a new 
union. 
  The Western fiasco over Gorazde must have made it clear to 
the Muslims and Croats that they would have to make a concerted 
military effort to wrest those areas from the Serbs. Moves 
towards a merger of their forces are underway. The West can 
help that process by acting to lift the arms embargo that has 
greatly disadvantaged them. The embargo was imposed on the 
former Yugoslavia in 1991 before the conflict in Bosnia erupted. 
Once the Muslims acquire heavy equipment, the Serb forces will 
begin to lose the military superiority they enjoy. Unless the 
ground situation begins to change, the Serbs will not engage in 
any serious peace process nor will NATO air strikes make much 
difference if they are resumed at all. The right of 
self-defence, at any rate, is one of the fundamental principles 
enshrined in the UN Charter. The West cannot continue to deny 
it to the Bosnian Muslims.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- International 
anti-nuclear and Korean environmental groups were of one voice 
Friday in opposing South Korea's nuclear power development and 
demanding information on the issue from the government. 
  "We are seriously concerned about nuclear (reactor) 
proliferation in South Korea," said Tom Clements, Greenpeace 
International's plutonium campaign manager based in Washington, 
D.C., and chief of the Greenpeace team touring Korea since April 
12. 
  "We feel that coming from Western countries, we can share 
our 
experience and knowledge about nuclear development and wastes 
with the Korean people," he told a press conference at the Korea 
Federation of Environment Movement (KFEM) headquarters in Seoul 
together with five other Greenpeace representatives and Korean 
environmental activists. 
  Prof. Yi Pil-ryol, representing 222 petitioners from various 
walks of life, questioned Seoul's support for the atomic energy 
industry, which he said is being abandoned worldwide due to its 
hazardous nature. 
  Shaun Burnie, a nuclear campaign coordinator based in 
Amsterdam, said he has learned of defects in the steam 
generators made by Westinghouse of the United States that have 
been causing troubles throughout the world. 
  Clements said in the United States, Westinghouse was being 
sued by 15 utilities for making faulty generators. 
  The campaigners, who have been touring proposed reactor 
sites 
and power stations in the Southern part of the country, arrived 
in Inchon aboard their flagship MV Greenpeace Thursday and moved 
on to the capital for three days of debate, protests and other 
activities. 
  They hope to meet government officials, including the prime 
minister, for Earth Day falling on Friday.

<F P=106> [Interview with B.J. Habibie, Indonesian state minister for </F>
research and technology, by BUSINESS TIMES correspondent Yang 
Razali Kassim in Jakarta; -- date not given] 
  [Text] BT [BUSINESS TIMES]: Your close relationship 
with President Suharto is no secret. Has he ever discussed with 
you privately the future of the Indonesian leadership and the 
question of succession? 
  DR HABIBIE: No. Because President Suharto has 
always said that he doesn't want to groom a putra mahkota (crown 
prince). He knows exactly the mechanism and the rules of the 
game of Pancasila democracy. 
  He always says it is the privilege of the People's 
Consultative Assembly (MPR) to first decide and discuss, to 
express the vision of the nation and, based on that, elect one 
of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who can meet the 
requirements to be given the mandate to implement the vision of 
the nation. 
  Q: There is a view that it is critical for Indonesia, 
during this transition, to settle the question of succession. 
Pak Harto [Mr. Suharto], having served very long and having 
done what is perceived as a good job, needs to have clear 
successor to sustain the good work. 
  A: You are right that Pak Harto is very, very 
credible, based on the fact that he has been always at the 
forefront for the last 27 years -- 32 years, if he finishes his 
present term as President and Mandatory. Based on his 
performance, theoretically and practically, he is the most 
credible man. In the interest of the nation, we have to listen 
to his opinion because he is a national as well as an 
international leader. 
  Now, because of that, if you ask me who will decide the 
successor to Mr Suharto, the answer is clear: the elected 
representatives of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who 
sit in the People's Consultative Assembly in 1998. They have to 
do the job. 
  Q: In the event that Pak Harto decides to retire 
halfway through his term, what do you think will happen to the 
presidency? 
  A: Knowing Pak Harto, and having assisted him the 
last 20 years, knowing his performance and his character, and 
his leadership, I know he will never stop something before his 
term ends. Never. 
  Pak Harto is a pejuang, a fighter. He has said: "I'm born 
and I grow up as a fighter. My mentality is this: as long as 
the people, my beloved people of the Republic of Indonesia ask 
me to do a job. in what condition ever I will be, I will accept 
the instruction and the will of the people to implement the job, 
in whatever condition." So that's why there is no reason for him 
to stop halfway, unless it is the will of Allah. 
  Q: And what if Allah wills that the President stop 
during his term? 
  A: Then, according to the Undang-Undang Dasar 
(Constitution), the Vice-President will take over. I'm sure the 
whole Cabinet and the whole armed forces and all the political 
parties will take care that this nation will keep its unity and 
keep the nation going, until the election comes. 
  Q: There is an impression that you are being prepared 
to be a future president. What is your reaction to this? 
  A: The first question is: prepared by whom? 
  Q: By President Suharto?/ 
  A: No, Pak Harto is one vote. You should 
understand the mechanism of our democracy. I give that comment 
not as a politician but as a man who has survived among the 
politicians and because I am trying to understand the truth 
about politics. I have become a philosopher (laughter), because 
I am older now. 
  Q: Are you ready to be the next Mandatory 
(President)? 
  A: Me? That question may be put equally to 
anybody. Are you ready? Anybody must be ready. But the 
question is: what will be the result of the musyawarah mufakat 
(consultation and consensus) of the People's Consultative 
Assembly then? Because they are the only ones who have been 
elected by the people to talk, to elect on behalf of the people, 
a man to become the Mandatory of this nation. I don't know. 
But this question is for anybody in the Republic. 
  Q: Whose advice do you listen to most? 
  A: I receive much advice but I have to decide for 
myself. I was already warned by Mr Suharto in 1974. He told 
me: "You should be aware that one day you will know so many 
people, but you are alone." He warned me: "You have to watch." 
At that time, I did not understand. 
  I believe that if you are the leader of a nation, you must 
be 
the leader also of those people who don't like you. If you are 
a leader only for the people who like you, then you are only a 
leader among friends. Now I understand Suharto. 
  Before the election for the Vice-Presidency in 1993, I was 
interviewed by TEMPO magazine. I told TEMPO that my master was 
Professor Suharto. Because I learned from him. After that I 
met President Suharto and said: "I apologise for calling you my 
professor, my teacher, my guru." 
  Pak Harto told me: "I am not your guru. I, Suharto, am the 
helper of your guru. Your guru is your own mind." Then he told 
me: "According to Javanese philosophy, knowing you because I 
have been watching you, your bathin (spirit) is very strong." I 
think not. But he told me so. 
Q: If you were given the chance to be President, would 
you continue the economic reform policies that have made 
Indonesia successful in turning around the once-battered economy 
to become what it is now? 
  A: The answer is that anybody who will be elected 
later to become the successor has to continue the policy of 
national development growth. Anybody. The elected 
representatives of the People's Assembly will take care -- must 
take care -- that the national development growth is sustained. 
It's the only way to bring the nation to the same level as the 
advanced economies. 
  Q: So if it were you, you would continue the economic 
reforms? 
  A: Not (just) me, I say anybody. I don't want to 
be the reference point. Anybody must do that. And the whole 
system in Indonesia is built around it. 
  Q: Why do we continue to hear domestic criticism of 
the aerospace industry and of your approach to economic 
development, or what is called "Habibienomics"? 
  A: Such criticism comes from people who have 
mixed feelings and political interests. I give you an example. 
Our CN235 [aircraft] hit a mountain two years ago. At that 
time, there was a lot of speculation that I was to be the next 
vice-president. As it happened, it went on for almost three 
months -- people were criticising me daily. Daily. Saying bad 
things and so on. 
  But later, when the black box came out, everything proved 
that I was right. I told them that it was human error. There 
was even an article from a lady, a professor in Bandung, who 
wrote an analysis that Habibie was a man against human rights, 
the rights of women. Terrible. All so emotional. Everybody. 
  And now, what happened? Look at the Superpuma [helicopter] 
accident in Malaysia. Look, at the reactions of the Malaysian 
Defence Minister, the air force commander, the prime minister 
and the mass media -- all very fair. They did not criticise as 
the Indonesians did. You know why? Because the Malaysians were 
more objective and were not politically involved. 
  All those reactions here (in Indonesia) were politically 
engineered to portray the bad idea that maybe Habibie was 
ambitious and wanted to become vice-president and so on. There 
were a lot of people who don't like that scenario. 
  Q: Political engineering? 
  A: I think so. In this case, political 
engineering -- making use of the fact that our society is 
heterogeneous. By the way, the majority of the people in the 
Republic of Indonesia, 99 per cent, are really not involved in 
political engineering for self (-serving) purposes. Why do I 
say so? Because daily, I get a lot of compliments from people. 
  Q: What does President Suharto say about these 
criticisms against you? 
  A: You know what he told me? He told me: "Don't 
listen to them. If you listen to crazy people and you get 
crazy, it's your own mistake." You can quote this. "You just 
do what you think is the best for your people, for your country. 
Then you can face God because you have done it to the best of 
your ability." That's the advice from President Suharto. 
  Q: What is "Habibienomics"? 
  A: There is no Habibienomics, there's no 
Wijoyonomics (after Professor Wijoyo Nitisastro, who played a 
major part in early Indonesian pro-market economic policy). But 
if there is such a thing as Habibienomics, it is because there 
was Wijoyonomics. 
  In the first 25 years, we were not in a position yet to take 
care of human resource development. So, what I'm doing now is 
only possible because my colleague, Pak Wijoyo, has done it (his 
job of laying the basis for economic growth). And don't forget 
that Pak Wijoyo was active in the Cabinet in the first three 
five-year plans -- Repelita 1, 2 and 3. Okay? And Habibie has 
been active in the Cabinet since the second Repelita till now -- 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
  So that means whatever he has done. I was a part of the 
team. I was already doing it. There's only one difference: I 
am 10 years, maybe 12 years, younger. So nobody can say: 
"Habibie has done nothing in the 25 years." I was active. I 
was responsible for what has been done. 
  I was lucky. I was then 37. So now, at 57, I have the 
experience of four Repelitas. So, it is wrong to say that 
Habibie was excluded, not involved in the decisionmaking of the 
last 25 years. It's not true that only Prof Wijoyo was involved. 
  Q: Why then is Habibienomics made an issue by your 
critics? 
  A: Political engineering -- to create political 
issues; sensationalism, misinformation, distortion of 
information, whatever. But I see no problem. If there is a 
"nomics", then I would say it's a Suhartonomics, or 
"Mandatory-nomics". Because he is the one who started it -- 
from Repelita 1 to now, Repelita 6. What I'm doing today is a 
part of the evolution of national development of Indonesia. 
  Q: Some outside Indonesia, including in Singapore, 
wonder whether you are a nationalist and therefore more 
protectionist, not supportive of economic reforms? 
  A: Oh yes, I will find that not only in 
Singapore, but here in Indonesia too (laughter). Because they 
want me to open up everything so that everybody can sell and 
kill my airplane manufacture. I said no.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop from the "Special Report" </F>
supplement: "Caution Prevails on Creation of Financial 
Conglomerates"] 
  [Text] No Korean bank is ranked among top 160 banks in the 
world. Even a combination of the 13 commercial banks will make 
it smaller than the world's 23rd largest bank. Only 16 banks 
are listed on the Banker's Top 500 in July last year. The 
average capital of the five major Seoul-based banks is just a 
tenth of that of their Japanese counterparts. Even worse, 
profitability of Korean banks is quite low by international 
standards. A Korean bank employee generated a before-tax income 
of 9.7 million won in 1991, compared with 51.2 million won for 
his counterpart in Japan and 97.8 million won for an employee of 
the 52 foreign banks in Korea. 
  This dismal picture made it inevitable for Korean banks to 
sharpen international competitive edge and a way of bolstering 
their global competitiveness is to increase their size or to 
become financial conglomerates. [sentence as published] An 
economy of scale or managerial efficiency will arise if banks, 
securities companies and insurance houses are merged to become 
financial conglomerates. But caution prevails over a hasty and 
arbitrary creation of financial conglomerates, many analysts 
said. 
  Professor Yi Pil-sang and other critics contend that the 
government is plotting a scheme to control the financial market 
through the creation of big players. They said they agree in 
principle with the government's move to establish a few mega 
financial institutions which will deal in banking, securities 
and insurance services. They said financial conglomerates, if 
established, will sharpen international competitive edge of the 
Korean financial industry. As Korea recruited and intensively 
trained "elite sportsmen" to win gold medals in the Olympics, so 
Seoul now needs to foster a few "representative financial 
institutions" which can compete with Citibank, Bank of America 
and Japanese and European mega banks domestically and globally. 
But they warned that no people or businesses, except for 
industrial groups such as Samsung and Hyundai, have enough money 
to become financial conglomerates. 
  About 300-500 billion won is necessary to take over a bank. 
Except for the government and industrial conglomerates, no one 
and or firm has such a huge amount of cash, many analysts said. 
  Government officials said that the government will strictly 
separate industrial conglomerates from muscling into financial 
groups. But critics say even if the government legally bans the 
participation of Samsung, Hyundai and other industrial groups, 
they may provide money through tricky arrangements to their 
"henchman" to establish financial conglomerates. Ultimately, 
financial conglomerates will become a "private safe" for 
industrial giants, they warned. 
  Furthermore, there is skepticism whether prospective 
financiers, if any, are ready to take over the commercial banks, 
which are saddled with a huge amount of nonperforming loans. 
  Textbook theory alleges that the synergy effect will arise 
when financial conglomerates handling banking, securities and 
insurance emerge. But there is no proven evidence that the 
synergy effect has emerged. Many local banks have used their 
securities, insurance and other financial subsidiaries as 
"channels" for digesting layers of "good old boys." It is no 
coincidence that financial institutions of which parents are 
banks have been performing more poorly than those with no 
affiliation with banks. 
  Another hindrance to the emergence of financial 
conglomerates 
is the rule that no one can control more than 8 percent of any 
Seoul- based commercial bank. This rule has made local bankers 
drift without real owners and left room for government 
intervention in their internal management although it committed 
itself not to meddle in their internal affairs. 
  Pak Chae-yon, senior secretary for economic affairs to 
President Kim Yong-sam indicated that the government would 
loosen the maximum share-holding limit to foster the financial 
conglomerates. 
  Risks on financial conglomerates are widespread. Trouble in 
a subsidiary will have a chain effect on the rest of the sister 
companies in financial conglomerates. Collusion may exist among 
these subsidiaries for regulating competition, forming a cartel 
on pricing and other unfair deals. They many exchange customer 
information, which may create a conflict of interest. 
  Before the emergence of financial conglomerates, Korea needs 
to revamp the current regulatory system in which the three 
supervisory bodies do not have a coordinating function. Mindful 
of such negative effects, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said 
the issue of fostering financial conglomerates is a long-term 
subject. The Ministry of Finance said at the current stage, the 
government has no official position on the issue although it has 
embarked on a full- scale study. Professor Yi of Korea 
University said that the government should first deregulate its 
internal control on financial institutions, help banks eliminate 
the huge amount of nonperforming loans before the idea of 
fostering financial conglomerates is considered. He and many 
critics said financial conglomerates should emerge naturally, 
not artificially by the government. Any artificial measure will 
invite a special favor legitimacy controversy of their birth as 
many industrial conglomerates have been constantly facing, they 
said. 
  Daehan Kyoyuk Insurance announced that it would seek to 
become a financial conglomerate by taking over a bank and a 
merchant bank soon. It has taken over a securities subsidiary 
from the ailing Bank of Seoul. The other candidates frequently 
mentioned as candidates for financial conglomerates include 
Shinhan Bank, Coryo Securities Daishin Securities, Korea Life 
Insurance and Tongyang Securities.

  [Text] Labour protests used to be rare in Indonesia under 
President Suharto. Jobs were in great demand and people who had 
them worked uncomplainingly. Labour unions existed, but they 
were never instruments of agitation unlike in the old days of 
the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Industrial peace helped 
the government attract foreign investments, which in turn 
created economic growth and generated more jobs. The net effect 
was that workers in Indonesia gained from greater prosperity, 
which has been a hallmark of Mr. Suharto's rule, especially in 
the last 10 years. But prosperity leads to rising expectations 
and the mood of Indonesian labour has changed in recent years. 
Workers are increasingly aware of their rights. They demand 
better wages and are now less inhibited about agitating for 
better working conditions. Interestingly, the rising militancy 
of Indonesian workers coincides with a new United States policy 
this year to advance the cause of workers worldwide by insisting 
on minimum working conditions. Against Indonesia, the U.S. has 
threatened to suspend concessions under the Generalised System 
of Preferences (GSP) unless Jakarta improves working conditions 
for its 80-million workforce. As if in response to such 
pressure, the Indonesian Government announced that from Jan. 1 
this year the legal minimum daily wage would be raised from 
3,000 rupiah to 3,800 rupiah for Jakarta and its outskirts. 
  Demanding better working conditions is legitimate for 
workers 
anywhere. But it becomes a problem when the demands are out of 
step with reality or are externally inspired with little regard 
for domestic conditions. 
  Worse, it becomes tragic when frustrations arising from 
unfulfilled expectations turn political. Sadly, this appears to 
have been the case in Medan. Medan workers, at the prodding of 
the independent union, the SBSI [Serikat Buruh Setiakawan 
Indonesia or Indonesian Solidarity Trade Union], agitated for 
minimum daily wages to be raised by 100 percent from 3,100 
rupiah to 7,000 rupiah -- twice the minimum daily wage in 
Jakarta. When the demand could not be met, the workers went on 
a rampage and turned it into an anti-Chinese riot. In 
Indonesia, it is easy to turn mob aggression into a protest with 
ethnic overtones. The authorities deserve credit for acting 
swiftly to contain the situation. 
  Indonesia does not need troubles like this. Riots and 
protests drive businesses and investors away -- and this Jakarta 
simply cannot afford. Two million new workers join the labour 
force each year. For them to find jobs, entrepreneurs and 
businesses must feel comfortable about sinking their capital 
into Indonesian soil. It will be foolish to expect them to do 
so if the country lacks a sense of stability and security. And 
if they don't invest, there will be no economic growth and no 
job creation. As the Indonesian authorities act to stabilise 
the situation, it is crucial that the Medan incident be seen in 
perspective. Investors should feel assured that the protest was 
more a single incident of labour unrest, not a racial riot. 
Indonesian workers ought to realise that mindless rioting is 
not the way to solve their problems. In fact, it only makes 
things worse. Last but not least, the U.S. needs to see the 
danger of blindly imposing its labour standards on others. The 
Medan riot has shown just how explosive this can be.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae declared Friday that the government would never allow 
the formation of a private grouping within the military. 
  The declaration was contained in Yi's ministerial command 
letter No. 3 to commanders and staff officers of brigades and 
above. The missive was entitled "Solidarity and Harmony for 
Stability of the Armed Forces." 
  The regular personnel reshuffle carried out earlier this 
month involving top Army posts has rooted out "the problems 
related to private organizations," the defense minister said. 
  Yi was referring to the April 16 shake-up in which eight 
Army 
generals who belonged to "Hana-hoe," a private organization, 
were forced to retire. 
  Hana-hoe, formed by former President Cho Tu-hwan and his 
group of Army officers, was instrumental in catapulting Cho into 
power by helping to stage "a coup d'etat-like" action on Dec. 
12, 1979, following the assassination of President Park Chung-he. 
  A kind of old-boy network, Hana-hoe reportedly wielded great 
power within the military and meddled in the nation's politics 
under the administrations of former Army generals. 
  But Kim Yong-sam, who was inaugurated as the country's first 
civilian president in February last year, has systematically 
purged politically minded members of Hana-hoe and other private 
organizations in the military. 
  In his letter, Yi said, "if anyone was found to have formed 
or attempted to form a private organization, he would 
immediately be picked out and expelled from the Armed Forces. 
  "This basic principle will be applied to all forms of 
private 
organizations," he added. 
  All commanders, therefore, should carry out their duties 
lest 
any private organization hamper the solidarity or reduce the 
combat capabilities of the Armed Forces. 
  Officers should make no further attempts to create a private 
group. Even the term "private organization" should not be 
mentioned in the military, Yi emphasized. 
  He said all officers, including those who once belonged to 
private groups, should employ their abilities fully to serve the 
country and their fellow Koreans. 
  Noting that talk about creating a private organization 
always 
stems from unfair promotion practices, Yi said promotions must 
be based on an officer's ability as seen from three viewpoints 
-- those of commanders, fellow officers and subordinates.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Tuesday the country should launch sweeping rural 
development programs upon the inauguration of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) next year. 
  "We should depart from the old-fashioned view of agriculture 
being a declining primary industry," he said. "We should 
instead establish a new future-oriented perception that 
agriculture is a developing secondary or tertiary food industry." 
  While talking with the members of the Rural Development 
Committee, a presidential advisory organ, at Chongwadae 
[presidential office], the president said it is especially 
important to improve educational, medical, cooperative and 
marketing systems in the rural areas. 
  The Rural Development Committee reported to the president a 
set of programs being planned to improve rural conditions. 
  Also on Tuesday, President Kim met nine American promoters 
of 
a Korean war memorial program. The visitors included William 
Livesey, one-time commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea. The 
visitors said they were promoting the construction of a large 
Korean- and Vietnam- war memorial education center in 
Pennsylvania. 
  "I hope the projected education center will become a 
significant space helpful to enhancing friendship between the 
peoples of Korea and the United States," President Kim said.

  [Text] The government delegation led by Samdech Hun Sen, 
second prime minister, and his wife arrived in the Takeo 
provincial capital at 0940 on (?21) April for a two-day working 
visit. 
  Accompanying the delegation were His Excellency [H.E.] (Sok 
An), co-minister of the Council of Ministers' Office; H.E. Mok 
Maret, state secretary for environment; H.E. Nhim Vanda, [words 
indistinct] and adviser to the second prime minister; and the 
excellencies [words indistinct]. 
  Attending the welcoming ceremony were H.E. So Phirun, 
governor of Takeo Province, and his wife; as well as the 
excellencies deputy provincial governor, ministerial and 
department officials, and governors of various districts in 
Takeo Province. 
  During its stay in Takeo Province, the government delegation 
led by Samdech Hun Sen attended a get-together with the 
provincial officials at the provincial hall. 
  H.E. So Phirun reported on the political, economic, 
security, 
and social situation by stressing the outcome of last year's 
rice production. According to the report, last year the 
peasants in Takeo Province planted over (?164,000) hectares of 
rainy season rice [words indistinct] and produced over 
(?147,800) metric tons of rice. The failure to fulfill the 
production plan was caused by flooding and [words indistinct]. 
As for the dry season rice, the province could plant only 
49,000 hectares yielding only 48,000-odd metric tons. As 
farming is the only industry in the province, H.E. So Phirun 
stressed that judging from the total yield, the province might 
suffer a consumption shortfall of 19,800 metric tons of rice 
this year. 
  At the same time, the province has repaired and built 
irrigation networks for agriculture by implementing the water 
methods in the Sangkum Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's popular Socialist 
Party] era. 
  [words indistinct] electricity, water, and [words 
indistinct] 
Route 2 stretching from the provincial town to the border. 
  Speaking on that occasion, Samdech Hun Sen conveyed the best 
regards from the king, the prince first prime minister, and the 
royal government to the administrators and people in Takeo 
Province. 
  He discussed various issues, especially the royal 
government's policy toward the Democratic Kampuchean group. The 
samdech [words indistinct] a law to declare the Khmer Rouge [KR] 
to be rebels. This is an appropriate measure since the 
government has kept its door open to the Khmer Rouge for quite a 
long time, but they have failed to respond. Moreover, they have 
even committed destructive crimes and caused insecurity in the 
country. So far, the royal government has practiced restraint 
by adhering to the principle of national reconciliation in line 
with the king's lofty aspirations. But now, the royal 
government can no longer tolerate their actions. 
  Concerning the relations between Thailand and the Khmer 
Rouge, the second prime minister said that Thailand has always 
given full support to the Khmer Rouge in opposing the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC] and the Cambodian people. 
  The samdech added that the king has always supported the 
National Assembly and the RGC because the two [words indistinct] 
organizations were born from the Cambodian people and are legal 
entities. 
  Concerning development work in Takeo Province, Samdech Hun 
Sen said that the province has important potential for 
investment [passage indistinct].

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Is It an Appeal or a Threat?"] </F>
  [Text] According to AFP, Thailand has recently proposed a 
meeting of ASEAN representatives in Thailand next week to 
discuss a conflict with Cambodia which is apparently becoming 
ceaselessly more and more serious and which seems to be slipping 
toward the edge of a ravine. Thai Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri said Thailand will (?listen to) the ASEAN 
representatives' opinions on the (?dispute) at a meeting, which 
will prepare for an ASEAN ministerial meeting in (?June), to be 
held in Bangkok next week. 
  Moreover, a report from Bangkok said Prasong on 18 April 
appealed to diverse countries or outsiders to stop supplying 
armaments and ammunition to Cambodia, saying the military aid 
would further inflame the conflict between the Phnom Penh 
government and Khmer Rouge rebels. The Thai foreign minister 
also told reporters in Bangkok that the aid was not (?an 
approach) to solving the problem. He added that various 
countries and outsiders appear to be bringing more violence to 
Cambodia on top of the existing conflict. 
  It is wondered whether Pasong Sunsiri's [words indistinct] 
statement contradicts the accusation by the Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC] about Thailand's recent support for the Khmer 
Rouge -- support that is contrary to Thailand's pledge made 
during Chuan Likphai's visit to Cambodia -- and that Thailand 
supports the Cambodian government, not the Khmer Rouge. 
  According to the 19 April issue of Thailand's THE NATION, 
Thai Army Chief General Wimon Wongwanit has issued an indignant 
threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand can no 
longer maintain a good relationship [words indistinct], 
referring to Phnom Penh's accusing Thailand of helping Khmer 
Rouge leaders. 
  Wimon added that between human beings, true friendship is 
very important, and so it is with international relations. 
Without sincerity, there can be no friendship. He further said 
that [word indistinct] without Thailand as a true friend, 
Cambodia would certainly be in trouble. 
  Observers wonder why, since the Cambodian Government 
occupied 
the Khmer Rouge's important bases along the border, Thailand has 
never expressed support for the occupation or denounced the 
Khmer Rouge. It has only done things, such as the recent 
repatriation of 25,000 Cambodian refugees in violation of human 
rights, that appear to be opposed to victories by the RGC and 
opposed to international organizations. Analysts are anxious 
about the conflict, which is becoming more and more serious. 
  As for the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has always wanted peace 
and friendship. It is also grateful to its friends for their 
understanding. We wholeheartedly welcome (?Thai) friends, but 
not those having a vested interest. The Cambodian people have 
never practiced the policy of catching a fish with two hands.

  [Text] The problem of the Vietnamese war refugees at Chrey 
Thom [Kandal Province] has become an issue worth considering. 
According to the refugees, the Vietnamese who fled from the 
Khmer Rouge's massacre around Boeng Tonle Sap Lake last year and 
who have gathered in Chrey Thom at the Cambodian-Vietnamese 
border with more than 1,000 boats, now number about 10,000. 
Nevertheless, according to the figure of the Kandal Provincial 
Research Commission, when the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
toured the area on 20 April 1994, the number of those refugees 
remained only 5,000. So where were almost half of other ethnic 
Vietnamese? 
  Answering this question, the Vietnamese displaced persons 
said: It is not difficult for those wanting to leave Chrey Thom. 
The easiest way for them is to sell their boats, then leave the 
area. According to local informed sources, those leaving this 
place have returned to their birthplace around Boeng Tonle Sap 
Lake; they claim that they were born in Cambodia. 
  The cause of the Vietnamese refugees' continued departure 
from Chrey Thom without permission from the Cambodian 
authorities is that they can no longer live in hardship there. 
A great many ethnic Vietnamese in the area said: The remaining 
Vietnamese refugees will leave in next three months if there is 
no solution to their problem from the Cambodian Government . 
  Their departure implies that they demand to return to their 
old places. According to this argument, there are two problems 
worth being considered: 
  1. The departure from the Chrey Thom area without law 
supporting those refugees: The departure appears to be 
evidence of the government's incapability to administer 
foreigners living in Cambodia. This sufficiently shows that the 
government's immigration law to be promulgated in the near 
future will encounter difficulties in their implementation. 
Because the ethnic Vietnamese continue to insist that their 
real birthplace is in Cambodia and because some of them even 
have identity cards as proof. 
  2. When the government's immigration law has not yet been 
issued, the Vietnamese war refugees should not be allowed to 
come, leave, or act at will. It is reported that they can 
travel wherever as they please and that their presence in the 
area is just for receiving meager assistance from humanitarian 
organizations. Now and then they go about doing their business 
in Vietnam or in Phnom Penh. There is another group of 
Vietnamese who do not yet have proof that they were born in 
Cambodia have looked for ways to establish that their real 
birthplace is in Cambodia. Besides, in light of the event, it 
can be concluded that the area has not been under the control of 
the Cambodian authorities. If it is the case, this issue should 
be up for review.

  [Text] According to the Agriculture Ministry, more than 
138,100 hectares of dry-season rice, or over 86 percent of the 
planned target, has been planted nationwide by 4 April. 
Outstanding provinces and cities in the planting effort 
included Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng, and Kompong Cham Provinces. 
  The report also said that during this 1993-1994 dry season, 
our peasants planted 7,900 hectares of rice fewer than in the 
previous year. Many factors, such as [words indistinct] and 
late and prolonged harvest of rainy-season rice, delayed this 
year's dry-season rice planting. 
  During the same period, over 50,000 hectares of dry-season 
rice were harvested nationwide and the average yield was about 
two metric tons per hectare.

  [Text] According to reports from Seoul, U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry made a junket [haenggak] to South Korea from 19 
to 21 April. 
  Perry's junket to South Korea was a junket of war to 
examine, 
on the spot, how their plan of a war of Northward aggression had 
been carried out and give new instructions to the puppets. 
  During the junket, Perry met with traitor Kim Yong-sam, 
puppet Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, and puppet Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu respectively, held one military confab 
[kunsajok moui] after another, mapped out vicious plans 
[hyunggye] to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise 
before the end of this year, build up the U.S.-South Korea 
combined forces, strengthen the cooperation system, and pursue 
the UN Security Council sanctions [jeje] against the North. 
This is an unforgivable criminal act to bring the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to a crisis phase and cause a very 
dangerous situation.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Defense Secretary's Trip to South Korea Denounced" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
condemn the U.S. defense secretary's visit to South Korea as a 
war trip intended to unleash another war on the Korean 
peninsula, an aggressive trip to increase the military 
dependence of South Korea and a trip of plunder for fleecing the 
South Korean people through arms sale. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst, commenting on the war confabs Perry 
and the Kim Yong-sam group held with a view to doing harm to the 
DPRK, says: 
  Raving that the North would "invade the South" if sanctions 
are taken by the United Nations, the U.S. defense secretary 
described their military step as one intended to prevent it and 
made quite a noise as if it were the DPRK, not the United 
States, that violated the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions. 
  This is a jargon that could be uttered only by such 
warmaniacs as Perry who are accustomed to justifying their moves 
of aggression and war. It is the United States, not the DPRK, 
that failed to implement the agreed conclusions reached at the 
DPRK-USA contact in New York. 
  It goes without saying that the United States needed to mass 
its Armed Forces in South Korea, an alien land, only to provoke 
a war. 
  Perry decided to resume the "Team Spirit" war gamble with 
the 
puppets under unreasonable pretexts. This shows that they have 
no intention to seek a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue, 
and reveals his criminal intention to take the road of military 
adventure after massing U.S. Armed Forces on the Korean 
peninsula on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue". Before 
setting foot in South Korea Perry sent Apache helicopters and 
Patriot missiles, and when he met with the puppets he pressured 
them to purchase heavy weapons of the United States, pressing 
home the need to build up the combat power of the U.S. forces 
and the puppet Army. 
  It is the intention of the United States to rake up colossal 
profits by forcing them to open not only the rice market but 
even the arms market of South Korea. 
  All this proves that the United States unilaterally 
discarded 
the Korean Armistice Agreement that prohibits the introduction 
of arms into South Korea for a war and the DPRK-USA joint 
statement on refraining from a nuclear threat to the DPRK and 
that the South Korean puppets nullified the North-South joint 
declaration on denuclearization that bans the introduction, 
deployment and production of nuclear weapons and are openly 
racing headlong along the road of war against the fellow 
countrymen. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are 
recklessly trying to stifle the DPRK with "strength", but it is 
a miscalculation. 
  The United States must know clearly that military pressure 
or 
"sanctions" cannot work with the DPRK. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets 
finally 
push the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase 
of war, they would be unable to escape a thousand-fold blow. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the aggressors and the 
traitors must act not rashly but prudently, clearly mindful of 
what tragic consequences their war frenzy would bring to them.

  [Text] According to a report in the U.S. paper THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL, cited by the South Korean KBS-1 radio, the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous nation-selling clique agreed with the U.S. 
authorities to purchase Apache offensive helicopters, anti-tank 
missiles, and other ultramodern weapons from the United States. 
  The puppet authorities will soon start purchasing weapons 
and 
when these weapons are brought into South Korea, the puppet 
Army's arms buildup plan, pushed for by the Kim Yong-sam group 
under instigation of the U.S. imperialists, will be completed 
ahead of schedule. 
  Reporting this, the paper revealed that the issue of 
purchasing U.S. military equipment was stressed during the talks 
between U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who made a junket to Seoul 
a few days ago, and puppet high-ranking officials.

  [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists 
conducted aerial mobile deployment exercises on 21 April by 
flying various aircraft, including fighter-bomber planes loaded 
with nuclear weapons, to South Korea from its overseas bases. 
  On 21 April, some 10 fighter-bomber planes, pursuit-assault 
planes, and vertical take-off and landing attack planes loaded 
with nuclear weapons took off from Okinawa and Yokosuka bases in 
Japan for deployment to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South 
Korea. The frantic war exercise was aimed at evaluating a speedy 
deployment to the Korean peninsula and actual fighting 
deployment capabilities. 
  On the other hand, on 20 April, KC-135 refueling planes flew 
from overseas bases over the sea off Kunsan, South Korea, and 
were frenzied with war fever by refueling tens of fighter-bomber 
planes and pursuit-assault planes, which were running wild in 
night aerial war exercises, from 1900 [1000 GMT] to 2200 [1300 
GMT]. 
  On 21 April, the South Korean puppets frantically exercised 
gun firing and helicopter sorties right in front of our nose 
near the DMZ. That day, 105-mm large-caliber artillery groups, 
which occupied firing positions in Naedae-ri, Chorwon County, 
Kangwon Province, and Magori, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province 
in South Korea, fired tens of bomb shells near the DMZ. The 
puppet Army's armed gangsters, which occupied combat positions 
in Yongsan-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and Kangsan-ri and 
Yangjae-ri, Chorwon County in the South Korean Kangwon Province, 
wielded a horrible war frenzy by randomly shooting some 1,000 
shots of large-caliber machine guns. 
  In addition, on the same day, the puppet Army's armed 
helicopters and transport helicopters ran wild in exercising 
ground support and air transport in the skies over areas 
adjacent to Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of the South Korean 
Kangwon Province. 
  The fire game commotion of the U.S. imperialists and South 
Korean puppets is further aggravating the war risk on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists committed a midnight aerial war exercise aimed at a 
surprise invasion of the North on 22 April. About 100 planes, 
including war planes, were mobilized from overseas bases, in 
addition to the fighter bombers, assault planes, observation 
planes, and reconnaissance planes affiliated to the U.S. Air 
Force occupying South Korea, were committed in this provocative 
war exercise. 
  This war exercise was carried out frantically from 2300 
[1400 
GMT] 21 April to 0400 [1900 GMT] 22 April in the skies over the 
areas of Osan, Yongwol, Kapyong, and Tongduchon. It was a 
dangerous playing with fire aimed at a nighttime preemptive 
strike on the strategic targets of the Northern half of the 
Republic. 
  The E-3 early-warning plane, which took off from Okinawa on 
22 April, made a double flight over the skies of Kangnung, 
Chunchon, and Tokchok Island. It was running amok in carrying 
out all-out plans and commanding the various types of plane 
units that were bustling about in exercises, such as bombing 
targets, giving ground support, and aerial war exercises. 
  As the aerial war exercise took place over a long period of 
time, a KC-135 refueling plane, which was already mobilized and 
deployed in South Korea from an overseas base, was mobilized 
over the skies off the coast of Kunsan and refueled scores of 
fighter bombers and assault planes participating in the war 
exercise. Thus, this instigated an atmosphere of war. 
  Also on this day, a RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane 
that took off from Kadena base in Okinawa flew into South Korea 
and flew over the areas of Pochon, Inje, and Kojin for a long 
period of time. Thus, it committed an act of taking aerial 
photographs and electronic reconnaissance of the overall regions 
of the Northern half of the Republic. 
  Over 500 war planes and 15 reconnaisance planes of various 
types aimed at invading the North were running amok in the 
aerial war exercise and espionage acts over the skies of South 
Korea on 22 April alone. 
  The frantic commotion of playing with fire being committed 
day after day by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets aimed at the Northern half of the Republic is driving 
the condition on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous situation.

Kapyong and Tongduchon of South Korea on April 22 under ohe 
command of an E-3 early warning plane by mobilizing warplanes 
based overseas and fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation

an aerial photographing and electronic espionage on the whole 
area of the Northern half of Korea, making a long-hour flight 
above Pochon, Inje and Kojin. 
  More than 500 warplanes and 15 reconnaissance planes were 
flown in the aerial warfare exercise and espionage directed 
against the North in the sky above South Korea on April 22. 
  On April 21, the South Korean puppets fired scores of shells 
and over 1,000 large-calibre machine-gun bullets in Chorwon 
County, South Korean Kangwon Province, Hyonchon and Paju 
Counties, Kyonggi Province. And helicopter gunships and 
transport helicopters of the puppet Army staged ground support 
and airlifting exercises in the air above Pochon and Yonchon, 
and Chorwon, South Korean Kangwon Province. 
  The unending war games of the U.S. imperialists and the 
South 
Korean puppets are increasing the danger of war on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, as soon as 
warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry left Seoul after hatching 
a war plot, the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique announced a plan 
to stage the Hwarang war exercise in which some 130,000 puppet 
military personnel, police officers, and reserve forces will be 
mobilized. The war exercise will take place from 25 April for 
five consecutive days and will be held in Inchon and areas of 
Kyonggi Province adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line. In 
order to instigate hostility and distrust within the nation and 
heighten antagonism toward the Northern half of the Republic 
among the South Korean residents, the puppet clique added a 
drill of countering so-called spy infiltration.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The traitorous Kim 
Yong-sam clique on April 22 announced a plan of "Hwarang" war 
exercises involving the puppet Army, police and "homeland 
reserve force", more than 1.3 million strong, according to a 
radio report from Seoul. 
  The 5-day exercises will begin on April 25 with Inchon and 
Kyonggi Province adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line as 
the theatre. 
  The facts clearly prove once again that the traitorous Kim 
Yong-sam clique is trying to find a way out of the crisis in the 
provocation of a war against the North, following in the 
footsteps of the preceding military fascist dictators. The fact 
that the plan of a massive war game was declared right after the 
powder-reeking trip to Seoul of the U.S. defense secretary fully 
reveals that the criminal tour was aimed at egging the puppet 
clique on to provoke another war against the North.

  [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, on 22 April, 
puppet Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang tendered his resignation to 
the Chongwadae [presidential office] after serving only four 
months in office. Stunned, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
denounced his act as irresponsible. 
  In the meantime, opposition Democratic Party leader Yi 
Ki-taek, who is visiting the United States, held an emergency 
news conference regarding the resignation of the puppet prime 
minister and demanded the resignation of the entire puppet 
cabinet in the wake of the puppet prime minister's resignation. 
He expressed a strong opposition to the fact that traitor Kim 
Yong-sam has designated Yi Yong-tok, current deputy prime 
minister and unification minister, as the new puppet prime 
minister, and revealed that he will vote in the National 
Assembly against Yi Yong-tok as the new puppet prime minister. 
  The puppet prime minister's surprising resignation clearly 
shows that the Kim Yong-sam regime is floundering in an impasse 
it created itself while committing flunkeyist traitorous acts.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of 
Korea (GFTUK) in a statement today denounced the South Korean 
authorities's negative stand toward the DPRK's proposal for the 
convocation of a national conference and urged them to look 
straight at the nation's aspirations and respond to the proposal. 
  Noting that the South Korean authorities showed a negative 
response to the proposal, saying "a conference oriented toward 
political propaganda is undesirable", the spokesman says this 
fully reveals their true color as flunkeyist traitors trying to 
plunge the nation into the scourge of war in league with outside 
forces, instead of sitting at a negotiating table with fellow 
countrymen to solve the question of national reunification 
independently. 
  He said, "Our working class and the whole nation can never 
tolerate the criminal moves of the Kim Yong-sam group which is 
taking the extremely dangerous road to a nuclear war in league 
with outside forces, disregarding the proposal for the 
convocation of a national conference which was prompted by our 
warm love of the nation and the stand of national independence 
to bridge over the present difficulties and open a broad avenue 
for reunification through the great unity of the nation." 
  "The South Korean authorities must immediately remove the 
checkbar which they dropped on the road ahead of the political 
parties, organizations and personages of broad strata in South 
Korea intending to participate in a national conference," the 
spokesman said. 
  He called upon all the workers and other sections of people 
of South Korea to actively turn out in a patriotic struggle for 
the convocation of a national conference which would open up a 
short cut to reunification in the '90s.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
group, in its fascist violence on April 20, walked away some 150 
students affiliated with the South Korean Federation of General 
Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) who broke into the puppet 
Defense Ministry building and denounced William Perry's South 
Korean trip and brutally suppressed the struggle of students in 
Seoul and Kwangju against Perry's visit and deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  The students' struggle this time can never be a target of 
suppression. It displayed their patriotic will to defend the 
wellbeing and dignity of the nation against the aggression and 
war policy of outside forces. 
  The object of overthrow is the Kim Yong-sam group bent on 
igniting a war and plunging the nation into a nuclear holocaust 
in league with outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group invited Perry to South Korea, begged 
for "sanctions" against the North and reinforcement of the U.S. 
forces and an "early deployment" of latest-type military 
equipment in South Korea. 
  The patriotic students courageously turned out in the 
struggle against Perry's war trip because the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppet clique were scheming to impose the 
disaster of a nuclear war on the nation. Nevertheless, the 
Kim Yong-sam group, far from turning an ear to the just demand 
of students and people, wielded the sword at the patriotic 
students. What a disgusting and despicable act of a pro-U.S., 
flunkeyist traitor and warhawk it is. 
  The valiant struggle of the South Korean students who 
ardently desire peace and reunification is supported and praised 
by the whole nation now. 
  Their righteous struggle and patriotic spirit can by no 
means 
be blocked or broken with anything. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which is resorting to 
treacheries, clinging to the coattails of outside forces, 
estranged from the fellow countrymen, cannot evade judgement by 
the nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held at the 6,000-seat theatre of the February 8 House of 
Culture today to mark the 62nd anniversary of the founding of 
the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA] (April 25, 1932). 
  A portrait of the great leader President Kim Il-song was 
placed on the platform of the meeting hall. 
  The meeting was attended by KPA Marshal O Chin-u, Presidium 
member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], first vice-chairman of the 
National Defence Commission of the DPRK, member of the party 
Central Military Commission and minister of People's Armed 
Forces; Vice-President Pak Song-chol who is Politburo member of 
the C.C., the WPK; and other senior party and government 
officials and officers and men of the Korean People's Army and 
working people in the city. 
  Members of delegations and visiting groups of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] staying in 
the socialist homeland were also present. 
  Military attaches of foreign embassies here were invited to 
the meeting. 
  Vice Marshal of the KPA Kim Kwang-chin, member of the 
National Defence Commission of the DPRK, made a report at the 
meeting. 
  The reporter recalled that the cause of building 
revolutionary Armed Forces in Korea was started [by] the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and has been promoted constantly 
under the leadership of the party and the leader along with the 
victorious advance of the revolutionary cause of chuche. 
  When he was hewing the path of the Korean revolution, 
Comrade 
Kim Il-song deeply analysed the historical lessons of the 
anti-Japanese national-liberation movement of Korea and put 
forward the policy of organising an armed struggle against 
Japanese imperialism and building a genuine revolutionary Armed 
Forces to that end. 
  Basing himself on the solid political and military 
foundation 
he had laid through his energetic efforts to carry out the 
policy, he founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army on 
April 25, 1932 and proclaimed the founding of the revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Korea to the world. 
  The reporter pointed out that over the past 60 odd years, 
the 
revolutionary Armed Forces of Korea have traversed a proud 
course of victory through a rigorous and arduous struggle and 
performed immortal feats which will shine long in the history of 
the country by their heroic struggle. 
  The reporter quoted Comrade Kim Chong-il, respected supreme 
commander, as saying: 
  "Our People's Army has waged a heroic struggle to safeguard 
the party and the leader and defend the motherland and gains of 
revolution and performed great exploits for the party and the 
revolution." 
  Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened the Korean People's 
Revolutionary Army into the regular Korean People's Army in a 
short period after the liberation of the country, drawing on the 
noble traditions of building revolutionary Armed Forces which 
had been established during the anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle. 
  The invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in 
the 
fatherland liberation war. 
  In the great fatherland liberation war, the KPA officers and 
men inflicted a disgraceful defeat on the U.S. imperialist 
aggressors, who had boasted of being the "mightiest" in the 
world, and honorably defended the independence of the country 
and the sovereignty of the nation, giving full play to mass 
heroism and unexcelled self-sacrificing spirit. 
  The reporter noted that the KPA has entered a new historical 
period in its development under the outstanding and tested 
leadership of Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and that a 
radical progress has taken place in all spheres of Army building. 
  The entire ranks of the KPA are filled with the 
death-defying 
resolution to remain loyal with a single heart to the party's 
leadership in whatever storm and stress and become a fortress 
and shield to defend the respected comrade supreme commander. 
  Under his leadership, the KPA has grown to be a unit of 
loyal 
combatants ready to dedicate their lives for the party and the 
leader and a strong Army equipped with powerful means of both 
attack and defence, each man of which is a match for a hundred 
foes. 
  Along with the KPA, the combat capabilities of the 
worker-peasant red guards and the young red guards have been 
strengthened considerably, all people are armed and the whole 
country has been consolidated as an impregnable fortress. 
  We can say confidently that as long as we have the 
invincible 
revolutionary Armed Forces and the all-people defence system 
with the KPA as the core, we can destroy any aggressors and 
firmly defend the cause of the party, the cause of socialism. 
  The noble achievements and imperishable exploits of our 
revolutionary Armed Forces are a brilliant victory of the 
chuche-based military idea of Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade 
Kim Chong-il and results of the outstanding and tested guidance 
of the party and the leader. 
  Referring to the grave situation created on the Korean 
peninsula by the reckless military threats and war moves of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, the 
reporter declared: 
  We will never look at it with folded arms. 
  Although the U.S. imperialists and the international 
reactionaries are desperately trying to isolate and stifle the 
DPRK and destroy Korean socialism over the "nuclear issue," no 
amount of pressure and threat can frighten our people and no 
strong arm and attempt to stifle the DPRK can work on us. 
  Our people are a people of decision who do not like an empty 
talk but mean what they say. 
  It is our unshakable position to answer dialogue with 
dialogue, and war with war. 
  Our people who cherish the independence of the nation and 
peace of the country do not want a war but will not beg for 
peace while leaving their dignity violated. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and their followers unleash a war 
in 
Korea, going against the trend of the times, our people and 
People's Army will fight it out for the party and the leader and 
for our socialist motherland which has been defended at the cost 
of blood, wipe out the aggressors to the last man and 
demonstrate the stamina of heroic Korea once again.

<F P=106> [`Commemorative report' by Comrade Kim Kwang-chin, member of </F>
DPRK National Defense Commission and Vice Marshal of Korean 
People's Army, KPA, marking 62d anniversary of the founding of 
the KPA at the 8 February Hall of Culture in Pyongyang -- live] 
  [Text] [applause] Comrades, today when all the people and 
soldiers of the People's Army are effecting a new upsurge in 
production and construction, while firmly defending the 
socialist fatherland by upholding the militant appeal of the 
party and the leader [suryong] and with single-hearted unity 
under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance, we are 
significantly commemorating the 62d anniversary of the founding 
of the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA]. 
  Marking the KPA founding anniversary -- a felicitous 
revolutionary day -- I warmly congratulate the courageous 
officers and men of the KPA and the Korean People's Security 
Forces, who are firmly defending the defense line of the 
fatherland by cherishing a lofty sense of loyalty to the party 
and to the revolution, in the name of the Political Bureau of 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and of the 
Central Military Commission of the party, under the 
authorization of the respected comrade supreme commander. 
[applause] 
  I also express the lofty sense of reverence to the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and to the patriotic 
fighters of the People's Army, who dedicated their precious 
lives for independence and liberation of the fatherland, for 
freedom of the people, for the party and for the revolution. 
[applause] 
  I extend warm congratulations to the old anti-Japanese 
fighters, old war veterans, disabled soldiers, and discharged 
soldiers, who registered heroic feats in the arduous 
anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and in the great fatherland 
liberation war and who are continuously blooming the 
revolutionary flowers of the socialist construction today. 
[applause] 
  I send warm greetings to all people who are vigorously 
struggling to defend, protect, and glorify the popular 
mass-centered socialism of our own style in firm unity with the 
party and the leader and who love and sincerely help the 
People's Army as if they are their own offspring. [applause] 
  Comrades, more than 60 years have passed since our people 
founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army [KPRA] -- their 
first revolutionary armed forces -- to achieve the cause of 
national liberation by upholding the banner of the chuche idea. 
At this significant occasion of commemorating the 62d 
anniversary of the founding of the KPA today, we are recalling 
with deep emotion the path of honorable struggle along which our 
revolutionary armed forces have traversed and their immortal 
achievements. 
  The cause of independence and the cause of socialism of the 
popular masses are carried out in a fierce confrontation and 
struggle against the imperialists and all sorts of 
reactionaries, and these causes can be carried out successfully 
by the armed support of the revolutionary armed forces. The 
country and people without their mighty revolutionary armed 
forces cannot defend the fatherland and the revolution from the 
imperialists' aggression, nor can they victoriously advance the 
cause of socialism. 
  The cause of building the revolutionary armed forces in our 
country was pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
and it was continuously deepened and developed by the victorious 
advance of the chuche revolutionary cause. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy on 
building genuine revolutionary armed forces to organize and 
improve the armed struggle against the Japanese imperialists 
based on his deep insight into the historical lesson of our 
country's anti-Japanese movement for national liberation learned 
during the period he pioneered the course of the Korean 
revolution. This was a revolutionary policy purporting that the 
Korean revolution must be carried out by the Korean people 
themselves. It was an original policy that opened a new road 
for the anticolonial war for national liberation and for the 
building of the revolutionary armed forces. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the KPRA on 25 
April 1932 based on a strong political and military foundation, 
which he himself provided through his energetic struggle to 
realize his policy on building the revolutionary armed forces, 
and proclaimed the founding of our revolutionary armed forces to 
the entire world. [applause] 
  The founding of the KPRA was a magnificent birth of true 
chuche-type revolutionary armed forces in our country. It was a 
historic event that brought forth a momentous turning point in 
our people's anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation and 
in the development of their communist movement. [applause] 
  With the founding of the KPRA, our people could victoriously 
wage the struggle, on a new higher plane, for the independence 
of the country and the liberation of the people with their 
genuine revolutionary armed forces. This was the very starting 
point of the glorious history of our revolutionary armed forces. 
Our revolutionary armed forces have traversed a proud 
victorious road for the past six decades through the blaze of 
the stern and arduous struggle. With their heroic struggle, our 
revolutionary armed forces have made immortal achievements that 
will shine long in the history of the country. [applause] 
  The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has noted: Our People's Army has waged a heroic 
struggle to defend the party and the leader and to defend the 
gains of the country and the revolution and has made great 
accomplishments for the party and the revolution. The KPRA, 
which was the first rank of our revolutionary armed forces, had 
to wage a bloody struggle against the strong imperialist enemy 
right from the time of its founding. The anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle was the most glorious revolutionary war 
in which our revolutionary armed forces defeated powerful 
imperialists, fighting with them over a protracted period of 
time under unprecedented arduous and grim conditions. 
  During the severe anti-Japanese revolutionary war, when 
there was no rear area of the nation or support from regular 
armed forces, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song victoriously 
organized and led the KPRA while solving difficult and complex 
problems raised in the course of implementing the general Korean 
revolution, including the armed struggle, in an original way 
based on a chuche- oriented position. [applause] 
  The KPRA men fully demonstrated the revolutionary Army's 
militant power everywhere by using chuche-oriented hit-and-run 
tactics under the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
extraordinary military and political leadership. At last, our 
revolutionary armed forces smashed the Japanese imperialist 
aggressors and brilliantly achieved the historic cause of 
liberalizing the fatherland by carrying out the heroic struggle 
for 15 years while overcoming various trials beyond man's 
imagination. [applause] 
  During the fortitude anti-Japanese struggle, the 
single-hearted unity of revolutionary ranks around the leader 
[suryong] was achieved, vivid models of the faithfulness of 
upholding the leader [yongdoja] were created, and our party's 
brilliant revolutionary traditions were firmly prepared. These 
are deep and stout roots of our party and Army, as well as an 
eternal footstone that guarantees the victory of our revolution. 
[applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened and 
developed the KPRA into the regular armed forces, KPA, in a 
short period following the liberalization, based on the 
revolutionary armed forces' valuable traditions prepared in the 
period of the anti-Japanese struggle. The KPA, the direct 
descendant of the KPRA, has been strengthened and developed into 
modern, regular armed forces and has excellently fulfilled its 
honorable mission in defending our party's cause. The 
invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in the 
fatherland liberation war, which was a great revolutionary war 
in which our people defended their fatherland after defeating 
[tasung] the U.S. imperialists, the head of world imperialism, 
for the first time in history by carrying out the heroic 
all-people struggle. 
  While saddling himself with the heavy burden for both the 
front and the rear in the severe period of the life-and-death 
war -- decisive to the destiny of the fatherland -- the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song united the entire party, the entire 
Army, and all the people as one and organized and mobilized them 
to the sublime struggle to destroy the enemies, thus leading the 
fatherland liberation war to victory. [applause] 
  Upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's orders, the 
wise and brave soldiers of our Army, Navy, and Air Force rose as 
one and sagaciously fought to defend every inch of the 
fatherland at the cost of their blood, while bearing deep in 
mind their lofty mission for the fatherland the people. 
  Heroic feats of the People's Army officers and men, who 
guaranteed the victory in the war by destroying the enemy's 
tanks and warships with human bombs and by blocking the enemy's 
guns with their hearts on the field of fierce battle with the 
enemy, will be handed down forever with the history of the great 
fatherland liberation war. [applause] 
  During the period of the arduous war, all the people in the 
rear area, regardless of age or sex, rose and supported [wonho] 
the front line and ensured wartime production by defending their 
plants and villages. Thus, they made great contributions to the 
victory of the war. 
  Officers and men of our People's Army inflicted disgraceful 
defeat on the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who boasted being the 
strongest in the world, by demonstrating mass heroism and a 
sense of peerless sacrifice in the great fatherland liberation 
war. Thus, they honorably defended independence of the 
fatherland and sovereignty of the people. [applause] 
  Our people, who rose in a just fight against an armed 
invasion of the imperialists, won active support and 
encouragement from hundreds of millions of people in the world. 
In particular, the Chinese people, who carried out a common 
struggle against the Japanese imperialists for a long time, 
dispatched support forces under the slogan: "Resist America and 
aid Korea," and helped our people's struggle with their blood. 
Our people are always grateful to our friends for the sincere 
support and encouragement they extended to us during the most 
arduous period. We will never forget them. [applause] 
  Our people won victory in fights against the two most 
atrocious and strong imperialist powers in the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary war and in the fatherland liberation war. These 
victories were vigorous demonstrations of the might and 
invincibility of our revolutionary ranks, who are firmly rallied 
behind the party and the leader. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the 
self-defense military line for converting the entire Army into a 
cadre Army, for modernizing the entire Army, for arming all 
people, and for turning the whole country into a fortress, in 
conformity with the demand of the situation created after the 
war and of the development of our revolution. He also put 
forward the outstanding and unique line for advancing economic 
construction and national defense construction at the same time. 
He wisely led the struggle to implement the line. 
  With thorough implementation of the party's line, our 
People's Army has been strengthened to a 
one-a-match-for-one-hundred revolutionary armed forces, and our 
nation came to highly display its dignified appearance as a 
strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive socialist 
country. [applause] 
  The People's Army smashed every step of the enemy's constant 
aggression and war provocation maneuvers, and reliably defended 
the security of the nation and the people. Thus, the People's 
Army made a great contribution to construction projects for the 
nation's prosperity and the people's happiness. Whenever the 
revolution faced an arduous trial, our People's Army tenaciously 
defended and protected the party and the leader at the van of 
struggle, and actively carried to accomplishment the party's 
line and policy. 
  When the situation at home and abroad was complicated and 
difficult after the war, the People's Army firmly defended the 
party's cause with arms by upholding the slogan: "Let us defend 
with our lives the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim 
Il-song!" 
  At the same time, our People's Army displayed heroic feats 
in 
the great socialist construction by upholding the slogan of 
loyalty: "What the party decides, we will do!" Thus, it 
honorably fulfilled its mission as the Army of the leader, of 
the party, and of the people. [applause] 
  Indeed, the brilliant history of our people's revolution has 
been embroidered with proud feats of our revolutionary Armed 
Forces registered before the nation and people. The great 
creations built on the land of the fatherland contain precious 
blood and sweat of officers and men of the People's Army. Today 
our People's Army has entered a new historic period of its 
development by following the outstanding and refined leadership 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, and an epochal 
turn is being effected in all domains of building the Army. 
[applause] 
  Our comrade supreme commander, who directed great efforts 
to strengthen and develop the People's Army at an early date, 
put forward the outstanding line of building the Army and 
remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea in compliance with 
the new demand of development of the revolution, and 
energetically led the struggle to implement the line. The line 
of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea is the most 
just program for building the Army, which enables us to make 
officers and men of the People's Army genuine revolutionary 
vanguards who are unswervingly loyal to the party and to the 
leader and to provide reliable military insurance for the 
socialist cause by accomplishing the chuche-based cause for 
building the Army. [applause] 
  The line of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea 
has 
been vigorously accelerated under the outstanding leadership of 
the respected comrade supreme commander, and as a result, the 
chuche-based system of commanding the Army, under which the 
entire Army moves as one under the leadership of the party, has 
been firmly established within the People's Army. The chuche 
idea has been thoroughly embodied in all domains of building the 
Army and military activities, and single-hearted unity and 
tradition of loyalty have been brilliantly inherited. 
  Today all ranks of the People's Army are filled with 
death-defying determination to loyally uphold the leadership of 
the party, no matter what storm and trial may come forward, and 
to become a fortress and a shield to defend and protect the 
respected comrade supreme commander. [applause] 
  Our comrade supreme commander developed the chuche-oriented 
tactics in compliance with the demand of modern warfare and with 
the concrete conditions in our country, and wisely led us to 
build a powerful modern defense industry and to constantly 
strengthen combat capabilities and armed equipment of the 
People's Army. Under the leadership of the respected comrade 
supreme commander, our People's Army has been fostered to be a 
loyal combat unit capable of fighting for the party and the 
leader by dedicating its life and one-a-match-for-one-hundred 
strong Army with all sorts of powerful offensive and defensive 
means. Our revolutionary Armed Forces are upholding as their 
supreme commander the great general and great commander who has 
indomitable will and courage and outstanding strategy and 
alchemy. Herein lies the guarantee for all victories and for 
constant strengthening and developing of our revolutionary Armed 
Forces. [applause] 
  Together with the People's Army, combat capabilities of the 
Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guard have been 
remarkably strengthened, and all people have been armed and the 
whole country has been further consolidated as an impregnable 
fortress. 
  Our party's idea for military-people unity has been 
brilliantly embodied in the entire Army and whole society, and 
as a result, blood ties between the military and people have 
been further intensified at a new higher stage. As long as we 
have the revolutionary Armed Forces, which have been 
strengthened and developed into indomitable combat ranks, and as 
long as we have the all-people defense system with the People's 
Army as its center, we can smash any aggressor and firmly defend 
the party's cause -- the socialist cause. We can say this with 
confidence. [applause] 
  The party, the Army, and the people are firmly united as one 
with our comrade supreme commander -- the great military 
strategist and iron-willed sagacious commander -- as the center, 
and constitute a strong independent main force of the 
revolution. Therefore, our socialism is advancing victoriously 
without wavering even in the midst of violent upheaval. 
[applause] 
  This invincible might of our revolution was verified again 
through a severe trial last year. Last year's political and 
military confrontation between our people and the U.S. 
imperialists was a large battle without gunshots. It was also 
an all-people, life-and-death battle to protect our party and 
the socialist fatherland. 
  When the fatherland and the revolution faced a grave trial, 
our comrade supreme commander took the stern self-defensive 
measure of declaring a semi-war state of the entire nation, all 
the people, and the entire Army to cope with the then-prevailing 
situation. 
  After receiving the supreme commander's order from the 
bottom 
of their hearts, officers and men of the People's Army and all 
the people launched as one into the struggle to protect the 
country's sovereignty and revolutionary gains and honorably 
defended the dignity and safety of their socialist fatherland by 
smashing the enemy's challenge and aggression maneuver. This 
was a victory of our comrade supreme commander's extraordinary 
military strategies, braveness, and iron-firm faith and will as 
well as a great victory of the single-hearted unity of the 
leader, the party, and the masses. [applause] 
  The valuable achievements and immortal feats registered by 
our revolutionary Armed Forces were a brilliant victory of the 
chuche- oriented military ideology of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved supreme commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as the result of the outstanding 
and seasoned leadership of the party and the leader. [applause] 
  At this meaningful moment of commemorating the 62d 
anniversary of the founding of the KPA, I extend the greatest 
honor and the warmest gratitude, along with the boundless 
admiration and fervent loyalty of all people across the country 
and of the People's Army officers and men, to Comrade Kim 
Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, who 
founded our revolutionary Armed Forces at an early age and has 
led them along the single road of victory, thus greatly 
demonstrating the honor of our fatherland and our nation and 
building a firm military guarantee for the completion of the 
socialist cause in our country, and to the respected and beloved 
supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, an extraordinary 
military genius. [applause] 
  Comrades: 
  Today's situation for our revolution is very complicate and 
tense. We must build socialism amid fierce confrontation with 
the enemy and achieve the historic cause of national 
reunification. The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries have 
unprecedentedly strengthened anti-Republic maneuvers in order to 
isolate and crush our nation -- the stronghold of socialism -- 
on pretext of the so-called nuclear problem. By bringing 
numerous war means and troops into South Korea, they are leading 
the situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war 
while militarily threatening us. We should further strengthen 
the People's Army to accelerate the revolution and construction 
and to firmly defend the popular masses-oriented socialism of 
our own style under today's acute situation. 
  The might of the People's Army lies, above all, in its 
political and ideological superiority. We should intensify the 
party's political work in the People's Army so as to firmly arm 
all soldiers with the chuche idea and to make them resolute 
revolutionary fighters who do not hesitate in sacrificing their 
youth and lives for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and 
the people. 
  The endless loyalty to the party's leadership is the life of 
the People's Army. Officers and men of the People's Army should 
thoroughly establish a revolutionary military trait, with which 
the entire Army acts as one according to the supreme commander's 
order, and should make all ranks of the People's Army filled 
with the revolutionary, militant military spirit of working and 
living in conformity with the party's ideology and intent. 
[applause] 
  The ethos of unity between officers and men and between the 
party and society is an important content of the ideological 
superiority of the People's Army and lofty trait to be 
maintained by all soldiers. The officers and men of the People's 
Army should show the unity between the upper and lower levels, 
continue to highly display the ethos of unity between officers 
and men and between the party and society with which they help 
and lead each other, and further be possessed with lofty traits 
of a revolutionary army. 
  The political and ideological superiority of the People's 
Army can display its invincible might when it is combined with 
military and technological preparedness. In accordance with the 
party's military line of self-reliance, we should thoroughly 
implement the party's policy of turning the whole Army into an 
army of cadres, a modernized army, and continue to exert efforts 
to make all the people armored and fortify the entire country, 
thereby fortify the self-reliant national defense power that is 
able to resolutely defend and safeguard the popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style in any changing 
situation. [applause] 
  The People's Army should put emphasis on combat and 
political 
training as the fundamental task and thoroughly implement the 
training methods and principles presented by the party. All 
soldiers should be strongly armed with our party's military 
strategic ideology and chuche-motivated war method, foster them 
as one-a-match-for-a-hundred fighters with high combat 
efficiency suitable for modern war, and further reinforce the 
People's Army companies. Highly displaying the traditional 
ethos of army-people unity is important for strengthening the 
People's Army and completing the preparations for a combat. 
Only when the People's Army help the people--the people 
actively support the Army, and the Army and the people literally 
become harmoniously united--can the People's Army be 
strengthened and developed into a matchless rank and win the 
fights against the enemies. 
  Officers of the People's Army should maintain the spirit of 
devoted service for the fatherland and the people, and continue 
to demonstrate heroic feats in the struggle to build socialist 
economy and protect the people's lives and property. The people 
should establish social ethos that stresses military affairs, 
and love and sincerely support the People's Army as family. In 
this way, the Army and the people can firmly be prepared to 
fight as one sharing the destiny of life and death in the 
contingency. 
  The single-hearted unity between the party and the 
revolutionary rank should be strengthened by all means. The 
single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses is 
our party's revolutionary philosophy and our revolution's mighty 
weapon. As did in the past, we should face the enemies with 
single-hearted unity in the future to push forward and complete 
our revolution with the might of single-hearted unity. 
[applause] 
  All the people and the KPA officers and men should be loyal 
toward the party and the leader and have their belief and 
character, and defend our firmly united revolutionary rank's 
single-hearted unity around the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander like the apples of the eyes. 
  Economic construction is an important work for firmly 
building up our socialist revolutionary position. In this 
regard, we should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary 
economic strategy so as to further strengthen and highly display 
the superiority of socialism of our own style. In order to 
thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy, we should highly manifest the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude. 
  We should break through difficulties and obstacles in 
socialist economic construction with a revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude, and at the same time we should 
continue to work without faltering with the firm ideological 
determination to carry out assigned revolutionary tasks with our 
own strength. National reunification is the nation's supreme 
task that should not be delayed even for a moment. We should 
achieve the cause of national reunification at the earliest 
possible date to achieve our nation's unanimous desire. Thus, we 
should hand a reunified fatherland over to our next generations. 
  Our party and the Government of the Republic have made all 
sincere efforts to achieve national reunification under the 
principle of national independence in conformity with the desire 
of the whole nation and the desire of the times. However, a 
graver obstacle has been created on the road ahead of national 
reunification because of the maneuvers of the United States and 
the South Korean authorities. 
  The United States is adhering to the military adventure 
[kunsajok mohom] to crush [apsal] our Republic by stepping up 
anti-Republic pressure commotions more openly in the 
international arena over our nuclear problem. The South Korean 
authorities frequently stage large-scale military exercises 
against our Republic in collusion with outside forces and are 
driving North-South relations to a dangerous phase while talking 
about military countermeasures and an international cooperation 
system under the pretext of our nuclear problem. 
  All of these moves in South Korea show that traitor Kim 
Yong-sam is precisely an out-and-out flunkeyist nation-seller 
who surpasses successive puppets, a treacherous and wicked 
fascist hangman, and implacable warmaniac. 
  As for our nuclear problem that the U.S. imperialists and 
their followers are clamoring about, it is a product of the 
antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers that the United States 
has been tenaciously perpetrating. It is precisely the United 
States who brought nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula and 
is actually threatening us. It is also the United States who 
clamors about the suspicion of the nonexistent nuclear 
development in the North. Even now the United States is 
deploying improved new type missiles to South Korea and is, 
thus, further strengthening military pressure on us. This proves 
that the United States has not renounced its wild ambition to 
keep hold on South Korea as an advanced base of the Far East and 
that it is using the nuclear problem as a means to isolate and 
crush our Republic. 
  The danger of war is growing momentarily on the Korean 
peninsula because of the reckless military threat and war 
provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppet clique [choson pandoesonun chonjaengui wihomi sisi 
kakkakuro kogago issomnida]. 
  Today, at a time when our nation, which has been forced by 
outside forces to endure the sufferings of division for half a 
century, is faced with even the danger of suffering the 
holocaust of nuclear war. We can never look at this grave 
situation with folded arms. Although they are frantically 
running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our 
socialism under the pretext of the nuclear problem, the U.S. 
imperialists and international reactionaries cannot frighten our 
people with any pressure, threat, or blackmail, and no 
high-handedness or pressure can fool us. As recognized by the 
world, our people do not like to engage in empty talk. They are 
a resolute people [kyoltansong innun inmin] who will do what 
they say they will and will not do anything when they say they 
will not. Responding to dialogue with dialogue and to war with 
war is our firm position. [applause] 
  Our people who treasure the nation's independence and the 
country's peace do not want war, but we will not beg for peace 
even if our sovereign rights are infringed upon. Pursuing 
aggression and war under the pretext of peace is the 
imperialists' conventional means. All situations taking place 
today on the Korean peninsula and the international arena show 
that the imperialists' aggressive and plunderous nature will not 
change at all and that we must not have any kind of fantasy 
about imperialism. 
  The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's 
Security Forces and members of the Red Worker-Peasant Militia 
and Red Youth Guards must be firmly armed with the 
chuche-oriented point of view on war, observe with vigilance the 
moves of the enemies, and assume a full combat readiness to 
destroy in a single blow whenever and wherever the enemies 
attack. [applause] 
  If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula where U.S. 
nuclear weapons are concentratedly deployed, it will easily draw 
the world into the ravages of a thermonuclear war. Then, man 
will suffer an irrecoverable wretched calamity. The United 
States and the South Korean authorities must contemplate over 
the grave consequences this reckless act will bring about and 
act with discretion. The Japanese reactionary class must 
correctly look at the trend of the times and must not commit a 
rash and thoughtless action. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and their following forces kindle 
the flames of a war on Korea to the very end, running counter to 
the trend of the times, our people and the People's Army will 
fight to the end for the party and the leader and for our 
socialist fatherland obtained through blood, to thoroughly 
annihilate and sweep away the aggressors and once again manifest 
the spirit of the heroic Korea. [applause] 
  Today's situation is presenting a very grave problem before 
our 70 million people of whether to open the road for the 
fatherland's reunification through great national unity, or 
become a victim of the big powers by carrying out hostility and 
confrontation between the fellow countrymen. Our nation must 
move toward the road of reunifying the fatherland through great 
national unity. Great national unity must be achieved to break 
the current deadlock, defend the nation's dignity and sovereign 
rights, and open the road for the fatherland's independent and 
peaceful reunification. All the fellow Korean countrymen of the 
North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the banner of 
the 10-point program of great national unity for the 
fatherland's reunification to carry out a nation-wide struggle. 
Therefore, we will realize the cause of the fatherland's 
reunification without fail. [applause] 
  Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an 
honorable and sacred struggle for the fatherland's prosperity 
and man's bright future. Voices of the world's revolutionary 
people supporting the socialist cause and our people's struggle 
for the fatherland's reunification are being raised with each 
passing day, and our revolution's international solidarity is 
being all the more strengthened. Amid the active support and 
encouragement of the world's progressive people, there is no 
power in this world that can obstruct our people's advance 
fighting for the just cause of the leadership of the great 
leader and the great party. We will also be always victorious. 
[applause] 
  Let us all single-heartedly unite around the party Central 
Committee accompanied by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim 
Il-song to all the more vigorously fight in realizing the cause 
of the fatherland's reunification and completing the chuche 
revolutionary cause. [applause] 
  Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our 
party 
and people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] 
  Hurrah for the glorious WPK, the organizer and leader 
[hyangdoja] of all victories of the Korean people! [shouts of 
hurrahs and applause] 
  Let there be victory and glory for the officers and men of 
the heroic KPA. [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Vice Marshal of the 
Korean People's Army [KPA] Choe In-tok in an article contributed 
to MINJU CHOSON today declares that the loyalty of the People's 
Army to Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il is characterized 
as the noblest and true loyalty which is spotlessly pure and 
clean, warm and intense and never change with the flow of time. 
  For the entire Army to be rifles and bombs defending comrade 
supreme commander is today the death-defying determination 
overflowing the People's Army and a slogan of faith and will 
upheld by the entire officers and men of the KPA, the article 
says, and goes on: 
  "When comrade supreme commander is determined, we can do 
anything!" A slogan of loyalty chanted by the whole Army today 
vividly proves how resolute and strong are the spirit of 
absoluteness and unconditionality, and faith and will of the 
officers and men of the People's Army who are faithful to the 
idea and leadership of the great General Kim Chong-il. 
  The People's Army today has grown into ever-victorious 
revolutionary Armed Forces with the reliable commanding force 
capable of skillfully organizing any operation and battle and 
modern offensive and defensive means, taking the chuche-based 
idea of Army building as the only guideline, and all the 
soldiers are firmly prepared to be all-conquering combatants 
capable of successfully discharging their military duties under 
any circumstances, armed with the immortal chuche idea and 
tactics of our style. 
  Today the situation of our revolution is very strained and 
the challenge of the enemy is getting all the more wanton. But 
as there is the heroic People's Army, powerful ranks of loyalty, 
each man of which is a match for a hundred upholding the wise 
guidance of comrade supreme commander, any grim difficulties can 
never block our advance and even a large Army tens of millions 
strong cannot provoke us.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea is giving definite precedence to the 
coal industry, the power industry and rail transport which must 
advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy. 
  The state budget for this year envisages a rise of 3 percent 
above last year in the investments in these sectors. 
  In the coal industry, the coal mines will concentrate on 
securing more reserve coal deposits and cutting faces by 
accelerating tunnelling and pit construction and on modernizing 
coal-cutting equipment. 
  In the power industry, the construction of large 
hydroelectric power stations and thermal power plants currently 
under way will be accelerated vigorously and many more minor 
power stations be built in all parts of the country. 
  In rail transport, the existing rails will be replaced by 
heavy-duty rails at an accelerated pace on the trunk lines 
including the Pyongyang-Chongjin line, more sections be switched 
over to electric traction and the modernisation of transport 
means be hastened to increase the railway transport capacity. 
  The investment will be up in the metal industry 2.6 percent 
on last year and the production of irons and steels will be 
placed on a reinforced foundation. 
  Last year the investment in the preferential sectors of the 
national economy went up 3.5 percent above the preceding year to 
considerably increase the capacity of coal and ore production. 
  Power production and railway transport capacity has been 
largely boosted with efforts concentrated on the construction of 
power stations and the strengthening of the material and 
technological foundations of railways.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 1230 GMT on 21 April, in its "Modern Closeup" 
program, carries a 30-minute video report from the NHK studio in 
Tokyo by NHK International News Department Correspondent Toshiro 
Kishi and NHK newscaster Hiroko Kuniya on Kishi's visit to North 
Korea to cover the celebration marking the 82d birthday of North 
Korean President Kim Il-song as well as the situation in North 
Korea. 
  Explaining how a group of NHK correspondents obtained visas 
from North Korea to cover the celebration, Kishi states: 
"Months after applying for them, North Korea issued our visas 
on 14 April, just a day prior to the celebration. I heard that 
North Korea issued our visas after long hesitation and much 
agony." Discussing the stay of the NHK correspondent in 
Pyongyang, Kishi said: "Our news coverage was severely 
restricted." 
  After a video showing citizens, streets, and cars in 
Pyongyang, Kishi continues: "Despite the reported oil shortages 
in that country, the number of trucks and automobiles in 
Pyongyang has grown since 1992, when I last visited the city." 
The video shows a folk dance staged in Kim Il-song Plaza on the 
evening of 15 April, with Kishi saying: "Most of North Korea's 
wealth is concentrated in Pyongyang. Many foreigners frequently 
visit the capital. Therefore, it is mistaken to assess all of 
North Korea based only on Pyongyang." 
  Discussing the food situation in North Korea, Kishi states: 
"I found no food shortages during my brief stay in Pyongyang." 
  Noting a visit by NHK correspondents to the border town of 
Panmumjom, Kishi adds: "On my way to Panmunjom I saw some 
factories emitting smoke, despite reports that many local 
factories in North Korea remain idle due to a lack of energy." 
The video shows a village near Panmumjom, then cuts to Kishi 
interviewing North Korean Major General Yi Chan-nam of the 
Military Armistice Commission. In the interview, Yi says: "Our 
nation is in the highest state of tension." Asked why North 
Korea is in such a situation, Yi states: "America is deploying 
Patriot missiles to South Korea, and are saying they will resume 
the Team Spirit exercises." 
  Discussing his impressions of Pyongyang, Kishi says: "I 
found no evidence during my stay in Pyongyang that North Korea 
was in a war atmosphere or on the verge of economic collapse as 
reported by the Western news media. I felt that the citizens in 
Pyongyang appeared more economically well off than when I 
visited two years ago." Kishi notes: "North Korea issued visas 
for us with the aim of showing the world that North Korea wants 
peace, not war, and that North Korea is seriously seeking to 
settle the nuclear issue." After Kuniya briefly explains how 
North Korea has been trying to resolve the nuclear issue, the 
video shows Kim Il-song meeting with foreign correspondents and 
an interview with North Korean Major General Kim Yong-chol. 
Following a lengthy video report on how the United States and 
South Korea are going to deal with North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons, Kishi and Kuniya conclude the 
program.

<F P=106> [By L. Baterna Hubert] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Belgium -- The Ramos Administration has 
swept away all chances of a peace accord between the government 
and the National Democratic Front (NDF), said Luis Jalandoni, 
NDF vice chairman for international affairs, during a talk 
before a small group at the Centre International over the 
weekend. 
  Jalandoni assailed the declaration of an executive order 
which "imposed the Philippine Government Constitution as the 
framework of the peace talks." 
  "For the NDF, the political arm of the Communist Party of 
the 
Philippines (CPP), this is a violation of the government-NDF 
Joint Declaration signed in The Hague (Netherlands) last 
September 1992," Jalandoni said. 
  "This imposition of the rule of law will never be accepted 
because it will be synonymous to surrender and it fails to 
recognize that the revolutionary movement has its own 
constitution, programs, and processes." 
  Jalandoni, now a Dutch citizen based at the NDF headquarters 
in Utrecht, The Netherlands, also cited the NDF's opposition to 
President Ramos' amnesty proclamations which, he said, "grant a 
license to kill and encourage the same people who were 
responsible for salvaging and the disappearance of persons to 
commit more crimes while extending amnesty to renegades and 
corrupt officials who profit from false surrenders." 
  He disclosed that an NDF communique was sent recently to 
former Ambassador Howard Dee of the government negotiating panel 
that "with the amnesty proclamations and the executive order, 
the Philippine Government has put huge obstructions in the peace 
process." 
  "A possible meeting between government and NDF 
representatives cannot take place as long as these obstacles, 
which Ramos himself had placed, remain," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to the Netherlands Romeo 
Arguelles confirmed that former Ambassador Dee had direct 
communication with the NDF. "They are still talking, although 
no agreement has yet been reached on the venue for the second 
round of exploratory talks," Arguelles said. "As far as Manila 
is concerned, the government is still open and is prepared to 
negotiate." 
  Jalandoni, guest speaker of a conference with slide 
presentation and photo exhibit organized by the Centre 
International in collaboration with the Ligue Anti-Imperialiste 
and the Groupe Philippines de Belgique, related the "25 years of 
resistance in the Philippines" in commemoration of the 25th year 
anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA). 
  Connie Ledesma of the Makibaka [Makabayan Kilusan ng Bagong 
Kababaihan -- Nationalist Movement of New Womanhood] Women's 
Front, who spoke on the "Role of Filipino Women in the Armed 
Struggle," joined Jalandoni on the panel. 
  "Despite Ramos' predictions that the NPA would self-destruct 
in December 1993, the NPA is still here, large, strong, and 
flourishing. It will continue to be so long after the Ramos 
Administration have left the scene. With the support of the 
masses, the NPA is invincible," he said. 
  Tanada [Subhead] 
  Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada asked President Ramos 
to recast his conditional and limited amnesty into a general and 
unconditional amnesty as recommended by the National Unification 
Commission (NUC) to encourage rebel groups to surrender with 
honor and justice. 
  In a privilege speech, Tanada said that the two amnesty 
proclamations are a "virtual trap" that would discourage instead 
of encourage the rebels to apply for amnesty because the 
approval or disapproval of amnesty applications is open-ended. 
  "I am for amnesty. But I am for amnesty at the proper time 
and after the proper preliminary steps have been taken; not the 
amnesty in the form, spirit, and substance the administration is 
foisting," Tanada said. 
  He added that the government and the rebel groups should 
have 
first sat down over the negotiating table to ensure the success 
of any amnesty proclamation. 
  Tanada said that he has been informed by all the armed rebel 
groups -- leftists, rightists, and secessionists -- of their 
blanket rejection of a unilateral amnesty outside of 
negotiations. 
  "Without the active participation of these rebel forces, 
Proclamation 347 and 348 will not be workable and will generate 
more problems than they will resolve," he said. "Let us 
remember that the commitment to negotiate goes with the 
commitment not to take any action that will be seen to sabotage 
or endanger the negotiations." 
  Tanada expressed his strongest objection to the "dangerous 
and unacceptable" Proclamation 348 extending amnesty to 
applicants from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and 
the Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel who may have 
committed human rights violations in connection with their 
counter-insurgency operations. 
  "It is dangerous and unacceptable," he said. "It is amnesty, 
or forgiveness, being extended by government to its own agents 
against the very people that government is supposed to serve and 
protect." 
  He argued that the only ones who are in a position to 
forgive 
human rights violators are the human rights victims, not the 
government.

  [Text] Bacolod City -- A faction of the Communist Party of 
the Philippines [CPP] allied with the exiled Jose Ma. Sison is 
plotting to assassinate Arturo Tabara, chairman of the New 
People's Army's [NPA] Visayas Commission and a bitter critic of 
Sison. 
  The plan to liquidate Tabara and three other top rebel 
leaders opposing the leadership of Sison, will be carried out by 
the Melito Glor Command headed by Gregorio Rosal, Alias Ka 
[Comrade] Roger, according to intelligence reports gathered by 
the military. 
  Other rebel leader sentenced to death are Romulo Kintanar, 
former NPA chief; Ricardo Reyes, then Secretary General; and, 
Felimon Lagman, secretary of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party 
Committee, the report added. 
  The liquidation of Tabara, Lagman, Kintanar, and Reyes were 
confirmed by Ka Roger as published in the national papers. 
  Tabara is facing kidnaping charges in Tiaong, Quezon and is 
detained in Fort Bonifacio, Makati. 
  Estelito Dioquino, former commander of the NPA in Southern 
Negros, admitted selective liquidation is being practiced by the 
underground movement on abusive policemen, paramilitary 
troopers, and even army men. 
  He said he does not know about the claims of pro-Sison 
forces 
in Central Negros that Tabara and others are subjects of 
liquidation by the other rebel faction. 
  Dioquino said the extent of punishment for abusive law 
enforcers or individuals depend on the gravity of their acts 
against the masses. 
  Dioquino used to be aligned with Tabara in the still 
unresolved power struggle within the CPP-NPA. 
  The continuing criticism being waged by the Tabara faction 
against Sison and its plan to establish a new party might have 
forced the CPP mainstream officials to order the liquidation. 
  Col. Antonio Romero, 301st infantry brigade commander, said 
a 
bloody confrontation between the two rebel factions is possible 
if reports about the liquidation of top rebel leaders are true.

  [Text] AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of 
Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo T. Enrile yesterday named three veteran 
Mindanao campaigners to sensitive military posts signalling a 
revamp in the military establishments. 
  Army Brig. Gen. Jocelyn Nazareno, Camp Aguinaldo commander 
and former 602 Brigade commander based in Maguindanao, was 
designated as the new deputy AFP chief of staff for civilian 
military operation. 
  Army Brig. Gen. Victor Lapus, chief of the AFP training 
command based in Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal, was appointed as 
the new deputy AFP chief of staff for operations. 
  Another Mindanao campaigner, Col. Angelo Reyes, chief of the 
603 Brigade based in Davao City, was appointed as the new chief 
of the AFP Civil Relations Service [AFP/CRS]. 
  Nazareno replaced Brig. Romeo Padiernos who was named chief 
of the Army's 5th Infantry Division based in Gamu, Isabela. 
  Col. Reyes replaced Brig. Gen. Rene Dado, chief of the 
AFP/CRS, who was named as the new Camp Aguinaldo Camp commander. 
  General Lapus replaced Brig. Gen. Danilo Olay, who was 
appointed as the new chief of the Army's 8th Infantry Division 
based in Samar. 
  Lt. Commander Jack Castano, AFP deputy public information 
officer, said the naming of Generals Nazareno and Lapus to 
sensitive staff positions signals a revamp in the service after 
the compulsory retirement of General Lisandro C. Abadia as AFP 
chief. 
  Earlier, Major Gen. Alfredo Filler took over as AFP vice 
chief of staff replacing Vice Admiral Mariano Dumancas Jr., who 
went on terminal leave of absence. Major General Orlando 
Soriano of Northern Luzon Command [Nolcom] was also earlier 
appointed as chief of the AFP Southern Command [Southcom] based 
in Zamboanga City. 
  Soriano replaced Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, chief of AFP 
Southcom, who retired from the military service. 
  While Major General Romulo Yap was installed as the new Army 
chief, Brig. General Ruperto Ambil of the 8th Infantry Division 
was named General Yap's replacement at the AFP Visayas Command 
based in Cebu City. 
  Brig. Gen. Edgardo Batenga, who came from the Army's 5th 
Infantry Division, took over as General Soriano's replacement at 
the Nolcom.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 25 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas said on Monday [25 April] that Indonesia congratulates 
Tsutomu Hata on becoming the new Japanese prime minister. 
Alatas told reporters that Hata is not a new figure to 
Indonesia and has known about Indonesian affairs for a long 
time. He refused to be drawn, however, on the prospect of 
Hata's leadership, saying, "it is difficult for me to comment on 
it because it's a Japanese internal affair."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO's Insufficient Action"] </F>
  [Text] NATO has again adopted a tough stand on the Serbs. 
Last Sunday, two NATO F-18 fighters bombed Serb positions 
besieging Gorazde in response to a request by UN peacekeepers. 
The action was repeated the following day. As a matter of 
fact, the Serbs who claimed that 15 soldiers and several 
civilians were killed, did not suffer many casualties. 
  The Serbs' reaction to the bombings was immediate and strong 
although their operation was not a large-scale one. They also 
immediately suspended contacts with the UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Force in Bosnia]. Serb leader Radovan Karadzic even 
canceled a meeting with a U.S. peace emissary scheduled for 
Monday. 
  In return, NATO threatened to immediately launch a 
larger-scale air strike if the Serbs retaliated. As Serb forces 
continued to bomb Gorazde, NATO launched the bombing operation. 
Long before the first strike was launched, NATO had asked the 
Serbs to stop the siege of Gorazde declared by the United 
Nations as a "safe haven." Apparently, the UN had asked NATO to 
carry out its threat as the Serbs failed to end the siege. 
  As a matter of fact, NATO's bombing operation had by then 
become controversial. The United States, for example, stated 
that the bombings were necessary to pressure the Serbs. "If the 
Serbs remain obstinate, they will face further strikes," said 
Bill Clinton. A similar threat also came from the UN secretary 
general. On the other hand, China as a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council expressed concern over the strikes. "We 
only support the peaceful settlement of all international 
conflicts," said a spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  Regardless of any controversy, the strikes dealt a serious 
blow to the Serbs. The Serbs knew very well that NATO had often 
been hesitant in taking tough action and capitalized on it. 
They layed siege and bombed Gorazde, where at least 52 Bosnian 
civilians were killed and hundreds wounded seriously, and this 
is just one of their blatant violations. 
  On the other hand, NATO's bombing operation did not do much 
to improve the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although the UN 
has been "maintaining security" there for over a year, the 
Bosnian Muslims as well as Croats are still in danger. The 
Serbs, who have a better knowledge of the terrain and who are 
better armed, have easily deceived the UN peacekeepers. As we 
all know, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians have been killed by 
Serb miliatiamen in the increasingly absurd [preceding word in 
English] Balkan crisis. 
  If the UN is serious about overcoming the Bosnian conflict, 
they should not just take sporadic action. There must be a 
comprehensive settlement and a preliminary step will be to 
strictly disarm the Serbs. Without serious action, there will 
be no way of expecting the Serbs to sit at the negotiating table 
and draft a common peace plan. Unfortunately, the United 
Nations or NATO has yet to do this.

  [Excerpt] Indonesia has asked the UN Security Council to 
take decisive action to save Gorazde, one of the UN-designated 
safe havens in Bosnia, from the Serbian attacks. Speaking at a 
formal meeting of the UN Security Council in New York, Nugroho 
Wisnumurti, Indonesian permanent representative to the United 
Nations, said the status of Gorazde and other safe havens must 
be upheld and the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina lifted. 
  Nugroho said a new diplomatic initiative aimed at reaching a 
cease-fire in Gorazde and the entire territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must continue so as to find a political 
settlement to the conflict. He also stressed the importance of 
ensuring the safety and independence of the UN personnel serving 
in Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Jakarta today, Indonesian President Suharto 
received a National Assembly delegation led by Speaker Sa'di 
Mahdi Salih, President Saddam Husayn's envoy. Suharto welcomed 
them to Indonesia and said he hoped their contacts with 
Indonesian parliamentarians would further boost bilateral ties. 
The president noted that during a visit earlier in the week to 
Indonesia by Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the foreign minister 
discussed with him recent developments in the UN Security 
Council [with regard to Iraq's demand that the sanctions be 
lifted]. Suharto told Salih that Indonesia takes a keen 
interest in the matter and will pursue it in its capacity as the 
current president of the Nonaligned Movement through its 
coordination bureau in Jakarta and liaison office in New York. 
Indonesia also plans to contact the movement's nations who are 
not permanent Security Council members. In case no suitable 
solution is worked out to end the hardships the Iraqis are 
experiencing from the sanctions, Indonesia, Suharto added, will 
explore other avenues. His country also stands ready to extend 
humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, particularly 
medicines. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih thanked the Indonesian president for his 
time and for the positive approach of the Indonesian leadership 
and people to Iraq.

  [Text] Indonesia hopes that the PRC Government does not 
doubt its determination and ability to swiftly cope with the 
riots in Medan, North Sumatera, which have threatened the safety 
of the ethnic Chinese community. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this in Jakarta today in 
response to a statement issued by (Wu Chiaming), spokesman of 
the PRC Foreign Ministry, calling on the Indonesian Government 
to immediately curb the demonstrations by workers in Medan which 
led to anti-Chinese riots. 
  The Indonesian Government's determination to deal with the 
riots was reflected in the remarks by President Suharto and 
other high-ranking officials who sought to take strong action 
against the rioters because the demonstrations led to 
destruction acts based on the sensitive SARA [tribal, religious, 
racial, and intergrouping conflicts] issues.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] Theo 
Sambuaga, vice chairman of House Commission I [in charge of 
foreign affairs, defense, security, and information] considers 
the Chinese Government's statement on the labor case in Medan 
too excessive. According to Sambuaga, from the United 
Development Faction, the Chinese Government's statement was 
improper in the context of friendly relations between the two 
countries. 
  [Sambuaga] The statement can affect good relations between 
the two countries because it can be interpreted as an act of 
interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. It is important 
that such an official statement be made cautiously because it 
may incite or contribute to undesirable racial conflicts in 
Indonesia. Certainly, the Chinese Government and other 
governments know that Indonesia has consistently handled various 
problems through swift legal approaches and has never 
discriminated against its citizens on the basis of ethnicity, 
religion, or least of all race. The government has consistently 
upheld it's principles in resolving all problems, not just what 
happened in Medan with all its excesses. There have been no 
problems. What happened in Medan stemmed from irresponsible 
acts, and legal action will definitely be taken against the 
culprits. 
  [Correspondent] In this regard, Theo Sambuaga urged the 
Department of Foreign Affairs to brief the Chinese ambassador on 
the incident so the Chinese Government will not make a wrong 
judgment of the events in Indonesia.

  [Text] Public security and order is well under control in 
Medan, North Sumatera. Here is RRI [Radio Republik Indonesia] 
correspondent Suyono reporting from Medan on the Medan protests: 
  [Begin recording] [Suyono] As of this evening, public 
security and order in Medan is 90 percent under control 
following protests by factory workers that are believed to have 
been masterminded by irresponsible people. Major General A. 
Pranowo, commander of the Bukit Barisan First Military Region 
Command, told reporters in Medan that 14 suspects believed to 
have masterminded the protests are still under investigation. 
About 14 company-level units mobilized by the Northern Sumatera 
Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability remain on alert at 
sensitive places. 
  [Pranowo] The latest developments show that the protests led 
to destructive acts. A field observation in Tanjung Merawa 
showed that workers in the majority of factories there were not 
involved in protests and had no intention of becoming so, but 
certain outsiders came and tried to force them to join the 
protests. Because they refused, destructive acts such as 
destroying offices took place. It is also apparent that the 
protests led to destructive acts, intimidation, and terror 
against workers and factories. We are concerned with this 
development. As a matter of fact, the security forces have 
coordinated their response to the situation to prevent it from 
spreading and to eliminate excesses. Certain groups appear to be 
exploiting the protests for their own interests. This must be 
overcome immediately. 
  [Suyono] A joint team organized by the Northern Sumatera 
Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability said the protests 
-- which led to intimidation and terror -- bore a resemblance to 
communist tactics, as noted yesterday by the chief of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia. 
The commander said that field observation showed this was 
partly true. Accordingly, the joint team is continuing 
investigations to find out who really masterminded the protests. 
The commander warned everyone in the region not to be provoked 
by rumors and anonymous phone calls that are aimed at 
heightening tension in the region. This will ensure public 
security and order in North Sumatera. This is correspondent 
Suyono reporting from Medan. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Central Executive Council of the All 
Indonesian Trade Union [SPSI] has rejected any protests that 
harm public order, let alone that lead to destructive acts or 
ethnic, religious, racial, or communal riots. Imam Sudarwo, 
general chairman of the SPSI Central Executive Council, said 
SPSI condemns acts that justify the use of any means to achieve 
an objective, thus inflicting moral and material losses. In a 
press release today, Imam Sudarwo supported the government's 
action against those who violated laws and rules. He urged the 
SPSI rank and file and all sides to conduct a self-examination 
in the wake of the Medan protests. In this respect, he urged 
all sides to handle the manpower issue seriously by strictly 
adhering to the Pancasila labor relations system, which has 
become a national consensus. The SPSI Central Executive Council 
also urged all Indonesian workers to maintain unity and cohesion 
to enable the Indonesian people to enjoy political and economic 
stability.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Three dailies carry editorials on the recent Medan 
protests. 
  Bandung PIKIRAN RAKYAT regrets that the protests demanding 
greater welfare lost their direction and that conscience was 
replaced by emotions. The Medan incident, which cost lives and 
property, has obviously marred the sacred struggle of the 
Indonesian workers. PIKIRAN RAKYAT hopes that officials in 
charge of manpower more actively monitor the condition of 
workers in their respective areas in the wake of the Medan 
incident. 
  ANGKATAN BERSENJATA focuses on who is behind the protests. 
It says the culprit is none other than the so-called Indonesian 
Prosperous Trade Union or SBSI. The minister of manpower does 
not recognize SBSI as an organization representing workers. 
Moreover, the organization has not been registered, and its 
existence has not been endorsed by the minister of home affairs. 
However, SBSI continues to conduct its activities, while the 
press consciously or unconsciously helps promote the 
organization by giving wide converage to its statements and 
activities. SBSI does not stop its activities, although workers 
are indifferent to some of its activities. Its methods -- 
agitation, dissemination of rumors, and mass action -- led to 
violence. In the wake of the incident, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA 
calls for a comprehensive investigation of SBSI's involvement in 
the Medan protests, including subsequent action against its 
leaders. Meanwhile, the daily urges the All Indonesian Trade 
Union [SPSI] as an organization representing workers to be more 
sensitive to the aspirations of its members. 
  Focusing on the incident, POS KOTA says the Medan protests 
showed that the Pancasila industrial relations system is not 
working as it should. According to POS KOTA, it is very 
important to implement the Pancasila industrial relations system 
in local private companies, let alone in foreign private 
companies. It has often been questioned as to why most 
businessmen refuse to sign employment agreements and allow SPSI 
to set up units in working places and why the government has no 
power to require or force them to do so. The question has yet to 
be fully answered, POS KOTA concludes.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The daily MEDIA INDONESIA says the protests for 
wage hikes in Medan that degenerated into rioting which was on 
the verge of spreading elsewhere opened up a new dimension -- 
the extent to which policymakers and businessmen in the country 
understand the meaning of welfare. According to MEDIA 
INDONESIA, we have just implemented rules on minimum wages, but 
our view of welfare remains very unclear and confusing because 
the minimum wages are considered a maximum return. 
  The daily PELITA noted that some disturbing rumors were 
circulating in Jakarta simultaneously. In this connection, 
PELITA says the rumors about rioting in Jakarta should make us 
realize the sensitivity of the matter, because it has exposed 
other basic problems that should be resolved. 
  Meanwhile, the daily REPUBLIKA says the Jakarta rumors 
pertained not only to rioting but also to a dollar rush. 
According to REPUBLIKA, it would be disturbing if citizens were 
provoked by various monetary rumors. Experience shows that a 
public panic would lead to a negative monetary situation. Such 
an unwarranted panic should be prevented. Of course, it will be 
insufficent for the government to simply give a vague 
clarification because this will again provoke citizens to be 
speculative.

Government from Germany. They consist of 16 (?Parchim)-class 
corvettes, nine Kondor-class minesweepers, and 14 (?Frost)-class 
tank landing ships. 
  With the arrival of the ships, a total of 17 warships have 
thus far arrived in Indonesia. KRI Sultan Taha Saifudin and KRI

  [Text] THAILAND and Iran have finally agreed in principle 
to exchange Thai rice with crude oil from Iran after the 
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) suggested the government 
refine the low-quality crude oil at lower costs in a third 
country, instead of burdening the local refineries with the 
additional costs of refining the crude oil, which contains 
higher sulphur and metallic contents. 
  The PTT suggested the government refine the problematic oil 
in Italy because if the local refineries are to refine the crude 
oil, it would have to spend additional funds for the 
installation of machinery designed to properly refine the crude 
oil from Iran, said Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the 
Foreign Trade Department. 
  Iran has long been the customer of rice from Thailand, but 
Thailand has been reluctant to buy oil from Iran because the 
Iranian oil possesses an undesirably high sulphur and metallic 
content. Thai and Iranian governments agreed a few months ago to 
conduct a counter trade by exchanging Thai rice with the crude 
oil from Iran, but so far they have yet to exchange their goods 
because the local refinery, Petroleum Authority of Thailand, has 
asked for compensation to offset the additional cost associated 
with refining the crude oil from Iran. 
  The two sides last week signed the MoU, said Commerce 
Ministry Uthai Phimchaichon, speaking upon his return trip from 
Iran. He said Thailand agreed in principle to export 
300,000-400,000 tonnes of Thai rice to Iran in exchange for 
crude oil. The amount of crude oil under the deal has yet been 
disclosed. 
  PTT will decide how much Iran crude oil Thailand should buy 
before submining the proposal to the cabinet for approval, 
Oranut said. 
  "Iran is a regular customer, and if we want to maintain our 
rice market we should buy its crude oil," she added. 
  Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the Foreign Trade 
Department, without elaborating on the compensation, said Iran 
has allowed Thailand to refine the crude oil at Singapore and 
Okinawa in Japan.

  [Excerpt] Italian companies have agreed to buy more Thai 
products as part of a counter-trade deal involving the Thai 
Defence Ministry's purchase of helicopters worth 3.4 billion 
baht, Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said after returning 
from Rome yesterday. 
  Mr. Uthai declined to give more details about what the 
Italians would do, saying only that the outcome of the 
negotiations exceeded expectations. He said he would brief the 
Defence Ministry and Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak about the talks. 
  The agreement will require Cabinet approval. 
  A Commerce Ministry source who was with the delegation in 
Rome said that Alinia, the Italian company in the process of 
selling the G-222 helicopters, had agreed to buy Thai products 
worth about 680 million baht or 20 percent of the sales volume. 
  The source said the company accepted Thai proposals to 
increase trade in eight products: frozen chicken, rubber, 
tapioca flour, toys, ceramics, sport shoes, plastic products and 
rubber gloves 
  Mr. Uthai claimed that the Italian talks should serve as a 
standard for Thai government agencies in future deals with other 
countries. 
  The Government last year had delayed approving the purchase 
of the transport helicopters and asked the Commerce Ministry to 
try to sell more Thai agricultural products to offset the trade 
deficit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Regarding a misunderstanding between Thailand and 
Cambodia, the prime minister has said that certain countries 
could be harboring prejudice against Thailand, so therefore the 
mass media should cooperate by filing reports that concern 
Thailand and Cambodia in ways that help restore good 
understanding between the two countries. The prime minister 
said this at Government House this afternoon. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] This was a topic discussed in the 
National Security Council meeting, to the effect that some 
countries appeared to be prejudiced. Therefore, the mass media 
is asked to cooperate. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will the government readjust 
its policy toward Cambodia? 
  [Chuan] I said two days ago that there would be no changes 
in the policy. 
  [Second correspondent] Did the military give you any new 
information? Did it ask for approval to carry out any action? 
  [Chuan] No. It was I who invited the defense minister and 
the supreme commander to discuss issues which were touched upon 
earlier, such as the border and the Cambodian issues. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
told newsmen after his meeting today with the prime minister 
that he informed Chuan that he would inspect the Cambodian 
border in Ubon Ratchathani and Trat Provinces. He would listen 
to briefings by local officials and visit the border areas where 
residents might be affected in order to gather information for 
planning appropriate measures. 
  Prasong said the Thai ambassador in Phnom Penh has been 
sending him regular reports and has tried to call on the 
Cambodian Government to clarify matters and to request certain 
documents, such as photographs. The photographs concerned have 
not been supplied so far. The ambassador reported this 
morning that from 2-7 May Samdech Norodom Sihanouk will hold a 
roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge 
with the aim of creating national reconciliation. This 
roundtable meeting is a good idea. 
  The foreign minister said he hopes that the problems will be 
resolved. Diplomatic measures will have to be carried out 
promptly in order to achieve understanding between the two 
countries. Regarding the Thai military's reaction to the 
Cambodian Government's conduct, the foreign minister said the 
military probably wanted to gauge the people's reaction. The 
people's tolerance also has its limits. Regarding possible 
interference by third countries, the foreign minister said the 
issue could not be verified at this time. Therefore, it is not 
prudent to charge any country of interference unless there is 
evidence to substantiate it.

  [Text] This morning Foreign Minister Squadron Leader 
Prasong Sunsiri and his party inspected the situation along the 
Cambodian border in Surin Province. In Kap Choeng District, 
they were received and given a briefing by Major General Sanan 
Marangsit, commander of the Suranari Force. According to the 
briefing, the Suranari Force is responsible for security along 
the Cambodian border in five Thai provinces: Surin, Buriram, 
Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, and Amnat Charoen. The border in 
this area is about 800 km in length. The Lao border also makes 
up part of this length. The border problems in Surin mainly 
concerned damage from shells from the fighting in Cambodia. 
Recently, nearly 200 artillery shells landed in Thai territory 
during the clashes in that country. There were also nine 
incidents of border encroachment. The Suranari Force has 
informed the agencies concerned of these incidents in order to 
protest to the Cambodian Government. There were also 21 
incidents of vehicles being hijacked near the border, 19 of 
these incidents being solved. Interrogation showed that 
Cambodian soldiers participated in the car hijacks. 
  The Suranari Force commander said trading activities along 
the Surin border have slowed considerably. The Chong Chom pass 
in Kap Choeng Distric remains closed. Thai officials have been 
providing safety for Thai people along the border. It is 
expected that fighting along the border will continue as long as 
problems in Cambodia remain unsolved. 
  The foreign minister then proceeded to inspect the situation 
in Chong Chom pass. He also met with Cambodian vendors selling 
Thai goods on the Cambodian side of the pass. The vendors 
wanted Thailand to reopen the border for trading as soon as 
possible. The foreign minister assured them that if fighting in 
Cambodia subsides, the Thai Government is likely to reopen the 
pass. 
  The foreign minister said he will use information obtained 
during the current trip to improve the overall situation.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday he 
will contact Cambodian leaders this week to discuss border 
conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia and "do my best" to 
clarify any misunderstanding between the two countries. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong was talking to reporters 
at 
the end of a border inspection visit that took him to Surin, Sa 
Kaeo and Chanthaburi provinces. 
  The Foreign Minister said the information from the 
fact-finding trip was very useful and he would do his best to 
resolve problems with Cambodia. 
  The Foreign Minister was satisfied with the role of Thai 
authorities along the border, saying "they conducted themselves 
in accordance with Government policy." 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong was briefed by senior Army commanders during 
his visit to Chong Chom Pass in Surin, Khlong Luk-Poipet border 
in Sa Kaeo and Saptari Pass in Chanthaburi. 
  He said the morale of Thai soldiers in the region was high 
and they wanted to see peace along the border. 
  In Surin, the Foreign Minister was briefed by Maj-Gen Sanan 
Maroengsit, commander of the Suranari Task Force in Buriram, 
Surin, Sisaket and Ubon Ratchthani provinces. 
  The commander said a total of 26 artillery shells had landed 
in the area and the Task Force had evidence to prove that they 
were fired by Cambodian government forces. 
  "We have pictures to prove our point but they (Phnom Penh 
troops) have steadfastly denied it," Maj-Gen Sanan told during 
the briefing. 
  Besides, the commander added, his units had to tackle 
Cambodian bandits who often crossed into Thailand to steal cars. 
  From there the Foreign Minister proceeded to Aranyaprathet 
district in Sa Kaeo province where he was briefed by Maj-Gen 
Niphon Pharannit, commander of the Burapha Task Force there. 
  Maj-Gen Niphon told the Foreign Minister that he had 
prepared 
counter measures to deal with any spillover of the fighting 
between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
into Thai territory. 
  He pointed out that the conflict with Phnom Penh soldiers 
arose particularly from the fact that they used a different map 
to identify the border demarcation line. 
  Thailand and Cambodia use different maps to identify the 
borderline, he said. 
  In addition, Maj-Gen Niphon added, there was the problem of 
Cambodians fleeing the fighting into the province, kidnapping 
and smuggling. 
  The Foreign Minister reiterated that the Government did not 
think that the problem of Cambodians fleeing the fighting into 
the province were just refugees and would be returned to their 
country in a few days when the situation was safe. 
  He said the checkpoint between Khlong Luk and Poipet would 
not be opened until fighting in Cambodia stopped to ensure the 
safety of Thais entering the country. 
  In Chanthaburi, the Foreign Minister visited Saptari 
checkpoint in Soi Dao district and met high-ranking officers of 
the Chanthaburi-Trat Task Force and senior provincial 
authorities including Governor Amon Ananthachai. 
  The governor urged the Foreign Minister to discuss the 
possibility of opening temporary checkpoints to transport logs 
from Cambodia. 
  Gem traders also sought help from the Foreign Minister to 
bring back their equipment confiscated by the Khmer Rouge. 
  Meanwhile, fighting between the Cambodian government and the 
Khmer Rouge will escalate as both sides are mobilizing their 
forces in other parts of Banteay Meanchey province opposite Ta 
Phraya and Aranyaprathet districts, military sources said 
yesterday. 
  Government soldiers and the guerrillas exchanged fire early 
yesterday in Thmar Puok, the sources said. 
  The exchange of fire broke out after the guerrillas launched 
an attack with mortar and artillery shells in an attempt to 
seize the Seventh Division Battalion headquarters about 20 
kilometers inside Cambodia from the Thai border in Ta Phraya. 
  Casualties were not known. 
  People living near a Khmer Rouge base at Phnum Malai are 
building new bunkers and repairing old ones to prepare for 
possible artillery shelling from fighting in Cambodia.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
told reporters that he received a phone call from Cambodian 
Foreign Minister Samdech Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut this morning 
to inform him that the Cambodian Government plans to organize a 
roundtable meeting with representatives of all Cambodian 
factions on 2 May. The Cambodian foreign minister said that the 
Cambodian Government, with its intention to clear up any 
skepticism regarding Thailand and create mutual better 
understanding between the two countries, one of the issues to be 
raised for discussion during the meeting will be the alleged 
Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge. 
  Touching on the plight of some 1,000 displaced Cambodians 
who 
fled the fighting in Cambodia to take refuge in Ta Phraya 
District of Sakeo Province, the Cambodian foreign minister said 
that Cambodian officials in collaboration with the Office of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees will take care of them. In 
this regard, Squadron Prasong Sunsiri informed his Cambodian 
counterpart that Thailand has not pushed any displaced people 
out of the country. However, if they return to Cambodia, they do 
so on a voluntary basis.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit expects 
King Norodom Sihanouk will be able to bring about reconciliation 
and peace in Cambodia, Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said 
yesterday. 
  He quoted the army chief as saying that the war in Cambodia 
had been going on for more than 10 years and, if it continued, 
it would affect Thailand and the good relationship between 
Thailand and Cambodia. 
  Col Phalangkun said the peace conference between the 
Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge to be held next month 
at the behest of King Sihanouk was Cambodia's internal affairs. 
  The Thai armed forces, he said, wanted peace restored in 
Cambodia. 
  "The best way to bring about peace is to stop fighting and 
for all sides to reconcile," he said. 
  First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo voiced 
support for King Sihanouk's peace initiative "because the policy 
of the Government and the Thai armed forces is to see peace and 
reconciliation being restored in Cambodia." 
  He said he had told the Burapha Task Force on the eastern 
border to compile evidence of cross-border shelling and the flow 
of Cambodian refugees into Thailand. 
  "We want the Cambodian refugees to speak out openly when 
they 
want to go home because previously we were always accused of 
forcing the Cambodians back," Lt-Gen Chettha said. 
  About 100 more Cambodian refugees fled to the border of Ta 
Phraya district in Sa Kaeo Province on Friday night for fear of 
a Khmer Rouge attack on their village. 
  The refugees from O Bai Chuan village, mostly women and 
children, were settled in a temple in Ban Non Mak Mun. 
  One of the refugees, Mrs Chao, 68, told Thai police that 
they 
escaped because they heard that Khmer Rouge guerrillas would 
attack their village and would kill all men wearing army uniform.

  [Text] THE Army again warned Cambodian government troops 
fighting the Khmer Rouge near the border yesterday that Thailand 
will respond "in a tough manner" if stray artillery shells 
continue to land on Thai soil. 
  Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said the shells could have 
"intentionally'' been aimed against Thai territory. 
  "The artillery shells which have fallen on our soil lately 
are becoming increasingly suspect," the spokesman said. " We 
are analyzing possibilities to determine whether they (Cambodian 
troops) had some motive and intended to fire directly into 
Thailand. 
  "We are preparing to respond in a tough manner" to ensure 
Thailand's sovereignty, said Phalangkun. 
  The warning came amidst heightened tension between Thailand 
and Cambodia over Phnom Penh's allegation that the Thai military 
is still supporting the outlawed Khmer Rouge. Cambodian leaders 
have blamed Thailand for the Khmer Rouge's success in retaking 
the strategic and gem-rich western town of Pailin, an accusation 
Bangkok described as a sore loser's attempt to find a scapegoat. 
  Phnom Penh accused some units of the Thai military of having 
business interests with the Khmer Rouge in Pailin, which were 
seized by the Cambodian army a month before the Khmer Rouge 
recaptured it about a week ago. 
  Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani last week 
complained about artillery shells fired by Cambodian troops 
landing in Thailand. 
  The military has also pointed out that while Phnom Penh has 
been "smearing" Thailand's image, Thais living along the border 
have had to bear the brunt of the military spillover from the 
Cambodian civil war as well as the burden of never-ending 
refugee problems. 
  "Thai soldiers are taking care of Khmer refugees at the 
border. This shows we are not siding with anybody," Phalangkun 
said. 
  Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit has been at the 
forefront of the diplomatic row between-Thailand and Cambodia. 
He last week threatened to cut humanitarian assistance to the 
war-torn country if it continued its verbal attacks on the 
government here. 
  Wimon yesterday said he wanted to see peace in Cambodia as 
soon as possible and an end to the refugee problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Misunderstanding Must Be Cleared"] </F>
  [Text] Relations between Thailand and Cambodia are sour 
again after Cambodian leaders, from prime ministers to foreign 
minister, made a series of allegations against Thailand through 
the media. They accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge in 
operations against the Phnom Penh government because the Khmer 
Rouge was excluded from national administration. 
  The latest accusation was heard when the Khmer Rouge forces 
retook the town of Pailin, which is in the northwest of Cambodia 
and less than 20 km from the Thai border. Pailin had been 
captured by government forces on 19 March, but remained under 
the Cambodian Government's control for only 30 days. 
  This time the accusation was made by Second Prime Minister 
Hun Sen, who said Thailand "directly helped the Khmer Rouge," 
and that several hundreds crossed from the Thai side to 
reinforce the Khmer Rouge at Pailin. 
  The Thai Government, through its spokesman, immediately 
denied the Cambodian allegation. It said the Thai Government 
was gravely concerned by the accusations made to the media by 
Cambodian leaders. It said, despite the fact that there was an 
agreement to settle problems through diplomatic channels, 
Cambodia never abided by the agreement. This caused Thailand to 
doubt whether the Cambodian Government was only finding a 
scapegoat to explain its defeat at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. 
  From what happened, we think the Thai and Cambodian 
Governments are now resorting to emotions in dealing with one 
another. It is useless to adopt such a stand, and continue 
throwing charges against each other, since this would only make 
things worse. 
  Before the Khmer Rouge lost Pailin to the Phnom Penh 
government, Thailand had adjusted its policy regarding issues at 
the border with Cambodia -- Cambodians would be denied shelter 
inside Thailand in order to prevent allegations that Thailand 
was helping the Khmer Rouge. However, Thailand was accused by 
the Cambodian Government of lacking humanitarian feelings when 
it pushed back fleeing Cambodian refugees. Now Cambodia has 
accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge -- which is very 
unlikely. Khmer Rouge elements can sneak into Thai territory 
without Thailand's knowledge because the Thai- Cambodian border 
is a long stretch. And it is not Thailand's fault if Khmer 
Rouge forces used Thai territory as a transport route without 
Thailand's knowledge. 
  We think that, although both Thailand and Cambodia are in an 
angry mood, they should immediately seek to hold a high-level 
meeting to thrash out the mutual distrust. 
  There is no use in Thailand helping the Khmer Rouge in their 
fight against the Phnom Penh government since Thailand, as a 
nation, would gain nothing from that. 
  It is necessary for Thailand and Cambodia to hold 
discussions 
to reach mutual understanding in order to prevent further any 
deterioration in their relations. Remaining indifferent to the 
issue will be no good for any of the two parties since, as 
geographical neighbors, they cannot live far apart from one 
another.

  [Text] Thailand has agreed to arrest Burmese "terrorists" 
travelling on false passports and Burma has agreed to open a 
border checkpoint to take back illegal Burmese immigrants, 
sources said yesterday. 
  The agreement was reached during a meeting of the 
Thai-Burmese Border Committee in Moulmein in Burma. 
  The sources said Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had been told 
of the agreement which would be submitted to the Cabinet for 
acknowledgement on Tuesday. 
  First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo and 
commander of the Burmese Southeastern Regional Army Maj-Gen Ket 
Sein worked out the agreements. 
  Burma said a number of "terrorists" had been using fake 
passports to travel abroad through Bangkok and asked Thailand to 
arrest them. The Burmese did not define the word "terrorists". 
  Thailand said it had a policy not to support Burmese 
terrorists and the Interior and Foreign Ministries would arrest 
them if they passed through Bangkok. Burma gave Thailand a 
report on the false passports and travel documents. Thailand 
told Burma the 300,000 Burmese illegal immigrants causing social 
and economic problems in Thailand must be repatriated. 
  Burma said it would open a checkpoint to take them back if 
it 
could be proven they were Burmese citizens. 
  Representatives of the two countries agreed on developing 
trade and tourism with local border committees of the two 
countries finding ways to achieve this. 
  The Interior Minister, the Customs Department and the Joint 
Operations Center of the Supreme Command had been given 
responsibility for this, the source said. 
  The agreements will be forwarded to the Cabinet on Tuesday 
and another meeting of the Thai-Burmese Border Committee will be 
held in Bangkok at the end of this month, the source said.

  [Text] The Taiwanese Government has approved requests from 
local companies to recruit more than 100,000 Thai workers 
despite frequent news reports Taiwan will stop employing foreign 
labor, said Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun Kaeothong 
yesterday. 
  Mr Phaithun said Israel had also shown an interest in 
employing 5,000 more Thai workers and South Korea says it wants 
to hire 20,000-30,000 workers from Thailand. 
  The minister was asked about news reports that Taiwan was 
considering stopping the recruitment of foreign labor. 
  He said he had heard frequent reports of this kind. 
  Taiwan has approved requests from companies to recruit 
117,000 Thai workers, equal to 68 per cent of its total foreign 
workforce. 
  Mr Phaithun said the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry 
yesterday issued an announcement fixing the brokerage fees which 
job placement companies can collect from workers in order to 
cope with Taiwan's requirements. 
  The announcement stipulates a company sending workers to 
Taiwan can demand no more than 25,000 baht plus a month's salary 
from each worker. 
  The company may charge the workers airfares for a single 
trip 
unless the airfares are provided by the employers. 
  Workers must pay for other expenses such as medical 
examinations, skills tests, the translation of documents and 
passports. 
  Brokerage fees collected from workers destined for other 
countries will differ, said Mr Phaithun. He said one measure to 
control the 174 job placement companies supplying workers to 
Taiwan was a requirement that they set up a central organization 
to make sure all companies comply strictly with the ministry 
announcement. He said the ministry had also been contacted by 
Israeli firms wanting about 5,000 Thai workers. 
  Ministry officials have been instructed to check the work 
sites to see if they are secure enough. 
  South Korea has also shown an interest in recruiting 20,000- 
30,000 Thai workers for factories in the form of job training 
similar to in Japan. The employment is on the condition that 
the workers must have worked for South Korean companies in 
Thailand, said Mr Phaithun.

  [Text] Nakhon Si Thammarat -- A powerful bomb went off at 
busy Nakhon Si Thammarat Railway Station around noon yesterday, 
killing three people and injuring 27 others in an apparent 
terrorist attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the 
incident. Police said the explosion came from a cluster of 
baggage in the crowded waiting area near a food stall on the 
platform where the Nakhon Si Thammarat- Bangkok express train 
stood around 12.30 pm. 
  Sutchai Butngam, 40, who kept the food stall, was killed 
instantly, while Rochem Butem, a young man, and a 17-year-old 
woman, Amnuai Raksarat, who suffered serious injuries died later 
at hospital. Eight of those injured were in critical condition 
last night and some may not survive, according to Maharat 
Hospital officials. Most of the casualties were passengers or 
relatives seeing off family members. 
  Provincial Governor Suchan Phongnua expressed outrage at the 
attack but did not lay blame. "The explosion was an act of 
terrorism. It intended to kill people -- poor people, women and 
children," he told reporters at the scene of the blast covered 
with pools of blood, broken tables and chairs, smashed utensils 
and scattered food. 
  Suchan quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw a young man in 
his mid-20s placing a paper box amid the baggage and casually 
walking away a few minutes before the explosion. The governor 
said police bomb experts had yet to identify the explosive 
device, although an initial report suggested that it was an 
improvised bomb set off manually by a battery-powered detonator 
attached to a time-delay circuit. 
  Security was tightened at the airport, bus terminals, 
wharves, railway stations and government offices throughout the 
province, he said. Terrorist attacks like yesterday's incident 
are impossible to prevent, he said, because the perpetrators did 
not use a time bomb, which can be detected before it goes off. 
  Police Director General Prathin Santipraphop, who arrived 
here from Bangkok to personally direct the investigation into 
the case, said he believed the bomb attack was not linked to the 
separatist movement because the type of bomb used was different. 
Asked whether the attack was aimed at discrediting the 
government, Prathin said police investigators would need some 
time to find out. The national police chief said initial 
findings suggested that there were at least three people 
involved in planting the bomb at the railway station. Prathin 
said yesterday's attack was unpreventable, but acknowledged that 
police will have to improve their intelligence gathering. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he was told by 
police that the bomb was designed to create the impression that 
the government is unable to keep peace and order. But he said 
it was premature to link it to "disempowered element". 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, also Democrat MP 
representing Nakhon Si Thammarat, said he was told by an 
eyewitness that a man apparently lit a fuse to set off the bomb. 
He said the eyewitness saw smoke rising from the paper box just 
before the explosion. Surin, who was in Nakhon Si Thammarat 
yesterday, said it was too early to say whether the blast was in 
any way linked to the separatist movement in Muslim-dominated 
provinces. 
  Police and army bomb experts equipped with metal detectors 
searched the railway station and the train for other bombs but 
found none. 
  The Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok train eventually departed on 
schedule at 1.40 pm, but most of the would-be passengers 
cancelled the journey, fearing for their safety, and had their 
tickets refunded.

  [Text] A FOUNDER and leading member of the Barisan 
Revolusi Nasionale (BRN) separatist movement in this northern 
Malaysian state blames a group of politicians for instigating 
violence in southern Thai provinces so as to create a situation 
to justify the overthrow of the Chuan government. 
  Speaking to the BANGKOK POST through an interpreter in his 
hometown Abdul Garim bin Hassan concluded that the situation in 
the South, manifested by torching of rural schools and bomb 
attacks, was manipulated with political intent. 
  A respectable religious instructor, he urged the Chuan 
government not to be misled by the situation or to put the blame 
on separatist movements. 
  Abdul Garim said he recently met Dr Arong Mureng, leader of 
a 
new and aggressive faction of the Pattani United Liberation 
Organisation, another separatist organisation which has waged a 
battle for the creation of an autonomous Pattani state in 
southernmost Thailand. 
  Dr Arong was suspected by the Fourth Army Region of playing 
a 
role in the torching of 34 schools in Yala, Pattani and 
Narathiwat provinces last August. 
  The BRN founder said he and Dr Arong shared the view that 
most of the untoward incidents in the past eight months in the 
South were perpetrated by some politicians to cause trouble for 
the Government. 
  He insisted that his BRN organisation and Dr Arong's PULO 
faction were not involved in any of those incidents. 
  "I know him (Dr Arong) personally and this helps convince me 
that the allegations against Arong for causing turmoil are 
totally ridiculous. 
  "First, he is a staunchly religious man and anyone who has 
strong faith in religion will not dare do anything which will 
harm the lives of innocent people. 
  "Secondly, it would take a large number of people to cause 
trouble in different places simultaneously. And Arong does not 
have that capability," said Abdul Garim referring to the 
torching of 34 schools. 
  He said when he first heard about the incidents he knew at 
once that they were not perpetrated by separatist movements. 
  Abdul Garim is considered by the Fourth Army as a highly 
respectable member of the BRN. 
  Negotiations are under way to persuade him to return to 
Pattani to pursue a normal life. 
  The BRN founder charged that some separatists "who do not 
have any ideology" were hired by some politicians to create 
turmoil in the South 'to create a pretext for the overthrow of 
the Government. 
  He said Arong suspects that some of his men may have become 
tools of the politicians but without his consent. 
  Arong, he added, was infuriated. 
  Abdul Garim claimed separatist organisations were created 
for 
political objectives. 
  He explained that southern provinces were a perfect target 
for trouble-making because the public could be easily misled to 
believe that the separatists have a hand in them. 
  He said he felt sorry for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai whose 
administration has become a target. 
  "He is a man of good heart and who has always fought for 
justice in society. I personally admire him," said Abdul Garim. 
  About his 30-year struggle for an autonomous state in 
southern Thailand, he said he now realises that violence and 
armed struggle are not a solution to problems in the South. 
  He said he was considering the peace overture from the 
Fourth 
Army. If he is assured religious freedom, he said he may return. 
  "What I really want to do when I return home is teach Islam 
to young Muslims and tell them to have faith in our religion," 
he said. 
  He said he has heard of the progress in the Muslim-dominated 
provinces and was impressed by the effort of the Government 
which has gone to great lengths to redress the plight of Muslim 
people. 
  Abdul Garim, who led an armed struggle during the early 
1960s 
because he felt at the time that the government was repressing 
Muslims, now views the situation more favourably. 
  He said he was confident that the situation in the South 
will 
improve now that the Government recognises and respects the 
religious' rights and freedom of Muslim people.

  [Text] ARMY Chief Wimon Wongwanit yesterday ruled out 
separatist involvement in Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si 
Thammarat's railway station, and said the military has evidence 
to support his claim. 
  "It is definitely not the work of separatists. We have 
evidence. We are gathering evidence. We will know the motive 
and the culprits in the next few days," Gen Wimon said. 
  The military knows there were two to three factors behind 
the 
bombing, be said, but he declined to elaborate. 
  Wimon said this kind of violence had not occurred in Nakhon 
Si Thammarat before because separatists have never operated in 
the province. Such incidents should occur only in provinces 
where there is serious conflict. 
  On Saturday, a bomb went off at the busy southern railway 
station killing three people and injuring at least 27 others. 
No one has claimed responsibility. 
  Police said the bomb detonated in a mound of baggage in the 
crowded waiting area near a food stall on the platform where the 
Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok express train sat waiting to depart. 
  Witnesses said they saw a young man in his mid-20s place a 
paper box amid the baggage and casually walk away about five 
minutes before the explosion. A sketch of the suspect was 
issued within hours. 
  But Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop said initial findings 
suggested at least three people were involved in planting the 
bomb. Police yesterday issued sketches of two more suspects. 
  Wimon denounced the bombing as "cruel and inhuman". He said 
it would damage the country in particular its security and 
economy. 
  A senior official at the Interior Ministry said that before 
the explosion the ministry had ordered all southern provinces to 
be well-prepared for terrorist acts. 
  The source who asked not to be named said Saturday's 
explosion was not the work of separatists but a movement which 
wants to destroy the Government and bring down Fourth Army 
Commander Kitti Rattanachaya. The Fourth Army headquarters are 
located in Nakhon Si Thammarat. 
  The source claimed that two lieutenant generals were 
dissatisfied with Lt Gen Kitti, who transferred them from the 
Fourth Army, and wanted to damage his reputation. 
  Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Suchan Phongnua said the 
province was warned beforehand that the provincial hall would be 
a bomb target, and security had been tightened there. 
  He said police had provided round the-clock security for the 
hall, but he had not expected a bomb would go off in the railway 
station. 
  Officials are investigating whether the incident had 
anything 
to do with any separatist groups, Suchan said. 
  On Saturday, Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut also 
said 
police had received advance intelligence about the bomb plot. 
He said police are hunting intensively for confirmation of 
another report that there will be similar violence in Bangkok 
next month. 
  Gen Chawalit believes the explosion was the work of a local 
group of troublemakers who want to destabilize the government, 
and not foreign terrorists. 
  Interior officials, including Deputy Interior Minister 
Chamni 
Sakdiset and Permanent Secretary Ari Wong-ariya, yesterday 
morning were briefed by local officials. 
  Chamni, who is also an MP for Nakhon Si Thammarat, said the 
explosion was the work of ill-intentioned people who want to 
destabilize the government. The incident was linked to violence 
in the southernmost provinces, he said. 
  He said the investigation has progressed since important 
witnesses were questioned. The arrest of those responsible for 
the explosion will lead to the arrest of those responsible for 
other sabotage in the deep South, he predicted. 
  "We now see the shadow of the wrongdoers, but we have to 
gather more information. I believe everything will be clear in 
a short time," Chamni said. 
  He said he had ordered police to beef up security at crowded 
places in the province to prevent a repeat of the bombing. He 
had also ordered the setting up of two police special task 
forces to hunt for suspects. 
  Ari said the Interior Ministry is preparing a major plan to 
prevent sabotage in the South. Provincial governors and police 
and military officers will be included. 
  Col Phathai Suthisi of the Fourth Army said the culprits 
must 
be experienced explosives handlers. The bomb was not a military 
M-26 hand grenade as initially claimed by police. It was 
home-made and consisted of about a quarter pound of high 
explosive timed to explode only two or three minutes after it 
was left at the station.

  [Text] Russia is not obligated to promptly assist North 
Korea pursuant to its treaty of military alliance with North 
Korea even if a military dispute occurs on the Korean peninsula, 
a senior Russian Government official said. 
  Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Korean division of the 
Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, interviewed by 
ITAR-TASS today, said this adding that Russia has already 
modified the interpretation of the clause on automatic military 
intervention, which is the key clause of the DPRK-Soviet Treaty 
on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed in 1961. 
  He explained that Russia conveyed its position on the 
modification of the automatic military intervention clause to 
Pyongyang about a year ago through a diplomatic channel. 
  Moiseyev noted that although Russia, which succeeded the 
Soviet Union, admits that the treaty is still valid, a different 
interpretation has to be made as to the automatic military 
intervention clause under the present circumstances.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea celebrates 
the 62nd anniversary of the founding of its armed forces on 
Monday, April 25. 
  The reclusive communist state founded the regular "Korean 
People's Army" on Feb. 8, 1948, and formerly observed this date 
as Armed Forces Day until 1978, when it opted for April 25 on 
the ground that it was on April 25, 1932, that Kim Il-song 
organized and became the first commander of the irregular 
"Korean People's Revolutionary Army." 
  The change was intended to date the origin of the regular 
Korean People's Army back to the irregular guerrillas during the 
days of Japanese rule, which has a great bearing on North 
Korea's military strategy today. 
  By ascribing the regular army to the irregular troops that 
waged guerrilla warfare against Japan in the 1930s, North Korea 
attaches importance to the art of unconventional warfare in its 
military strategy. This strategy calls for forming a second 
front in the rear area of South Korea by infiltrating guerrilla 
troops for a mix of regular and irregular warfare to turn the 
whole of South Korea into a huge battleground. 
  North Korea's Armed Forces should thus be viewed as an 
important instrument of its strategy to communize South Korea by 
force for eventual reunification, analysts say. The strategy's 
objective is communist reunification of Korea, and to achieve 
this aim North Korea is pursuing "the four great military lines" 
while strengthening "the three great revolutionary 
capabilities." The four great military lines are guidelines of 
action for the military based on the chuche (self-reliance) 
ideology. 
  North Korea has developed its military strategy with a mix 
of 
the Chinese people's warfare strategy, the former Soviet Union's 
modern warfare strategy and the lessons of the Korean, 
Vietnamese and Persian Gulf conflicts. Based on the concept of 
offensive war, the strategy calls for sweeping the whole of 
South Korea in a blitzkrieg action or invading the Seoul area in 
a limited but lightning-quick war. 
  For this purpose, North Korea maintains mechanized and 
mobile 
troops, as well as special troops [to] infiltrate South Korea's 
rear area. It has also dug tunnels across the Demilitarized 
Zone as infiltration avenues. 
  North Korea's defense structure is patterned after those of 
the former Soviet Union and China, and the Ministry of Armed 
Forces is not a part of the Administrative Council (cabinet) but 
under the direct control of the Workers' (communist) Party 
Central Military Commission and the National Defense Committee 
-- unlike cabinet ministries. And the chief of General Staff is 
directly responsible to the Armed Forces minister and controls 
the three branches of the Army, Navy and Air Force. 
  Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President Kim 
Il-song, 
became the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army in 
February 1991, a marshal in April 1992 and chairman of the 
National Defense Committee in April 1993, taking a firm grip on 
the Armed Forces. The Army has 16 corps, in addition to tank and 
special force commands. 
  According to NAEWOE press, the official North Korea watcher 
here, the North Korean Army has 3,700 tanks, 2,500 armored 
personnel carriers and 9,800 artillery pieces, in addition to 
12,000 anti-aircraft guns. 
  Batteries of 240mm multiple rocket-launching systems are 
intensively deployed along the Western part of the front line. 
Each of these systems can launch 24 rounds of ammunition at a 
target as far as 24 kilometers, and Patriot missiles are 
reportedly not effective against this rapid-fire artillery. 
  North Korea's missile capabilities include AT-3/4 anti-tank 
missiles and improved scud missiles. 
  The special troops of North Korea number 100,000, including 
20,000 paratroopers and special marines. 
  The North Korean Navy has some 700 ships, including 26 
submarines. It recently began improving its fleet of 
submarines, missile ships and torpedo boats. 
  The North Korean Air Force boasts 1,600 aircraft, including 
60 MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighters. 
  North Korea's nuclear capability includes a 4,000-kw 
experimental reactor imported from the former Soviet Union in 
1965, a 3,000-kw reactor completed recently and a 200,000-kw 
reactor under construction. 
  In the 1960s, Pyongyang began developing its chemical and 
biological warfare capabilities. Today, it is known to have gas 
and germ weapons. North Korea has also developed a device 
capable of delivering these horrible weapons to targets in South 
Korea. 
  North Korea is said to be capable of producing 100 improved 
Scud-B missiles with a range of 500 kilometers annually for 
export to Iran and other countries. Now, it is reportedly 
developing a new model with a range of 1,000 kilometers, known 
as the Nodong-1. 
  Noteworthy is that North Korea deploys 65 percent of its 
ground forces, 60 percent of its ships and 40 percent of its Air 
Force below the line drawn between Pyongyang and Wonsan, a 
position close enough to the Demilitarized Zone for the North 
Koreans to launch a blitzkieg on South Korea whenever they want.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry 
instructed commanders of major military units Saturday to stay 
on full alert for North Korean troop movements. 
  Over 50 commanding officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force 
and Joint Chiefs of Staff attended a meeting at the ministry 
held to analyze the latest developments in the North Korean 
nuclear impasse and Pyongyang's military movements. 
  The meeting, presided over by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, 
concluded that North Korea has not showed any signs of forward 
movement but that the North's conventional troops still pose a 
threat of attack. 
  The commanders also decided that North Korea is unlikely to 
abandon its nuclear program despite South Korean-U.S. efforts at 
dialogue, leaving the issue clouded by uncertainty. 
  North Korean aggression cannot be ruled out if the matter is 
referred to the UN Security Council for sanctions, they said. 
  Yi instructed the military to support the government's 
policy 
on resolving the nuclear crisis through dialogue, while 
remaining on full alert to deter any attack and maintaining an 
early warning system in cooperation with the United States. 
  Yi asked the armed forces to prepare for the South 
Korean-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit," scheduled to 
open in November unless the nuclear problem is sufficiently 
defused.

  [Text] The ROK and U.S. Governments are having a 
difference of opinion over the export of the ROK defense 
industry, said officials of the two countries on 21 April. 
  According to ROK and U.S. sources, the ROK Government, via a 
diplomatic channel, has officially asked the United States to 
approve of the ROK's sale of military equipment to other 
countries, However, the United States has showed no reaction so 
far. 
  Under the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on the defense 
industry signed between the two governments, in principle, the 
ROK has to have U.S. approval in order to sell military 
equipment manufactured with U.S. technology to a third country. 
  Pointing out that the details of the MOU were eased in 1982 
and 1989 to pave the way for the ROK to more readily export 
military equipment, the sources said that the recent official 
request was based on this adjustment. 
  The U.S. Government was originally scheduled to respond to 
the ROK Government's request on sales in some 15 fields, 
including artillery of various types and armored personnel 
carriers, to Southeast Asia and Latin America by last February, 
but has yet failed to respond, added the sources.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has 
denied as "unfounded" the foreign press report that South Korea 
had decided to purchase a large amount of American-made 
sophisticated weapons. 
  A Ministry official said on Friday that there were no talks 
at all on the possible purchase of Apache helicopters, Patriot 
missiles and other high-tech weapons from the United States 
during the recent visit to Seoul by U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL of the United States reported that 
during Perry's visit to Seoul, South Korea agreed to buy a host 
of American-made high-tech weapons. 
  "Apart from Perry's visit, we had partially modified the 
Yulgok arms procurement program in a way that places a more 
emphasis on building up our anti-artillery and night-time battle 
ability," the official said.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry has denied reports by domestic 
papers on 22 April citing a foreign press report that 
discussions on the purchase of weapons were held during the 
recent talks between the ROK and U.S. defense ministers and has 
released its official view. 
  After Cho Song-tae, director of the Policy Planning Division 
of the Ministry, explained the truth regarding the report on the 
purchase of weapons, the Defense Ministry distributed to the 
press an official written explanation expressing its position 
and asked the press to support the present ROK-U.S. cooperative 
system, stressing the importance of the system. 
  The Defense Ministry made it clear that both countries' 
ministers did not discuss the purchase of Apache helicopters, 
Patriot missiles, and other latest U.S. weapons during their 
recent talks. 
  The Ministry reported: In an effort to improve its 
capability to cope with an unexpected situation in connection 
with the North Korean nuclear issue, our military has partially 
modified the arms procurement program in the Yulgok Five-Year 
Plan to adjust the timing for the purchase of weapons, placing 
more emphasis on building up our antiartillery and night battle 
ability. However, this has no relation to the recent ROK-U.S. 
talks. 
  Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae explained the 
result 
of the recent talks to reporters in the press room of the 
Defense Ministry and said that there was no discussion on the 
purchase of weapons at the 20 April talks. 
  Prior to this, in a news conference with domestic and 
foreign 
reporters at the Shilla Hotel on 21 April, U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry also said that he and Minister Yi did 
not discuss selling U.S. weapons to the ROK.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chong Yon-chu from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Almost at the same time that the United States 
deployed Patriot missiles to the ROK, the U.S. Defense 
Department made a final decision on 21 April to purchase the 
great-sphere interceptor missile system (Erint), rather than the 
Patriot missiles, as its missile weapon system for defense. 
This was notified to Congress. 
  Since the U.S. Defense Department is the main customer for 
weapons, this decision implies that the Defense Department does 
not plan to purchase Patriot missiles. This is being considered 
as a true death sentence for the Patriot missiles. Raytheon, 
the company that produces Patriot missiles, is faced with a 
difficult situation because of such a decision. It is expected 
that this company will actively increase its activities to 
promote overseas sales of Patriot missiles. 
  Before making a final decision on 21 April, the U.S. Defense 
Department had decided in February to purchase the (Erint) 
missile system rather than the Patriot missiles. However at that 
time, senators and congressmen from Massachusetts, where the 
Raytheon company is located, demanded an objective basis for the 
Defense Department's choice. Therefore, the Defense Department 
formed an independent team to continue to research on this 
matter. 
  This research team concluded that the (Erint) missile is 
more 
effective and has a greater impact than the Patriot missiles in 
intercepting ballistic missiles loaded with chemical and nuclear 
weapons. John Deutch, under secretary of defense, revealed: 
"In accordance with the result of the analysis made by the 
research team and the operational demands, the Defense 
Department concluded that the (Erint) is the best choice." 
  The Patriot missile which was treated like a "hero" during 
the Gulf war received various criticisms on its performance 
after the war. Thus, its myth was dispelled. Moshe Arens, 
Israeli defense minister during the Gulf war said: "The rate of 
hits was only 20 percent." The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology research team harshly criticized the Patriots by 
saying: "The Patriot missile played almost no role at all 
during the Gulf war."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yi Chang-min from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] Quoting the U.S. military and aviation journal AIR 
SPACE DAILY, in a report dispatched from Washington, Japan's 
SANKEI SHIMBUN reported on 23 April that soon after developing 
the Nodong No. 1 missile, North Korea is developing a new 
missile which has a range of up to 6,000 km. 
  According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, there are two types of the new 
missile. This was discovered in February at the North Korean 
Sannudong Research Development Institute through the U.S. 
reconnaissance satellite. Each type consists of two-stage 
rockets [kakkak idanisikuro toeoitta]. 
  The U.S. intelligence authorities stated that the new 
missile 
is named Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2. They estimate that the 
first stage is 18 m long and its diameter is 2.4 m, and the 
second stage is 14 m long and its diameter is 1.3 m. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN reported: "If the range is 6,000 km, Guam as 
well as all of Japan, including Okinawa, can be a target. AIR 
SPACE DAILY reported that if North Korea is successful in 
developing this missile, it will emerge as a big military power 
in the East Asian region." 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN also reported: "Great Britain's military 
journal, JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, reported that the missile North 
Korea is developing has a range of over 2,000 km. However, this 
is the first time it is revealed that its range is in fact 6,000 
km. If North Korea completes the development of this missile, 
the entire East Asian region would be greatly threatened."

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- Contacts between North 
Korea and European banks and businesses have become brisk with 
inter-Korean consultations almost suspended, relevant 
authorities and business sources here said Monday. 
  A few European banks, including ING (Internationale 
Netherlanden Bank M.V.) of the Netherlands, are consulting with 
North Korea on establishing offices in Pyongyang and U.S. 
multinational corporations such as McKinsey Inc. and IBM Corp. 
are trying to advance into the communist state, the sources said. 
  North Korean imports of machinery and social infrastructure 
goods, including telecommunications equipment from Europe, have 
risen sharply from last year, according to the sources. In 
contrast, South-North economic cooperation has made no headway 
since last year as the nuclear dispute has chilled inter-Korean 
relations. 
  North Korea's efforts to get closer to European banks and 
U.S. multinational corporations are designed to revitalize its 
economy by inducing investment and obtaining loans from foreign 
banks and businesses. For example, a North Korean economic 
mission toured European nations including Britain, Germany and 
Austria late last year to hold seminars aimed at attracting 
investment to the Najin-Sonbong special economic zone. Thanks to 
such efforts, foreign banks have begun paying more attention to 
North Korea. 
  ING bank is seeking to establish a liaison office in 
Pyongyang -- a first for Western banks -- while Australia and 
New Zealand (ANZ) bank is pushing for a Pyongyang office to 
secure a bridgehead there. 
  Banks from Britain, Germany and Switzerland are also 
consulting with North Korea, according to the sources. 
  McKinsey Inc. of the United States has contacted North Korea 
through its firms in South Korea, Japan and Europe, and IBM's 
British subsidiary sent staff to the isolated state last summer 
to provide technical training. 
  Thailand dispatched a large-scale economic mission to North 
Korea recently to discuss a 50-year lease at Najin port and to 
secure real estate within the Najin-Sonbong special economic 
zone.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry has opposed 
the Foreign Ministry bid to join the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), which was put into force in January this year 
by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The trade ministry has 
claimed that Korea would suffer more loss than benefit from its 
entry into the trade bloc in an analysis on strategies of world 
trading blocs. 
  The ministry pinpointed four positive aspects if Korea 
joined 
the tripartite agreement but feared greater loss. 
  First of all, the entry would promote competition among 
businesses as it is expected to accelerate the speed of market 
opening and internationalization of domestic companies, the 
analysis said. 
  It forecast that exports to North America would increase as 
a 
result of the scrapping or reduction of tariffs and U.S. 
companies would be promoted to increase investments and 
technology transfer to Korea. 
  Domestic manufacturers could also expect to increase exports 
of raw materials and parts, which are strictly applied to 
"origin of country" regulations, to the three nations, according 
to the ministry. 
  On the other hand, negative effects would be more serious in 
the financial and foreign exchange industry, intellectual 
property rights protection, the farm market, labor and 
environmental sector. 
  The ministry said that U.S. tariff rates will be cut to 4 
percent non average in four years due to the Uruguay Round [UR] 
accord from current 6.2 percent. As a result, the merit from 
tariff cut will be meager, it said. 
  It noted that several items, including garments and musical 
instruments, would benefit from the entry as they are 
competitive in the United States as U.S. duties will be zero to 
bloc members in 10 years. 
  But the ministry analyzed that sluggish export to the United 
States has not resulted from high tariff rates but has derived 
from weakened competitiveness. 
  The domestic agricultural market would be harder hit from 
the 
entry into NAFTA than from the Uruguay Round accord as the 
United States is expected to push ahead with the export of rice, 
beef, orange juice and dairy products to Korea. Now a third of 
Korea's farm imports comes from the three North American nations. 
  Textile exports will grow sharply even if Korea gains NAFTA 
membership as trade of textile products subject to the 
multilateral fiber agreement (MFA) is to be liberalized in 
accordance with the UR accord. 
  Exports of electronics goods and automobiles are expected to 
increase as the country of origin regulations will not be 
strictly applied to member nations. 
  Korea will be obligated to open 77 services markets to U.S. 
firms completely. Financial, telecommunications and 
transportation markets are likely to become the ground of U.S. 
companies in case Korea joins the NAFTA, the ministry said. 
  U.S. high-tech firms in telecommunications equipment, 
medium- 
and large-sized computers, power generation and the environment 
are expected to make inroads into Korea's government procurement 
sector. 
  Korea will also have to remove restrictions on market 
access, 
foreign exchange dealings and investment. 
  The United States is certain to mount pressure to protect 
its 
intellectual property rights through monitoring activities of a 
committee set up under the NAFTA pact. 
  The analysis also pointed out that U.S. manufacturing 
companies would not be attracted here than expected as 
production costs are higher than those in Mexico and other Latin 
American nations in a move to join the body. [sentence as 
published] 
  Based on the analysis, the trade ministry is very cautious 
about its entry into the NAFTA, saying that comprehensive 
measures would have to be drawn up such as formation of a 
special partnership to NAFTA and consolidation of cooperation 
with the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) and the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC). 
  But Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu insisted on two occasions 
early this year that Korea should tie up with NAFTA to avoid 
possible isolation from NAFTA and Southeast Asian economic blocs. 
  At the foreign ministers talks, Han called on his Canadian 
counterpart to help Korea join the NAFTA in February. Mexico 
and Canada have expressed welcome to NAFTA.

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean and 
Chinese trade ministers agreed Monday that Chinese provincial 
governments should use more Korean steel, chemicals, foodstuffs 
and machinery. 
  The agreement came as Trade, Industry and Energy Minister 
Kim 
Chol-su met with visiting Chinese Minister of Internal Trade 
Zhang Haoruo for talks on promoting bilateral economic links. 
  Officials said Kim asked Zhang to open the Chinese market to 
official auto imports from South Korea. He also requested 
China's active interest in allowing South Korea's corporate 
entry into the distribution market since it is linked with 
bilateral trade expansion, officials said. 
  Zhang, in response, said South Korean companies should 
invest 
mainly in improving and building China's distribution network 
including warehouses and marine transport centers. 
  The two trade ministers decided that Seoul would send a 
government-private study team to China around June or July to 
look into the distribution market. 
  They agreed that their governments would fully support the 
planned construction of the Korea business center in Beijing and 
an oil refinery that South Korea's Yukong hopes to build in 
Liangchuan.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Yi Hoe-chang expressed hope Saturday that the government's 
reform policy will succeed. 
  "Otherwise, it will be a big national misfortune. I pray for 
the success of the reform policy," he said. 
  Yi handed in his resignation Friday to President Kim 
Yong-sam 
after expressing discontent over the administration's 
decision-making process on national security and unification 
matters. 
  He told journalists that he had resigned of his own free 
will, denying rumors that the president told him to step down. 
  "A resignation can be expressed verbally, but I wanted to 
make my intentions clear so I followed the formal procedure." 
  Yi said he had once talked about quitting when the dismissal 
of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries minister was 
discussed in connection with the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
because he felt responsibile for not having asked the minister 
to brief him on the UR [Uruguay Round] negotiations. 
  "But the president stopped me from resigning," the former 
judge and chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection said. 
  "I feel regret that I could not carry out goverment policies 
in a composed and full-fledged manner while spending too much 
time and effort on coping with various sudden issues including 
water pollution." 
  Yi added that he has no intention of serving in any other 
public posts.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
almost suffered a heart attack when he saw the early editions of 
Friday morning's newspapers and felt another palpitation while 
watching the evening news on Thursday. He immediately ordered 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang to toe the line. This is what led to 
Yi's dismissal. 
  Local newspapers and TV news all reported Yi's remarks, made 
through his secretary, pointing out the operational and 
technical problems of the Unification-security Policy 
Coordination Committee. President Kim had personally formed the 
committee to erase any images of dissent within the government 
on unification and security. But his prime minister, supposedly 
the No. 2 man, challenged the president by pointing out problems 
with the committee. 
  How could a prime minister dare announce such opinions 
through a secretary, couldn't you wait until our regular meeting 
tomorrow, what did you hope to gain by having your words carried 
in the newspapers?, Kim probably yelled at Yi over the telephone. 
  Such anger revived the president's memory: The violence at 
the Chogye temple broke out while I was away: I had to order a 
thorough investigation because the prime minister failed to take 
charge, Kim most likely muttered to himself. 
  Kim's ire apparently hadn't died out Friday afternoon when 
the two men sat down for their regular briefing session. But 
instead of apologizing, the prime minister only said he had 
acted on behalf of the country and the president, behavior 
deemed consistent for a former judge nicknamed "Bamboo" for his 
strict adherence to the law. 
  So, if we follow the law as you say, who should be 
responsible in case of a power vacuum? Isn't it the prime 
minister?, Kim probably said, clearly indicating that he planned 
to fire Yi. Yi got the message and handed in his resignation as 
soon as he returned to his office. 
  Kim's aide said the president was surprised when Yi walked 
into his office Friday afternoon without a letter of resignation 
after what happened the previous evening. Although the move was 
certainly unexpected to many, insiders had actually been 
predicting it for a long time. 
  Yi, they say, put the brakes on many of the orders that came 
from the presidential office. For instance, Kim said dismissing 
his Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-bae 
was inevitable because he revised South Korea's Uruguay Round 
country schedule despite promising the president he wouldn't. 
  The prime minister challenged this thinking, insisting that 
the country schedule was not revised in any way but only 
"appeared" to have been changed. Yi asked the other cabinet 
ministers to emulate him and pay less attention to the 
presidential office, telling them he would take the 
responsibility when meeting with the press. 
  On some occasions, he bluntly told Chief Presidential 
Secretary Pak Kwan-yong not to meddle and issue orders to the 
cabinet, they say. Yi may wish to call it a resignation, but 
considering the prior series of events, "fired" is the correct 
term.

    [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 23 April 
carry editorials and articles on the resignation of Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang on 22 April, one day after he lashed out 
at the decision-making process of the Kim Yong-sam 
administration by requesting, during a meeting with his senior 
aides on 21 April, that every decision of the administration go 
through prior discussions by the cabinet. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word 
article by reporter Choe Yong-muk entitled "Why Prime Minister 
Yi Hoe-chang Resigned." The article describes the prime 
minister's resignation as "shocking," and notes, "It seems that 
Prime Minister Yi had complained about President Kim's mode of 
managing state affairs and his reform style." The article then 
cites recent episodes that apparently angered the prime minister 
-- the presidential office's habit of belittling and sidelining 
the prime minister's office, such as the instance when the prime 
minister strongly objected to the Presidential Office directive 
on the contents of the prime minister's statement of apology to 
the people in connection with the government's handling of the 
Uruguay Round; the lukewarm investigation of the Samgmudae 
financial scandal; and above all, the manner in which the prime 
minister was sidelined by not being included in the Unification 
and Security Policy Coordinating Meeting. The article 
concludes, "The prime minister must have thought since his 
proposals were flatly ignored, this meant that President Kim 
would not fully recognize the cabinet and instead wanted a 
`quasi-prime minister,' and this was something the prime 
minister could never accept." 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word 
article by reporter Kim Chang-ki entitled "Upright Prime 
Minister Resigns in Four Months--Background and Prospects for 
Future Political Scene." The editorial notes that the prime 
minister's sudden resignation on 22 April has driven the entire 
political situation on alert and says, "The resignation of a 
prime minister in this manner is very unusual and thrusts the 
Kim Yong-sam government into suddenly having to confront a 
surging wave of problems. In particular, since the Kim Yong-sam 
government that was launched under the signboard of reform 
selected Prime Minister Yi, the virtual star of reforms and the 
standard-bearer of audits and inspections, his resignation must 
come as a serious blow and burden to the Kim Yong-sam 
government. This must compel President Kim to modify his style 
of managing state affairs and to reconsider his policy options." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Prime Minister's Sudden Resignation." 
The editorial begins, "The prime minister's sudden resignation 
is very shocking. It is far from an ordinary development 
because Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang has resigned within four 
months of his assumption of office and because his resignation 
resulted from his complaint about the government's management of 
state affairs." The editorial then notes, "Whatever the 
background and reason for his resignation may be, the prime 
minister's resignation is causing considerable damage to 
President Kim Yong-sam's personnel policy. President Kim 
Yong-sam must have been aware of Mr. Yi Hoe-chang's strong 
convictions and upright character when choosing him." The 
editorial concludes, "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation 
brings up the old issue in which the prime minister is put in a 
difficult position regarding his role and maneuverability under 
a president-centered form of government. Nevertheless, the 
prime minister's control over the cabinet and his policy 
coordinating role should be enhanced. For this, the prime 
minister's authority should be respected." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's 
Convictions." The editorial begins, "It is a shocking 
development that Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, who is noted for 
his uncompromising convictions, should have suddenly resigned on 
22 April." The editorial notes Prime Minister Yi's strong 
complaint about the way the Unification and Security Policy 
Coordinating Committee was run and his resolve to restore the 
authority and function of the prime minister and the cabinet, 
which the presidential office regard as a challenge to the 
presidential office." The editorial then notes that the people 
were glad to see a prime minister of conviction who differed 
from previous rubber-stamping prime ministers who are referred 
to as "prime ministers who only read what someone else has 
written for them" and "powerless madams," but that he had to 
leave office before being able to put his convictions into 
practice. The editorial asserts that his resignation will 
provide a fresh jolt to the world where many are changing their 
convictions to hold on to their posts." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "The Sudden Replacement of the Prime 
Minister." The editorial begins: "The sudden reprimand to and 
replacement of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the ensuing 
sudden appointment of Yi Yong-tok, the acting prime minister, is 
an unusual development that shocks and perplexes the people. It 
is certainly unfortunate that the president should have 
reprimanded the prime minister for his irregular words and 
actions and fired him. Nevertheless, we positively evaluate the 
president's swift action in appointing a replacement to launch a 
new cabinet instead of concealing the problem, which is an 
expression of an active will to turn the misfortune to an 
advantage." The editorial notes the need for the government to 
establish order and discipline, and rebukes Prime Minister Yi 
for his unprudent words and actions openly revealing his 
complaint about the operation of the Unification and Security 
Policy Coordinating Committee. The editorial concludes: "Prime 
Minister Yi's resignation should not be construed as a 
deterioration of reform. We must support the president's 
resolve in executing state affairs productively and efficiently 
in harmony and team work to fully utilize the advantage of the 
year without elections." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
900-word 
editorial entitled "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's Sudden 
Resignation--the Retreat of a `Law-Upholding Man' Could Mean a 
Return to Conservatism." 
  The editorial begins: "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden 
resignation is an incident of grave importance leading the 
people into uneasy worries, not to mention the fact that it will 
deal the Kim Yong-sam regime a political blow." The editorial 
notes: "Prime Minister Yi had an upright character and held 
convictions upholding the law, commanding high popularity with 
the people. The people expected that he would excellently carry 
out his role as a coordinator in the government to augment the 
clumsy execution of power of the civilian government." The 
editorial continues: "It is quite natural that we should be led 
to suspect that the prime minister's sudden resignation may 
reflect the problems in President Kim's ruling style and his 
mode of executing state affairs. Therefore, his resignation 
could lead the people to suspect that the government is 
abandoning the law-abiding ethos and returning to the old 
practice of looking for expediency in violation of the law, thus 
damaging the civilian government's resolve for reform and 
political morality." 
  The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN carries on 
page 
2 a 1,500-word article entitled "The Greatest Political 
Crisis--Striving To Find a Way Out." The article begins: 
"Political circles regard the contingency created by the 
resignation of the prime minister unprecedented in the 
constitutional history as the greatest political crisis facing 
the Kim Yong-sam government, and are striving to find a way out 
of this crisis." The article notes a comment by an unidentified 
senior official of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party that `The 
sudden resignation of the prime minister could kindle a fire to 
the disharmony lurking within the ruling camp. The opposition 
parties and other forces critical of the government will 
initiate a political offensive, which could lead to the 
discussion of an overall realignment of political circles.'" The 
article then notes the comment by the opposition Democratic 
Party that `Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden resignation 
well reveals President Kim Yong-sam's weak personnel policy.'" 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Replacement of the Prime Minister in Four 
Months." The editorial begins: "It is regrettable that Mr. Yi 
Hoe-chang resigned as prime minister in only four months since 
he assumed office. Different from the former prime ministers 
who were described as a `powerless madame' and a `prime minister 
who only read what someone else wrote for him,' he played a 
central role in the cabinet with his convictions and 
demonstrated his competence and reasonableness in coping with 
various difficult pending issues of the country." The editorial 
continues: "We think it is a troublesome development that the 
replacement of the prime minister was made very abruptly and 
that Prime Minister Yi resigned because of the difference of his 
view from that of the presidential office over the policy-making 
process. Yi Hoe-chang's resignation means not only replacing 
the prime minister himself, but the resignation of all the 
cabinet members he recommended and the formation of a new 
cabinet, which is an enormous state event. The abrupt action of 
this magnitude not only shocks the entire society, but is 
undesirable for the stable operation of state affairs." The 
editorial concludes: "The uproarious replacement of the prime 
minister has to be a political blow to President Kim. President 
Kim, who professed personnel action to be a matter of foremost 
importance, appointed a new prime minister for the third time in 
one year and two months and is to reshuffle the cabinet in four 
months. This must burden him. We urge the government to 
reestablish as soon as possible the posture for stable execution 
of state affairs."

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) decided Saturday to resist Unification 
Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime minister at a 
National Assembly session to approve the premier-designate, a DP 
leader said. 
  Emerging from a meeting of senior party lawmakers, Acting 
Chairman Kim Won-ki also told reporters that the DP would call 
for the entire cabinet's resignation. 
  "The Constitution requires that the cabinet be appointed 
through the recommendation of the prime minister. Moreover, the 
resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, according to the 
announcement of Chongwadae [presidential office], is something 
like reprehension. So the cabinet must resign en masse in 
consideration of the spirit of the Constitution and the mistakes 
made by the incumbent cabinet," said Kim. 
  The major opposition party also decided to take issue with 
the constitutional, political and even moral procedures of Yi's 
resignation before dealing with the approval of the new prime 
minister at the National Assembly. 
  According to Kim, the DP will demand that the National 
Assembly convene a separate, full assembly session to discuss 
Lee's resignation. The demand will be made during Monday's 
National Assembly meeting, called to handle the Sangmudae 
scandal involving suspected bribery in the relocation of 
military facilities in Kwangju, the southwestern provincial 
capital. 
  Kim also cited the poor performance of Prime 
Minister-Designate Yi while serving as unification minister as 
the party's reason for opposing his appointment. 
  DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, now on a U.S. tour, will return to 
Seoul Monday to tackle the volatile domestic political 
situation, Kim said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Following the abrupt 
resignation of Yi Hoe-chang as prime minister Friday afternoon, 
public attention shifted Saturday to the timing and scope of the 
inevitable cabinet reshuffle that is expected within a few days. 
Stunned by the unexpected end of the Yi Hoe-chang cabinet after 
only 128 days, top government and ruling party officials awaited 
follow-up measures by President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Kim has already designated deputy prime minister and head of 
the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok as his new 
prime minister after accepting Yi Hoe-chang's resignation. The 
president must now fill the NUB post and possibly reshuffle a 
number of cabinet ministers. 
  Keen public interest is focusing on who will replace Yi 
Yong-tok at the NUB. The first name mentioned by many analysts 
is Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong, who is widely 
recognized as an expert on North Korean affairs. In addition to 
this expertise, Pak is a good bet for the deputy premiership 
given his stature at Chongwadae [presidential office] and within 
the ruling circle. 
  A spate of misjudgements, confusion and questionable 
decisions has plagued diplomatic and national security policy 
since the inauguration of the Kim administration in February 
last year. Pak is among the very few deemed able to straighten 
out the situation as he has stayed close to Kim Yong-sam over 
the past 14 months. He has not only assisted the president on 
unification and other inter-Korean problems but also served as 
"a bridge" among the various ministries. 
  In this regard, Pak is highly qualified for the job of 
deputy 
premier and head of the National Unification Board, some senior 
officials at the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] believe. 
Others in the DLP, however, say that the current situation was 
created by the prime minister's resignation alone, and therefore 
replacing Yi Hoe-chang should be enough. The president should 
not change his chief secretary, they add. 
  Along with Pak Kwan-yong's immediate future, attention is 
also centering on the scope and timing of the cabinet reshuffle. 
A lot depends on whether Pak remains at Chongwadae, however. If 
the chief presidential secretary stays on, many observers 
believe that two or three ministers, including the deputy 
premier, will be changed. 
  Speculation has it that Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui could 
take over the NUB portfolio. In that event, there is a slight 
chance that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and the senior 
presidential secretary for foreign and national security 
affairs, Chong Chae-uk, who have both contributed to confusion 
in the government's foreign and North Korea policy, could be 
replaced. 
  One senior ruling party official pointed out that since the 
current cabinet was formed only five months ago, the president 
will probably just patch it up a bit. If Yi Yong-tok is quickly 
approved as prime minister by the National Assembly on Monday, 
Kim is expected to present his credentials on the same day and 
go right to work on a limited cabinet shake-up, he said. But 
since the Democratic Party has already said it will resist Yi 
Yong-tok's appointment, it is difficult to speculate what kind 
of "card" President Kim might use to overcome such opposition, 
sources say. If parliamentary approval of the new prime minister 
is delayed, the scope of the cabinet reshuffle will likely 
increase, they said.

<F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Un-chan] </F>
  [Text] Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, who is 
visiting the United States, held an emergency news conference in 
Washington on 22 April regarding the resignation of Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang. He demanded the resignation of the 
entire cabinet and decided to return home the day after tomorrow 
[25 April]. He was originally scheduled to return on 2 May. 
  Chairman Yi Ki-taek asserted that President Kim Yong-sam's 
acceptance of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation can be 
interpreted as the president's distrust in the cabinet and 
demanded the resignation of the entire cabinet to show that all 
the ministers are responsible. 
  Chairman Yi Ki-taek clearly opposed the National Assembly's 
appointment of acting Prime Minister Yi by saying that the new 
acting Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok has no administrative 
experience and is too conservative and that a competent and 
progressive new figure should be elected as prime minister. 
  Branding the resignation of the prime minister due to a 
disagreement between the president and the prime minister as a 
national misfortune, Chairman Yi strongly denounced President 
Kim's personnel policy.

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) decided Monday to withdraw its demand for 
the government to form a coalition cabinet. 
  Kim Won-ki, a member of the party's supreme committee, said 
the panel had discussed the demand, which party chairman Yi 
Ki-taek expressed to reporters on the plane carrying him back 
from the United States, and agreed to cancel it. 
  "We talked about the coalition cabinet but reached the 
conclusion that this is not the appropriate time to make such a 
demand. Our party has no plans to mention the demand anymore," 
he said. 
  Chairman Yi had urged President Kim Yong-sam to disband his 
cabinet, set up a pan-national crisis management organ and form 
a coalition cabinet.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Korea Exchange Bank 
President Ho Chun resigned Saturday for allegedly tampering with 
the bidding price for the public auction of 
soon-to-be-privatized Korea Telecom [KT] stocks. Ho, who took 
up the post in June last year, handed in his resignation at a 
board meeting with Managing Director Yi Chang-u to act on his 
behalf until a replacement is named. 
  Korea Exchange Bank, commissioned by KT to receive bids for 
its shares, nevertheless took part in the two-day public bidding 
from Monday and allegedly used inside information to match the 
lowest offer. Just before the application deadline, the 
Exchange Bank bid for 900,000 shares at 34,800 won per share 
with a deposit of 3.13 billion won. The price reportedly 
matched the successful lowest bid. 
  Rumors then spread fast that the bank, taking advantage of 
inside information, knew in advance about the bidding price by 
examining the offers of investors. Amidst public criticism, the 
bank withdrew on Thursday after falsely claiming it had lost the 
bid by pledging 34,600 won, 200 won off its actual bid price. 
It announced that the successful figure was 34,700 won and that 
it lost because it offered a lower price, despite its 
application to the Bank of Korea showing a bid price of 34,800 
won. 
  Ho explained the situation to reporters Friday and again 
lied 
while admitting the false announcement. He showed reporters the 
manipulated computer data stating 34,600 won as the bank's bid.

<F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen urged Japan to do more to stimulate domestic demand in a 
meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Sunday, 
a senior U.S. official said. The U.S. treasury official said 
Bentsen "urged Japan to do more to stimulate domestic demand and 
to bring down the (trade) surplus" during talks with Fujii. 
  Fujii, however, emerged from the meeting saying the U.S. had 
not made any particularly strong requests. 
  The 30-minute talks were held at the Treasury Department 
ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from 
the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in the afternoon. 
  Bentsen "also emphasized the importance of steps by Japan to 
open up its financial services and insurance markets to foreign 
competition," the official said, suggesting an unchanged U.S. 
stance to await further Japanese moves to restart the stalled 
"framework" trade talks. 
  The treasury official termed that talks "useful" for 
reviewing bilateral developments prior to the G-7 gathering. 
  Both sides declined to reveal what Bentsen and Fujii 
discussed about exchange rates. 
  Fujii said he told Bentsen that the record 15.25 trillion 
yen 
stimulus package adopted by the Japanese Government in February 
is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually showing 
brightness" and is not as weak as the recent projections by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  The IMF predicted in its twice-yearly world economic outlook 
that Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic 
product (GDP) would be 0.7 percent in 1994. The Japanese 
Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994. 
  Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most 
of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the 
current state of the Japanese economy. 
  They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be 
formed when Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is elected premier 
will continue the policy of deregulating the Japanese economy 
and carrying out economic reform. 
  The Japanese finance minister said he also explained that a 
policy accord newly reached Friday by the coalition parties 
endorsed the direction for "comprehensive" tax reform to be 
decided in June and enacted by the end of the year. 
  Regarding the framework trade talks with the United States, 
Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of 
Japan- U.S. relations and Japan's desire to resume the talks as 
soon as possible. 
  Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started 
to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank 
in yen terms last year, the officials said.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister </F>
and deputy prime minister, and commentator Naoki Tanaka, both in 
NHK's Tokyo studio, and Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), and Osamu Uno, 
chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation, via relay from 
Osaka; from the "Sunday Discussion" program moderated by NHK 
commentator Takashi Yamamoto -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Yamamoto] Good morning. 
  [Hata] Good morning. 
  [Yamamoto] I understand, Mr. Hata, you have long said that 
you had no intention of becoming a politician. However, Mr. 
Hata, you are now going to become the chief executive running 
the state administration. How do you feel at the moment? 
  [Hata] Well, in my career as a politician, I have always 
tried to challenge my own destiny. In greeting the new 
situation, I once again keenly feel that heavy responsibilities 
will rest on my shoulders. Frankly speaking, this is how I feel 
now. [passage omitted on discussion of various issues such as 
early enactment of budget bill, dual power structure, tax 
reform, and Hata's relationship with Ichiro Ozawa] 
  [Yamamoto] As foreign minister, Mr. Hata, you have been 
directly engaged in dealing with Japan-U.S. relations. You must 
have a better understanding of the points at issue than anyone 
else. Do you have any plans to make new proposals for taking 
concrete measures to reduce the trade surplus or deal with other 
issues? 
  [Hata] First, it has just been mentioned that Japan-U.S. 
relations are deadlocked at this moment. I discussed this issue 
with Mr. Gore, and also with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in 
Marrakech recently. We have agreed that each of our two 
countries has now come to realize wherein lie the points at 
issue and major differences in our awareness, and at the same 
time we have come to understand well what each other has to say. 
  However, as has been pointed out just now, it will take some 
time to arrive at a conclusion because these issues involve 
individual sectors. In this sense, frankly speaking I felt that 
they are concerned with macroeconomic issues, too. Therefore, 
as has just been pointed out, there exist such problems as what 
measures should be taken to expand domestic demands and to 
promote imports. However, I feel we should not believe that 
measures for expanding domestic demands or promoting imports 
should be taken merely for the purpose of reducing the trade 
surplus. On the contrary, if we tackle these issues from the 
viewpoint that these measures will also contribute to the 
improvement of the people's livelihood, I am sure we will be 
able to win understanding, and even the other side's 
understanding. 
  As has been mentioned, these measures should be applicable 
also to other areas such as European and Asian countries. If 
they should be applicable merely to issues existing between 
Japan and the United States, a question will then arise: Why 
was it necessary for GATT talks to be held recently? I believe 
that in tackling these issues, attention must be paid to these 
factors. [passage omitted on Tanaka's remarks on increase in 
investment] 
  [Tanaka] Incidentally, there is an item on deregulation in 
the recently-signed document on the items for confirmation in 
establishing the new coalition administration. However, the 
expression seems to indicate retrogression as compared with the 
statement in the Administrative Reform Outlines [ARO] published 
last February. It merely says that market revitalization should 
be promoted through extensive easing of excessive economic 
regulations. No mention was made on the original ARO statement 
which says economic regulations should be abolished in principle. 
  Does this indicate that there is retrogression in the ARO 
principle because of various factors such as bureaucrats' 
influence or pressure from individual industrial organizations? 
  [Hata] No. It is so stated as a brief expression but I 
believe there is no such influence or pressure. As a cabinet 
member, I have stated my views at various meetings, including 
panel sessions on this issue sponsored by industrial circles on 
some occasions. Executives of some industrial organizations 
have even called for implementing deregulation, maintaining that 
they are now determined because they understand that in easing 
or abolishing economic regulations, some circles are bound to be 
hit hard but that a society genuinely filled with vitality can 
never be created without overcoming such difficulties. In fact, 
just recently I made these remarks at a meeting held about a 
week or 10 days before my tour to Marrakech. [passage omitted 
on Uno's remarks on administrative reform] 
  [Yamagishi] I also have something to say. I agree with 
your opinion. After all, it is not good for the future of Japan 
if it continues to be the only nation in the world with a huge 
trade surplus. It is necessary for Japan not only to cut its 
trade surplus but also to promote a shift from an external 
demand-oriented economy to a domestic demand-oriented one. 
Japan is called a nation with high nominal wages but low real 
wages. Why is this so? It is because commodity prices are high 
in this nation. In particular, housing and food prices are very 
high compared with those in Europe and the United States. It is 
a stark fact that price gaps exist between Japan and other 
countries. The government needs to promote thorough 
deregulation to rectify the price gaps. Mr. Hata just explained 
the policy platform agreed upon by the ruling parties. I 
receive this platform positively because I believe it has been 
formulated based on the agreement on the abolition of economic 
regulations reached when the Hosokawa cabinet was inaugurated. 
But it will not be easy to promote it. It is certain that 
bureaucrats will strongly oppose deregulation. In that case, 
the prime minister will be asked to exercise leadership. 
  I recently met with a senior official of the ruling 
coalition 
who is a defector from the Liberal Democratic Party. He said 
that at the change of cabinet, the new prime minister should 
obtain letters of resignation from bureaucrats such as 
administrative vice ministers so that he can dismiss them if 
they do not give devoted service to the cabinet. I sincerely 
hope Mr. Hata will exercise powerful leadership. 
  [Yamamoto] Let us again hear Mr. Hata's resolve to exercise 
leadership as prime minister. 
  [Hata] I totally agree with what all of you have said. I 
met with the chief cabinet secretary and others this morning. 
In the meeting, they said nothing would change unless the new 
cabinet promotes deregulation. They expressed anxiety about the 
future of Japan's society and economy, and asked me to seriously 
consider what they said. We are fully aware of what you have 
pointed out. We also know from experience what will prevent the 
government from promoting deregulation. Keeping in mind what 
you have said, we will exercise leadership. 
  [Uno] I am glad that Mr. Hata agrees with us about 
deregulation. There is another issue coupled with deregulation. 
That is decentralization of political power. It has been said 
that the number of regulations should be cut through 
deregulation, and that of the remaining regulations, those which 
are related to people's living should be enforced by local 
governments. What is important in promoting decentralization is 
to clarify the roles to be played by the central government, 
local governments, bureaucrats, and the private sector. The 
government's tasks include tackling diplomatic, security, and 
financial issues. I hope the government gives more effort to 
this task. Other issues which can be handled by the private 
sector or those related to people's living should be taken care 
of by local governments. I sincerely hope the government will 
promote decentralization by all means. I believe the former 
Hosokawa government was considering enacting legislation for 
deregulation. Also, ruling and opposition parties unanimously 
adopted resolutions on decentralization at both the upper and 
lower houses last June. Thus, I hope the new cabinet will 
continue efforts for decentralization. 
  [Yamamoto] Now, we will move on to the Korean peninsula 
issue. Mr. Uno earlier used the word Hokusen. It is not the 
right name. The correct name is the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea. Well, we have outlined the main points of 
the coalition parties' fundamental policies. One of them is 
that they would abide by UN policies on the Korean issue. Does 
this mean that the government will give all-out cooperation to 
the United Nations if it decides to impose economic sanctions 
against North Korea? 
  [Hata] Generally speaking, yes. However, it is said that 
the United Nations wants to settle the issue through dialogue 
while being considerate to the DPRK. I should not comment 
further on this matter. 
  [Tanaka] The issue of Japan's cooperation with the United 
States and the ROK [in time of emergency] was also talked about 
at the coalition parties' policy meeting. But, the discussion 
became complicated because the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] wanted to include China in the cooperative ties between 
Japan, the United States, and the ROK. Eventually, an agreement 
was reached to drop China. Does that mean the coalition does 
not want China to be involved in critical matters of security 
because the United States and the ROK are involved? Was the 
priority order revealed, so to speak? 
  [Hata] No, I do not think so. We are allies bound by the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S.-ROK Security Treaty. As I 
have been saying, China has the strongest influence over the 
DPRK when it comes to the issue of nuclear arms development. 
China does not appreciate the existence of nuclear weapons on 
the Korean peninsula. After all, we must have discussions with 
China. I think the meeting did not adopt a resolution on this 
issue but a chairman's statement was announced instead because 
of China's influential power. 
  [Tanaka] Japan and the United States talked about the issue 
of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development when Les 
Aspin, then U.S. secretary of state, visited Japan last fall. 
Of late, William Perry came to Japan and you had discussions 
with him on the nuclear issue. Was the U.S. secretary of 
defense very much worried about the North Korean nuclear issue? 
  [Hata] Well, I do not think the situation on the Korean 
peninsula is such that war can break out at the slightest 
provocation. However, North Korea has to accept the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections to dispel the 
suspicion. Otherwise, the suspicion will continue to grow in the 
international arena. 
  The United States has deployed Patriot interceptor missiles 
in South Korea to be prepared for possible attack from North 
Korea. We are preparing for the worst. Fundamentally, however, 
we want to settle the issue through dialogue. 
  [Tanaka] Is the U.S. Government saying that Japan should 
clarify how it will deal with the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms development? 
  [Hata] No. The United States clearly understands that Japan 
will deal with the issue within the scope of the Constitution. 
Also, it is said that the United States is highly assessing the 
fact that Japan is holding discussions with China and other 
countries to settle the issue. Therefore, we think that the 
United States and Japan clearly understand each other's stand. 
  [Yamamoto] It is possible that the United States and the ROK 
may want Japan to stop the remittance of money to North Korea 
even if the United Nations does not decide to impose economic 
sanctions against North Korea. Can you comment on this? 
  [Hata] The United Nations still has not taken up the issue 
of economic sanctions as a topic of discussion. Therefore, we 
should not talk about something that is an assumption based on 
assumptions. Also, I am still only a foreign minister. 
Generally speaking, however, we will deal with the situation, 
if anything should happen, within the scope of the Constitution. 
  [Yamamoto] One of the fundamental policies states that the 
government will be prepared for an emergency case. Does the 
emergency case mean military action? 
  [Hata] North Korea is saying that economic sanctions will be 
considered as a de facto declaration of war against it. 
Probably, discussions were made within this context. 
  [Tanaka] Do you think Japan will have no choice but to take 
further action to confine North Korean nuclear weapons if the 
United States says, after the United Nations adopts a 
resolution, that it has no choice but to assume a clearer stance 
to confine North Korea's nuclear weapons? 
  [Hata] Well, I should not comment on this matter either. 
Generally speaking, however, some countries in other regions are 
succumbing to the temptation of possessing nuclear weapons. 
Therefore, the nuclear issue, if North Korea has actually 
developed nuclear weapons, will have an impact on these 
countries. Not only the United States but also European 
countries are interested in the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development. Japan, in particular, is North 
Korea's neighboring country so we just cannot take it easy. We 
have to say that North Korea, no matter what, should not be 
allowed to develop nuclear weapons. 
  [Yamamoto] Now, I would like to ask you about imminent 
issues. Do you think it is difficult to make a large-scale 
cabinet reshuffle because budget deliberations have to start 
soon? 
  [Hata] It is hard for me to comment on this matter because I 
am not yet prime minister. Generally speaking, the most ideal 
way is for the ministers who were involved in mapping out the 
budget draft to deal with this matter. However, since we will 
be forming a coalition cabinet, I think we have to listen to the 
opinions of each party. We will deal with this matter by taking 
these factors into consideration. 
  [Yamamoto] As we have been discussing, the next 
administration will be confronted with many important tasks. 
Therefore, some members of Shinseito are of the opinion that you 
should have a strong cabinet lineup. 
  [Hata] Every party has different opinions within itself. I 
think the current cabinet is composed of prominent people. 
However, there are different movements in each party. 
Therefore, we need to have a firm understanding of the 
situation to deal with the important tasks if we continue to 
remain in power. 
  [Yamamoto] The leaders of all coalition parties, except for 
the SDPJ, are in the cabinet. Do you think [SDPJ Chairman] 
Murayama will join the next cabinet? 
  [Hata] Again, I can only give you a general opinion. If we 
become a governing party, then...[changing thought] Originally, 
we agreed that party leaders would become cabinet members. If 
they are cabinet members, then we can meet each other every day. 
  [Yamamoto] You can have a party leaders' meeting every day? 
  [Hata] That's right. In that sense, I may ask Murayama to 
join the cabinet. However, the SDPJ may have its own idea. 
  [Yamamoto] Do you want him to join your cabinet? 
  [Hata] Judging from previous examples, I think you can say 
that. 
  [Yamamoto] The Hosokawa cabinet had some problems with the 
chief cabinet secretary. What do you think of the role of chief 
cabinet secretary? 
  [Hata] It is desirable if the chief cabinet secretary shares 
the same views as the prime minister. 
  [Yamamoto] You mean he should play a role of supporting the 
prime minister? 
  [Hata] Yes. The chief cabinet secretary is the prime 
minister's spokesman. 
  [Yamamoto] They should be on intimate terms. 
  [Hata] That's right. 
  [Yamamoto] Does that mean the chief cabinet secretary will 
be selected from among the Shinseito members? 
  [Hata] Well, I still am not prime minister yet. I can only 
answer you in a general way on this matter too. 
  [Yamamoto] You will also have to select a new foreign 
minister, your successor. It is a very important post. Do you 
think factions will be an important factor in selecting your 
successor? 
  [Hata] I do not think so. We are in the coalition so that I 
should make no bones about such things. However, we need to 
choose a suitable person for the post. 
  [Tanaka] I heard that many current ministers will remain in 
their posts. If that is so, then are you going to ask your 
ministers to take a clear leadership role to promote 
administrative reform? As has been said before, your cabinet 
will be calling for free economic activities, in principle, and 
thereby allowing the private sector to display its own vital 
power. Are you going to tell your ministers to play a 
leadership role at each critical moment? 
  [Hata] Needless to say, I have to do that if I am in such a 
position. As I said earlier, this is an issue which can be done 
only at the time of administration change. No zoku [group of 
people concerned with specific issues] exists, and members share 
the same intention when a new administration is formed. 
Therefore, that will be a good change to do what you have just 
said. Also, a direction for decentralization of the government 
can be set only at that time. 
  [Tanaka] The voters will critically evaluate your cabinet 
lineup. As prime minister, are you going to tell your ministers 
how you will evaluate their performance? Did any prime minister 
give such an instruction to his cabinet members before? 
  [Hata] When I became agriculture, forestry and fisheries 
minister, I was told to do everything as I wished because I had 
been doing what I was expected to do. 
  [Tanaka] Are you going to say the same thing to your 
ministers? 
  [Hata] If I become a prime minister, I will ask my ministers 
to do their best. 
  [Yamamoto] Since politics is changing significantly, some 
people, needless to say, may say that the new administration 
should listen to the people's opinions as soon as possible. 
What do you think of holding a general election? 
  [Hata] During the previous general election, the voters 
criticized the closed nature of politics. Another thing is that 
they wanted to see changes in Japanese politics. Somebody said 
earlier that nothing has changed. Well, the LDP became an 
opposition party and former opposition parties became ruling 
parties. I suppose it appeared strange to the people at the 
beginning. However, when you look around coolly, you will note 
that things are changing significantly. 
  [Yamamoto] Does that mean that the next election will be 
held under the new system? It will not be held under the 
current medium-sized precinct system? 
  [Hata] Fundamentally, I do not think that we should not 
restrict the prime minister's right to dissolve a cabinet. In 
this sense, it is possible that a general election can be held 
under the current system. However, we survived the previous 
election so that we have a general idea of what the people want. 
We need to respond to people's expectations. It is not the 
time to think about dissolving the cabinet now. [passage omitted 
on remarks by Uno and Yamagishi] 
  [Yamamoto] Somebody said earlier that you should make a new 
ministerial post in charge of international relations. What do 
you think of this proposal? 
  [Hata] Again, I have to speak on the assumption that I am in 
the position of forming a new cabinet. Anyhow, it will be 
difficult to do so if we have a double power structure. I know 
that some people are of the opinion that I should create the new 
ministerial post. However, I still do not have a clear plan for 
forming the new post. 
  [Yamamoto] The time is up. Thank you very much for being 
with us today.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Outgoing Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, who is virtually certain to become premier later 
in the day, repeated suggestions Monday that he may ask Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to join the 
new cabinet. 
  Hata also indicated at a press conference after an 
extraordinary cabinet meeting, where the eight-month-old cabinet 
of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, that the changes 
in the new cabinet will be small to middle-scale. 
  Hata said that "in general," it is better to have heads of 
coalition parties in the cabinet to reflect the parties' 
opinions, indicating he may ask Murayama to join the cabinet. 
There were six SDP cabinet ministers in the Hosokawa government 
but Murayama did not hold any cabinet post. 
  Hata, who was also deputy premier in the Hosokawa 
administration, said that in principle, it is desirable for the 
ministers who helped compiled the fiscal 1994 budget bill to 
remain in the cabinet and respond to upcoming Diet 
interpellations on the budget. 
  Reviewing his eight-month-long tenure as foreign minister, 
Hata said he felt the world expected Japan to speak up more on 
the international scene. 
  Japan could make various proposals on problems such as 
population, environment, AIDS, disarmament and arms control, he 
said. 
  Hata also said foreign ministers should not change so often 
and that he regrets he was only able to hold the post for eight 
months. 
  He also said Japan should push ahead with deregulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The formation of newly 
elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet was delayed Monday 
[25 April] because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) reacted 
sharply to the abrupt establishment of a new 130-legislator 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives that 
excludes the party. 
  An intracoalition standoff intensified a few hours after the 
Diet voted to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata, 
58, to power as the replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," 
comprises Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two splinter groups that 
recently defected from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
-- the Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai. 
  By incorporating former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, the 
parliamentary strength of the new camp shot up to 130. 
Yamaguchi himself is an LDP rebel. The group's strength has 
already dwarfed the SDP's strength of 74. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, blasted the 
sudden 
attempt to alter the coalition's makeup for betraying the SDP, 
which was the largest contingent in the ruling coalition. 
  The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five 
political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by 
the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new 
unified party, political analysts said. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito 
counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally proposed such a 
convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming general election 
under the newly legislated electoral system, which has 
introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation. 
  The leaders of the coalition were originally scheduled to 
begin talks on the formation of a second coalition at 4 P.M. 
[0700 GMT] but the SDP's rage apparently delayed the start of 
the consultations for more than four hours until SDP Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama went to the premier's official residence at 
8:30 P.M. However, Murayama walked out of the meeting 18 
minutes later to discuss his party's response at the SDP 
Headquarters. 
  The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi told DSP legislators the coalition parties should initiate 
such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support base" for 
the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier one of the 
chief critics of such a move. 
  Kubo, the SDP's chief strategist, told reporters, however, 
"it is a universal rule to live by the etiquette based on mutual 
trust and obligations. It is outrageous for them to suddenly 
initiate this move on the very day of a cabinet formation 
despite the fact that the SDP has cooperated with other 
coalition partners in running the government until today," Kubo 
said. 
  Ouchi later told a news conference, "the reason why we have 
to establish the parliamentary group to back up the new prime 
minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point 
policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties." 
  The platform was created after two weeks of squabbles and 
standoffs since Hosokawa suddenly announced his resignation 
April 8. 
  Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary 
base to support the prime minister and we put together parties 
that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to 
enlist all the parties immediately into the new group."

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Tsutomu Hata was 
elected prime minister Monday [25 April] by Japan's bicameral 
Diet, as Japan faces such crucial issues as a trade row with the 
United States, tax reform and the suspected North Korean 
development of nuclear weapons. 
  Hata, 58, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core 
party in the coalition, became Japan's 51st premier and the 
sixth prime minister in five years, succeeding Morihiro 
Hosokawa, 56. [passage omitted] 
  Later in a meeting with Shinseito legislators, Hata appealed 
for greater allegiance, saying "Japan is facing difficult times 
domestically and internationally." He was apparently referring 
to the recession, trade tensions with the United States and the 
North Korean nuclear issue. "If Japan made a wrong policy 
choice, it would plunge into an abyss and historians (of the 
future) will look back and say there used to be a country named 
Japan," Hata warned. 
  He hinted, however, that he would not lead Japan to take a 
high profile role in U.N. peacekeeping efforts, saying, "I am 
not asserting that the Japanese should go abroad carrying 
bazookas on their shoulders." 
  LDP president Kono called on Hata to step up efforts for 
political reform to restore the credibility of Japanese politics. 
  "I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's 
distrust in politics," Kono told reporters. "I heard the ruling 
coalition say repeatedly that it should follow through on 
promised political reform in order to restore the credibility of 
politics," Kono said. 
  Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP urged the 
governing coalition to live up to its vow to implement policies 
earlier agreed upon as a policy platform. "I want the Hata 
administration to carry out policies which were worked out by 
Shinseito," said Watanabe, who threatened in mid-April to leave 
the party in a bid to seek the premiership, hoping for backing 
from some of the ruling coalition. The leader of the LDP's 
third-largest faction said, "we will extend our support for (the 
Hata administration's) policies that could help our country, 
while withholding support for any policies that could not."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's exiting industrial 
and economic planning chiefs called Monday for the new 
government to carry on with deregulation and consumer-based 
reforms. 
  After a morning cabinet meeting in which Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet resigned en masse, Hiroshi Kumagai, 
head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), 
said the survival of Japan's economy depends on further 
deregulation. 
  "Japan has taken only the first step in its deregulation 
efforts," Kumagai said. "The fire for reforms built up by Mr. 
Hosokawa should not be extinguished." 
  Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), urged the new government, to be headed by outgoing 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, to put priority on consumers. 
She said that while promoting deregulation and other reforms, 
the new government should focus on such issues as seeing that 
the benefits of the high yen are passed on to consumers and 
repeated that income tax cuts to stimulate the economy should 
precede an offsetting hike in such indirect levies as the 
consumption tax. 
  Political sources speculated that Kumagai will keep his post 
as MITI minister under Hata. Kubota said she had heard nothing 
of her own prospects. 
  On trade issues, Kumagai hinted at perplexity on new U.S. 
proposals to restart stalled bilateral "framework" talks, saying 
Washington's approach should be "a bit clearer." 
  Contents have not been disclosed of the U.S. proposal Hata 
received as foreign minister April 15 from trade representative 
Mickey Kantor at a global trade meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. 
The United States and Japan have "fundamentally different 
interpretations" of the framework objectives, a senior MITI 
official said last week, adding Japan will respond to the U.S. 
proposal after next week's string of national holidays.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker 
criticized the ruling coalition on Monday for the lengthy 
wrangling among its members over key policy issues that caused a 
delay in selecting the new prime minister. Yohei Kono, 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said, "it took 
a long time since Prime Minister (Morhihiro) Hosokawa announced 
his intention to resign." 
  "That created concerns and caused troubles for the people." 
  The seven-party coalition agreed on key policy issues last 
Friday and decided to select Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as 
its candidate to succeed Hosokawa, two weeks after Hosokawa said 
he would step down because of a Diet stalemate over his 
financial impropriety. 
  Hata will be elected new prime minister Monday afternoon. 
  "The coalition should have a serious soul-searching over the 
political vacuum," Kono told reporters. 
  The LDP chief also blasted the Hosokawa administration, 
which 
came to power with a vow to clean up politics, for its failure 
to restore the credibility of the Japanese politics. "The 
people's distrust in politics deepened instead," he said. 
  "Mr. Hosokawa was himself not so enthusiastic about 
clarifying the suspicions" over his past financial deals "and 
the coalition members clammed up on the issue," Kono said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker 
Monday called on just-elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to 
step up efforts for political reform to restore the credibility 
of Japanese politics. 
  "I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's 
distrust in politics," said Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). "I heard the ruling coalition say 
repeatedly that it should follow through on promised political 
reform in order to restore the credibility of politics," Kono 
told reporters. 
  Earlier in the day, Hata was elected prime minister to 
succeed Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on 
April 8 over financial improprieties. 
  The LDP chief said his party may or may not cooperate with 
the coalition, depending on whether the new administration will 
do things for the benefit of the people. "If they carry out 
steps that bring profits to the people, we will cooperate, but 
if they take a stance that is not beneficial for the people, we 
should stand firmly against them," he said. 
  Kono also said at a meeting of LDP legislators that his 
party 
should take a firm stance against the coalition's "forcible" 
handling of Diet business. "The coalition's forcible way in its 
handling of Diet business could destroy Japan's democracy...we 
should firmly oppose that," he said. 
  Kono earlier criticized the coalition for a delay in 
selecting Hata as their candidate for premier. "It took too 
long since Hosokawa announced his intention to resign," Kono 
said. 
  "The coalition should do some serious soul searching for the 
political vacuum," he said. 
  On the LDP's intraparty affairs, Kono said he had agreed 
with 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe over joint efforts for 
party reform. During the political uncertainty following 
Hosokawa's resignation announcemment Watanabe expressed his 
intention to leave the party to become a candidate for the 
premiership, but later dropped the plan after he failed to 
secure enough support among the coalition members or among his 
followers for the move.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's new government 
under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will uphold the trade policy 
of his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, a senior trade ministry 
official said Monday. The basic framework of the ruling 
coalition will be the same under the Hata government, to be 
inaugurated later Monday, Hideaki Kumano, vice international 
trade and industry minister, told a press conference. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will 
focus "in earnest" on implementing macroeconomic steps and 
deregulation in line with goals Japan set in the 15.25 trillion 
yen stimulus package released in February and in a 
market-opening package adopted last month, Kumano said. 
  MITI will make particular efforts to deregulate 
distribution, 
information and telecommunications as well as land policy. 
  On trade issues with the United States, he said Tokyo will 
continue to seek an early reopening of the stalled trade 
"framework" talks through more dialogue. 
  Washington has repeatedly said since February's collapse of 
the framework talks that "the door is still open," while Japan 
has stressed the need for "more efforts at communication," 
Kumano said. 
  On reported new U.S. framework proposals made at an April 15 
meeting between Hata as foreign minister and trade 
representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Kumano said 
both parties agreed to keep the content of the talks secret. 
  Kumano denied reports that MITI will send a ranking official 
to Washington after the holiday season next week to respond to 
the reported U.S. proposals. "Nothing has been decided on the 
issue," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro 
Saito urged Japan's yet-unformed government Monday to enact a 
fiscal 1994 budget quickly and called for cooperation to 
stabilize currency rates. Asked what he hopes to see from the 
government that new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was to form 
later in the evening, Saito told a regular news conference he 
would first put priority on the long- delayed budget. 
  The government of Morihiro Hosokawa was unable to start Diet 
deliberations on the budget for the fiscal year that started 
this month, as parliamentary business snagged on the personal 
financial dealings that toppled Hosokawa. 
  "It would be nice to see the budget enacted as soon as 
possible," Saito said. He also noted that a meeting of finance 
leaders from seven major industrial nations Sunday reconfirmed a 
Group of Seven (G-7) commitment to exchange rates that reflect 
economic fundamentals and to avoiding "excessive" fluctuations. 
  In the future, Saito said, he hopes the G-7 will "cooperate 
to stabilize the foreign exchange market."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The business community 
welcomed the election Monday [25 April] of Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as Japan's new prime minister. 
  Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Japan's top automaker Toyota 
Motor Corp., said he expects Hata, with deep perspectives and 
rich experience in administration, to demonstrate his leadership. 
  Yasuo Shingu, chairman of Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., 
expressed hope that the Hata government will take quick action 
in dealing with pending problems. 
  Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers 
Association, urged the government to carry the fiscal 1994 
budget through the Diet as soon as possible in view of the slow 
recovery in the domestic economy. 
  Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the government should try to 
cut expenditures and abolish or amend the consumption tax to 
create new sources for public welfare funds. 
  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, expressed hope that the government will pave the 
way for a smooth settlement of external trade problems ahead of 
a summit of the Group of Seven nations to be held in Naples, 
Italy this July. 
  Katsuhiro Utada, vice chairman of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), described Hata as the right 
person to tackle the major domestic and international issues 
facing Japan. 
  Utada cited the issues as an early enactment of the 1994 
state budget pending before the Diet and resumption of 
negotiations for a new trade framework between Japan and the 
United States. 
  Utada, honorary chairman of Ajinomoto Co., said the urgent 
task facing the ruling coalition is to stabilize the political 
situation and Hata is the most suitable person for the mission.

  He said he wants to see a new bloc to be established among 
such parties as Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Japan 
New Party (JNP) and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger]. Ouchi made 
the call in a meeting of DSP legislators. 
  Shinseito, the JNP headed by the just-resigned former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the four-member Kaikaku no Kai 
of a parliament group in the lower house decided to join the new 
bloc, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," party sources said. 
  However, Sakigake head Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet 
secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, rejected the scheme. 
  Some 130 lower house members are expected to take part in 
the 
new group, including splinter groups that recently left the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, such as New Party Mirai and 
the Liberal Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A 130-member joint 
parliamentary group was formed in the House of Representatives 
on Monday [25 April] to support newly elected Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. The group, called "Kaishin" (Renovation), 
comprises Hata's 62-member Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the 
37-member Japan New Party (JNP) led by Hata's predecessor as 
premier Morihiro Hosokawa, the 19-member Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), the seven-member Liberal Party and the four-member 
Kaikaku no Kai, party officials said. 
  Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member, also joined the 
bloc. 
  The Liberal Party led by Koji Kakizawa and Kaikaku no Kai 
led 
by Takeo Nishioka were formed by defectors from the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  New Party Mirai (Future), another five-member LDP breakaway, 
did not join "Kaishin" but plans to take part in the future, a 
senior Shinseito official said. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi urged the formation of a new joint 
alliance, saying, "we should create a strongly united grouping 
to support new Prime Minister Hata." Ouchi made the call in a 
meeting of DSP legislators. 
  However, new party Sakigake [Harbinger] head Masayoshi 
Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, 
rejected the scheme. 
  Sakigake, poised to distance itself from the dominant 
Shinseito-Komeito alliance in the coalition, has pledged not to 
take a post in the new government but voted for Hata in the 
prime ministerial vote in the Diet. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 74-member Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), expressed displeasure with the move 
toward a joint alliance, saying, "I cannot say it is good or 
bad. But also I cannot say `please do as you like'." 
  DSP sources said Ouchi and Shinseito Secretary General 
Ichiro 
Ozawa, the chief strategist in the coalition, met secretly at 
the end of last week and agreed on the formation of a new joint 
parliamentary group. 
  Hosokawa called for the creation of a joint parliamentary 
group, called "Kaikaku" (Reform), with other coalition parties 
in the lower house on April 8 when he announced his sudden 
resignation. 
  The idea had been frozen because of criticism from Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the SDP, which charged that such a proposal 
would lead to the formation of a large new party amalgamating 
the JNP, Shinseito and Komeito.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Morihiro Hosokawa, who quit 
as prime minister Monday, thanked the public for their 
understanding and assistance to reform efforts he promoted over 
the past eight months. Noting his administration achieved some 
reforms that his predecessors could not, including political 
reform, Hosokawa said he was grateful to the public for their 
"warm encouragement and help." 
  "It is extremely painful that I have to leave office halfway 
through my reform efforts (and) at a time when there are a 
number of domestic and foreign challenges...I don't know how to 
apologize to the public for that," Hosokawa said in a statement. 
But he sought understanding of his decision to resign, saying 
he had to take political and moral responsibility for the delay 
in Diet budget debate and for his involvement in questionable 
financial dealings. 
  Hosokawa, who rose to power last August, also expressed hope 
the next administration will deal squarely with a host of 
formidable domestic and foreign policy tasks and "herald a new 
era for Japanese politics." 
  At an extraordinary cabinet meeting earlier Monday, Hosokawa 
thanked cabinet members for their cooperation with his reform 
efforts and vowed to support the next government as a 
legislator, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said. 
  Takemura, speaking at his last news conference as the 
Hosokawa government spokesman, said he felt as if he set sail 
for the rough seas when he started working as part of the 
Hosokawa administration. "Today, I feel I can come ashore after 
so much time," he said, adding he wants to make full use of his 
eight-month experience at the center of power and get ready for 
an expected political reconfiguration.

Manufacturers' Association, who will step down from his post in 
May, looked back at his term of office during which he was quite 
busy in dealing with economic frictions between Japan and the 
United States. On the Big Three, he said: "We can welcome the 
fact that they are beginning to respond to our demand that `they 
should make cars which suit the Japanese market.'" In this way, 
he positively assessed the changes in the stand of the Big 
Three, who have begun to produce cars with a steering wheel on 
the right-hand side.

  [Text] On 21 April, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine 
and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, Inc. [MFIAJ], in 
reference to the fact that the insurance sector has become one 
of the focal points in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, 
said: "We are considering plans to set up a meeting ground 
where officials from the private sector can hold discussions to 
deepen their mutual understanding." Onoda, who is also 
president of the Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., 
made the comment at a news conference held the same day. He 
also disclosed there are plans to revise the existing system to 
give easier access to membership in the MFIAJ for foreign 
insurance companies which have entered the Japanese market. 
  The MFIAJ already holds meetings with foreign insurance 
companies which have entered the Japanese market. Onoda, 
however, feels these meetings have remained too routine. He 
disclosed the MFIAJ is thus considering plans to set up a forum 
where top-level meetings can be held to discuss a broad range of 
topics. The plans are expected to materialize as early as this 
coming summer.

  [Text] With regard to the issue of resuming the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, a senior official with 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on 
22 April, "Japan and the United States will hold informal 
consultations to discuss resuming the stalled framework talks 
after the May holidays." The MITI senior official expressed an 
eagerness for a resumption of the stalled framework talks, 
saying: "During the consultations, Japan and the United States 
will discuss not only such macroeconomic measures as continued 
tax cuts and an increase in public investment, but also the 
adoption of objective criteria to measure the openness of the 
Japanese market and individual sectors. Japan seeks to reach a 
set of agreements with the United States in the framework talks 
prior to the industrialized nations' summit (the Naples summit) 
scheduled for July." 
  The senior MITI official indicated that vice-ministerial 
officials from the two countries will hold the informal 
consultations, adding that "the two countries need to hold 
several rounds of informal consultations before the summit talks 
are held." The MITI official went on to say: "In order for the 
stalled framework talks to be resumed an early date and for the 
two countries to reach a set of agreements, the macroeconomic 
measures are important, but Japan should not defer the 
discussion of individual sectors at the framework talks. The 
two countries need to reach a set of agreements on both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic measures prior to the summit 
talks."

  [Text] Japan and the United States will start informal 
vice-ministerial negotiations on the Japan-U.S. framework talks, 
which have been broken off, after the Golden Week holidays [from 
the end of April through early May]. It was revealed on 23 
April that there are differences between Japan and the United 
States in their views on the connection between the goal of the 
framework talks themselves, and individual sectors. 
  The point at issue is the overall goal of the framework 
talks 
mentioned in the joint statement about a bilateral agreement on 
a new framework for trade talks, which was reached between the 
Japanese and U.S. leaders in July last year. The statement 
stipulated that a goal of the framework talks is to 
"substantially increase access and sales of competitive foreign 
goods and services." While the United States believes that this 
goal is applied to every individual sector such as insurance, 
Japan understands this "is not applied to all sectors." The 
breaking of the deadlock in the framework talks will possibly 
depend on whether both sides can fill the recognition gap. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor met in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April. In 
making a new proposal during the meeting, Kantor stated that the 
framework talks would be resumed on the condition that progress 
should be made in three areas: macroeconomy; the overall goal; 
and objective criteria. There have so far been clear 
differences between Japan and the United States in their views 
on macroeconomy and objective criteria. However, Kantor's new 
proposal "indicated obviously for the first time that Japan and 
the United States differ in views on interpretation of the 
overall goal" of the economic framework talks (as stated by a 
top official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry). 
  According a source at the negotiations, the U.S. 
understanding is that the improvement in access of competitive 
foreign products "is the overall goal of the framework talks and 
this applies to every individual sector." It is observed that 
this U.S. view has led to its demand that numerical targets be 
set in all of the three priority sectors, including automobiles 
and auto parts. On the other hand, Japan maintains: "Of the 
three priority sectors, the goal of the government procurement 
sector is the same as that of the framework talks themselves. 
However, while the goal of the insurance sector is 
deregulation, that of the automobile and auto parts sector is 
the improvement in chances for access." 
  The handling of the overall goal will inevitably become an 
important topic at informal negotiations from now on. If Japan 
generally promises "increased sales of competitive foreign 
goods," the United States will be satisfied with it. Will Japan 
and the United States discuss individual sectors in light of the 
characteristics of each sector? Or, will they apply the overall 
goal to each individual sector and recall arguments on numerical 
targets? Attention will be focused on moves by both Japan and 
the United States.

  [Text] On 22 April, a Foreign Ministry source indicated 
that Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen are expected to hold Japanese-U.S. finance 
ministerial talks in Washington prior to a meeting of finance 
ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven 
(G-7) major industrialized nations which is to be held there. 
Although a concrete schedule for the Fujii-Bentsen meeting has 
not yet been decided on, on 23 April both sides were 
coordinating the schedule. 
  During the meeting with Bentsen, Fujii is expected to 
indicate the government's intention to maintain in the future 
its basic position on Japan's policies toward foreign countries 
and its domestic economic measures, as well on following a 
policy accord reached by the ruling coalition parties. 
Meanwhile, Bentsen is expected to call for additional economic 
pump-priming measures by Japan, claiming that "Japan should make 
voluntary efforts to achieve an economic recovery led by the 
expansion of domestic demand to lead a world economic recovery."

  [Text] In connection with the issue of North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, a top Foreign Ministry 
official on 21 April touched on the possibility of Japan 
imposing its own economic sanctions against North Korea before 
the UN Security Council votes to impose them on that country. 
He then said, "Japan has been consulting with the United States 
about various options." In this way, the top Foreign Ministry 
official hinted at the possibility of both Japan and the United 
States imposing their own economic sanctions on North Korea 
before the UN Security Council decides to impose them on that 
country. 
  Both Japan and the United States are believed to have been 
studying the possibility of imposing their own economic 
sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council decides 
to do so in anticipation that China's opposition to the 
sanctions may block the UN Security Council from voting to 
impose the economic sanctions, thereby delaying enforcement of 
the economic sanctions against the DPRK. 
  Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
and 
U.S. Defense Secretary Perry are scheduled to meet on the 
morning of 22 April and are likely to discuss this possibility 
during their meeting.

  [Text] Kanju Sato, chairman of the National Public Safety 
Commission [NPSC] (and concurrently minister of home affairs), 
was present at a news conference held after the 22 April cabinet 
meeting. Touching on measures to be taken if the UN Security 
Council imposes sanctions on the DPRK (North Korea) in 
connection with its suspected nuclear weapons development 
program, Chairman Sato stated, "In my position as NPSC chairman, 
I have requested various agencies with the National Police 
Agency [NPA] playing the leading role to compile a manual, as 
well as to come up with carefully planned measures to prepare 
for unforeseen contingencies." In this way, he disclosed that 
measures for ensuring public safety are under study now. 
Maintaining that "(details of the measures) should not be 
disclosed in concrete terms," Chairman Sato avoided mentioning 
concrete details. However, he stressed that "these measures 
will be taken within the framework of existing laws." He then 
added, "Maximum diplomatic efforts should be made to avoid 
sanctions." 
  In connection with this issue, the NPSC Information Office 
issued the following comments on the morning of the same day: 
"This means that the NPA is currently reviewing and studying 
points at issue in connection with various situations, but it 
does not mean that a practical manual is being prepared now."

  [Text] In connection with the issue of a Japanese trading 
company acting as a broker in exporting old Russian submarines 
to the DPRK (North Korea) for use as scrap metal, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI], in an unusual move, 
has asked the Russian Government to permit it "to send 
inspectors to make sure that the submarines cannot be 
recommissioned." As a result, it has become likely that there 
will be a considerable delay in settling the issue. 
  The situation is the result of mounting tensions regarding 
the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program. Trading company officials thus must sit back in despair 
while saying, "It was just a bad time for this business deal." 
  The Toen Trading Company (based in Tokyo and capitalized at 
30 million yen) acted as the brokerage agent for the submarine 
dismantling contract. The company concluded a deal with the 
Russian Defense Ministry to take control of 12 old Russian 
submarines. When the first submarine was transferred to North 
Korea, U.S. intelligence agencies and other relevant agencies 
questioned the deal because they suspected that "North Korea may 
possibly recommission the submarines." MITI then put a "hold" 
on the remaining 11 submarines. If these submarines can 
actually be recommissioned, the trading company would be 
violating the Foreign Exchange Control Law, which prohibits 
commission trade involving weapons. 
  In response to MITI's inquiry about the submarines, the 
Russian Government said that "they cannot be used as 
submarines." The same conclusion was drawn when photos of the 
submarines submitted by the Toen Trading Company were analyzed. 
  However, MITI recently requested the Russian Government to 
permit it to send officials to conduct on-site inspections. A 
senior ministry official said, "If North Korea had not been 
involved, it would not have been necessary to confirm matters to 
this extent." He thus admitted that the nuclear issue has much 
to do with this situation. 
  The Russian Government has not yet responded to MITI's 
request. This is fine as far as MITI is concerned because it 
thus can stall for more time. MITI officials have reportedly 
told Toen Trading Company officials, "Let us take our time and 
do it gradually."

  [Text] Seoul, 21 April -- The Japanese and South Korean 
Governments opened the first Japanese-ROK economic partnership 
conference in Seoul on 21 April. The Japanese side is 
represented by Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi, 
while his South Korean counterpart is Son Chun-yong, second 
deputy vice foreign minister. Each side has about 20 
working-level officials altogether from its ministries concerned 
with economic affairs attending the meeting. A wide-ranging 
exchange of views is being held on bilateral economic 
cooperation. The conference is scheduled to be held on 21 and 
22 April. 
  This conference is being held in accordance with an 
agreement 
reached at the Japanese-ROK summit meeting in Kyongju, South 
Korea, in November 1993. The conference was formed by 
reorganizing the previously existing Japanese-ROK Trade, 
Business, and Technological Cooperation Committee.

  [Text] On 21 April, Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), touched on the issue of Japan's bid for a 
permanent seat in the UN Security Council [UNSC], and said: 
"There are various opinions in Japan, but I feel it is natural 
for Japan to be in the UNSC. This view has become widespread 
within the United Nations. Regarding Japan's contributions, 
however, it would be difficult for Japan to feel it is actually 
making contributions unless it actually participates in UN 
activities." Ogata, who is temporarily back in Japan, made the 
comments in response to a question by an ASASHI SHIMBUN 
reporter. She added: "It is desired that Japan participate in 
activities in diverse ways, whether it be refugee problems or 
development assistance programs. What is important is a 
willingness to actively contribute in areas where Japan can do 
its best."

<F P=106> [The following item did not appear in the 22 April Morning </F>
Edition of MAINICHI SHIMBUN] 
  [Text] Because of the situation on the Korean peninsula, 
Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general, 
and other lawmakers are talking about "emergency defense 
legislation" at the ruling parties' policy meeting. In this 
regard, Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the 
Defense Agency [DA], said at a news conference on 20 April that 
"The emergency defense legislation that Mr. Ozawa is talking 
about is different from the general emergency legislation that 
we studied before in terms of its characteristics and range of 
influence." He explained his opinion that Ozawa's "emergency 
defense legislation" is not general legislation but rather a 
concept designed to deal with the DPRK's suspected nuclear 
weapons development program. 
  Hatakeyama first said that "the general emergency 
legislation 
deals with various peacetime regulations regarding movements of 
the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] during emergencies." He then 
explained his view, saying, "I think that lawmakers, when they 
talk about the emergency defense legislation, must keep in mind 
the cooperation that Japan can give to the international 
community, as well as the support that Japan can provide to the 
U.S. military, when the UN Security Council adopts a resolution 
to deal with an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula." 
  As for "collective security," Hatakeyama said that "the DA 
does not have a particular definition concerning actions for 
collective security." However, on the question of whether the 
SDF can cooperate with the international community in the area 
of logistics to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula 
within the scope of the current laws, Hatakeyama explained his 
understanding that "there are many things we cannot do unless we 
give power to the SDF by revising the current laws or by 
introducing new laws."

  [Text] Regarding laws to deal with emergency situations, a 
top Foreign Ministry official said on 21 April: "It is better 
to be prepared to enact such a law, but, of course, it should be 
within the framework of the Constitution." He thus stressed the 
need to be prepared to enact legislation within the framework of 
the current Constitution in order to respond to emergencies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Is U.S. Pressure Behind Anti-SDPJ </F>
Encirclement?"] 
  [Text] With policy debate among the ruling coalition 
parties deadlocked over tax reform and the DPRK's (North Korea) 
policies, on 20 April the parties continued difficult 
negotiations all day. 
  In the morning, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] told reporters, "It is 
important to carefully review and settle all points of dispute." 
In the interparty negotiations on a new policy accord, the SDPJ 
was in a difficult position coping with "anti-SDPJ encirclement" 
by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The SDPJ 
believes the anti-SDPJ encirclement was created by "U.S. 
pressure." 
  In the SDPJ Central Executive Committee meeting on 20 April, 
deputy secretary general Hideyuki Maejima expressed strong 
frustration with the coalition's preparatory work for policy 
accord. He said: "If `close tie-ups with the United States and 
the ROK' are incorporated in the coalition's policy accord, 
Japan may have to comply with U.S. requests even before the 
official UN decision (on sanctions against North Korea)." 
  After Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's return home from 
Morocco on 18 April, "U.S. pressure" became the focal point of 
the "post-Hosokawa" political scene. A senior Komeito official 
said "It appears, in Marrakech, Hata received very difficult 
requests from (U.S. Vice President) Al Gore over the North Korea 
issue." Similarly, a source in Shinseito said "Hata has become 
prudent about his succession of the premiership since he noticed 
the rigid U.S. stance on North Korea and economic issues." 
  In an 18 April news conference, Democratic Socialist Party 
secretary general Takashi Yonezawa stressed: "Nobody will 
become prime minister unless the coalition parties adopt a clear 
stance toward the North Korea issue." 
  Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal 
Democratic Party recently decided to form a new party to win the 
premiership, and the coalition was shaken by this move. Some 
coalition parties are stressing that Hata is an indispensable 
political figure to maintain the framework of the coalition 
government, and that, to achieve the objective, the coalition 
must work out concessions on the North Korea and tax reform 
policies. This opinion is obviously targeting the SDPJ. 
  The collapse of the Hosokawa administration was accelerated 
by the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks in February. 
Hosokawa's successor should overcome the chilly relations with 
the United States as a top priority issue. Under such 
circumstances, Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa 
reportedly intends to remove all possible obstacles before the 
inauguration of the new administration. Commenting on Ozawa's 
strategy, a senior Sakigake [Harbinger] official said, "that is 
why they expelled Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura as 
the `principal offender' in ruining the proposal for the public 
welfare tax." 
  Also, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee chairman Koken 
Nosaka said immediately before the 20 April negotiation of the 
coalition parties: "They do not want to make the Hata 
administration a stopgap government. So, they are urging us to 
accept difficult conditions." It appeared Nosaka was trying to 
say the United States is the behind-the-scenes player in the 
political controversy.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held a meeting 
over dinner with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and 
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama at a restaurant in 
Tokyo on 20 April. Commenting on the concept of the "national 
welfare tax," which he proposed last February and later 
retracted, the prime minister revealed that despite his own 
intentions, the bureaucracy, including the Finance Ministry, had 
exerted stronger influence. For example, he said: "I tried to 
take advantage of the Finance Ministry and other government 
agencies to achieve my goals. However, it turned out that I was 
the one who was exploited by the bureaucrats. I was swayed by 
what they said." 
  In connection with the news conference on the announcement 
of 
the national welfare tax being held in the early hours of 3 
February, Takemura said: "I ran all over the place to try to 
stop the news conference." In response, Hosokawa reportedly 
indicated he "learned his lesson," saying: "I should have not 
held the news conference at all. I should have postponed it 
until the next day. It was unreasonable." 
  That night, however, when rumors of Hosokawa's remarks 
spread 
through Nagato-cho [the district in Tokyo where the Diet 
building is located], the prime minister telephoned Takemura and 
asked him "not to disclose the details." Thus, the relations 
between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary 
remained awkward until the very end.

  [Text] Looking back at the disturbances created over the 
issue of the national welfare tax, Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said at a dinner meeting with Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio 
Hatoyama on the evening of 20 April that "the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] took advantage of me." In this regard, Jiro 
Saito, administrative vice finance minister, made a comment at a 
news conference on 21 April and smiled wryly, saying, "I have no 
knowledge of taking advantage of the prime minister." He even 
looked angry for a moment. 
  The prime minister reportedly said: "I wanted to use the 
power of the MOF. On the contrary, however, the ministry took 
advantage of me over the issue of the national welfare tax and 
other issues." The prime minister reportedly did some 
soul-searching at a midnight news conference as well. He 
sounded as if he was saying he failed because he acted in 
accordance with the MOF's recommendations. 
  In this regard, Saito first said "I think I should not 
comment on this because I heard it from others." He then denied 
a rumor that "the Ministry of Finance masterminded the national 
welfare tax plan."

  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
secretary general, commented on his cooperation with Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] member Michio Watanabe, former deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, in a Fuji Television 
program on 22 April. Ozawa indicated his intention to continue 
to seek a cooperative relationship with Watanabe in the future 
on the condition that Watanabe leaves the LDP. He said: 
"Allying with the LDP runs counter to our spirit (and our ideas 
upon forming Shinseito). However, I still hope to act with him 
if he secedes from the LDP." 
  In criticizing the idea of "forming a coalition between the 
LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan" while excluding 
Shinseito, which is an idea that once cropped up in the process 
of establishing the next administration, Ozawa stated, "This 
concept lacks the right recognition of the times." In warning 
these parties, Ozawa said: "This is nothing other than a 
suicidal act. Why do they want to do this?"

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Coalition Government Led by Shinseito, </F>
Komeito Will Leave the Seeds of Future Problems"] 
  [Text] Ruling parties, at a meeting of their heads on 22 
April, decided to choose Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, as a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
agreed on the basic policies of a new coalition government. The 
Diet is expected to elect Mr. Hata the next prime minister on 25 
April. With these arrangements, two weeks of political turmoil 
will subside, and infighting between the ruling parties will 
come to an end. Nevertheless, the possibility of realigning the 
established political parties is likely to keep the political 
situation unstable in the future. 
  A long delay in picking a successor to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa plunged both ruling and opposition parties into a state 
of confusion. Such a situation occurred because the ruling 
parties lost their cohesive force which had held them together 
after the Political Reform Law was enacted in the Diet, and they 
continued to vie with each other for the leadership of running 
the coalition government while being pressed to choose between 
the maintenance of their coalition and its breakup. 
  Sakigake [Harbinger], which played a pivotal role in the 
coalition government, has broken away from the coalition 
government, and the Japan New Party has split. Those 
developments have precipitated a bipolarization in the ruling 
coalition parties in which Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito have forged an alliance against the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What kept the ruling parties involved in 
a dispute to the last, when they sought an agreement on the 
basic policies of a new coalition government, were the issues of 
reforming the current tax system and that of security, which was 
triggered by North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
weapons. Raising the two issues at discussions by the ruling 
parties was a matter of course. 
  To settle the disagreement between the ruling parties on the 
issues of reforming the current tax system and security and to 
formulate common policies on them for a new coalition 
government, it is logical to deal with those issues by changing 
the current coalition framework. But, the Shinseito-Komeito 
alliance and the SDPJ chose the way of seeking a compromise 
while leaving their deepening mutual distrust unaddressed. 
  We have asked that "the post-Hosokawa government" be formed 
by the political forces that emerge after the established 
political parties realign themselves on the basis of a policy 
consensus. Nonetheless, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
and the SDPJ, which have a numerical edge over other parties, 
abandoned their political leadership by giving their top 
priority to defending their own organizations and avoiding 
making their own policy proposals. As a result, the political 
leadership passed to Mr. Ozawa of Shinseito, who took the lead 
in formulating the basic policies for a new coalition government. 
  A set of agreements reached among the ruling parties clearly 
states that the key element in reforming the current tax system 
is to "study the validity of amending or abolishing the 
consumption tax and to raise indirect taxes." We have long 
advocated that it is an urgent task to upgrade the current 
social infrastructure to prepare for a society of senior 
citizens, and we proposed that the consumption tax be raised to 
6 percent. 
  Shinseito and Komeito, which will play a key role in 
reforming the current tax system, have only stressed the need to 
increase taxes. We have stressed the premise of raising the 
consumption tax while 1) the income tax should continue to be 
cut; 2) the progressive rate of the income tax should be 
reviewed; 3) defects in the consumption tax and other taxes 
should be corrected; and 4) the expenditure structure and the 
unfair tax system should be reviewed. 
  With regard to the issue of North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons, if the DPRK succeeds in 
developing nuclear weapons, this will have a serious impact on 
the peace and safety of the Far East, including Japan. We have 
repeatedly asked North Korea to accept international nuclear 
inspections. In principle, diplomatic efforts should be made 
for a peaceful solution to the issue, and pushing North Korean 
into isolation would instead cause a dangerous situation. 
  We are doubtful about why the ruling parties agreed on a 
basic policy that says, "Japan will act in line with a policy to 
be adopted by the United Nations." The United Nations is still 
in a transitional period while undergoing a process of trial and 
error. Leaving Japan's option to the United Nations beforehand 
in dealing with issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons will limit the flexibility of Japan's diplomacy.

  [Text] The issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development became a focal point of discussions at the ruling 
coalition parties' policy meeting. In this regard, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and Defense Agency [DA] authorities 
were carefully watching the outcome of the discussions at the 
meeting. A MOFA source said: "If the issue is going to be 
discussed at the Diet sooner or later, we should be thankful to 
the coalition parties for their effort to clarify the problem 
points and to draw up policies before forming a new 
administration." 
  On the other hand, some people are already talking about the 
possibility of Japan, the United States, and the ROK imposing 
economic sanctions against North Korea without waiting for a UN 
Security Council resolution. They are also pointing out a 
negative aspect, saying that tasks which "should be studied 
internally" (according to a top Foreign Ministry official) are 
being brought to public notice. For the time being, it seems 
the authorities are on "tenterhooks" as far as the possibility 
of having detailed discussions at the policy meeting is 
concerned. 
  Regarding the ruling parties' policy meeting, most Foreign 
Ministry officials have assessed it positively. While citing 
the case of the United States, where presidential candidates 
always announce their policy platform before the actual 
election, as an example, a senior Foreign Ministry official 
said: "This is something we never did before in Japan. I am 
carefully observing the discussions at the meeting with a sense 
of excitement." A top MOFA official said: "I am very 
interested in them." (Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] chief) 
Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign 
minister who is likely to become the next prime minister, 
stated: "In terms of managing politics, it is good for us to 
find out the course of the new administration at this stage." 
  The DA also shares the same view. A senior DA official said: 
"(Shinseito representative secretary general) Ozawa's concept of 
emergency defense legislation, designed to place the focus on 
the North Korean issue, and the emergency legislation which we 
have been studying from broad viewpoints, are not necessarily 
the same thing. However, we welcome the discussions at the 
meeting." 
  However, their views are different when it comes to the 
concrete issue of whether to include China in cooperation with 
Japan, the United States, and the ROK in the event of an 
emergency involving the North Korean issue. A senior Foreign 
Ministry official pointed out: "This is an issue we should talk 
about in case China exercises its veto power against the UNSC 
resolution for imposing sanctions against North Korea, but it is 
still too early to talk about it." 
  MOFA officials are saying that it is not good policy, at 
this 
stage, to aimlessly excite North Korea, which reportedly 
informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its 
policy to conditionally accept nuclear inspections, and China, 
which has "the most influential power," to persuade North Korea.

<F P=106> [Interview With Seiichi Toshida, director general of the </F>
Research Bureau, Economic Planning Agency (EPA), on 17 December 
1993; place not given: "A Turning Point for Leading 
Industries...."] 
  [Text] Perceptions Worse Than Reality 
  [KANKAI] Speaking from the standpoint of reading business 
trends, I am afraid this year [1993] has been a very difficult 
one for you: in June, for example, you declared that the 
recession had bottomed out, and yet in November the word 
"recovery" once again disappeared from your monthly economic 
report. I wish you'd begin by commenting on the point I've just 
raised. 
  [Toshida] It isn't just this year; after all, it has been 
that way since the year before last. Just this November, we 
took the liberty of making a sort of tentative conclusion that 
"the economy had peaked in April 1991," which means that two and 
a half years have elapsed since the peak. This year, all of us, 
both in and outside the government, started off with an 
expectation that the economy would get on the recovery track 
beginning in the fall. In early spring, a view gained ground 
that things were indeed moving in the direction that seemed to 
bear out our earlier expectation. 
  It was in that context that in June we took a look at the 
overall situation as existed at the time and came up with an 
assessment that somehow the economy would not deteriorate any 
more than it already had and that things would get back on the 
road to a slow recovery starting in the fall as we had expected 
earlier. At that time, as things stood, there were some 
reasonable bases to our assessment: the so-called stock 
adjustment and inventory adjustment were making considerable 
progress; in June, a supplementary budget was adopted for new 
comprehensive economic measures, the practical impact of which 
seemed certain to be felt in earnest beginning in the fall; and 
even the problem of bad assets among financial institutions was 
being dealt with--sort of--by a clear initiative to encourage 
the banks to aggressively write off such bad assets. In that 
sense, we had the feeling that we were gradually getting a 
handle on those problems then facing us. 
  In reality, however, we ended up facing a situation totally 
unexpected--you might call it a case of Murphy's Law, which is 
omnipresent lately: "No sooner had we declared the bottoming out 
of the recession than the economy took another turn for the 
worse." I think the rising yen was the biggest factor after 
all, but what made it worse was that we had a cool summer with a 
long rainy season, which resulted in a bad rice crop. As a 
result, it became clear that the scenario we had 
envisioned--that the economy would get on a recovery track 
beginning the fall--was not going to materialize. 
  That's why in November we dropped from the monthly economic 
report our earlier prediction of gathering momentum for a 
recovery, the prediction which we had held to during the summer 
with expectations. 
  In that sense, what was difficult was not just our work; 
rather, I think it was the not-so-simple economic movement that 
made our work correspondingly difficult. I also think that this 
view is shared by those in the private-sector businesses as well. 
  [KANKAI] The "QE" [Quick Estimate] (national income 
statistics bulletin) came out just the other day for the months 
July through September, the period you called "a cool summer 
with a long rainy season." The report painted a picture which, 
I should say, was somewhat better than what had been 
anticipated: contrary to general expectations, the report showed 
a fairly high rate of growth for that particular period. I 
suspect that from this report some could draw a conclusion that 
the real economy might not have been so bad after all. 
  [Toshida] I think we are dealing with a question of 
yardsticks--the standard by which we decide "what is the range 
that is bad." "Good is when Japan's economy itself is in the 
plus territory; bad is when it is in the minus territory"--if 
this is the standard by which we measure things, obviously we 
could say that 2-percent growth isn't bad. But the thing is, 
the April-June quarter had negative growth, and what gain there 
was in the July-September priod was barely enough to make up for 
it. So, if you average it out, the conclusion is that the 
economy was hovering near the bottom just as we had anticipated; 
therefore, it cannot be said that the July-September performance 
was anything particularly good. But from the standpoint of 
those who had noisily predicted that the bottom would fall out 
of the economy, the actual performance in the July-September 
period may very well be rated as having exceeded expectations. 
  The 2-percent growth may be given its due appraisal if it 
had 
served as a catalyst toward firming up the economic base to 
bring about better conditions beginning in the fall; in reality, 
however, while the 2-percent growth was in progress, the reading 
of business conditions by companies themselves and consumer 
confidence kept on cooling off disproportionately to the actual 
state of the economy. And it is these negative psychological 
factors that have been affecting the real economic activities 
during the October-December period and will continue to do so in 
the days ahead. This has been the trend. 
  In the eyes of the general public, the state of the economy 
must have seemed worse than it actually was, especially if such 
psychological aspects were also taken into account; yet, 
regrettably, I believe the economy has been lacking the strength 
to negate such psychological cooling-off effects. 
<H5>  Industrial Production Holds the Key to Business Recovery </H5>
  [KANKAI] Looking at the factors directly underlying business 
conditions, I have the feeling that not everything there is 
totally negative. In your process of studying economic trends 
ahead, what is it that you are watching most carefully in terms 
of indexes or indicators that are key to your discerning a turn 
toward recovery? 
  [Toshida] To put it plainly, whether or not there is a clear 
sign of an upward move in industrial production--this, I think, 
is the key. Industrial production registered the worst 
single-month decline in October. Subsequently, it zigzagged 
during November and December, following a torpid trend. If only 
it begins to show an unmistakable upward trend, even little by 
little, I believe it will have salutary ripple effects on other 
sectors of the economy. As to the reason for the stagnancy in 
industrial production, it clearly boils down to low levels of 
shipment and weak demand. On the demand side, there are many 
influencing factors, including the housing and public investment 
indexes, both of which look bright at the moment; I think 
industrial production, more than anything else, provides an 
early indicator that reflects the aggregate impact of all these 
factors that govern demand. 
  So, we watch production for a clue to the immediate trend, 
but it is employment we pay attention to when we are thinking 
about the conditions a little bit more into the future. The 
reason is this: If the employment picture is such that 
consumption is negatively affected by it, it is bound to impact 
on the levels of factory shipments and consumer demand, the two 
factors which I've just mentioned. That's why, as a matter of 
approach, we judge the current picture by production. But I 
think the question of employment adjustment will inevitably come 
up when we are to look at the near-term future outlook. 
  [KANKAN] Employment is a lagging index, is it not? I gather 
what you are saying is that you need to watch the employment 
picture quite closely because of its effect on consumpiton. 
  [Toshida] That is correct. Let's take a look at the demand 
side of the picture: In the past, when all was said and done, 
demand was given the initial push by exports and public 
investment; only when that initial phase was clearly proving 
effective did the next phase--plant and equipment investment and 
consumption--come into play. Speaking of consumption: again in 
the past, because consumption as a whole was being supported at 
its base, rarely did it fall by any drastic measure. This time 
around, however, demand could not count on exports, for one 
thing; then on the consumption side, too, unlike the tendency of 
the past when consumption seldom nosedived, sluggishness is the 
notable feature. 
  Moving on to the third element which is plant and equipment 
investment: This is being affected negatively by the prospect 
that attempts by business firms to dispose of their excess 
property holdings, such as office buildings and other 
structures, will be a time-consuming proposition; thus, not much 
can be expected of this element in the near term. Consequently, 
a popular view now is that it is essential for consumption to 
provide a measure of firm support to demand. It is in this 
connection that I believe the impact of the employment picture 
on consumer confidence may very well hold an important key to 
this question. 
  As we touched on at the beginning, what changed the picture 
between June and the fall was this: Consumer confidence, and 
business psychology to a lesser degree, showed some improvement 
around June, but then it began cooling off once again in the 
fall. As for the reason, I think it was a sense of uneasiness 
touched off by the fear of spreading employment adjustment or 
personnel cutback. In this sense, when we talk about the 
employment index we don't simply mean the jobless rate or the 
ratio of effective labor demand to effective labor supply; what 
really affects consumer confidence, I believe, is the question 
of how widespread and how deep are these personnel reductions. 
<H5>  A Structural Turnabout of Japan's Economy--Pros and Cons </H5>
  [KANKAI] The view attributing the current recession phase to 
two factors--the effect of the bubble's collapse and a cyclical 
force--has been around for some time now, but lately another 
view, which goes beyond that, seems to be gaining ground, 
pointing to the possibility that Japan's economy may be faced 
with a structural turning point. But the question is whether it 
is indeed at a turning point or not. Let's say it is, then my 
question is, what are the areas must one observe closely in 
order to be able to come to such a conclusion? 
  [Toshida] This is an extremely difficult question; for one 
thing, I think it can reasonably be argued that a structural 
turning point is at hand. In any event, the crux of the 
question lies in the industrial sector. There is a view that 
the automobile industry and the electric machinery industry, 
which have been the leading industries thus far, could be at a 
turning point of sorts. Some see this as a problem arising from 
the strong yen. Although there is a school of thought that, had 
it not been for the strong yen, both of these industries 
would've been able to make it out all right, when it comes to 
the question of their strength to pull the nation's economic 
growth, I am afraid they will no longer be as strong as they 
have been in the past 10 years or so. What kind of industries 
will be leading the Japanese economy in the days ahead? This, I 
think, is going to become a question of increasing importance. 
  There is another aspect to the question of structural 
turnabout. That is, some seem to think that various systems 
within the Japanese economy may have reached their limits. In 
some sense, this is a question of degree. There is no denying 
that the systems have gradually become antiquated and therefore 
need to be repaired; still, until two or three years ago, the 
popular view had been that the Japanese-style systems may be 
superior. Internationally, if anything, there clearly remains a 
strong tendency to try to learn and adopt the Japanese-model 
systems. Given this circumstance, it somehow seems too hasty 
for the originator to say that all of these systems should be 
discarded and replaced with something else; this is why I 
believe it behooves us to give the question a little more 
thought. In general terms, if for instance there are too many 
regulations, of course those things ought to be rectified, but 
to say just for that reason that the Japanese economic system as 
a whole is bad would be.... Such an argument, I am afraid, would 
make those countries trying desperately to study and adopt the 
Japanese system feel that we are pulling the rug from under them. 
  In last year's Economic White Paper, we gave major 
points of this question an analytical once-over, which did not 
lead to a conclusion that the Japanese-model system as a whole 
had better be changed. The picture that emerged from our 
analysis is this: That each of the segments of our economic 
system has its own historical background, which makes it 
sensible to give them partial repairs while retaining their 
bases; that not all mountains can be made to look like Mt. 
Fuji--some may look like this way and others that way, but all 
of them are linked and integrated at the bottom. There is no 
way one can draw a conclusion that the whole system had better 
be changed by shifting from one mode to another. It is in this 
connection that one gets an impression that perhaps the drastic 
impact of the bubbble's collapse somehow got mixed up with the 
argument for a structural changeover. 
  [KANKAI] I touched on the structural question because you 
raised the issue of structural reform in your World 
Economic White Paper for this year. Obviously, 
circumstances are different for each country, but my impression 
is that you are analyzing this issue based on the premise that 
not just Japan but all other countries must come to grips with 
the question of post-Cold War economic order and global economy. 
  [Toshida] As far as that goes, following the successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations, 
Japan has already done a quite a bit in opening up and improving 
the transparency of its domestic markets. The times are such 
that we need to take those steps. In this connection, that we 
are faced with the need for structural reform to accommodate 
these changes is most typically reflected in the case of rice. 
In that sense, I think your point is well taken. 
  Still, if that line of thinking and the subject of 
short-term 
recession are hastily linked together in the manner of 
short-circuiting, I am afraid it will create misunderstandings 
on the question of structural reforms that are a matter of 
medium- and long-term concern. If you say business conditions 
will not improve without structural reforms, you are apt to 
paint an extremely pessimistic picture. Some may take it to 
mean that no improvement can be expected for a period of years. 
It may also lead to another kind of misunderstanding--that 
implementing structural reform is useless or may do more harm 
than good to the business situation. I think it behooves us to 
consider structural reform correctly and pretty much as a 
medium- and long-term proposition and to accept the fact that 
its effects, too, will only be felt over the medium and long 
terms. 
  Without question we will have to undertake structural 
reform, 
but to say that business conditions will never improve without 
it or that it will have nothing but negative impact on business 
is, I think, a case of going too far in mixing up the subject of 
business conditions with the medium- and long-term structural 
question. 
<H5>  Will Listen More to Private-Sector Views </H5>
  [KANKAI] At present the EPA, of course, is evaluating 
business conditions on the basis of all kinds of indicators. In 
this connection, I am sure you are aware of the presence of a 
school of thought that has, for quite some time now, been 
saying, among other things, that the economy is shifting from 
goods to services. I suspect that some in this school may be 
wondering whether the indicators being followed by the EPA might 
not be giving too much weight to goods and too little to 
services. What is your feeling on this? Do you, for instance, 
see the need for reviewing your selection of indicators? 
  [Toshida] It is very difficult to seize, in a timely 
fashion, 
the trends in the service sector, and this is clearly due to the 
limited availability of data. This is why I think we ought to 
make up for the lack of data on the service sector by such means 
as holding hearings. It so happens, however, that in the 
current situation, as you know, the nonmanufacturing sector, 
too, is not doing very well. But during the high-yen slumps of 
the past, even if the manufacturing sector was doing poorly, the 
nonmanufacturing sector was doing well; so, it was possible to 
point to the nonmanufacturing or service sector and say that the 
overall picture was such and such. Today, perhaps to a lesser 
degree, the nonmanufacturing sector, too, is behaving generally 
the same way as is the manufacturing sector; my sense, 
therefore, is that the point you raised is not causing much of a 
problem to our grasping of the business trend. 
  In any event, looking back, I believe we have learned quite 
a 
bit from the development related to the so-called bubble 
economy, especially its impact on the financial sector, for 
example. 
  [KANKAI] You have not reached the point where you feel you 
should reexamine, for example, the specific items covered by the 
DI (diffusion index), or have you? 
  [Toshida] Of course that is one of the things we will have 
to 
do, but my feeling is that it might be better to wait until 
business conditions improve a little more and everyone is in a 
calmer frame of mind before we take such steps. But we are 
continuing our basic studies: for instance, we have requested 
the Business Cycle Base Dates Determination Committee, which has 
been practially decommissioning itself after each time it 
completed the job of determing the peak and trough of a business 
cycle in the past, to make itself a standing group because we 
would like groups such as this to serve as the forums for 
continuous debate. It is always too late to fuss over the 
indicators' being good or bad when business conditions have 
already become dubious; it is like trying to figure out how to 
make a rope after.... This is why even members of this committee 
themselves are saying, "Surely it is a question worth asking: 
Wouldn't it be a good idea for us to meet regularly to keep an 
eye on business trends and to discuss the modality of economic 
indicators while the situation is still relatively stable?" 
  [KANKAI] Just the other day--I believe it was in 
November--for the stated purpose of listening to the voices of 
outsiders, a businessmen/economists forum was set up as your 
personal advisory body. Trying to figure out where exactly an 
organ of this nature fits in, I am wondering whether listening 
more closely to outside voices is your only reason for having it 
or if you have something else in mind. 
  [Toshida] In the private sector, the so-called think tanks 
have achieved a great deal of progress and growth; there are 
quite a few of them around, all working very hard and publishing 
the results of all kinds of analyses they conduct. Looking 
back, in the old days--some 20-30 years ago--the EPA's Research 
Bureau, acting to some degree as if it had a monopoly of the 
market for economic research, used to handle that kind of work. 
  Now, however, the bureau has many competitive counterparts 
sprung up in the private sector. So, a thought has occurred to 
us which, if I may explain at the risk of being misconstrued, 
goes like this: Would it not make sense if we tried to let these 
outside gurus teach us some of their ideas? After all it used 
to be.... We were the ones who provided all the ideas, so there 
is no reason why we shouldn't be on the receiving end for a 
change. Basically, we want them to teach us some fresh ideas 
that have escaped us and therefore will be a pleasant surprise 
to us. I believe it is a good idea if possible to let people 
with different views debate various issues which we present to 
them. 
  In this sense, what I have in mind is not the normal 
deliberative council process, in which the council's view is 
"solicited" on an idea or proposal formulated and presented by 
the secretariat. Rather, I want to see the forum's participants 
truly face one another with different opinions so that we can 
listen to their debate and enjoy instructional benefits from it. 
This is my aim. Take forecasting, for example: as you know, 
some see the outlook bullish, others bearish. What is the 
difference in their standpoints that lead them to come up with 
different forecasts? I intend to ask the forum to take up this 
question. Not just the question of forecasting but other 
questions as well, such as the question of how to come to grips 
with the problem of bad assets, because I believe there are 
different ways of looking at these questions. I think it would 
be nice if the forum taught us not just different options, but 
also the different arguments behind them. 
<H5>  Recovery of the U.S. Economy--Premature? </H5>
  [KANKAI] Because we touched on the global economy earlier, 
let me ask you how you see the current state of the U.S. 
economy. Also, in view of the extraordinary amount of attention 
the United States is paying to Asia of late, which was evident 
at the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] meetings, I 
would like to hear your views on Asian economies. 
  [Toshida] The aspects of the globlal economy which we have 
to 
keep an eye on are widening more and more, creating a 
non-too-easy task for us. It used to be that we considered the 
global economy as something we looked at as a prelude to our 
consideration of the future direction of Japan's economy; now, 
however, when it comes to subject matters such as the APEC which 
you've just mentioned, inevitably it raises the question of 
strategy as to how--to what direction--Japan intends to lead the 
global economy, and it is we at the EPA's Research Bureau who 
must provide necessary background information for the 
formulation of such a strategy. We are proceeding with this 
awareness. 
  As for the U.S. economy, I think the consensus now is that 
it 
is moving, albeit slowly, from a smooth recovery to an 
expansionary phase. Even so, there is a question about whether 
the structural problem of the U.S. economy has been truly 
resolved or not, and opinions are divided on this point between 
the fairly optimistic and the fairly pessimistic. I personally 
believe that the popular view of the U.S. economy used to be 
overly pessimistic but has now turned a little too optimisitic. 
  U.S. enterprises have intrinsic strengths. This time around, 
too, they have regained their profitability by going ahead with 
restructuring; yet, when it comes to the U.s. economy as a 
whole, one has to wonder whether the problems inherent in it 
have really changed by any significant degree. The U.S. 
Government, meanwhile, seems to have realized that there may 
well be a limit to domestic procreation of its economic growth 
potential. So it came up with the idea of boosting its economic 
growth potential by "latching onto"--perhaps this is a poor 
choice of word--Asia that has an extraordinary possibility for 
development. This, I believe, is the reason why the Clinton 
administration has begun taking great interest in the APEC. 
  As can be surmised from what I've just said, truly Asia's 
growth and development potentials are by far a cut above those 
of others within today's global economy. It is all the more so 
because China has entered into the picture. Of particular note 
is that the Asian economy as a whole is beginning to move along 
very well. Moreover, this favorable development is likely to 
continue because there are various positive factors helping the 
Asian economy. The development process of an economy is like 
the process of a business cycle: once it starts to move 
smoothly, or to put it another way, once it enters into a 
favorable cycle, it tends to stay on that track. This, I am 
inclined to think, is what can be expected to happen in Asia as 
a whole. For starters, the United States is keenly interested 
in Asia; the strong yen, among other things, is driving Japan 
into placing increasing emphasis on investment and production 
overseas; and then there are big countries such as China and 
Vietnam that are poised to move toward market-oriented 
economies. Given all these factors, the smooth development of 
Asia as a whole is likely to continue. 
  What should Japan make of this Asian outlook and how should 
Japan deal with it as a matter of foreign policy? These, I 
should think, are questions of extreme importance. Because of 
the involvement in the picture of such major powers as the 
United States and China, these questions are, in some sense, 
difficult ones to answer; in another sense, however, I think 
they present significant themes worth tackling for us. 
  [KANKAI] What is your view on the EC or the European 
economy? 
They say the economic picture in the United Kingdom has 
improved somewhat. 
  [Toshida] The assessment that the EC's economy is at its 
trough this year but will begin to improve next year [1994] is 
probably on the mark. Because, for one thing, the German 
economy seems to be moving toward a gradual improvement. 
Nevertheless, that the much touted union will greatly 
invigorate the EC's economy as a whole is a prospect not so 
easily attainable. How to overcome the different interests and 
idiosyncrasies of its member nations poses a very difficult 
problem. Even in Japan, there are regional differentials which 
we have been trying to eliminate for the past 20-30 years 
without much success. So, it only follows that there be some 
doubt about whether things will go smoothly when individual EC 
countries remove their fences to become integrated. Naturally 
some countries would want to maintain their traditional high 
standards. The question is, would things work out all right 
when these countries are put together with others that are 
trying to catch up with the former's high standards? I believe 
this is the crux of the matter. 
  [KANKAI] Now, if you have anything else to add, please go 
ahead. 
  [Toshida] In closing, if I may be allowed to indulge in some 
self-advertisement, we at the EPA have a rather difficult task 
of trying to get Japan's economy back on a smooth growth track 
and we are working very hard on it. But, as you know, we are 
often subjected to such criticisms as "the government's 
perceptions are wishful" or "the government's way of looking at 
things lags behind reality." But perhaps these criticisms are 
in some sense not as substantive as they may sound if you 
consider the fact that it is the private sector that is pulling 
Japan's economy by means of market mechanisms. When it comes to 
the question of medium- and long-term economic directions I 
believe the government and the policymaking authorities must 
bear a heavy responsibility for them, but it is a little 
different story when it comes to the economic activity occurring 
right now. Recently, some people praised us for having closed 
the gaps between us and the private sector with respect to 
certain projections; no sooner were we praised than the stock 
prices fell; then there were people who scolded us for saying 
that business conditions were not likely to recover 
readily...(laughter). 
  In this sense, now is truly the time for business managers 
of 
the private sector to demonstrate their capability. We at the 
EPA have learned a lot during the currrent recessionary phase; 
in the process, we have been able to improve many aspects of our 
work in comparison with the way they were handled in the past. 
I know this will sound funny, but let's take the narrative 
style of our monthly economic reports, for example: There were 
periods in our past history when the readers of our reports 
could not be sure, because of the way the reports were worded, 
whether the business conditions of the period were bad or what. 
  During the current recession, however, the monthly reports 
we 
have been putting out are so worded that future historians 
reading them would immediately know that the economy was in a 
slump in this period. In the process of preparing these 
reports, we have, as I briefly touched on earlier, been creating 
opportunities for us to listen to the views of those in the 
private sector. Also, recently we initiated a minithesis series 
entitled Research and Analysis Viewpoints, the 
purpose of which is to enhance the timeliness of our research 
products. When business conditions are fluctuating as much as 
they are now, if research takes too much time, people's 
perception of the problem itself may have changed by the time 
the research results are produced. This is part of the reason 
that we are putting out minitheses without waiting for the 
annual white paper time. I think it is fortunate that because 
of the recession we have made progress in certain aspects of our 
work; likewise, I believe those of the private sector, too, can 
make progress on account of the recession. What I mean by this 
is that they can go forth with forward-looking restructuring 
measures, which is what I hope they would do. This is my 
thought toward the coming new year [1994].

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that in order to give answers to 
the inquiry by members of the Great State Hural delegating the 
National Democratic and Social-Democratic Parties in reference 
to the prime minister concerning the ensuring of the activities 
of the centralized power system there has been taken place a 
meeting of the Standing Parliamentary Committee on Development 
of Economics and Politics in the Sphere of Infrastructure. At 
the meeting took the floor the Minister of Power, Geology and 
Mining Industry B. Jigjid. He noted in his speech that the main 
cause of difficulties arising in the activities of the power 
system lies in the shortage of spare parts, indebtedness not 
having been paid off by consumers, slackening discipline and 
responsibility of those working in this system. The 
subcommittee has admitted to be advisable to closely consider 
the situation arisen and in case of necessity submit appropriate 
issues for consideration by the Great State Hural. It is 
thought to be expedient if the Great State Hural would hear the 
information of the government on measures for implementation of 
the objectives provided for by the government programme in the 
sphere of power according to the newspaper, the General Tax 
Board has carried out inspection of the activities of about 400 
offices of trade and services of the capital. The inspection 
has shown that the accounting is in bad state in those 
organizations, the tariffs and duties on the imported alcoholic 
drinks and tobacco were not paid properly in time. Proceeding 
from the results of the inspection the General Tax Board and the 
General Customs Department have issued a joint order on 
compulsory registration by economic units and individuals of 
alcohol and tobacco being imported from abroad and on 
presentation of corresponding documentation corroborating the 
payment of tariffs and duties. Those who would violate the 
procedure prescribed are to be taken proper measures of 
punishment. 
  The newspaper informs that at the central square of the 
Mongolian capital still goes on being taken a political hunger 
strike of the representatives of the Mongolian Democratic 
Association and the union of students demanding resignation of 
the government. At the same time at the Erh Choloonii Square 
there is being held a counter-hunger strike of those supporting 
the government. According to the newspaper, letters by people 
are being received at the government. The newspaper informs that 
some 96 percent of those who sent letters were expressing their 
support of the government. 
  The newspaper also carries an interview of its correspondent 
with the Ambassador of Switzerland to Mongolia E. Shurtenberg. 
The ambassador noted that prior up to recently the Swiss 
salesmen used to buy in Mongolia the animal raw materials. This 
year, the ambassador said, thirty years have passed since the 
establishing of diplomatic relations between Switzerland and 
Mongolia. Swiss firms and companies are displaying great 
interest in cooperation with organizations of the country and 
first steps have already been taken in this reference. 
  The newspaper "MONGOLYN ZALUUCHUUD" [spelling as received] 
for the youth notes that the head of the administration of the 
Dzabhan Aymag basing upon the proposals of the aymag's Union of 
Youth has included to the programme of its action for the 
current year a wide range of issues relating to work with the 
youth including arranging training in economics of young 
businessmen, organization of working rallies and meetings. The 
Savhanmandal Somon is the first in the country to announce the 
year 1994 to be the year of youth care. 
  The newspaper reports that the union of Mongolian youth, 
creative unions of artists have announced on holding during 
25-28 April the Festival of Dances. Writing in this respect in 
the newspaper, leader of the movement for dancing art B. 
Altantsetseg noted that the movement sets itself the goal of 
promoting the development of dance art among the Mongolian 
youth. One of the steps to be carried out for this purpose, she 
noted, are the festivals of dance art being carried out since 
the middle 1980s. 
  The newspaper also provides an interview of the head of the 
Press Office of the Ministry of External Relations T. 
Chuluundorj. Apart from characterizing the purposes of his 
office he noted that there are foreign correspondents 
representing the world's biggest news agencies as the XINHUA, 
Reuter, Kiodotsusin [KYODO News Agency], ITA and France Press 
working in the country on a permanent base. According to him, 
so far it is not possible to regard Mongolia as being connected 
up to the world information network.

<F P=106> ["Unreasonable Demand Cannot Be Met" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
brands the demand of the United States and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for the DPRK's full compliance with 
the safeguards agreement, which was contained in a "presidential 
statement" of the U.N. Security Council, as unjustifiable and 
unreasonable. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Their demand ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced 
withdrawal from the Non-proliferation Treaty shows they are 
trying to deny the unique status of the DPRK and use the 
safeguards agreement as an experient for the sinister political 
purpose of stifling it. 
  We cannot fully comply with the safeguards agreement, even 
if 
we try before the United States and the IAEA prove in practice 
that they are not going to stifle the DPRK. 
  So long as the United States refuses to stop the anti-DPRK 
campaign and its nuclear threat and the IAEA Secretariat fails 
to renounce its partiality, we cannot allow inspection 
activities tantamount to routine and ad hoc inspections. 
  It is self-evident that if we allow such inspection 
activities while the IAEA is escalating its partiality, 
dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat will join-more 
zealously in the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK, groundlessly 
charging us with the possession of something which we do not 
have, and reversing black and white. 
  When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our 
unique status, the nuclear issue will be settled smoothly. 
  How long our unique status lasts depends on the behavior of 
the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  Pressure cannot be a solution to the problem. 
  It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear issue 
peacefully through dialogue and negotiation. 
  It is entirely up to the United States and the IAEA 
Secretariat how the situation will develop.

  [Text] According to Seoul KBS-1 Radio, on 21 April the 
U.S. imperialists finally began to deploy new-model Patriot 
missiles to the central region of the front line in South Korea, 
despite strong protest and denunciation by the Korean people and 
by a broad range of world public opinion. This is an open 
challenge to us and is aimed at threatening us militarily and 
carrying out a preemptive strike against the Northern half of 
the Republic. 
  The beginning of the U.S. deployment of new-model Patriot 
missiles to the central region of the front line while talking 
about a nonexisting offensive threat by someone else is a 
deliberate, dangerous military act [uidojogin wihomhan kunsa 
haengdong] to make the situation on the Korean peninsula more 
unstable [touk puranjonghage hago], and further, to prompt 
[yubal] a new war. 
  The deployment of new-model Patriot missiles in broad 
daylight plainly shows that the U.S. authorities can cast any 
international agreement away like dirt to achieve their goal of 
aggression, taking no regard of the Armistice Agreement or the 
armistice organization. 
  The U.S. imperialists should discreetly act, being well 
aware 
what grave consequence will result from the deployment of 
new-model Patriot missiles, which pose a great threat to the 
peace and security of Korean peninsula and the Far East.

  [Text] The United States and North Korea have resumed a 
full-scale contact and have begun to iron out their differences 
of opinion. 
  In a response to a message sent by Kang Sok-chu, North 
Korean 
vice foreign minister and chief of North Korean delegates to 
U.S.-North Korean talks on 19 April, it was learned in the 
United States that U.S. delegation head Galluci delivered a 
reply to the North side last week. 
  The two sides exchanged basic proposals regarding the mutual 
practice of additional inspections and high-level U.S.-North 
Korean talks. It was learned that the two sides will begin 
full-scale working negotiations to reach an agreement on these 
items within this week. 
  A well-informed source on the nuclear issue said that North 
Korea withdrew its previous stance stating it has kept all the 
agreements reached with the United States by disclosing that it 
was compelled to break the agreement last month because of a 
precondition that the special envoys of the North and South 
should be exchanged. The source said that this hints at a 
positive change in the North Korean stance. 
  It was also learned that the United States, through 
Gallucci's reply, informed the DPRK of its stance over the 
suspension of Team Spirit and high-level U.S.-North Korean talks.

  [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japanese Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii tried again Sunday to convince his U.S. 
counterpart about Japan's measures to lift the economy. 
  Fujii said he told U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
that 
the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package adopted in 
February is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually 
showing brightness." He was speaking to reporters after 
emerging from a 30-minute talk with Bentsen at the Treasury 
Department ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central 
bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in 
the afternoon. 
  Fujii said he also explained that a policy accord newly 
reached by the coalition parties endorsed the direction for 
"comprehensive" tax reform to be decided in June and enacted by 
the end of the year. 
  He did not say whether he told Bentsen about the scale and 
other details in continuing the 5.47 trillion yen cut in income 
and residential taxes included in the February package for only 
fiscal 1994 that started April 1. 
  Bentsen was unavailable for comment on the talks. But he 
previously said the single-year tax plan is not enough for Japan 
to boost domestic demand and reduce trade surplus, and has 
called on Japan to take further fiscal measures. 
  Fujii said he heard no particular requests from Bentsen on 
the matter during the talks. 
  While citing improvements in the economy, Fujii said he also 
told Bentsen that Japanese economy is "not as weak as" the 
projections released last week by the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF). 
  The IMF said in its twice-yearly world economic outlook that 
Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic product 
(GDP) is expected at 0.7 percent in 1994. 
  The Japanese Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth 
for fiscal 1994. 
  Fujii declined to comment on currency exchange rates, saying 
the two financial leaders agreed not to make any public comment. 
When pressed later by reporters whether exchange rates were 
raised at the meeting, a Japanese official said only Fujii made 
an overall presentation of the Japanese economy "from various 
points." 
  Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most 
of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the 
current condition of the Japanese economy. 
  They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be 
formed under Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will continue to keep 
policy unchanged toward deregulating the Japanese economy and 
carrying out economic reform. 
  Regarding the stalled trade talks with the United States, 
Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of 
Japan-U.S. relations in suggesting Japan's desire to resume the 
so-called "framework" talks as soon as possible. 
  Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started 
to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank 
in yen terms last year, the officials said. 
  Japanese officials said Fujii also pledged Japan's 
cooperation with the U.S. in extending aid to Russia.

  [Text] Kuala lumpur, April 25 KYODO -- Malaysian 
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said 
Monday [25 April] she sees no changes in her country's ties with 
Japan under new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, whom she described 
as "well apprised" of global trade matters. 
  "We've established very good relations with Japan. If there 
are any changes, it should be for the better," she said. 
  Hata, foreign minister under Morihiro Hosokawa, was elected 
Monday by the Diet to succeed Hosokawa, who announced April 8 he 
was quitting over his personal financial dealings. 
  Rafidah said she has met Hata several times, most recently 
at 
this month's signing of the Uruguay Round world trade pact in 
Marrakech, Morocco, where "I remember teasing him about being 
the next prime minister." 
  She said she felt Hata is fully aware of the ramifications 
of 
the Uruguay Round's policies to Free World trade and all other 
elements of international trading matters. 
  Asked if she hopes Hata will back the idea of an East Asia 
Economic Caucus (EAEC), proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed, Rafidah said he should not be "burdened" with 
the issue so soon in his term of office. 
  But she expressed confidence the EAEC will be seen 
"favorably" in Japan if it is recognized as a loose, 
consultative forum to enhance regional economic cooperation. 
  The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), which includes Malaysia, is anxious to get Japan, as 
East Asia's economic powerhouse, into the EAEC. 
  But Japan and such other potential members as South Korea 
are 
noncommittal in the face of a cool response from the United 
States, which would be excluded and which views the EAEC as a 
trade bloc.

  [Text] A further reflection of the going cooperation 
between and among countries of ASEAN was seen in Kuala Lumpur 
two days ago, where Malaysia and Thailand signed an agreement to 
jointly explore and exploit oil and gas resources in the Gulf of 
Thailand. The signing has paved the way for the launching of 
the oil exploration in the more than 7,000 square kilometer area 
known as the Joint Development Area, JDA. It took 14 years of 
talks and negotiations. But the fact that they have led to a 
successful conclusion is a positive sign of the majority of the 
leaderships of the two countries and their senior officials who 
have been engaged in the talks. 
  Studies made in the JDA have shown that it can be a source 
as 
well as a reservoir of oil and gas. Several oil discoveries 
have already been made in the area. The joint exploration will 
no doubt lead to more discoveries that will be of benefit to 
both countries. Four agreements have been signed, including two 
for production sharing and the other two for joint operations. 
It may be remembered that both Malaysia and Thailand had 
previously laid claims to the area in question. So the presence 
of the prime ministers of the two countries, Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed and Mr. Chuan Likphai, at the signing ceremony gave 
added significance to the new venture that the two ASEAN nations 
have jointly agreed to embark upon. 
  Dr. Mahathir has described the approach to the agreements as 
a model for the settlement of overlapping claims. With the 
signing of the agreements, both countries can look towards 
broadening cooperation in many other fields that will bring 
benefit to the people as well as contribute towards a peaceful, 
prosperous, and stable Southeast Asia. 
  On his part, Mr. Chuan has expressed confidence that the 
agreements will boost the close cooperation between the two 
countries. The agreements, in his words, are a testimony to a 
long and fruitful relationship between his country and Malaysia. 
  The body that is chiefly responsible for bringing about the 
joint exploration deals is the Malaysia-Thailand Joint 
Authority, MTJA. It ought to be congratulated for its award of 
contracts to three big companies -- one from Malaysia and the 
other two from Thailand -- to carry out the operations. The 
MTJA emerged from the foresight of past leaders, namely, the 
late premier of Malaysia, Tun Hussein Onn and his then Thai 
counterpart, General Kriangsak Chamanan. Their intention to 
resolve the problem of overlapping claims in the Gulf of 
Thailand came out with a novel idea of establishing a joint 
authority. 
  To the MTJA, there is great scope for the two countries to 
develop and intensify their economic cooperation. The joint 
exploration for oil and gas is a unique venture. The MTJA and 
the three contracting parties have a big task ahead to bring 
about fruitful results for the benefit of both Malaysia and 
Thailand.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 23 -- The Vietnam oil and gas 
corporation (Petrovietnam) strongly protests the American oil 
company Crestone in a contract with China for conducting surveys 
for oil drilling in Vietnam's special economic zone and 
continental shelf, says a statement released today by 
Petrovietnam. 
  Crestone signed the so called 'Wan En 21 Contract' with 
China 
in May 1992 to explore oil and gas. The area is in fact the Tu 
Chinh shoal well within the special economic zone and 
continental shelf of Vietnam, the statement says. The signing 
of the said contract is a serious encroachment of the Vietnamese 
territorial sovereignty, causing worries for organizations and 
individuals doing oil and gas business in the region and the 
world, the statement remarks. 
  It recalled that a spokesperson for Vietnam's Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday vehemently protested the April 18, 1994 
announcement by Crestone on its current seismic surveys and 
preparations for test drilling in the so called 'Wan En 21'. 
  The statement concludes by demanding Crestone put an end 
without condition to all its activities on oil and gas in the Tu 
Chinh area of Vietnam.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Mr. Zlenko, talked to a 
press conference in Hanoi on Wednesday that his country could 
learn from Vietnam's economic experience. Here is Mr. Zlenko at 
the presss conference: 
  [Begin Zlenko recording in Russian fading into Vietnamese 
translation] This is the first visit to Vietnam by a Ukrainian 
foreign minister since the Republic separated from the former 
USSR. In its foreign policy, Ukraine attached great importance 
to relations with countries in Asia and the Pacific, in which 
Vietnam plays an important role. Ukraine has been confronted 
with numerous difficulties in its economic reform when shifting 
to a market economy. Production has declined, information 
increased, and people's life degraded. In this situation, 
Ukraine needs to find new trade partners, especially restoring 
relations with traditional clients such as Vietnam. 
  According to economics, Asia-Pacific has been a dynamic and 
promising region of the 20th century. Ukraine admires the 
achievements of the Vietnamese people in economic reform while 
maintaining political stability. It is good for Ukraine to 
learn from the experience of Vietnam and other countries in the 
region. 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister said: He had talks with his 
Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam and met with Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides agreed to continue their 
friendship and bilateral comprehensive cooperation in which 
Ukraine can develop its potentials in engineering, oil, and gas 
exploitation, food processing, and construction. 
  The two sides also agreed to continue the process for 
signing 
agrements on encouragement and protection of investments, and 
avoidance of double taxation which will serve as a legal 
foundation for new bilateral relations to bear fruits. 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister also said Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet would visit Ukraine in June this year and believed the 
visit would be an important step for further development of 
bilateral relations. 
  Speaking with newsmen on the situation in Bosnia, the 
Ukrainian diplomat said: Ukraine wanted to solve the conflict 
through peaceful negotiations. Ukraine was gravely concerned 
about what had happened there would not only cause much losses 
and sorrow for local people but also threaten to drag other 
Balkan states into the conflict. 
  Ukraine hopes efforts by the world community, including 
Russia, would soon peacefully solve the crisis. [end recording]
